Readers Divided on News Siteâ€™s Map of Gun Permit Holders,https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/02/readers-divided-on-news-sites-map-of-gun-permit-holders/,"When a newspaper in Westchester County NY published a map online last month showing the names
                                        and addresses of local pistol permit holders a flood of nationwide criticism and a counterflood of support ensued Many gun owners objected to the information being published though it is publicly available
                                        and now officials in Putnam County NY are refusing to release pistolpermit records to the
                                        paper The Journal News A post here on City Room about the controversy drew its own outpouring of more than 1000 comments
                                        with our readers close to evenly split between the pro and con camps We did not do a full tally but we looked at the first 100 and the most recent 100 comments that were easily classifiable and found that 52

Sex Ed for Both Sexes,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/03/opinion/sex-ed-for-both-sexes.html,To the Editor I was pleasantly surprised to see Republicans Must Support Public Financing for Contraception OpEd nytimescom Dec 28 and read with avid interest until Juleanna Glover gave herself away with this comment Encouraging abstinence among young women is positive and necessary but not enough So Im curious what shall we encourage among our young men Sow your wild oats where ye may Honest and accurate sex education which includes educating our young people about responsible sexual behavior is essential for both men and women Comments made during the 2012 election make it clear that many of our more conservative politicians are blatantly unfamiliar and uncomfortable with basic female biology But that they fail to grasp the most basic fact of life that pregnancy is not a spontaneous solo creation truly mystifies me But thats probably just my womb wandering again CARLY BISEK Zurich Dec 28 2012
"Taking Calls on Abortion, and Risks, in Chile",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/04/world/americas/in-chile-abortion-hot-line-is-in-legal-gray-area.html,SANTIAGO Chile  Every time the phone rings Angela Erpel feels her nerves swell Sometimes it is a scared teenager on the other end or a desperate mother of three There are the angry ones too with callers playing the sounds of crying babies or sending text messages with pictures of aborted fetuses  Then Ms Erpel 38 a sociologist who volunteers at Chiles Safe Abortion Hot Line gathers herself and settles into a familiar dialogue on the use of misoprostol a drug that will induce a medical abortion  We dont give them a moral guide or advice we only provide information she said  Since the hot line began in 2009 volunteers spread across this long thin country have taken turns answering tense calls from women seeking information about abortion every evening from 7 pm to 11 pm There have been more than 12000 calls so far and they continue rolling in at a steady clip  In a country where abortion is entirely illegal even in cases of rape or when a womans life is in danger the hot line is a risky endeavor Operating in a legal gray area volunteers face a daunting prison sentence if a conversation veers too far from a lawyerapproved script The hot line already has had three lawsuits brought against it though all were eventually dropped According to the law having an abortion carries a penalty of 5 to 10 years in prison depending on the circumstances while doctors and others who perform an abortion or assist with one could face up to 15 years prosecutors say In practice however fewer than 500 cases have been prosecuted over the last several years  I think there is a certain sensitivity to the social conditions behind these abortions such as poverty or rape or teenage pregnancy explained Paula Vial a lawyer and former public defender in Santiago  Beyond the legal consequences the 30 hot line volunteers are keenly aware of the social ramifications of taking an active role in such a polarizing issue They wear masks when promoting the hot line at public gatherings and are often vague about the details of their volunteer work in their daily lives Many fear losing their jobs or driving a wedge into personal and family relationships Indeed Ms Erpel was the only volunteer willing to go on the record about her work with the hot line and even she is usually circumspect about it  Its complicated she explained Im open about being in an organization but not necessarily that I work directly with abortion Abortion was not always a clandestine affair in Chile The current law that strictly bans it was one of the final acts of the dictatorship In 1989 shortly before relinquishing power Gen Augusto Pinochet ended a tradition of legal abortion dating to 1931 in which a pregnancy that threatened a womans life or a fetus that was not viable outside the womb could be terminated Chiles law now is one of the strictest in the world By contrast Uruguay legalized abortions in the first trimester for any reason last October joining Guyana and Cuba as Latin American countries with broadly legalized procedures Abortion is also legal in Mexico City But Chile has remained a socially conservative country after 20 years of economic growth and the election in 2006 of a woman as president The hierarchy of the Catholic Church has had a very strong influence in public policy said Claudia Dides a spokeswoman for the Movement for the Legal Interruption of Pregnancy In a pivotal case in 2008 Karen Espndola then 22 learned in her 12th week of pregnancy that her fetus had holoprosencephaly Fetuses with the condition have a singlelobed brain and most die before they are born It is a common reason for terminating a pregnancy Ms Espndola sought an abortion appealing to the president and setting off a national conversation over abortion In February 2009 Ms Espndola gave birth to Osvaldo who died in 2011  In reality he was never conscious he was alive she lamented He fought to breathe he was fed through a tube We all suffered a lot Nobody here is a winner Chile has witnessed a swell of liberal social movements in recent years with gay men and lesbians pressing for the countrys first hatecrime legislation environmentalists stalling dambuilding projects in Patagonia and students pushing for an overhaul of the education system  Advocates contend that abortion rights sentiment bubbles near the surface as well but the government has pushed back After criticizing the abortion hot line in the news media the Ministry of Women started a hot line of its own It is attended by psychologists and social workers who answer calls from men or women looking for information or support when facing what the ministry calls an abortion situation or postabortion syndrome Maternity one of the most satisfactory experiences in the life of a woman can go through difficult and desperate moments Minister Carolina Schmidt said at the time the government hot line began Other influential antiabortion organizations offer to guide women considering abortion away from the procedure  If you help that person define what is troubling them and making them think of an abortion and together you find a solution in the end the person decides for life and her child said Victoria Reyes director of assistance for Foundation Chile United We are convinced the second victim of abortion is the woman the woman who has an abortion carries that guilt The government reported several hundred adoptions in 2011 but it estimates 120000 abortions in a country with a population of about six million women from 15 to 64 years old  Misoprostol sold under the brand name Misotrol in Chile has changed the way many of those abortions are performed The drug was originally developed as an ulcer medication and its warning label advised that in excess misoprostol would cause a woman to miscarry Before long women in countries with little or no access to safe abortions were using the drug to do that very thing  Misoprostol is a revolution for women said Rebecca Gomperts founder of the Dutch organization Women on Waves Even where abortion is illegal and women dont have a doctor or they are poor they still have a way to do a safe abortion The abortion hot line is Ms Gompertss creation A medical doctor and former Greenpeace activist she realized in 1999 that it was possible for a ship sailing under a Dutch flag to take women from countries where abortion is illegal to international waters to administer misoprostol Before departing Chile Women on Waves helped set up the abortion hot line training volunteers how to discuss misoprostol according to World Health Organization guidelines There are now five abortion hot lines in South America in Argentina Chile Ecuador Peru and Venezuela  Misoprostol was taken off pharmacy shelves in Chile under Michelle Bachelet the former president who now runs the United Nations agency for womens advancement so access to the drug is almost entirely a black market transaction  Dozens of Web sites offer misoprostol at exorbitant prices and sometimes of dubious quality  One 29yearold lawyer who became pregnant a few months ago said she paid 300 for the necessary 12 pills  To meet someone in a clandestine place hoping they arent a police officer wondering if they are even giving you the right pills knowing that you could go to prison when all you want to do is exercise your right as a woman is horrifying the lawyer said on the condition of anonymity to avoid prosecution  To its volunteers the Safe Abortion Hot Line stands as a simple equation  30 women and a single cellphone that gets passed among them This month they expanded they released an abortion manual on using misoprostol  Occasionally women call back the hot line after a successful abortion but more often the volunteers never know the outcome Thats always the hardest part Ms Erpel said 
Pregnancy Centers Gain Influence in Anti-Abortion Arena,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/health/pregnancy-centers-gain-influence-in-anti-abortion-fight.html,WACO Tex  With free pregnancy tests and ultrasounds along with diapers parenting classes and even temporary housing pregnancy centers are playing an increasingly influential role in the antiabortion movement While most attention has focused on scores of new state laws restricting abortion the centers have been growing in numbers and gaining state financing and support Largely run by conservative Christians the centers say they offer what Roland Warren head of Care Net one of the largest pregnancy center organizations described as a compassionate approach to this issue  As they expand they are adding oncall or onsite medical personnel and employing sophisticated strategies to attract women including Internet search optimization and mobile units near Planned Parenthood clinics Theyre really the darlings of the prolife movement said Jeanneane Maxon vice president for external affairs at Americans United for Life an antiabortion group That ground level oneonone reachingthewomanwhereshesat approach Pregnancy centers while not new now number about 2500 compared with about 1800 abortion providers Ms Maxon estimated that the centers see about a million clients annually with another million attending abstinence and other programs Abortion rights advocates have long called some of their approaches deceptive or manipulative Medical and other experts say some dispense scientifically flawed information exaggerating abortions risks Jean Schroedel a Claremont Graduate University politics professor said that there are some positive aspects to centers but that things pregnant women are told at many of these centers some of it is really factually suspect The centers defend their practices and information Women who come in are constantly telling us Abortion seems to be my only alternative and I think thats the best thing to doÂ  said Peggy Hartshorn president of Heartbeat International which she described as a Christcentered organization with 1100 affiliates Centers provide women with the whole choice One pregnant woman Nasya Dotie 21 single worried about finishing college and disappointing her parents said she was almost positive I was going to have an abortion A friend at her Christian university suggested visiting Care Net of Central Texas She met with a counselor went home and considered her options She returned for an ultrasound and though planning not to look at the screen when a clinician offered she agreed Then I was like Thats my baby I cant not have himÂ  Thirteen states now provide some direct financing 27 offer Choose Life license plates the proceeds from which aid centers In 2011 Texas increased financing for the centers while cutting family planning money by twothirds and required abortion clinics to provide names of centers at least 24 hours before performing abortions In South Dakota a 2011 law being challenged by Planned Parenthood requires pregnancy center visits before abortions Cities like Austin Baltimore and New York have tried regulating centers with ordinances requiring them to post signs stating that they do not provide abortions or contraceptives and disclosing whether medical professionals are onsite Except for San Franciscos the laws were blocked by courts or softened after centers sued claiming free speech violations Similar bills in five states floundered Most legal challenges to Choose Life license plates failed although a North Carolina court said alternate views must be offered Some observers say harsh antiabortion statements from the 2012 elections may also benefit pregnancy centers Do you want some individual politician talking about rape or some woman who says I care about you Dr Schroedel said Conservatives like Rick Santorum during his presidential campaign and the Texas governor Rick Perry have praised pregnancy centers Some centers use controversial materials stating that abortion may increase the risk of breast cancer A brochure issued by Care Nets national organization for example says A number of reliable studies have concluded that there is an association between abortion and later development of breast cancer  Dr Otis Brawley the American Cancer Societys chief medical officer who calls himself a prolife Catholic said studies showing abortionbreast cancer links are very weak while strong studies find no correlation Other claims include longterm psychological effects The Care Net brochure says that many women experience initial relief but that women should be informed that abortion significantly increases risk for clinical depression suicidal thoughts and behavior posttraumatic stress disorder and other problems An American Psychological Association report found no increased risk from one abortion With largely volunteer staffs and donations from mostly Christian sources centers usually offer free tests and ultrasounds services that clinics like Planned Parenthood charge for They offer advice about babyrearing or adoption ask if women are being pressured to abort and give technical descriptions of abortion and fetal development Many offer prayer and Bible study Mr Warren who described Care Net as a Christian faithbased organization with 1100 affiliates likened the centers new strategies to his experience working at Pepsi The end result was to put liquid into someones stomach we talked about it as share of stomachÂ  he said The work that centers are doing it really is a lot around share of mindÂ  Internet search optimization services are hired to float centers names up when people search for abortion Some no longer call themselves crisis pregnancy centers believing crisis makes women feel victimized Many locate near abortion clinics Watch CVS where do they go They go where Walgreens is said Bridget Van Means president of Thrive St Louis which parks a van across from Planned Parenthood Tova Tenenbaum 24 entered Thrives van for pregnancy and sexually transmitted disease tests thinking it was Planned Parenthood until a form asked what my relationship was with Jesus she said She stayed for test results negative and to be polite but I had the feeling Id been duped she said adding that a counselor promoted abstinence with misinformation like condoms have holes in them Thrive and other centers say they provide accurate information Wacos Care Net posts signs listing phone numbers but no name across from Planned Parenthood Pregnant Considering abortion Free services And Change your mind Get your ultrasound  back Texas requires abortion providers to give ultrasounds at least 24 hours before abortions Another strategy said Waco Care Nets chief executive Deborah McGregor is keeping distance from brasher antiabortion groups like ProLife Waco whose van outside Planned Parenthood reads Abortion One heart stops Another heart breaks They put their signs up near ours across from Planned Parenthood and sometimes we take them down said Ms McGregor saying signs removed before a reporters visit reflected that regular cleanup We dont want to be seen as not affirming what these groups do But we dont want to offend anyone National pregnancy center organizations are trying to reach black and Hispanic women Heartbeat Internationals Urban Initiative Web page quotes John Piper a minister O that the murderous effect of abortion in the Black and Latino communities destroying tens of thousands at the hands of white abortionists would explode with the same reprehensible reputation as lynching Pregnancy centers are not womens health clinics Medical services at Wacos Care Net are pregnancy tests and ultrasounds given to 2500 women in 2011 That year Wacos Planned Parenthood performed 15575 Pap smears breast exams and other services and in a wing required to be separate 445 surgical and 414 medication abortions Ms McGregor said 94 percent of women receiving ultrasounds decide against abortion It goes from a baby to my baby she said If they are abortionminded or abortionvulnerable we automatically offer ultrasound Her centers checklists consider a woman abortionminded if she has an abortion scheduled regardless of how tentative she seems or asks questions like Â How much does an abortion costÂ  An abortionvulnerable woman by continuing her pregnancy faces obstacles that she may feel incapable of handling or unwilling to experience Women await pregnancy test results in a comfortable room which Wacos center painted bold eggplant turquoise and olive after surveying local college students about favorite colors Forms which say Care Net does not provide abortions include abortionrelated questions and religious checkoffs Christian Christian Catholic None Other Wicca Another question is Would you like our Christian counselor to pray for you today If clients say yes outcomes like profession of faith or not a believer are recorded To receive state money center must hold religious activities elsewhere All Waco clients receive nonreligious options counseling from volunteers staff or a licensed counselor who had an abortion  Planned Parenthoods building looks like the medical clinic it is It distributes information on prenatal care and adoption among other things but does not offer emotional counseling Were our patients medical provider said Katie Wolfe the health educator not their emotional support Amanda Hall met Care Nets definition of abortionvulnerable Twentyfive pregnant with her second child her husband in jail she was facing eviction Although uncomfortable about abortion she checked undecided saying I cant support two kids Care Net let her stay in a house Ms McGregor owns found her a job negotiated debt payment plans offered Bible study and other classes She gave birth in March Everybody here she said was like a different family
"After Years in Solitary, an Austere Life as Uruguayâ€™s President",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/world/americas/after-years-in-solitary-an-austere-life-as-uruguays-president.html,MONTEVIDEO Uruguay  Some world leaders live in palaces Some enjoy perks like having a discreet butler a fleet of yachts or a wine cellar with vintage Champagnes Then there is Jos Mujica the former guerrilla who is Uruguays president He lives in a rundown house on Montevideos outskirts with no servants at all His security detail two plainclothes officers parked on a dirt road  In a deliberate statement to this cattleexporting nation of 33 million people Mr Mujica 77 shunned the opulent Surez y Reyes presidential mansion with its staff of 42 remaining instead in the home where he and his wife have lived for years on a plot of land where they grow chrysanthemums for sale in local markets  Visitors reach Mr Mujicas austere dwelling after driving down OHiggins Road past groves of lemon trees His net worth upon taking office in 2010 amounted to about 1800  the value of the 1987 Volkswagen Beetle parked in his garage He never wears a tie and donates about 90 percent of his salary largely to a program for expanding housing for the poor  His current brand of lowkey radicalism  a marked shift from his days wielding weapons in an effort to overthrow the government  exemplifies Uruguays emergence as arguably Latin Americas most socially liberal country  Under Mr Mujica who took office in 2010 Uruguay has drawn attention for seeking to legalize marijuana and samesex marriage while also enacting one of the regions most sweeping abortion rights laws and sharply boosting the use of renewable energy sources like wind and biomass  As illness drives President Hugo Chvez of Venezuela from the political stage suddenly leaving the continent without the largerthanlife figure who has held such sway on the left Mr Mujicas practiced asceticism is a study in contrasts For democracy to function properly he argues elected leaders should be taken down a notch  We have done everything possible to make the presidency less venerated Mr Mujica said in an interview one recent morning after preparing a serving in his kitchen of mate the herbal drink offered in a hollowed calabash gourd and commonly shared in dozens of sips through the same metal straw  Passing around the gourd he acknowledged that his laidback presidential lifestyle might seem unusual Still he said it amounted to a conscious choice to forgo the trappings of power and wealth Quoting the Roman courtphilosopher Seneca Mr Mujica said It is not the man who has too little but the man who craves more who is poor THE leader at the helm of Uruguays changes known to his many detractors and supporters alike as Pepe is someone few thought could ever rise to such a position Before Mr Mujica became a gardener of chrysanthemums he was a leader of the Tupamaros the urban guerrilla group that drew inspiration from the Cuban revolution carrying out armed bank robberies and kidnappings on Montevideos streets  In their war against the Uruguayan state the Tupamaros gained notoriety through violence The filmmaker Constantin CostaGavras drew inspiration for his 1972 movie State of Siege from their abduction and execution in 1970 of Daniel Mitrione an American adviser to Uruguays security forces Mr Mujica has said that the group tried by all means to avoid killings but he has also euphemistically acknowledged its military deviations A brutal counterinsurgency subdued the Tupamaros and the police captured Mr Mujica in 1972 He spent 14 years in prison including more than a decade in solitary confinement often in a hole in the ground During that time he would go more than a year without bathing and his companions he said were a tiny frog and rats with whom he shared crumbs of bread  Some of the other Tupamaros who were placed for years in solitary confinement failed to grasp the benefits of befriending rodents One of them Henry Engler a medical student underwent a severe mental breakdown before his release in 1985  Mr Mujica rarely speaks about his time in prison Seated at a table in his garden sipping his mate he said it gave him time to reflect I learned that one can always start again he said  He chose to start again by entering politics Elected as a legislator he shocked the parking attendants at Parliament by arriving on a Vespa After the rise to power in 2004 of the Broad Front a coalition of leftist parties and more centrist social democrats he was named minister of Livestock Agriculture and Fisheries  Before Mr Mujica won the 2009 election by a wide margin his opponent Luis Alberto Lacalle disparaged his small house here as a cave After that Mr Mujica also upset some in Uruguays political establishment by selling off a presidential residence in a seaside resort city calling the property useless  His donations leave him with roughly 800 a month of his salary He said he and his wife Luca Topolansky a former guerrilla who was also imprisoned and is now a senator do not need much to live on In a new declaration in 2012 Mr Mujica said he was sharing ownership of assets previously in his wifes name including their home and farm equipment which lifted his net worth  He pointed out that his Broad Front predecessor as president Tabar Vzquez also stayed in his own home though Mr Vzquez an oncologist lives in the wellheeled district of El Prado and that Jos Batlle y Ordez a president in the early 20th century who created Uruguays welfare state helped forge a tradition in which there is no distance between the president and any neighbor INDEED if there is any country in South America where a president can drive a Beetle and get by without a large entourage of bodyguards it might be Uruguay which consistently ranks among the regions least corrupt and least unequal nations While crime is emerging as more of a concern Uruguay remains a contender for the regions safest country  Still Mr Mujicas governing style does not sit well with everyone The proposal to legalize marijuana in particular has incited a fierce debate with polls showing most Uruguayans opposed to the measure In December Mr Mujica asked legislators to postpone voting to regulate the marijuana market though he is pushing for the bill to be discussed again soon  Its a shame to have a president like this man said Luz Daz 78 a retired maid who lives near Mr Mujica and voted for him in 2009 She said she would not do so again if given the choice This marijuana thing its absurd she added Pepe should return to selling flowers  Polls show that his approval ratings have been declining but I dont give a damn insisted Mr Mujica emphasizing that he considered reelection to consecutive terms already prohibited by Uruguays Constitution as monarchic If I worried about pollsters I wouldnt be president he said  With two years remaining in his term Mr Mujica seems to cherish the freedom to speak his mind About his religious beliefs he said he was still searching for God  He laments that so many societies considered economic growth a priority calling this a problem for our civilization because of the demands on the planets resources Interestingly enough Uruguays economy is still expanding comfortably at an estimated annual rate of 36 percent  When the gourd of mate was empty Mr Mujica disappeared into his kitchen and returned with an impish grin and a bottle of Espinillar a Uruguayan tipple distilled from sugarcane It was not yet noon but glasses were filled and toasts were pronounced  After that the president jumped around subjects from anthropology and cycling to Uruguayans love for beef He said he could not dream of retiring but looked forward to his

A Barrier Drops for Military Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/05/opinion/a-barrier-drops-for-military-women.html,A small but important provision of the military budget bill just signed by President Obama ends a longstanding act of discrimination against women who serve in Americas military Offered by Senator Jeanne Shaheen a New Hampshire Democrat the provision lifts a statutory ban on giving female service members insurance coverage for abortions in cases of rape and incest Since 1988 military health plans have paid for abortions only when a pregnancy endangers a womens life  That policy was all the more unjustifiable given the serious and continuing problem of sexual assault among service members and in light of the more respectful treatment accorded civilians who work for the federal government or rely on Medicaid These nonsoldiers are allowed to use their government insurance to pay for abortions in cases of rape as well as in lifethreatening situations The new provision does not end the difficulty that military women have in accessing safe abortion care Next Congress and the administration must end another longstanding restriction that prevents servicewomen from obtaining abortions at military hospitals and clinics even if the women pay the bill Current law bans abortions at military facilities except in instances of rape or incest or when a pregnancy threatens a womans life  The rule is a special hardship for servicewomen stationed in foreign countries particularly in a war zone like Afghanistan Women serving overseas should have the same basic health care that other American women enjoy and should not have to risk their health privacy or future career advancement in order to exercise a constitutionally protected right  Two New York Democrats Senator Kirsten Gillibrand and Representative Louise Slaughter will soon be reintroducing legislation to allow women to obtain abortions on military bases with private funds It asks members of Congress to stop burdening soldiers with ideological restrictions on their health care 
When Reporters Get Personal,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/public-editor/when-reporters-get-personal.html,BILL GRUESKIN remembers being an editor at The Wall Street Journal in 2004 when Farnaz Fassihis email meant for a few friends eyes only began to circle the globe Ms Fassihi an IranianAmerican was a reporter for The Journal and the exposure of her views about the deteriorating situation in Iraq provocative and incisive was shocking Published outside the normal bounds of painfully balanced journalism her missive gave readers an unfiltered blast of reality It was startling to read it and the reaction was explosive said Mr Grueskin now the academic dean at Columbia Universitys Graduate School of Journalism Since then the debate about whether reporters should expose their personal views has only gathered power and velocity The debate  in a different form  flared again a few weeks ago when I wrote on my blog about The Timess Jerusalem bureau chief Jodi Rudoren Ms Rudoren writing on Facebook had expressed personal thoughts about Palestinians in a way she later regretted But some observers saw an important lesson in the situation Journalists thoughts and beliefs DO matter enough of this objectivity myth Jillian York a freespeech advocate wrote on Twitter The message from some readers We dont want a reporters personal beliefs covered up even if we disagree One who commented on my blog Mark from Sydney wrote I think the instinct to maintain the old fiction that professional journalists can free themselves of their personal views and habits of mind is doomed to failure In an increasingly polarized society this is an increasingly important subject and a complex one Does objectivity matter Is the idea of impartiality worth preserving Lets acknowledge upfront that it is a twoheaded beast partly about the personal biases that reporters may bring into their work and partly about the middleground reporting that muddies the truth in the name of fairness Jay Rosen a New York University journalism professor believes that traditional notions about impartial reporting are fundamentally flawed For starters he thinks journalists should just come out and tell readers more about their beliefs The grounds for trust are slowly shifting he told me recently The View from Nowhere is slowly getting harder to trust and Heres where Im coming from is more likely to be trusted Pushing back are editors like Philip B Corbett The Timess associate managing editor for standards I flatly reject the notion that there is no such thing as impartial objective journalism  that its some kind of pretense or charade and we should just give it up come clean and lay out our biases he said We expect professionals in all sorts of fields to put their personal opinions aside or keep them to themselves when they do their work  judges police officers scientists teachers Why would we expect less of journalists Neither of these thoughtful journalists though is blackandwhite on the subject Mr Rosen wont go so far as to say that The Timess Washington bureau chief for example should have a Web page summarizing whom he voted for whether he believes in abortion rights and what political party he is registered with While he believes that is the right direction for journalists I also understand that there are lots of practical problems including the simple fact that the Washington bureau chief will get attacked for saying that And for his part Mr Corbett doesnt expect reporters and editors to be faceless impersonal entities He encourages them to take part in Webbased chats where readers can get to know the people behind the bylines He supports Times journalists use of Facebook Twitter and other social media platforms to communicate in a more personal way But thats a far cry from making public declarations of political opinions a practice he believes would erode our credibility and feed the false notion that there are no real facts no impartial reporting or analysis  just spin and polemic I agree with Mr Corbett that The Timess credibility would be damaged if its reporters began declaring their partisan beliefs As he notes readers already have a hard time accepting that reporting is fairminded But I also appreciate an element of Mr Rosens philosophy In his view objectivity is problematic when it involves taking the midpoint between opposing sides and calling that neithernor position impartialÂ  Hes dead right about that As Ive written before what readers really want is reporting that gets to the bottom of a story without having to give opposing sides equal weight They also want reporters to state established truths clearly without hedging or always putting the words in a sources mouth Theyre most interested in truth Smart journalists may reasonably differ on how to get there Mr Rosen says Tell us where youre coming from Mr Corbett says Check your personal beliefs at the door Ill offer these conclusions The idea that transparency is the new objectivity as the author David Weinberger puts it has merit Journalists can let readers get to know their backgrounds their personalities and how they do their jobs The Times has embraced that move toward transparency through social media Webbased chats with journalists and even its employment of a public editor who explains the paper to readers But there should be limits especially for news reporters as opposed to opinion writers The Times should continue to enforce its rules that bar journalists from the most visible forms of partisanship contributing to campaigns joining rallies or making public shows of support for candidates or causes It would be hard for readers to believe that a reporter who contributed to a campaign or carried a sign in an abortionrelated rally could report without bias If impartiality means an even split between opposing beliefs in every article the concept deserves to be tossed out Get at the truth above all But getting at the truth can require setting aside personal views to evaluate evidence fairly If thats impartiality it remains not only worthwhile but crucially necessary
New Legislature Faces a New Set of Priorities,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/us/texas-legislature-faces-a-new-set-of-priorities.html,The last time Texas lawmakers convened in Austin they were absorbed with numbers and boundaries how to make ends meet with a deflated state budget and draw new district maps the courts would approve But with improving fiscal conditions and redistricting mostly in the rearview mirror they are approaching the 2013 legislative session with some pressing policy questions from whether to introduce private school vouchers into the states public education system to whether they should put in effect  and accept financing for  major provisions of the federal health care overhaul Meanwhile lawmakers will face the consequences of the sweeping cuts and budgetbalancing tricks of the 2011 session including a multibilliondollar Medicaid shortfall and a lawsuit  expected to be appealed to the Texas Supreme Court early this year and decided in the summer  over how the state finances public education  The Legislature is also staring down the barrel of some other major investments from ensuring that Texas has the water to meet its soaring population growth to finding consistent revenue streams for longdelayed transportation projects Do not expect a full respite from hotbutton issues lawmakers have already offered legislation to ban abortion after 20 weeks and to allow teachers to carry concealed handguns in school classrooms But the Legislatures Republican majority may take a softer tack toward immigration bills this session after a national election in which the growing Hispanic population moved even further into the Democratic camp A look at the anticipated legislation issues and political battles in the 83rd session PUBLIC EDUCATION Whether to pass school choice reform  and what shape it might take  could be one of the biggest battles of the 2013 session A key aspect of any proposal will be whether parents can use public money to send children to private schools Support for such a measure does not fall along party lines and it has divided Republicans in the past Lawmakers are also poised to take on the states public school accountability system because of widespread reaction against the use of highstakes standardized tests to measure student performance Dan Patrick Republican of Houston and the chairman of the Senate Education Committee and Michael L Williams the states education commissioner have offered proposals that rate schools on a scale of A to F other legislators have suggested doing away with state testing  Education advocates and some lawmakers will push to restore some or all of the 54 billion in public school budget cuts made during the 2011 session But any decision will hinge on the resolution of a major school finance lawsuit against the state A Texas Supreme Court decision anticipated in early summer could bring lawmakers back to Austin to revamp the states method of financing public schools After the mass shootings last month at a Connecticut elementary school lawmakers could also consider measures to heighten security at public schools including a bill to let school employees carry concealed handguns Look to Mr Patrick to be the gatekeeper on education policy in the Senate Key lawmakers to watch in the House include John Otto Republican of Dayton and an appropriations guru and Jimmie Don Aycock Republican of Killeen who has taken the lead on school finance issues MORGAN SMITH HEALTH CARE Lawmakers will be responding to scandals in the health care arena that have rocked the states cancer research institute and its Medicaid program and federal reforms that will dramatically alter Texas medical landscape  As criminal and civil investigations of the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas continue rebuilding public trust in the 3 billion voterapproved initiative will be a top priority Lawmakers have also filed bills to tackle Medicaid fraud among dental and orthodontic providers  In response to federal health care reform  socalled Obamacare  lawmakers must decide whether Texas will expand Medicaid to cover poor uninsured adults or set up an Orbitzlike online insurance exchange Mr Perry has insisted that Texas will not play ball but decisions by the states Republican majority could pressure the governor to accept federal reforms and the money that comes with them  Some lawmakers may be reconsidering a 73 million cut to family planning services that was made in the last session which was largely an effort to force Planned Parenthood out of state programs They will also be looking at the rules and financing of the Texas Womens Health Program the successor of a federally financed program that ended after the state enforced a rule banning providers affiliated with abortion clinics  Abortion opponents are also backing a fetal pain measure that would ban abortions after 20 weeks and a bill to place tougher requirements on doctors who perform abortions BECCA AARONSON HOUSE SPEAKER Once upon a time speakers of the Texas House easily won reelection until they overstayed their welcome falling victim to politics or scandals But during the tenure of Joe Straus the current speaker and his predecessor Tom Craddick there have been challenges at the beginning of every legislative session  Mr Straus Republican of San Antonio unseated Mr Craddick Republican of Midland in 2009 In 2011 he fended off a rambunctious challenge from Representative Ken Paxton Republican of Plano who has since moved on to the Texas Senate  Now it is Representative David Simpson carrying the challengers banner  Mr Simpson Republican of Longview is entering only his second term but he proved during his freshman term that he was not a goalongtogetalong guy He got in the way of restrictions on socalled puppy mills two years ago even though the sponsor was Senfronia Thompson the venerated Houston Democrat who was in a position to spike all of the upstarts legislation  He argued loudly and unsuccessfully in favor of restricting federal airport searches and gave a personal privilege speech  a fancy term for a heartfelt oratorical address to the House that cannot be interrupted for debate  railing against the machinations he said prevented passage of the antigroping legislation  Now his disdain for Mr Strauss leadership has blossomed into a fullblown challenge for his job After members take their oaths of office on Tuesday to begin their new terms they will decide whether to stick with Mr Straus or switch to Mr Simpson ROSS RAMSEY THE GOVERNOR After enduring a humiliating run for president and his first electoral loss ever Mr Perry heads into the session looking to rebuild his brand He will most likely do it by championing the noholdsbarred conservatism that made him a presidential contender in the first place Over the next few months look for Mr Perry to push a fetal pain bill that would ban abortion after 20 weeks of pregnancy possibly as an emergency item that would fast track the measure He said recently that he sees it as a step toward his goal of ending abortion rights entirely Mr Perry will also call for drug testing welfare recipients and Texans can count on him to resist anything that sounds like a federal mandate whether it relates to health care the environment or guns  The governor says people should be allowed to carry concealed weapons in any public place His response to the mass shooting in Connecticut Let teachers carry guns Mr Perry is likely to face some awkward wrangling over tax incentives and grants to private companies that promise to create jobs  he calls it economic development but many Tea Party conservatives see the programs as corporate welfare The governor promises to reveal his political plans this summer He has said he is leaning toward a reelection race and he could begin another presidential bid in 2016 At a Tea Party gathering a few weeks ago Mr Perry was quoted as saying he still has a burning desire in my heart to see this country led by a Godfearing conservative patriot JAY ROOT ENERGY In a state that remains in a severe drought the overarching energy and environment issue this session will undoubtedly be water  Lawmakers will consider proposals to draw 1 billion or more from the Rainy Day Fund to help finance water projects State Representative Lyle Larson Republican of San Antonio has already filed such a bill  High water rates charged by private companies in rural Texas are also likely to receive scrutiny especially as lawmakers assess whether to move water rate oversight to the Public Utility Commission from the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality The utility commission is undergoing a comprehensive sunset review by the Legislature this session an assessment of the need for a state agency  The Texas Railroad Commission like the utility commsssion is also under sunset review That could result in a name change the leading candidate is the Texas Energy Resources Commission which reflects the agencys oil and gas oversight as well as scrutiny of the agencys enforcement policies for drillers  The Legislature will also most likely be looking at how effectively Ercot the state grid operator resolves its longterm problem of limited power supplies and growing demand Environmentalists will be pushing for the restoration of financing to state parks which saw budget cuts last session Twenty state parks could close if the money does not materialize according to Luke Metzger director of Environment Texas KATE GALBRAITH HIGHER EDUCATION Ideas for getting more out of Texas colleges and universities without giving them more money will dominate higher education discussions in the coming session Under a plan proposed by the Texas Higher Education Coordinating Board the eligibility pool for the states largest needbased grant program would be reduced and the award decreased allowing financing to stretch farther in a more targeted populationÂ  This will be the first session in which the Senates higher education committee which was created in 2009 has not been run by Senator Judith Zaffirini Democrat of Laredo Senator Kel Seliger Republican of Amarillo is the new chairman  Dan Branch Republican of Dallas and the chairman of the House Higher Education Committee has already signaled his priorities filing a bill that would require universities to offer students the option of a fouryear fixedrate tuition plan and seeking to tweak the states enrollmentbased approach to appropriations by tying as much as 25 percent of financing to performance measures like graduation rates Mr Perry has endorsed variations of both proposals The governor does not expect legislation ending Texas longstanding policy of giving some illegal immigrants instate tuition rates and access to financial aid to reach his desk But such a bill has been filed and it could be one of the sessions most contentious higher education issues REEVE HAMILTON IMMIGRATION Unlike last session lawmakers have not prefiled a mountain of immigration legislation After President Obamas strong showing among Hispanic voters in the November general election analysts suggest Texas Republicans may be revising their message  Some state lawmakers however remain intent on keeping the issue front and center State Representative Lyle Larson Republican of San Antonio has filed a bill to repeal instate tuition for illegal immigrants and another that could make it easier for county governments to construct immigration detention centers Representative Bill Zedler Republican of Arlington has filed a bill that would crack down on day labor centers where unauthorized workers congregate to look for temporary work  Mr Perry has not said whether legislation to ban socalled sanctuary cities in Texas would be a priority But he recently reiterated his support for the measure which would expand the immigration enforcement authority of local law enforcement officers  After the United States Supreme Courts decision in June to uphold what critics call the show me your papers provision of the controversial Arizona immigration law Texans could see a similar bill filed this year  But there could also be unprecedented pushback as Texas Republicans watch the states demographics shift and seek to draw more Hispanics into the partys ranks  At their state party convention in June Republicans voted to include a call for a national guestworker program in their platform a public acknowledgment that some of the partys rhetoric may have alienated Hispanic voters JULIN AGUILAR CRIMINAL JUSTICE In the realm of courts and prisons continuing debate is expected over the role of prosecutorial misconduct in Texas wrongful convictions  Michael Morton who was exonerated in 2011 after spending nearly 25 years in prison for his wifes murder is already lobbying legislators to find more ways to hold prosecutors accountable when they make mistakes that lead to wrongful convictionsÂ  Senator Rodney Ellis Democrat of Houston and chairman of the Innocence Project board is likely to take the lead on this issue  Following a year of renewed violence in Texas youth lockups  youthagainstyouth violence this time as opposed to the staffonyouth assaults of 2005 that resulted in system reforms  lawmakers will work to improve the states troubled juvenile justice system Discussion is likely to center on whether to close even more of the states facilities currently there are just 6 down from 15 a few years ago  Reform advocates have long urged legislators to consider smaller secure facilities that are closer to urban centers instead of the massive ones in rural parts of the state In the months ahead Texas could also make more history with its prison system In 2011 lawmakers shut down the aging Central Unit near Houston it was the first time the state had ever closed a prison  Senator John Whitmire a Houston Democrat and the longtime leader of the upper chambers Criminal Justice Committee has already hinted that he would like to see two more Texas prisons closed as the inmate population continues to decline Mr Whitmire will be taking charge of prison issues after the retirement of his longtimeÂ partner inÂ criminal justice Representative Jerry Madden Republican of Plano BRANDI GRISSOM TRANSPORTATION Other budget priorities have overshadowed transportation for years but Texans may see some major movement on two fronts in 2013  After a decade of relying largely on debt and tolls to advance road projects without raising taxes state leaders including Mr Perry and the speaker of the House Mr Straus are calling for the development of a more dependable revenue stream The current financing system largely bolstered by gas taxes has been unable to keep pace with the cost of maintaining roads let alone developing new routes to relieve congestion A proposal toÂ dedicate the sales tax on new vehicle purchases to transportation financing is drawing strong interest  Commuter rail may also see a big boost this year if private development of a highspeed rail system and public efforts to expand rail lines in North Texas move forward Following Mr Perrys veto of a 2011 textingwhiledriving ban lawmakers could reconsider behindthewheel legislation to counter distracted driving  Lawmakers may also provide ways for state and local authorities to hold oil and gas production companies responsible for the damage their vehicles and equipment do to roads in the Permian Basin Eagle Ford Shale and Barnett Shale regions AMAN BATHEJA
G.O.P. Begins Soul-Searching After Tax Vote,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/06/us/politics/big-battles-ahead-divided-gop-begins-soul-searching.html,WASHINGTON  When Republican leaders in Congress agreed to raise taxes on the wealthy last week it left the increasingly fractured and feuding party unified on perhaps only one point that it is at a major crossroads  From Mitt Romneys loss on Election Day through the recent tax fight that shattered party discipline in the House of Representatives Republicans have seen the foundations of their political strategy called into question stirring a newly urgent debate about how to reshape and redefine their party At issue immediately is whether that can be achieved through a shift in tactics and tone or will instead require a deeper rethinking of the partys longtime positions on bedrock issues like guns and immigration President Obama intends to test the willingness of Republicans to bend on those issues in the first months of his new term when he plans to push for stricter gun control and a comprehensive immigration overhaul The coming legislative battles are certain to expose even more division in the party And with establishment Republicans and Tea Party activists at times speaking as if they are from different parties altogether concern is spreading throughout the ranks that things could get worse before they get better The Republican Party cant stay exactly where it is and stick its head in the sand and ignore the fact that the country is changing said Ralph Reed the founder of the Faith and Freedom Coalition and onetime leader of the Christian Coalition On the other hand if the party were to retreat on core profamily stands and its positions on fiscal responsibility and taxes it could very quickly find itself without a strong demographic support base Having lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections Republicans now face a country that is increasingly younger multiethnic and skeptical of Republican positions on some social issues The partys deficitcutting agenda relies heavily on reducing taxes for the wealthy which irks middleclass voters and cutting spending on government programs like Social Security and Medicare that are popular with many voters  Generational change is also robbing the party of some of its most effective political positions Samesex marriage which less than a decade ago was an issue that reliably drove conservative voters to the polls in favor of Republicans appears to be losing its potency with an electorate increasingly comfortable with gay unions None other than Newt Gingrich a former House speaker who promised to fight for a constitutional ban against samesex marriage during the Republican presidential primaries now says his party must come to terms with the countrys rapidly shifting views on the subject Walking around and pretending it doesnt exist just means youre going to become irrelevant Mr Gingrich said in an interview Prominent Republicans insist that if the partys disparate factions can come together around a set of economic social and foreign policy principles in the coming years they stand a good chance of retaking the presidency making gains in Congress and repairing some of the damage done through several years of bitter primary battles and divisive legislative bickering Republicans will get their mojo back when they define themselves as the party of economic growth and upward mobility said Gov Mitch Daniels of Indiana a Republican who will become the president of Purdue University next week Mr Daniels said new lawmakers and governors  many of whom are minorities and women  would reshape the Republican Party  The party with all its problems  and Im not disputing them  has a really large and interesting crop of new faces he said Ultimately parties tend to be defined by their most visible personalities Republicans have already demonstrated success in midterm elections when fewer people vote and in state elections for governorships and legislatures In North Carolina Pat McCrory a Republican former mayor of Charlotte was sworn in as governor on Saturday after waging a campaign that emphasized pragmatism over ideology  My message remained a Republican message Mr McCrory said suggesting that national Republicans could learn a lesson from state politicians But I did it with a tone of problem solving I did it with a tone of cooperation I didnt run one negative ad But a changed tone alone may not do enough to smooth over the very real disagreements in the Republican Party And it is not clear how the intraparty combatants can meet in the middle For example while some Republicans argued that the tax vote last week enshrined almost all of the Bushera tax cuts into permanent law and should be seen as a victory harderline fiscal conservatives called it a shameful departure from the partys two decades of successful opposition to tax increases Clashes between Tea Party supporters in the House and Speaker John A Boehner during the budget battles last year led a dozen of them to withhold their votes for speaker last week  And across the country deeply conservative organizations angry about the concession on tax increases are pledging more not fewer primary challenges to Republicans they believe are straying too far from the partys orthodoxy on taxes guns energy immigration spending and abortion  The gloves are off said Everett Wilkinson a founder of the Tea Party movement in Florida Were going to challenge a lot of the GOP going forward he added both in primaries and general elections  Moderate Republicans are bracing for the challenges Steven C LaTourette who retired from his Ohio Congressional seat at the end of the year and will become the president of the Republican Main Street Partnership said his group would raise money to defend middleoftheroad Republicans against the more conservative groups There has to be an acceptance within the party of people who have nonidentical views on every issue Mr LaTourette said You cant be a national party unless you invite in and are accepting of members with different visions You cant treat them as pariahs As the new year begins some of the partys leaders in Washington are searching for ways to address the philosophical divide and the structural changes in the country that have caused such problems Some are talking about the need to find a positive vision and agenda that represents conservative values but still speaks more directly to the concerns of a broad section of voters  and manages to sell that vision through leaders who can convince voters that the party wants to move forward and not back  Former Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison a Texas Republican who retired this year said Republicans must shift their focus away from issues like abortion samesex marriage gun rights and immigration The combination of our fiscal responsibility message and the social issue message did not bring together a majority in the presidential election she said Its not so much coming to the middle Its letting people have various views on personal issues and not requiring complete fealty to all of those issues in a way that will drive people off Other leaders have urgently ordered toptobottom reviews to determine how the party lost touch with the most important and fastestgrowing voting blocs including women and Hispanics and how it can win them over by the 2014 midterm elections It is now accepted in the party that it has failed to keep up with Democrats in the competition for ascendant voting blocs of Hispanics AfricanAmericans Asians and young people Although exit polls showed that Mr Romney won nearly 60 percent of the white vote Mr Obama won more than 70 percent of Asians and Hispanics and more than 90 percent of black voters If theres one conclusion thats going to come out of this process its that we have to be much more granular in our approach to partners in the community like AfricanAmericans Hispanics and Asians said Reince Priebus the Republican National Committee chairman who is overseeing one of the most ambitious review efforts
The Internationalization of Women's Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/us/09iht-letter09.html,NEW YORK  At the dawn of this new year a note of cautious optimism is rising from female leaders activists and advocates who are anticipating major new strides as women issues go global  Women issues are world issues Michelle Bachelet the executive director of UN Women and former president of Chile said recently Today there is greater awareness than ever before that womens full participation is essential for peace democracy and sustainable development  At the same time Alyse Nelson chief executive of Vital Voices Global Partnership a nongovernmental organization that trains and empowers emerging female leaders and social entrepreneurs around the globe noted that the pace and nature of globalization have worn away the distinction between womens issues and global issues In 2013 women who find real solutions and leverage their leadership to empower others will rise to the international stage in increasing numbers  and not because theyre women I believe these women are the vanguard of a new era of global leadership  A universal vision seems at work here Elect more women as heads of state and government there are only 21 worldwide and to parliaments and promote more women to corporate boards and executive positions advance and empower women in the developed and developing world close the gender pay gap and improve workplace conditions Meantime violence against women a central focus of UN Womens agenda has exploded as a world issue In some countries up to 7 in 10 women will be beaten raped abused or mutilated during their lifetimes Ms Bachelet said There can be no peace no progress when women live under the fear of violence  Indeed Malala Yousafzai the Pakistani student shot by Taliban attackers after she spoke up on behalf of girls education has become a global symbol renewing efforts to protect schoolgirls in extreme patriarchal societies India the worlds largest democracy was put on notice that women would not be silent anymore Thousands of people have joined female demonstrators against government and police mishandling of rape cases and insensitivity to women in general Large protests over a fatal gang rape became frontpage news around the world and protesters led by women demanded stronger laws against rape sexual harassment and child abuse  With the globalization of womens issues world organizations are drumming up the support of activists the world over of marquee names and celebrities At the first Trust Women conference convened by the Thomson Reuters Foundation and the International Herald Tribune in London in December participants and speakers  from Queen Noor of Jordan to Christy Turlington  debated complex issues like sexual slavery child marriage and the role of women in the Arab world  Separately the Women in the World Foundation which will have its fourth annual conference in New York City in April announced that a fundraising appeal in the name of Ms Yousafzai had collected more than 100000 in donations that the foundation said would go toward girls education in Pakistan and Afghanistan   Some progress has been made on that score In countries around the world we see womens educational achievement growing to the point that in many countries more women than men are attending university says Liza Mundy a fellow at the New America Foundation and author of The Richer Sex about the rising number of female breadwinners The nearfatal shooting of Ms Yousafzai she says demonstrated the real import of schooling for girls and women and it also shows how deeply threatening this can be to extreme traditionalists  Taking on another big issue Catalyst a nonpartisan organization for the advancement of women in business is kicking off a plan to get more women onto corporate boards We expect 2013 to be the year when momentum builds for women in leadership Ilene H Lang Catalysts president and chief executive said by email Corporate boards are top priority Women hold only 166 percent of Fortune 500 board seats To help close that gender gap Catalyst plans to enlist chief executives who would sponsor boardready women into leadership positions In Europe Viviane Reding the commissioner for justice is leading another big push for women on boards Allied activists have produced a register of thousands of boardready women to counter arguments that there is a shortage of qualified candidates A big lift to American women came with the record number of women 20 who won seats in the US Senate The old tag Year of the Woman has been revived and fresh momentum injected into the campaign to elect a woman president in 2016 Its no news that Hillary Rodham Clinton  recovering from a blood clot and other illnesses  is the undisputed Democratic frontrunner But the names of Democratic female senators also pop up including Kirsten E Gillibrand of New York and the newly elected Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts The female senators make up just 20 percent of the 100member Senate but are drawing outsize attention Known challenges await them in and out of Congress like efforts to restrict abortion rights and cut back or end federal funding for womens health programs like Planned Parenthood  Familiar issues like equal pay workplace policies familywork balance and political power havent gone away in the United States or anywhere else Basic needs and basic rights remain elusive for many women in the developing world And those issues too will not go away anytime soon But more women in more regions of the world are stepping up and living better lives just about everyone in the field agrees And as the old womens issues become global the expectations

The Spread of Pregnancy Crisis Centers,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/opinion/the-spread-of-pregnancy-crisis-centers.html,  To the Editor Given recent attacks on family planning and abortion care in Texas the growth of crisis pregnancy centers there may not be a surprise Abortion Fight Helping Hands Gain Influence front page Jan 5 But these centers are proliferating across the country including in New York especially in lowincome areas and communities of color such as the South Bronx Crisis pregnancy centers are antichoice front facilities whose purpose is to dissuade women from seeking abortion care consistently providing misinformed and manipulative information A Naral ProChoice New York investigation found that some centers tell outright lies such as suggesting that a woman can wait well into her ninth month to seek abortion care or that she is likely to miscarry anyway so should delay care In fact the longer a woman waits the more expensive inaccessible and ultimately illegal the option of abortion becomes Pregnancy centers may seem like the benign counterparts to antichoice extremists in state legislatures or protests outside clinics but they represent a threat to womens health Pregnant women  especially those in vulnerable populations who rely upon free help  deserve accurate and unbiased information and timely access to medical care so they can make the decision that is best for them and their families Pregnancy centers rob women of that option ANDREA MILLER President Naral ProChoice New York New York Jan 5 2013 To the Editor As a staunchly prochoice person I was glad to hear about increases in pregnancy centers that offer a variety of services to women including information about alternatives to abortion together with financial and other support If choice means anything it means having the support to make the alternatives viable Indeed the only bad actors in this story seem to be the state governments that stick their ideological thumbs on the scale by subsidizing one choice while unconstitutionally burdening another WARNER R BROADDUS San Diego Jan 6 2013 To the Editor The purposefully misleading tactics used by these pregnancy counseling centers do not help women As a psychiatrist I am upset by the inaccurate claims relating to mental health including purported increased risk of depression suicide or other negative outcomes following abortion There is no good evidence for these claims Reputable studies have shown that there is no independent link between abortion and negative psychological outcomes This is just one example of the many inaccurate scientifically baseless statements these centers use to misinform women How you can you be acting in good faith when your entire premise is predicated on lies Education counseling and support are clearly not the goal Rather they seek to increase the shame and guilt of vulnerable women to further their own agenda And that is anything but compassionate ANGELA JANIS Madison Wis Jan 5 2013
Texas Budget Surplus Proves as Contentious as a Previous Shortfall,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/us/texas-budget-surplus-proves-as-contentious-as-a-previous-shortfall.html,AUSTIN Tex  The last time Texas lawmakers began a legislative session a costcutting fervor filled the marble hallways of the Capitol in January 2011 as the state faced a budget shortfall of as much as 27 billion Legislators warned of sparing nothing and no one from deep cutbacks  from highways to prisons to health care for the poor to programs for preschool children Two years later as lawmakers met Tuesday for the opening of the Legislature the states financial picture was not nearly as dire A boom in revenues from sales taxes as well as taxes from oil and natural gas production have given Texas a budget surplus that the state comptroller has estimated at 88 billion But the question of what to do with the surplus is proving just as contentious as debate over the shortfall two years ago and will most likely frame much of the wrangling throughout the fastpaced 140day regular session  Republican and Democratic members of the State House and Senate have offered competing visions of how to use the surplus and how the state should respond to rapid population growth severe drought the federal health care overhaul and a host of other issues Education advocates and Democratic lawmakers have called for the Legislature to restore some or all of the 54 billion cuts made to public education in the 2011 session But Republican leaders and other fiscal conservatives have expressed reluctance to finance anything beyond growth in student enrollment particularly when a lawsuit against the state over how it finances public education will not be resolved until later in the year I think theres going to be a group of people who think weve got the money we need to spend it said Representative Jim Pitts Republican of Waxahachie and chairman of the House Appropriations Committee I think theres going to be a group of people who think we need to cut our budget more The session could be very difficult because of those two groups of people pushing us Shortly after noon inside the Capitols Senate chamber Gov Rick Perry told senators that the comptrollers revenue estimate released the day before was good news but cautioned them to retain the states fiscally conservative model Mr Perry has called on lawmakers to support his socalled Texas Budget Compact a Tea Partystyle pledge to oppose new taxes and to replace the current spending limit for the state budget with an even stricter formula There are interests all across the state who view Mondays revenue estimates as the equivalent of ringing the dinner bell Mr Perry said adding However in the face of that kind of pressure we have to remember that Mondays revenue estimate represents not a chance to spend freely but an opportunity to rededicate ourselves to the very policies that have made Texas economically strong Mr Perrys speech rankled some Democrats who described the increased revenues as a socalled surplus because services for public education health care and other programs had been slashed statewide Thats why you raise revenue  to spend it wisely said Senator John Whitmire a Houston Democrat Theres not a state agency in this state that is being adequately funded Higher ed public ed social services highways parks  all of them are hurting You shouldnt start out by saying No No is not a program Mr Perrys remarks to the senators were interrupted briefly when a member of Mr Whitmires staff who had been standing at the back of the chamber collapsed Senators and others rushed to help her but she appeared to be unharmed When Mr Perry stepped to the microphone again he quipped to applause and laughter I have not had that kind of impact on anyone in a long time Mr Perry has been busy building up his political capital and perhaps his own ego after his unsuccessful campaign for president He has indicated that he is considering running for reelection in 2014 and has not ruled out making another run for the White House in 2016 His influence over the Legislature in light of his possible future campaigns remains an unknown factor as the session gets under way but many believe his stumble on the national stage has not set him back in his home state He now looks a little more human maybe after his presidential run said Michael Quinn Sullivan the president of Texans for Fiscal Responsibility But dont confuse looking human with looking weak The governor is still the governor In Texas lawmakers convene every other year and set state spending in a twoyear budget cycle While the 83rd Legislature was already being called one of the states most inexperienced  with nearly 50 firsttime legislators in the House and Senate  it was also described by some as likely to be one of the most conservative Republican leaders including Mr Perry have expressed support for a socalled fetal pain bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy In addition lawmakers have proposed requiring those applying for welfare and unemployment benefits to undergo drug testing and allowing teachers who are licensed to carry concealed handguns to wear their weapons in the classroom But aside from those proposals the surplus has allowed the Legislature to focus on issues that have often been pushed aside in leaner budget times including seeking new ways to finance longdelayed infrastructure projects like the building of roads and reservoirs Though they lost their supermajority in the House in the November elections Republicans continue to control both chambers of the Legislature and to hold every statewide elected office But the tone of the session will likely be set not only by numbers but by the political dynamics at play The farright agenda of grassroots and Tea Party activists has come to dominate the Republican Party in Texas turning moderate Republicans into an endangered species for the most part Mainstream Republicans are likely to use the legislative session to bolster their conservative credentials particularly after Ted Cruz a Tea Party favorite defeated one of the states most powerful Republicans Lt Gov David Dewhurst in a United States Senate race last year Mr Dewhurst who presides over the Senate as lieutenant governor and has indicated he plans to run for reelection said that his campaign taught him a number of things  including doing a better job communicating his accomplishments to voters  but that his conservative record was impeccable To be up in Washington as a freshman senator in which nothings going to go on youre going to have gridlock so noisy you cant hear he said Im glad to be here
Lawmakers in New York Move Toward New Limits on Guns,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/nyregion/cuomo-on-gun-control-and-storm-issues-in-annual-address.html,ALBANY  Gov Andrew M Cuomo and legislative leaders believe they are close to an agreement on a package of gun laws that includes a restrictive ban on assault weapons and lawmakers hope to vote on it as soon as next week Mr Cuomo delivering his third annual State of the State address on Wednesday called on lawmakers to approve the toughest assault weapons ban in the nation And displaying an unsual degree of speed for Albany lawmakers seemed prepared to move quickly on the governors request Forget the extremists  its simple Mr Cuomo said to a crescendo of applause near the end of his nearly80minute speech No one hunts with an assault rifle No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer End the madness now Mr Cuomo not only proposed a far more restrictive assault weapons ban than currently exists in New York but he also proposed a more comprehensive ban on largecapacity magazines He also proposed to require background checks for private sales of guns not just at gun shows and stores And he called for tougher penalties for buying guns illegally or for using them to commit crimes as well as for uniform licensing standards across the state This is not taking away peoples guns he said That is not what this is about It is about ending the unnecessary risk of highcapacity assault rifles Mr Cuomo has been working feverishly to negotiate a deal with lawmakers and he is said to be close to one that would allow for rapid passage of the gun measures Indeed the Senate Republican leader Dean G Skelos of Long Island said on Wednesday that Republicans were having productive negotiations with Mr Cuomo I think our goal is to try to get something done by the end of this week present it to conference next week and well see where we go he said Mr Cuomo rewriting his agenda after the trauma of the Newtown Conn school massacre and the devastation of Hurricane Sandy proposed a number of measures intended to limit the damage from future storms in addition to steps intended to reduce the scourge of gun violence The governor a Democrat who has come under attack from the liberal wing of his party as he contemplates a 2016 bid for the presidency also tacked aggressively to the left with new proposals in his address delivered in an auditorium at the Capitol complex He proposed an increase of the state minimum wage to 875 an hour from 725 an hour tougher greenhouse gas standards solar jobs programs a 1 billion affordablehousing initiative grants for schools that extend school days and a 10point plan for women that included strengthening abortion rights laws and enacting equalpay legislation that garnered the loudest applause Mr Cuomo did not say how his many proposals would be financed he is to introduce his budget later this month The governor said he would continue to push for a referendum in November on expanding casino gambling and described casinos as vehicles for improving the upstate economy He said that at first he would allow as many as three fullscale casinos upstate and none in New York City in an effort to lure tourists to travel upstate But guns and the aftermath of Hurricane Sandy were focal points of his address In New York the debate resulting from the Newtown school bloodshed was amplified by the shooting deaths of two firefighters in Webster NY Mr Cuomo gave flags to the families of the firefighters and the police chief from Rochester which is near Webster called on New York to lead the nation on gun control Speaking of Hurricane Sandy the governor drew from the early progress of four commissions he created in the wake of the storm though many of their proposals are still works in progress Climate change is real he said It is denial to say each of these situations is a onceinalifetime There is a 100year flood every two years now It is inarguable that the sea is warmer and there is changing weather pattern and the time to act is now Among his proposals was a bailout fund for homeowners who want to move out of floodprone regions and aid to build homes to better withstand floods He also called for measures to better protect subways public utilities the fuel delivery system and the New York Harbor And he excoriated Washington for waiting so long to provide New York and New Jersey with federal storm aid That is just too little and it is too late and it has nothing to do with the way Congress has acted in the past he said This has long been established that in the face of a disaster the national government comes in to help Remember New York he added because New York will not forget I promise you
A Family Circle Spins Around the Oval Office,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/arts/television/1600-penn-on-nbc-with-pullman-gad-and-elfman.html,There is something funny about 1600 Penn but mostly in the sense of odd Its an NBC sitcom on Thursday about a fictional first family that the network is promoting as a blend of Modern Family and The West Wing Actually 1600 Penn seems more like a time capsule of the presidencies of Gerald Ford Jimmy Carter and Ronald Reagan and period sitcoms like Growing Pains  The most contemporary thing about it is the topic of abortion it is taboo When the presidents unmarried adult daughter discovers she is pregnant after a onenight stand her loved ones are shocked let down and worried about her promising future Nobody however suggests terminating the pregnancy  That choice was available back in the pioneering days of Maude Murphy Brown and the Dabney Coleman comedy Buffalo Bill Nowadays the antiabortion movement has grown so powerful that most primetime sitcoms find it safer to ignore the option altogether  In almost every other way 1600 Penn is an oldfashioned comedy in which every bad turn ends with a smile Bill Pullman is Dale Gilchrist the reserved but kindly president who has an adoring second wife Emily Jenna Elfman and four children from his first marriage who get into hairbrained scrapes  particularly Skip Josh Gad Skip is a young Billy Carter figure a goofy gaffeprone college dropout after seven years Skip is still three credits short who combines the infantility and clumsiness of Jerry Lewis with John Belushistyle hedonism  There are some amusing moments especially involving Mr Gad who was a star of The Book of Mormon and adds his own idiosyncratic idiocy to the proceedings Skip is a knowing naf and sly dreamer who makes trouble but can also inadvertently save the day  for his pregnant sister Becca Martha MacIsaac and even for the presidents foreign policy  The humor is broad particularly the sendups of foreign leaders who seem frozen in 1970s stereotypes Austrians are stern sticklers for discipline and protocol Latin Americans are prideful but childish easily won over with alcohol and fractured Spanish phrases  There are other shows that mine politics and the White House for humor most notably Veep on HBO which adapted a wickedly funny and seditious British comedy The Thick of It to an American vice president and her staff Veep which stars Julia LouisDreyfus works because it is stripped Britishstyle of all sentiment and redemption and instead bores in relentlessly on the insecurities petty rivalries and unprincipled selfinterest that guides policy makers in real life Its practically the CliffsNotes for the fiscal cliff  1600 Penn is much sunnier which helps explain why President Obama was scheduled to watch it in a private screening at the White House on Wednesday Also one of the shows creators is Jon Lovett a former Obama speechwriter  But the show has some wit and also a few modern touches As first lady Emily is a selfpunishing people pleaser who has to win over both the White House press corps and her own stepchildren who havent entirely accepted their fathers tall blond young wife  While hosting a White House event to encourage girls to pursue math the motto is Lets Multiply a youngster asks Emily what it means when her father says the first lady is a trophy wife Emily freezes then replies with a tight smile Trophies arent just pretty they denote accomplishment like putting yourself through law school running a dozen successful political campaigns by the age of 40 and still managing to get to the gym three days a week and I mean real classes not just standing there on the elliptical The White House press secretary intervenes before she loses it altogether  The series doesnt break new ground by any means but the more atavistic touches serve as a reminder of how much more disciplined presidents and their families have become since the heyday of honesty and free expression that defined but also damaged the reputations of the children of Ford Reagan and Mr Carter  Their experiences led their successors to do better With a few notable exceptions the Bush family managed to be more circumspect The Clintons had more than their fair share of lurid scandal but they nevertheless found a way to preserve the privacy of their daughter Chelsea when she was growing up in the White House fishbowl  The Obamas have perfected the art And their skill and application is particularly remarkable in this era of TMZ and 24hour tabloid journalism Its astonishing that Web sites morning shows and latenight comedies arent blaring tidbits about Malia Obamas suitors or Sasha Obamas grades For some reason probably having to do with learned caution and more media savvy those kinds of White House revelations dont happen much anymore  The Gilchrists on the other hand arent at all adept at hiding their true selves from the camera even though the family motto which Emily and Becca dutifully recite in unison when prompted by Dale is reporters are the worst people in the world Skip however thinks he means another Gilchrist maxim and intones Expiration dates are there for a reason 1600 Penn has charm and some funny riffs but its a 2013 sitcom that at times seems like it was written in 1983 
The Woes of Roe,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/opinion/collins-the-woes-of-roe.html,Forty years ago this month the Supreme Court handed down the great abortion rights decision Roe v Wade To be honest youre not going to be seeing a whole lot of cake and Champagne Time magazine recognized the occasion with a downbeat cover story Theyve Been Losing Ever Since Gallup polls suggest support for abortion rights is fading particularly among young Americans and that more people now regard themselves as prolife than prochoice On the other hand  I know you had faith that eventually wed get to the other hand  the polls depend on the question According to the Quinnipiac poll if you ask Americans whether they agree with the Roe decision nearly twothirds say yes Its always been this way Americans are permanently uncomfortable with the abortion issue and they respond most positively to questions that suggest it isnt up to them to decide anything Should be a matter between a woman and her doctor is usually a popular option Whatever recent changes there are in public opinion may be less about abortion than about the term prochoice This week Planned Parenthood unveiled a pile of new research some of which suggests that younger women dont like labels Or at least not that one Weve been discussing changing our name for the past year or so said Kelsey Warrick a Georgetown University student whos president of Hoyas for Choice Maybe its like feminism a word with a glorious history thats rejected by many young people who are staunchly in favor of womens rights Maybe as Dawn Laguens the executive vice president of Planned Parenthood suggested at a press conference this week its just that young women feel as though theyre up to their ears in choices already We may never know although if prochoice activists want to rebrand themselves the Movement for Leaving Women Alone its likely nobody under the age of 50 would object  One way or another the abortion rights cause needs all the help it can get Abortion clinics around the country are reeling under crazy new rules that make it impossible for them to operate In Virginia the state board of health is demanding that clinics follow the same architectural standards as hospitals including 5footwide hallways In Texas the Legislature is considering a law that would require that all abortions be performed in ambulatory surgical centers When the state passed that requirement for pregnancies beyond 16 weeks in 2004 every single clinic doing that procedure was forced to shut down Only a handful managed to reopen  in a state that encompasses more than 261000 square miles In Mississippi the states one and only abortion clinic the Jackson Womens Health Organization is in danger of closing because of a new law requiring that any doctor who does abortions have admitting privileges at a local hospital This would be less of a problem if the local hospitals were not all terrified of giving privileges to anybody who performs abortions When the clinic tried to advertise for a doctor who already had the requisite affiliation the state medical journal refused to take the ad Were just doing business as usual Trying to be there for the women of Mississippi said Betty Thompson the former director who stayed on after she retired and is now working as a counselor  Over the last 40 years women seeking abortions have been put through a lot of unnecessary trauma Trips of hundreds of miles to the nearest clinic Requirements that they have ultrasounds or have ultrasounds and listen to the physician describe the ultrasound or have ultrasounds and then wait 24 hours before the procedure In Texas the doctor who does the abortion also has to conduct the ultrasound creating a scheduling nightmare Theyre caught in the middle of a political fight over a deeply personal issue that leaves most Americans feeling uneasy If you want to rack up a real positive response on a poll ask people whether the women or the politicians should make decisions about their pregnancies One of the surveys commissioned by Planned Parenthood showed 83 percent of likely voters picked the women including 64 percent of those who called themselves prolife If theres been any permanent message in this long battle thats been it No matter how conservative the state sooner or later you will hit the point where the people object to politicians messing with a womans private business Mississippi voters rejected a statewide referendum to give any fetus the right of personhood Voters in South Dakota another state with a single struggling abortion clinic have twice rejected total abortion bans Every time the antiabortion movement pushes too far it reminds people that its cause no matter how filled with moral fervor is basically about imposing one particular theology on the rest of the country Over the long run the nervous ambivalent uncomfortable public wont let that happen 
Robert Borkâ€™s Tragedy,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/09/robert-borks-tragedy/," Even before Robert Bork died last month he had achieved something close to martyrdom In the quartercentury
                                        since the Senate rejected his Supreme Court nomination successive generations of conservative lawyers and activists have carried the torch depicting his defeat as an injustice of historic proportion
                                        Following his death at the age of 85 liberals mostly maintained a respectful silence while conservatives dusted off old complaints about the conduct of the confirmation hearing and the unfairness in their view
                                        of the borking the nominee received Clearly the Bork Battle survives Bork No one who actually lived through the Senate Judiciary Committee hearing in September 1987 is without views on the subject and I have previously offered mine                                        I think that the televised hearing which held the country spellbound provided a rare and valuable public seminar on the meaning of the Constitution the methods of constitutional interpretation and the different
                                        answers that competing methods offer to the most profound questions of individual autonomy and equality Indisputably there was some exaggerated rhetoric and certainly the hearing had its rough edges as Judge Richard A Posner observed                                        in Slate last month thats politics and a Supreme Court confirmation hearing is at its core a political event But what borking really amounted to was holding the nominees vigorously
                                        expressed views up to the light for public inspection In five days of testimony thenJudge Bork  a former professor of mine whom I liked and respected  had every opportunity to make his case His
                                        ideas were fully aired and considered By a vote of 58 to 42 the senators having heard from their constituents concluded that his constricted constitutional vision locked into the supposed original intention
                                        of the framers was not what the country needed or wanted Some time after the Senate vote I was invited to a conversation with Judge Bork at the offices of The New Republic magazine He was hurting and angry When my turn came to ask a question I asked him whether at any
                                        time during the hearing he had felt that a member of the Judiciary Committee had met him on his own level in serious constitutional conversation No he answered Not even Arlen Specter I asked Specter had his mind made up from the beginning he snapped I knew that wasnt true although Judge Bork clearly believed it Senator Specter a Pennsylvania Republican had in fact agonized over his vote as I knew from having talked with him almost daily A Yale Law
                                        School graduate and former prosecutor the senator went head to head with the nominee through several rounds of questioning hours of mesmerizing constitutional debate in which he probed for any sign of flexibility
                                        in Judge Borks view that the entire course of modern constitutional law was profoundly mistaken Finding none Senator Specter who had assumed at the start of the hearing that he would vote for confirmation
                                        decided to vote No fully recognizing the price he would pay within his own party Five other Republicans followed Judge Bork and Senator Specter whose paths crossed at such a significant moment in their lives
                                        died within months of each other Arlen Specter who eventually became a Democrat died in October at 82 At The New Republic gathering I didnt say anything to correct my old professors view that the hearing was a charade in which the fix was in from the start Arlen Specter could speak for himself it
                                        seemed to me It was clear at that moment and became only more so as the years passed that Robert Bork couldnt accept the legitimacy of his defeat No one is entitled to a seat on the Supreme Court of
                                        course and many towering legal figures who never made it took their disappointment to the grave Judge Bork was hardly unique in his sense of entitlement but it ran so deep that it prevented him from understanding
                                        the obvious dynamic of what happened Because he had been nominated to fill the swing seat vacated by Justice Lewis F Powell Jr a moderate conservative whose retirement left nearly every issue
                                        of constitutional moment hanging in the balance his nomination became a public referendum on whether the court should move decisively to the right or stay basically the same The status quo won out Its
                                        evident in retrospect how much would have been different had Robert Bork been sitting all these years in the seat that President Reagan intended for him and that Anthony M Kennedy finally assumed in February 1988
                                        It was pretty clear back then too Justice Kennedy  then like Judge Bork a federal court of appeals judge  was confirmed unanimously As the confirmation hearing has come down in history Judge Borks comment that serving on the Supreme Court would be an intellectual feast is what many people remember it sounded so arrogant
                                        when it was I think rather refreshingly honest A less famous but more telling moment took place earlier during a colloquy with Senator Orrin Hatch a Republican from Utah It was Senator Hatchs daunting
                                        task to show that the nominee was not the extremist his opponents had described but rather a person of comfortably mainstream views To that end the senator read a series of quotations from liberaltomoderate
                                        law professors who like Judge Bork had criticized Roe v Wade the 1973 abortion decision The names of the critics read like a legal establishment hall of fame Finally Senator Hatch served up what sounded like a concluding softball question In your lengthy constitutional studies is there any Supreme Court decision that has stirred more controversy or criticism amongst scholars and citizens than that particular case Then came the unexpected answer I suppose the only candidate for that Senator would be Brown v Board of Education Scrambling to reclaim lost ground Senator Hatch quickly offered Or possibly the Dred Scott case Yes thats right Judge Bork said The moment passed quickly but its worth unpacking that deeply revealing exchange As Senator Hatch immediately grasped the nominee had violated a cardinal rule of modern judicial confirmation hearings which
                                        is that Brown v Board of Education is beyond debate The 1954 school desegregation ruling was in fact the subject of substantial criticism within the legal academy in the 1950s and well into the 1960s some eminent
                                        professors while endorsing the outcome took strong issue with the courts analytical method Awareness of the rich critical literature from that period had faded away by 1987 effaced by the decisions
                                        celebrated unanimity and moral weight So while Judge Borks answer to Senator Hatch was historically accurate it was an obtuse accuracy More to the point was how the moral dimension seemed to elude him
                                        as he tossed Brown into the same box with the abortion decision of which he had been so scathingly dismissive I should explain this columns title Robert Borks Tragedy I see him as a tragic figure not because he was dealt an unjust hand  he wasnt  but because of his
                                        inability to understand what happened He spent his final decades surrounded by acolytes who stoked his sense of victimhood and there seemed to be no one around him to provide a reality check as his rants about
                                        the Supreme Courts depredations and the collapse of Western civilization he portrayed the two as inextricably linked became ever more extravagant In a symbolic gesture aimed at the Republican base Mitt
                                        Romney named him cochair of his campaign advisory committee on law By 1996 in Slouching Towards Gomorrah Modern Liberalism and American Decline he was taking aim at Darwinian evolution and embracing intelligent design                                        evidence for which he later called overwhelming A Country I Do Not Recognize a book he edited in 2005 found him plunging ever deeper into the culture wars with the Supreme Court as his main target His introductory essay charged that the
                                        Supreme Courts unconstitutional rulings were an attempt to remake society and thus to remake man himself He complained about the courts embrace of radical individualism
                                        and its destruction of taboos about vile language He wrote Our cultures abandonment of a sense of the sacred an abandonment greatly facilitated by the Supreme Court is a heavy
                                        loss adding in a tone of angry despair Almost every value every virtue every symbol and every institution that was once taken as sacred not to be overthrown in practice has now been overthrown
                                        or is in question In 2010 he declared his opposition to Elena Kagans Supreme Court nomination bafflingly calling her admiration for Aharon Barak the distinguished former president of Israels Supreme Court disqualifying
                                        in and of itself Ms Kagan had described the Israeli judge internationally known for his human rights decisions as her judicial hero But to Judge Bork Justice Barak was the worst judge on the planet                                        He had an odd fixation about Justice Barak devoting a chapter of a 2003 book Coercing Virtue The Worldwide Rule of Judges to an attack on him and on the court he led The Israeli Supreme Court
                                        displayed an addiction to universal values that was subverting the Jewish character of the Israeli state Judge Bork complained Its tempting to suppose that only the bitterness of defeat drove a once cheerfully combative iconoclast to the apocalyptic rhetoric that defined his subsequent writing and speeches Perhaps he saw himself as
                                        the one who might have kept his finger in the dike holding back the inexorable tides of ever expanding notions of equality that he feared so deeply In fact his record suggests that the pre and postnomination
                                        Robert Bork were one and the same with the later version simply having lost the need for discretion So perhaps his defeat didnt so much change him as free him from inhibition When the Senate rejected his backwardlooking vision and instead embraced Anthony Kennedy who praised the Constitutions framers for having made a covenant with the future it was no tragedy
                                        for the country But it was for a man and its important to know the difference"
New York Is Moving Quickly to Enact Tough Curbs on Guns,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/nyregion/new-york-nears-gun-control-tightening-laws.html,New York State is nearing agreement on a proposal to put what would be some of the nations strictest guncontrol laws into effect including what Gov Andrew M Cuomo vowed on Wednesday would be an ironclad ban on assault weapons and largecapacity magazines and new measures to keep guns out of the hands of criminals and mentally ill people Lawmakers in Albany seeking to send a message to the nation that the recent mass shootings demand swift action say they hope to vote on the package of legislation as soon as next week The Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver a Manhattan Democrat told reporters on Wednesday that Mr Cuomo and legislative leaders were 95 percent of the way toward an agreement Senate Republicans considered the only possible obstacle to the governors proposal indicated they did not intend to block a deal When you hear about these issues all across the nation whether its in the movie theater in Aurora Colo or Columbine something needs to happen  something transformative said Senator Timothy M Kennedy a Democrat from Buffalo  The dash to enact new gun controls made New York the first flash point in the battles over firearm restrictions that are expected to consume several state capitals this year  But the debate also raged elsewhere on Wednesday from Denver where supporters of gun rights rallied to oppose weapon restrictions in the new legislative session to Connecticut whose governor Dannel P Malloy in an emotional speech to lawmakers  he lost his composure talking about the mass killings at a Newtown elementary school last month  said More guns are not the answer At the White House Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr met with guncontrol advocates and said the Obama administration planned both to pass legislation and to use executive orders to try to reduce gun violence The president and I are determined to take action Mr Biden said This is not an exercise in photo opportunities Mr Cuomos aides said the proposed legislation in New York would expand the definition of what is considered an assault weapon to match Californias law currently the most restrictive in the nation But the overall package would go further they said by limiting detachable ammunition magazines to 7 rounds from the current 10 and requiring background checks for purchases of ammunition not just weapons Limiting magazines to seven rounds would give New York the toughest restrictions in the nation Only around half a dozen states currently limit the size of magazines and most of them allow magazines that contain up to 10 rounds according to a survey by the Law Center to Prevent Gun Violence which advocates gun control The New York law would also close a loophole that has thwarted enforcement of limits on the size of magazines  Even as Mr Cuomo detailed his plans gunrights groups mobilized to oppose the new restrictions We fully expect that New York states gun owners will be completely engaged in this debate and NRA will be there to lead them said Chris W Cox the chief lobbyist for the National Rifle Association which has donated more money to state politicians in New York than anywhere else much of it to Senate Republicans And immediately afterward Budd Schroeder the chairman of the Shooters Committee on Political Education a New York gunrights group said he planned to meet with every state senator he knew to ask them to stand up to the governor The legislators are going to be getting a lot of phone calls in their district offices Mr Schroeder said How is taking away my rights to own any type of firearm I choose going to change the attitude of a criminal Yet Mr Schroeders group on its Web site acknowledged the challenging terrain We can say with certainty it warned that anything short of overwhelming our legislators with calls emails and letters we have virtually no chance Mr Cuomos initiative drew praise from Mayor Michael R Bloomberg who has made gun control his signature cause I was particularly struck by his passionate leadership on gun violence Mr Bloomberg said in a statement New York State has led the nation with strong commonsense gun laws and the governors new proposals will build on that tradition Mr Cuomo is a possible 2016 presidential contender who is seeking to elevate his stature among Democrats base nationally after a muchpraised victory on samesex marriage in his first year in office His push for enhanced gun control even drew praise from Cardinal Timothy M Dolan of New York in a letter that otherwise criticized Mr Cuomos support for abortion rights Mr Cuomo had already stirred up anxiety among gun rights groups by saying in a radio interview in December that confiscation could be an option for existing assault weapons But on Wednesday Mr Cuomo backed away from that statement This is not about taking away peoples guns he said in his State of the State address It is about ending the unnecessary risk of highcapacity assault rifles Thats what this is about The expectation from Senator Dean G Skelos the Republican leader and his aides that the guncontrol legislation would come to the Senate floor for a vote is significant Senate Republicans have consistently rebuffed efforts by Democrats to pass more restrictive gun laws  But Republicans now have partial control of the chamber because of a coalition they recently established to share power with a group of dissident Democrats who favor more gun control And Democrats believe that Republican leaders would rather accept a deal than jeopardize their warm relationship with Mr Cuomo or risk a public relations backlash Many Senate Republicans sought reelection in part by touting their bond with the governor who remains popular with Republican voters as well as with Democrats Mr Cuomo recognizing the extent of his political power has vowed to travel the state blaming Senate Republicans if they do not back his efforts for gun control The guncontrol debate had already flared up in other ways in New York State since the shootings last month in Newtown and in Webster NY where two firefighters were killed A newspapers publication of a map showing the names and addresses of gun owners in suburban Westchester and Rockland Counties set off a wave of threats against and harassment of the papers employees In his State of the State address Wednesday the governor told lawmakers it was their duty to stop the madness of violence  Forget the extremists  its simple Mr Cuomo said to a crescendo of applause No one hunts with an assault rifle No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer
Cuomo Calls for State to Return to Progressive Ideals,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/10/nyregion/cuomo-calls-for-the-state-to-return-to-its-progressive-ideals.html,ALBANY  Gov Andrew M Cuomo who spent his first two years in office establishing himself as a fiscal conservative turned left in his third annual address to the Legislature and sought to reclaim the states progressive mantle Mr Cuomo a Democrat had two emotional fulcrums in his sprawling 78minute address gun violence and Hurricane Sandy But most of the speech was devoted to an onslaught of proposals favored by the left wing of his party  He proposed increasing the minimum wage to 875 an hour from 725 an hour public financing of elections tougher greenhouse gas standards solar jobs programs a 1 billion affordable housing initiative grants for schools that extend school days and a 10point womens rights program that garnered loud applause for its provisions strengthening abortion rights laws and enacting equal pay legislation  We are a community based on progressive principles the governor said in a speech to several hundred lawmakers and guests at an auditorium in the Capitol complex We must remain that progressive capital of the nation How the state would pay for any new programs was not clear The governor is to introduce his budget this month but until Congress decides how much aid to send to New York to defray the costs of rebuilding after Hurricane Sandy the states financial picture will be clouded  The governor promised not to raise taxes He has made similar promises in the past but then agreed to support a new higher tax bracket for the states highest earners And he said he would continue to push for a referendum in November allowing an expansion of casino gambling describing casinos as vehicles for improving the upstate economy He said that at first he would allow as many as three fullscale casinos upstate and none in New York City in an effort to lure tourists to travel to economically struggling areas  Overall the speech served to reposition the governor who has faced criticism from the left wing of his party for paying too little attention to their concerns Liberals praised the governor in 2011 for persuading lawmakers to pass samesex marriage legislation But his first two years in office focused on a centrist fiscal policy that included a cap on property tax increases steep spending cuts and contentious negotiations with unions that resulted in a cut to the pension benefits of future state employees  Now Mr Cuomo who is considered at least in New York a presidential contender for 2016 is emphasizing proposals  some new and some he has suggested in the past  that cheer his Democratic base Progressive proposals by Mr Cuomo are also likely to face a more receptive audience in the Legislature this year because the Senate which had been controlled by Republicans is now controlled by a coalition that includes several Democrats as well as all of the Republicans The Assembly is controlled by Democrats  Few advocacy groups on the left found issues they could not applaud Environmental Advocates of New York said Mr Cuomo showed true leadership in his comments on climate change Andrea Miller president of Naral ProChoice New York said of his proposed womens initiatives He heard the call and is a true leader  Bob Master director of legislative action at the Communications Workers of America said To the extent hes using this speech to appeal to the liberal primary electorate doing something meaningful on public financing would be a big achievement  Republicans also saw the trend but bemoaned it Assemblyman Steve Katz a Hudson Valley Republican called the speech a sharp veer to the left offering big government solutions for all problems Even the cover of a 300page book that accompanied the speech was something of a kitchen sink  an odd tableau that superimposed a stark image of Breezy Point the Queens neighborhood devastated by Hurricane Sandy on the front lawn of the Capitol building with a new model of the Tappan Zee Bridge soaring overhead The governor gave some of his most impassioned remarks to date on guns a cause he has voiced support for in the past but has not made a legislative priority Mr Cuomos legislative agenda was clearly upended by the recent mass shooting in Newtown Conn and the killings of two firefighters in Webster NY End the madness now he said Wednesday  Forget the extremists  its simple the governor added to a burst of applause No one hunts with an assault rifle No one needs 10 bullets to kill a deer  The governor also continued to use Hurricane Sandy as a reason to talk about global warming  Climate change is real he said It is denial to say each of these situations is a onceinalifetime There is a 100year flood every two years now It is inarguable that the sea is warmer and there is a changing weather pattern and the time to act is now  Among his proposals were a bailout fund for homeowners who want to move out of floodprone regions and aid for building homes that can withstand floods  ideas that are contingent on how much federal aid comes through He also called for measures to better protect subways public utilities the fuel delivery system and New York Harbor  And he excoriated Washington for waiting so long to provide New York and New Jersey with federal storm aid  That is just too little and it is too late and it has nothing to do with the way Congress has acted in the past he said This has long been established that in the face of a disaster the national government comes in to help  Remember New York he added because New York will not forget I promise you

Faith and Fiction,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/books/review/faith-and-fiction.html,To the Editor Paul Elies essay Has Fiction Lost Its Faith Dec 23 mentions several American novelists myself excluded who he believes have tackled the issue of faith  even if somewhat timidly  in their work He ends with the following All the while you hope to find the writer who can dramatize belief the way it feels in your experience at once a fact on the ground and a sponsor of the uncanny an account of our predicament that still and all has the old power to persuade You look for a story or a novel where the writer puts it all together Well with all due respect to his assessment that there exists no such book I would like to bring to his attention my novel Mr Ives Christmas a Pulitzer finalist in 1996 In the opinion of many  clergy religious studies scholars and general readers alike  Mr Ives fits that description OSCAR HIJUELOSManhattan  To the Editor I read Paul Elies essay with interest as he is a graceful and thoughtful writer But I think he is missing out on a major  and perhaps unexpected  area of fiction today with spiritual concerns the crime novel Nowhere in contemporary fiction will you find a stronger expression of faith than in James Lee Burkes novels set in Louisiana and featuring the highly conflicted former alcoholic and regular churchgoer Dave Robicheaux I was Jims editor for 11 books and am well acquainted with the mindset of both author and protagonist Jim once told me that he considers all of his books to be religious allegories of a kind its just that the realm in which his hero battles the forces of evil tends to be corporations that pollute corrupt public officials and others of various religious and socioeconomic backgrounds whove sold their souls to contemporary incarnations of the Devil Conversely Robicheauxs wife is a socially aware exnun Activist priests also crop up in the plotlines Yet what gives the books dimension is that even some of the bad guys are waging internal battles and the lines between the white hats and the black hats are not always clearly drawn such is the moral muddle of the modern world I can think of many fine practitioners of the crime and suspense genre writing today whose heroes and heroines trudge on gambling that good will somehow triumph  or at least draw even  with the dark forces abroad in the land Its just a different way of grappling with spiritual and moral quandaries in a highly secular world I have a feeling that if Walker Percy and Flannery OConnor were alive today they might be reading Dennis Lehane James Lee Burke Henning Mankell Michael Connelly or any number of others PATRICIA MULCAHYJackson Heights Queens  To the Editor Paul Elie says hes searched in vain for contemporary American literature that deals with questions of religious belief He may be looking in the wrong places Many science fiction and fantasy writers of the last few decades have explored the topic in books set in our own world and time as well as in imagined ones To name only a few Gene Wolfes multivolume Book of the New Sun John Crowleys Aegypt sequence retitled The Solitudes Mary Doria Russells Sparrow and Children of God James Blishs Case of Conscience Walter M Miller Jrs Canticle for Leibowitz Elizabeth Moons Speed of Dark ELIZABETH HANDLincolnville Me  To the Editor My friend Paul Elie argues eloquently that Christianity has become something between a dead language and a hangover in American literature I would note a possible exception in the stories and novels of David Foster Wallace A churchgoer trained in philosophy Wallace deplored the thematic poverty of contemporary fiction its inability to speak of faith and doubt yet his own characters do a lot of praying a young evangelical couple pray over whether to have an abortion a rape victim prays for her attacker two wouldbe adulterers pray to be delivered from temptation etc Even more often Wallace shows us what it could mean for a Christian not to be able to pray So many of his characters feel convinced of their own depravity or else are trapped in solipsism that looks like the sin of pride Wallace once described the men in Brief Interviews With Hideous Men as souls in need of grace who dont even know it That there are very few church services and a lot of church basements in Wallaces work may help prove Elies point Instead of writing about religion as such Wallace described moreorless secular institutions  Alcoholics Anonymous the IRS a halfway house  when he wanted to show people in communion with something larger than themselves But for this reader at least the religious impulse is hard to miss LORIN STEINManhattanThe writer is editor of The Paris Review  To the Editor Paul Elie provides the answer to his own question when he writes about how hard it is to make belief believable Unfortunately faith is by definition makebelieve I sometimes wish it were not so particularly at this time of the year when we are immersed in such beautiful stories of the advent of the Christian religion Nonetheless faith in a deity is becoming irrelevant as more people recognize it as magical thinking That should not preclude it as a subject for fiction but it may relegate it to the genre of fantasy JIM LANGEThornton Pa  To the Editor Concerning Paul Elies observation that half a century after Flannery OConnor Walker Percy Reynolds Price and John Updike presented themselves as novelists with what OConnor called Christian convictions their wouldbe successors are thin on the ground All one can say is Thank God ANDY DAVISManhattan
"His Job Safe, Strausâ€™s Next Challenge Is the G.O.P.",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/us/with-his-speakership-safe-strauss-next-challenge-is-gop.html,With the latest threat to his leadership easily dispatched the speaker of the House Joe Straus Republican of San Antonio has proved once again that he can hold onto the third most powerful post in state government despite a vocal contingent of critics in his partys conservative wing But as he heads into the states 83rd legislative session he faces what may be a greater challenge  tackling issues that have been thorny for Republicans in the past including public education and plans for water and transportation infrastructure without alienating the far right In a recent interview in his Capitol office Mr Straus said that addressing those basic needs was essential not just for the state but also for the Republican Party He said that if the party did not seek to attract anyone beyond its traditional primary voters it would have to face the possibility that its statewide dominance could come to an end Im somebody who wants to build the party to see the Republican Party grow and not just be satisfied because you got 50 percent plus one he said  On Tuesday during his acceptance speech for the speakers chair he called on lawmakers from both parties to work together to make what he called the core responsibilities of government a priority He said the states biggest challenges were not fiscal in nature pointing to Texas rapidly growing population and changing demographics with increasing numbers of children in public schools who have limited English skills and economically disadvantaged backgrounds  The remark contrasted with Gov Rick Perrys speech that day which focused heavily on the need to keep spending down But Mr Straus has stopped short of saying whether any of the 54 billion sliced from public schools during the last legislative session should be restored  a position that would put him directly at odds with the governor who said recently that the states financing for public education has been pretty phenomenal Mr Strauss political resilience so far is in part because of the makeup of his district which includes the affluent Alamo Heights neighborhood His constituents while conservative tend toward mainstream Republicanism He has also learned to wield the power of his position while earning a reputation among his House colleagues as a largely fair and reasonable leader  But that has not prevented his facing the indignation of conservative grassroots activists whose opposition presents a serious roadblock to statewide primary candidates They have targeted him since he came to power in 2009 by defeating Tom Craddick of Midland the current dean of the House who was the first Republican to lead the lower chamber in more than a century This session Mr Straus faced a challenge to his speakership from David Simpson a Republican of Longview who is just beginning his second term It was the latest in a series of attempts to undercut Mr Straus from the right that included a May primary opponent backed by FreedomWorks the deeppocketed national Tea Party organization Mr Simpson the second candidate to vie for the spot in advance of the 2013 session withdrew his bid on the first day Michael Quinn Sullivan the president of Empower Texans a conservative group active in state politics that opposes Mr Straus attributed the speakers staying power to the insidebaseball dynamics of the speakership which he said meant candidates were responsible to other lawmakers rather than to the electorate The antagonism some of the Republican Party faithful feel toward Mr Straus was apparent in June at the biennial state Republican convention of roughly 10000 people in Fort Worth Â the same gathering at which he drew jeers in 2010 Stickers bearing his likeness with the slogan Oust Straus provided by several regional Tea Party organizations were worn on numerous lapels and blouses in the convention hall  Its a question of his record and until now he and his leadership team as often as not have been obstacles to reform Mr Sullivan said  The causes of their lack of affection can be difficult to pin down During a challenge to Mr Strauss speakership ahead of the 2011 legislative session party activists circulated emails emphasizing the Christian faith of his opponents But the same theme did not emerge during the latest bid to unseat Mr Straus who is Jewish Before this session his critics instead accused him of obstructing pet legislation for conservatives  like stricter immigration laws  and they questioned his commitment to issues like reducing government spending and ending abortion But those attacks struggled to gain traction  Under Mr Strauss leadership in the last session the lower chamber passed a longstruggling voter ID bill an abortion sonogram law and an austere budget that drastically cut financing for public education  Mr Straus said he was aware of his detractors who he said were the same people who say no to everything There are some ugly voices out there Mr Straus said and there are some people around the state who seem to have made a very small cottage industry out of opposing me but they havent gotten very far While many of those voices are on the right Mr Straus also has some opponents on the left Representative Trey Martinez Fischer a San Antonio Democrat who has supported Mr Straus in the past has become a loud critic Mr Martinez Fischer said he wanted to give the speaker the benefit of the doubt on his plans to rise above partisan battles to take on major state needs but that it was difficult after the 2011 session when he led a bitterly divided chamber that passed major budget cuts to government services It appears to me that Joe Straus is going to spend a lot of time looking over his shoulder Mr Martinez Fischer said There is a lot of extreme conservative ideology surrounding this Capitol and it appears for now Joe wants to be the adult in the room I dont know how long that will last Now a seasoned leader with a robust campaign war chest Mr Straus should have ample possibilities for his next political act But what is next for him may instead be a waiting game  Â and could depend on whether he can outlast conservative activists control of the state Republican Party For now Mr Straus is careful to keep the exact nature of his future ambitions obscure and he said he remained committed to his current position  Im one who does believe that doing the best job you can do in the job you are elected to do is the best way to have options down the road he said
Influential Womenâ€™s â€˜PACâ€™ to Back Council Speaker in Her Bid for Mayor,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/nyregion/christine-c-quinn-council-speaker-to-be-endorsed-by-emilys-list.html,The New York City Council speaker Christine C Quinn who is seeking to rally female voters in her quest to be mayor will pick up an endorsement on Friday from Emilys List the influential national political action committee that backs Democratic women Emilys List seldom becomes involved in local elections and has never made an endorsement before in a mayoral race in New York City The groups membership has grown over the past two years to almost 24 million  including almost 50000 in the city  from 400000 But the support underscores efforts by Ms Quinns campaign to highlight her gender in a crowded Democratic primary field and to convince female voters that her election would make history A woman has never been elected mayor of New York Jen Bluestein communications director of Emilys List said We have an enormous membership that is totally committed to womens leadership has achieved incredible results in 2012 and is looking for the next opportunity  Electing a young woman mayor of the largest city in America is a huge next step she added Ms Quinn faces strong primary opponents including Bill de Blasio the public advocate and William C Thompson a former comptroller and the 2009 Democratic nominee for mayor both of whom have enjoyed support among liberal groups and backing from prominent female leaders  While at least one early poll suggested that Ms Quinn was leading among women four to one it is not clear whether she can maintain such a lead as all of the candidates become better known Women typically make up a majority of Democratic primary voters in New York Quinn has to establish a gender gap said Bruce Gyory a political consultant and adjunct professor of political science at the University of Albany Mr Gyory suggested that it would be difficult based on the history of female candidates in Democratic primaries in New York Geraldine A Ferraro in two Senate campaigns Carol Bellamy in the 1985 mayoral primary and Kathleen Rice in the 2010 primary for state attorney general all failed to attract a significant enough edge among female voters to prevail He could cite only two examples of women who had ridden to victory in primaries on outsize support from female voters Mary Anne Krupsak in the 1974 Democratic primary for lieutenant governor and Ms Bellamy in the 1977 primary for president of the New York City Council the equivalent of todays public advocate Historically Mr Gyory said New York City voters typically choose a mayoral candidate based on factors like geography religion race or socioeconomic status rather than gender  Black woman have generally voted more as black voters than as women voters  similarly with Hispanic women and Jewish women and white Catholic women he said Ms Quinn said in an interview Thursday that she believed her record in the City Council of passing ontime balanced budgets preventing teacher layoffs and ensuring womens access to abortion and emergency contraception would be something that all New Yorkers are going to respond to I think all New Yorkers want to make sure that we have as prochoice and prowomen a city as we can she said As for whether people would vote for her on the basis of her gender she demurred I think people are going to vote for the candidate who has the most experience been the most effective and has the best vision for the city she said Ruth Messinger who was the Democratic nominee for mayor in 1997 and who has not endorsed a candidate in this years race said she did not think that many New York City voters voted on the basis of gender Reflecting on her own mayoral campaign she said Somebody once told me during the campaign You dont need to campaign specifically with or to women because thats the one thing people can obviously see about you People are more interested in where did you grow up what legislation did you work on in the City Council Those are all things people have to hear from you to understand What your gender is they can see from looking at youÂ  Ms Bluestein of Emilys List said the group had not determined what steps it would take to support Ms Quinn When Emilys List endorsed Grace Meng last year in her campaign for Congress in Queens it sent out direct mail and paid for online advertising
Girls,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/books/review/she-matters-by-susanna-sonnenberg.html,This memoir of female friendships inspired a parlor game I suspect many readers will want to play  musing about the friends who shaped our own lives The first best friend the one to whom you clung and whispered all your secrets and then outgrew The bigsister friend who married before you had children before you and showed you her way of navigating those passages The friend who let you down who vanished during a crisis and the one who stayed by your side The friend you wronged without understanding how The friend you simply had fun with and the one you called when you were in despair Susanna Sonnenberg captures the fervor of these friendships their dark undercurrents as well as their sustaining generosity As much as we cherish the men in our lives we need women to confide in to vent to and to fashion ourselves after For Sonnenberg these friendships provide ways to try on and discard identities they also provide the lenses through which she views herself and comes to understand love loyalty and betrayal She always had the balm gave me a glad heart she writes of Patricia the friend who opens the memoir and is one of its most appealing characters It is telling that Sonnenberg begins with a mature friendship one that has withstood time distance and flashes of quiet estrangement Most movingly she recalls a moment of confession when she and her new husband had decided to terminate an unwanted pregnancy and Patricia who had been trying to conceive blurted out Dont do it The fluctuating bond with Patricia frames the memoir which moves through the friends who populated Sonnenbergs childhood and adolescence as well as those who have left their mark on her adult selves as writer mother and wife For some women female friends are their first and most steadfast allies but Sonnenberg has to learn to trust them Her previous book Her Last Death described the toxic relationship with her manipulative mother from whom she is now estranged She Matters explores the friendships that slowly helped convince Sonnenberg that women could give as well as take soothe as well as abuse Her traumatic childhood left her lunging after closeness and sometimes suffocating those who preferred to drift toward intimacy She acknowledges she is not good at allowing emotional privacy Not everything Susanna has to be discussed dissected investigated she admonishes herself recounting one of the lessons she learned after a few friendships foundered when she pushed too hard too fast She sought friends to repair wounds and recalls how she searched for surrogate mother figures There was Abigail the proctor in her boarding school who treated her with cheerful but emotionally distant kindness There was Annabelle the glamorous married neighbor who embraced her but whose absorption in motherhood puzzled and alienated the young Susanna Later there was a massage therapist she had been using as a confessor but did not want to take on as a friend I courted mothers but I had to pay them Sonnenbergs father and mother divorced when she was quite young and he is remembered as a remote intimidating and withholding figure Susanna tried to befriend some of the invariably attractive assistants at the literary magazine he ran One of the most touching encounters is with Marlene her fathers former girlfriend who sought her out after he died and bestowed on her a lasting gift reassurance that her father had been proud of her As it does for many women having children provided Sonnenberg with a way to repair childhood wounds But she also writes viscerally about the consuming nature of motherhood including the fiercely protective love and the relentless demands In the land of Cheerios dirty diapers fleeting naps and interrupted sleep other mothers are a lifeline Our husbands were undone from us phantoms of some former interest Sonnenberg writes I had nothing to say to men Men I could barely fathom their use now that wed made children Yet many of these friendships at least in Sonnenbergs case seem to falter as the intensity of young motherhood ebbs new mothers are bonded in survival but may not have enough in common besides their children That is not always the case of course friends who have watched your children grow can become a kind of extended family one that encompasses the men as well as the women The passions of motherhood also underpin one of the darkest tales in the book about a college roommate who is far more fragile than Sonnenberg realizes As her friend Rachel grows more anxious and then destructively obsessive after the birth of her child Sonnenberg commits the unforgivable sin she tells Rachel she is a bad mother Sonnenberg is brave to tell this story and contrite since it shows her at her judgmental and selfabsorbed worst She comes to understand that part of her attraction to her friend was her passivity Rachel she writes ruefully did not fight me for the spotlight But for all the pain and flaws she exposes her book is redemptive too Sonnenberg describes one friend who is able to help her bury the longfestering anger at her husband for the abortion early in their marriage Another helps her bear the onslaught of grief when her father dies This book is explicitly a memoir of female friendships a choice that inevitably narrows the frame even as it so richly explores a central facet of womens lives There was just one chapter that touched on a friendship between couples  friendships that in my own life have been anchors in good times and bad Only when the couple splits up does her friendship deepen with the wife Sonnenberg works first to support her friend and then in an important transition to accept support in turn There is one more gift to give a friend her husband tells her You can let her care for you Sonnenberg also touches elliptically on a troubled time in her marriage but only as it is reflected in a friends reassurance when Sonnenberg had a brief affair There is much to admire in this book  its imaginative narrative structure its arresting prose its raw honesty  but some of it is exasperating too I wish it had been edited more tightly with fewer friends each one standing more precisely for a turn in Sonnenbergs life or a moment of revelation At times the writing grows a bit fevered particularly in the last chapter or two And because Sonnenberg does not spare herself there are places where she comes off as narcissistic  a risk in any memoir Yet Sonnenberg demonstrates a selfawareness that is clearly hardearned one of the many qualities she has absorbed from her eclectic and generous friends In the end that determination to learn from the women who are close to her to investigate where she failed and where they did is what gives the book such resonance She Matters lingers with you inviting you to construct a patchwork quilt of your own life and salute the many women who helped you along the way
Republican Says Akin Was â€˜Partially Rightâ€™ About Rape,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/republican-says-akin-was-partially-right-about-rape/,"Two months after the incendiary issues of rape and abortion helped defeat two Republican Senate candidates a veteran House Republican from Georgia reopened the subjects on Friday telling a group in suburban Atlanta
                                        that the former Republican senatorial candidate Todd Akin                                        of Missouri was partially right when he said that women do not become pregnant when raped The lawmaker Representative Phil Gingrey an obstetrician and gynecologist told the Cobb County Chamber of Commerce that neither Mr Akin who lost his Senate bid to Senator Claire McCaskill nor Indiana State Treasurer
                                        Richard Mourdock who lost to

                                        had been treated fairly in the wake of their rape comments according to The Marietta Daily News Ive delivered lots of babies and I know about these things MrÂ Gingrey said according to the paper It is true We tell infertile couples all the time that are having trouble
                                        conceiving because of the woman not ovulating Just relax Drink a glass of wine And dont be so tense and uptight because all that adrenaline can cause you not to ovulate So he was partially
                                        right wasnt he He went on But the fact that a woman may have already ovulated 12 hours before she is raped youre not going to prevent a pregnancy there by a womans body shutting anything down because the
                                        horse has already left the barn so to speak And yet the media took that and tore it apart  He also justified Mr Akins distinction between legitimate rape  which Mr Akin had said womens reproductive systems can defend against  and other unspecified sexual acts
                                        that can lead to pregnancy Mr Akin he said was asked by a local news source about rape and he said Look in a legitimate rape situation  and what he meant by legitimate rape was just look someone can say I

"Guns, Abortion and Mistrust",https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/11/guns-abortion-and-mistrust/,"Before his closeddoor meeting with guncontrol advocates on Wednesday Vice President Joe Biden chatted briefly with reporters
                                        What he told them incensed rightwing news sources The Drudge Report splashed headshots of Hitler and StalinÂ The ExaminerÂ 
                                        ran a story claiming that President Obama would ban guns and act like a dictator by taking legally owned firearms from nonviolent Americans What Mr Biden actually told reporters was The president is going to act There are executive orders executive action that can be taken We havent decided what that is yet but were compiling
                                        it all He made no mention of bans or confiscation which the White Houseanywaycould not accomplish through executive order even if it wanted to Operating without Congressional approval President Obama could
                                        appoint a new ATF director or require federal agencies to report mental health records but he could not enact an assault weapons ban let alone an outright ban
                                         The distance between what Mr Biden said and what The Examiner reported gets at why its so difficult to conduct a national conversation on the regulation of firearms If
                                        the guncontrol camp mentions restrictions the antiguncontrol camp hears bans If the former mentions a ban on certain kinds of guns the latter hears all guns plus confiscation Many gunrights activists moreover seem to suspect that the other side argues in bad faith In public guncontrol advocates may sound reasonable proposing only limited regulations but what they really                                        want is to repeal the Second Amendment or to overturn Heller and force the complete disarmament of the civilian population First theyll come for our Bushmasters then theyll come for
                                        our hunting rifles The fear that restrictions are a Trojan horse the prelude to outright prohibition similarly animates the staunch defenders of another controversial right Abortion Writing in Slate in 2006 during Samuel Alitos confirmation hearings the legal academic Dawn Johnsen
                                        argued that Senators asking whether he would overturn Roe were missing the point He would more likely hollow it out Ms Johnsen suggested that Roe opponents have taken an incremental
                                        approach to eviscerating abortion rights Theyve pushed for restrictions such as waiting periods and informed consent laws restrictions designed to sound reasonable while also limiting
                                        the number of abortions performed ultimately as completely as would a criminal ban Last December Michigan Gov Rick Snyder signed an abortion bill requiring doctors to screen
                                        women for coercion among other measures Supporters claimed the bill was necessary to safeguard womens health opponents said it was a paternalistic assault on womens rights The same argument
                                        played out in Kansas in 2011 when the state set compulsory standards for abortion clinics Supporters claimed the regulations were an effort to protect women from unsafe conditions opponents said they were a ruse
                                        to curb reproductive freedom  The Supreme Court has ruled that the freedom to own a gun and the freedom to have an abortion are both rightsyet the most vehement gun and abortionsupporters worry that Heller and
                                        Roe do not provide adequate protectionÂ Thats in part because these decisions are vulnerable to similar legal attacks Judge J Harvie Wilkinson III of the Fourth Circuit a conservative encapsulated the case against Heller when he wrote that the majority read
                                        an ambiguous constitutional provision as creating a substantive right that the Court had never acknowledged in the more than two hundred years since the amendments enactment The majority then used that
                                        same right to strike down a law passed by elected officials acting rightly or wrongly to preserve the safety of the citizenry In his Roe dissent Justice Byron R White wrote The Court simply fashions and announces a new constitutional right for pregnant women and with scarcely any reason or authority for its action invests
                                        that right with sufficient substance to override most existing state abortion statutes These arguments amount to the same accusation an overactive Supreme Court invented rights where none existed and put itself above elected representatives Both gunrights and abortionrights supporters then have
                                        to contend with an opposition that does not even believe that these precious rights are rightsno matter what a majority of Justices had to say  Judging from polls a majority of Americans support gun and abortion rights but also support greater restrictions on those rights Gallup has found that 52 percent
                                        of Americans think abortion should be legal under certain circumstances 69 percent favor 24hour waiting periods and 64 percent favor a law that would make it illegal to perform a partial birth abortion
                                        except in cases necessary to save the life of the mother On guns CNN found that 96 percent favor background
                                        checks while roughly 60 percent support bans on the sale or possession of semiautomatic weapons and highcapacity ammunition clips Fear and mistrust in both the gun and abortion debates inhibit sane level conversation and impede what moderates might consider reasonable regulations In some alternate universe where gunrights advocates believed
                                        their basic entitlements were secure and that DC would never enact a general ban maybe the National Rifle Association would not have so much power In which case maybe it would not be so difficult to prohibit
                                        the sale of highcapacity magazines or to mandate waiting periods And if choice advocates believed the same maybe they would not fight limits on lateterm abortions or object to waiting periods  If related anxieties pervade and frustrate the gun and abortion debates it does not follow that these anxieties are equally realistic Are the gunrights activists just paranoid or are they onto something What about
                                        the abortionrights activists Im prochoice and I favor guncontrol Perhaps for that reason it seems to me that choice supporters concerns are more warranted They have more to fear than fear
                                        itself
                                     Granted even extremeseeming gunrights activists arent totally delusional There really are people who would abolish the right to bear arms if they could After Newtown Kurt Eichenwald                                        argued in Vanity Fair that we should repeal the Second Amendment On Twitter the MSNBC host Ed Schultz asked why should anyone own an assault rifle and suggested that the confiscation of
                                        these types of weapons will have an impact But keep in mind that Mr Eichenwald and Mr Schultz are journalists Politicians with actual power who support guncontrol go out of their way to emphasize that they want regulation not the end to legal ownership
                                        In his state of the state address New Yorks Gov Andrew Cuomo vowed to enact the toughest gun assault weapon ban in the nationand noted that hes a gun owner By contrast theres no shortage of prominent politicians who say they would vote to end legal abortion Consider Mitt Romneys runningmate Representative Paul Ryan In 2010 Mr Ryan told the Weekly
                                        Standard Im as prolife as a person gets In 2011 he cosponsored the Sanctity of Human Life Act which stated that the life of each human being begins with fertilization cloning
                                        or its functional equivalent at which time every human being shall have all the legal and constitutional attributes and privileges of personhood The Republican party platform is unambiguously
                                        antichoice It specifies that the unborn child has a fundamental individual right to life which cannot be infringed  Abortionrights advocates have more cause for concern than gunrights advocates Still the fact remains that both groups oppose restrictions that a majority of Americans would apparently find                                        acceptable Both groups turn debates that might focus on specific regulations into outandout arguments
                                        about essential rights riling up everyone and settling nothing It might help matters if activists didnt treat every skirmish as if it would decide the war Of course for that to happen guncontrol supporters would have to find a way to reassure the gunrights camp that
                                        basic ownership privileges are not at issue And moderates who believe in betterregulating abortion without actually prohibiting it would have to enter the fray mitigating antichoice absolutism"
"As Texas Bakes in a Long Drought, Water Becomes a Focus for Legislators",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/us/texas-drought-pushes-lawmakers-to-focus-on-water-in-new-session.html,AUSTIN Tex  There is usually no shortage of controversial and politically divisive issues for lawmakers to address in the opening days of a state legislative session from abortion to immigration to gun rights  But throughout the opening of the 83rd Texas Legislature last week one of the most frequently discussed topics had bipartisan support improving the states water infrastructure as the population booms and a devastating twoyear drought drags on Lt Gov David Dewhurst and other Republicans proposed tapping an emergency fund that is fed by taxes on oil production to finance the building of new reservoirs and other projects identified in the states 50year water plan an unusual move in a state where fiscal conservatives usually push to streamline government and limit spending Gov Rick Perry a Republican and the House speaker Joe Straus III a Republican from San Antonio both mentioned the states water needs in their openingday speeches to legislators on Tuesday despite the rainfall that soaked Austin as they spoke In 2011 the last time the Legislature convened for one of its biennial sessions Representative Allan Ritter a Republican and the chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee was unsuccessful in getting lawmakers to approve legislation imposing an annual fee on water users like homeowners and businesses to help finance projects in the state water plan But on Thursday Mr Ritter proposed bills that would draw 2 billion from the states emergency Rainy Day Fund to establish a water infrastructure bank that would lend money for the projects This time his proposals received support from Republican leaders and groups that are often on the opposite sides of issues including the Sierra Clubs Texas chapter the Texas Association of Business and other industry groups At least 20 percent of the money available in the fund would be used for conservation and reuse efforts There were people who were trying to talk about water last time and there wasnt any money and there wasnt the critical mass said James Henson the director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas Austin Elite opinion begins to coalesce after a little while and it takes people a while to get the issue out there and I think thats part of whats happened with water Another reason for the shift and why some are calling this Legislature the water session has to do with the sense of urgency over the drought Texas is in the grip of a recordbreaking drought that began in the fall of 2010 and continues to affect many parts of the state So far it is the thirdworst drought in Texas since at least 1895 when statewide weather records begin with the multiyear drought in the 1950s being the worst said John NielsenGammon the state climatologist The drought has cost farmers billions of dollars and has forced hundreds of communities to limit water usage Eighteen public water systems were projected to run out of water in 180 days or fewer as of Tuesday according to the Texas Commission on Environmental Quality which monitors and assists those systems  Meanwhile the levels of many lakes and reservoirs a crucial part of the water supply have steadily decreased with the lack of rainfall  Without additional water supplies Texas will be short 83 million acrefeet of water by 2060 according to the Texas Water Development Board It is a nearly unimaginable amount one million gallons of water equals just 307 acrefeet The board also estimates that failure to meet water needs in times of drought in 2060 could cost Texas businesses and workers up to 116 billion But advocates for other causes worry that water may overshadow the states other needs and divert attention from restoring the money to social services parks education and other programs that was cut during the last legislative session Thousands of state employees were laid off School districts have reported eliminating thousands of jobs increasing class sizes and reducing library services and other programs In 2011 when education advocates and Democratic lawmakers called on Mr Perry and other Republicans to tap the Rainy Day Fund to offset some of the cuts to education the governor and others refused saying that doing so would leave the state ill prepared for emergencies  But last week some of those same leaders including Republicans who opposed tapping the fund two years ago for recurring expenses said they would support using the fund to pay for water projects through Mr Ritters bills or other proposals  I think its all ideological said Bob Sanborn the president of Children at Risk a nonprofit research and advocacy group in Houston  In the end people dont really have strong principles about a rainyday fund he said They want to fund the things that they want to fund And if something is seemingly not part of your ideology and public education doesnt seem to be of high concern to a lot of our Texas leaders it falls by the wayside Mr Ritter said there were several priorities for lawmakers to focus on but that water was a building block of society Im not saying this is a higher priority than education Mr Ritter said Weve got to have a great education system but weve got to have water to nourish our people and our economy What comes first the chicken or the egg Do we have educated people and then water comes Or do we have water and have a reason for people to be here to go to school
Democrats Behaving Badly,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/13/opinion/sunday/bruni-democrats-behaving-badly.html,FOR the textbook definition of not knowing enough to quit while youre ahead please turn your attention to Harry Reid he of the scabrous tongue and rotten temper a boxer in his youth and a pugilist to this day throwing mud along with punches and invariably soiling himself Reid the Democratic majority leader in the Senate couldnt just stand back and relish the recent spectacle of House Republicans making callous fools of themselves by stalling aid to communities walloped by Hurricane Sandy He wasnt satisfied that these Republicans were vilified not only in the news media but also by some members of their own tribe like Peter King and Chris Christie No he had to get into the ring himself and his genius strategy once there was to pit one storms victims against anothers to stage a bout between Atlantic Citys splintered boardwalks and Louisianas failed levees What a titan of meteorological tact  Noting that Congress had provided help after Hurricane Katrina more quickly and generously than after Sandy Reid said The people of New Orleans and that area they were hurt but nothing in comparison to what happened to the people in New York and New Jersey Almost one million people have lost their homes One million people lost their homes That is homes that is not people in those homes Lets put aside for the moment his fleeting difficulty distinguishing a biped with a weak spot for reality TV from a wood brick or maybe stucco structure in which several bipeds watch TV Lets focus instead on his math The one million figure is easily more than twice the combined tally of domiciles not only destroyed but also damaged in New York New Jersey and Connecticut Its an invention And if comparisons are to be made consider this one as a result of Katrina 1833 people died  more than nine times as many as died in connection with Sandy Using the word nothing anywhere in the vicinity of Katrina defies both belief and decency and Reid was indeed forced last week to apologize his effort to shame his Republican foes having brought a full measure of shame to his own doorstep yet again Why did he make the effort in the first place Democrats came out of the 2012 elections looking good and the countrys changing demographics suggest that they could come out of 2016 and beyond looking even better especially if Republicans dont accomplish a pretty thorough image overhaul And that overhaul isnt exactly proceeding at a breakneck pace The perseverance of farright obstructionists in the House stands in the way leaving the party in grave trouble If its foes were smart and humble theyd do what a sports team with a big lead does Theyd play errorfree ball Not Reid And not President Obama whose recent actions have been careless at best and cavalier at worst There was the gratuitously provocative nomination of Chuck Hagel for defense secretary followed by the gratuitously insulting invitation of Louie Giglio a Georgia pastor to give the inaugural benediction That plan was abandoned after the revelation of Giglios past remarks that homosexuality offends God that homosexuals yearn to take over society and that a conversion to heterosexuality is the only answer for them Giglio would have been the second florid homophobe in a row to stand with Obama and a Bible in front of the Capitol  Rick Warren in January 2009 was the first  and while it appears that this double bigotry whammy wasnt the administrations intent its an example of vetting so epically sloppy that it gives an observer serious pause about the delicacy with which Obama and his allies no longer worried about his reelection are operating The pick of Hagel underscores that indelicacy Theres a potent case to be made for his installation as secretary of defense but there are potent cases for others and its hard to believe that Obama couldnt have found someone who shared his values and would further his agenda but wouldnt be such a guaranteed lightning rod for his Jewish LGBT and female supporters all of whom played crucial roles in his November victory Regarding women Hagels record on reproductive freedom is as conservative as his record on gay rights and it included his support for a ban on abortions in military hospitals even for servicewomen prepared to pay for the procedures themselves Whats more Obama rolled Hagel out in a cluster of other highprofile nominees John Brennan Jack Lew John Kerry sure to be noted for their gender uniformity and to rekindle questions about the predominantly male club of advisers and golf and basketball partners who have the presidents ear The upset was predictable and avoidable It has been noted rightly that the president put two additional women on the Supreme Court and that his percentage of female appointees is as good as President Bill Clintons was But given the march of time since then and given the questions raised during his first term about how valued women in the administration felt and given his drumbeat that he was a champion for women in a way Mitt Romney could never be shouldnt he be surpassing Clinton Going out of his way Theres a perverse streak of defiance in him and as donors and even Democratic lawmakers have long complained gratitude isnt his strong suit While Hagel lurched toward his confirmation hearings and Giglio skittered away the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee announced that it was sending each of the 35 Republican freshmen in the House a tea party membership card which spelled out their rights to put ideology over solutions to be horrid to women to coddle Big Oil and to create andor ignore any national crisis Thus did the Dems turn legitimate gripes into schoolyard taunts that were more likely to inflame GOP freshmen than to bully them into bipartisanship What beyond the theater of the gesture was the point of it Granted Republicans had done their own adolescent taunting calling Democrats lap dogs in the Nancy Pelosi obedience school But Democrats pride and market themselves as the reasonable adults in the equation and thats part of their currency with many voters Why fritter it away  And why abide the overwrought antics of Reid He once compared opponents of Obamas health care reform to enemies of emancipation He took valid questions about Romneys low tax bill and spun them into the unsubstantiated claim that Romney hadnt paid any taxes for an entire 10year period Then he said the burden was on Romney to prove the charge untrue Good thing our criminal courts dont work that way Just before and after the 2012 election it looked as if Republicans might be successfully burying themselves All Democrats had to do was hammer the nail in the coffin But the way theyre behaving theyll raise the dead
Hagel to Meet Schumer to Discuss Policy Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/us/politics/schumer-to-meet-with-hagel-over-policy-issues.html,WASHINGTON  In what could be a crucial moment in the Obama administrations efforts to advance the nomination of former Senator Chuck Hagel as secretary of defense he will meet this week with Senator Charles E Schumer the most influential Jewish member of the Senate who is expected to press Mr Hagel on issues concerning Iran and Israel  Mr Schumer Democrat of New York will be among the first senators to meet with Mr Hagel since his nomination last week Mr Schumer has told aides and other senators that he could be persuaded to support Mr Hagel depending on the meetings outcome Mr Hagels nomination has been met with suspicion and even outright hostility among Republicans and Democrats who are strongly aligned with Jewish groups  Mr Schumer plans to ask Mr Hagel to clarify and in some ways recant statements about Iran and Israel according to a person with knowledge of the senators plans for the meeting Mr Schumer also intends to press Mr Hagel about conservative views he has expressed on gay rights and abortion Other Democrats are likely to take their cues about the nomination from Mr Schumer who is the No 3 Democrat in the Senate and has strong ties to proIsrael groups  Of deepest concern to Mr Schumer reflecting the anxiety of many Israel advocacy groups are Mr Hagels positions on the nuclear threat posed by Iran according to the person with knowledge of the senators plans Mr Hagel has said a military strike against Iran would be counterproductive But Mr Hagel got a resounding vote of support on Sunday from a fellow Republican moderate Colin L Powell the former secretary of state who said on the NBC News program Meet the Press that Mr Hagel was superbly qualified First I think hes had a very very distinguished public service record that he can stand on Mr Powell said There are a lot of comments about different things he said over the years and I think hell have a chance to respond to all those comments at the confirmation hearings  Another Republican Senator Bob Corker of Tennessee said on the ABC News program This Week that he had questions about Mr Hagels overall temperament  Mr Schumer is also suspicious of comments by Mr Hagel that seem to support a strategy of containment in which the United States would accept Irans development of a nuclear weapon while seeking to prevent a nuclear arms race in the Middle East Mr Hagel might need to fully reject that strategy in order to bring his position in line with President Obamas and Mr Schumers During his race against Mitt Romney last year Mr Obama took a more forceful position against Iran  As a senator from Nebraska Mr Hagel voted against several rounds of sanctions against Iran that ultimately passed the Senate Mr Hagel has said unilateral sanctions are ineffective a position that is out of step with the Obama administrations thinking But in recent weeks Mr Hagel has sounded more hawkish about Iran in meetings with administration officials Mr Hagels views on the militant Islamist groups Hezbollah and Hamas have also become issues He was among only a handful of senators who declined to sign a letter to the European Union calling for the designation of Hezbollah as a terrorist organization  Mr Hagel has since said he does not believe in sending letters to foreign governments He has also supported direct negotiations between the United States and Hamas which governs Gaza Mr Schumer will seek reassurances that Mr Hagel now considers Hezbollah and Hamas to be terrorist groups the person familiar with his plans said Mr Schumer is also expected to ask Mr Hagel about his disparaging statements about gay people  remarks he has since apologized for  and his views on abortion particularly his opposition to allowing abortions for women in the military who have been raped a position that has upset some Democratic women in the Senate Although Mr Schumer said Mr Obama should have discretion over appointments to his cabinet people close to the senator said his concerns would need to be put to rest before he would support Mr Hagels nomination  Jewish groups that have met with Mr Schumer have expressed reservations about openly opposing Mr Hagels nomination for fear of inflaming their tensions with the Obama administration and deepening difficulties between the United States and Israel Further it would be a major break with the Obama administration for Mr Schumer to oppose him On Sunday Mr Hagel continued to draw criticism from conservatives who share Mr Schumers worries about Israel and Iran and have lingering concerns about Mr Hagels criticisms of the Bush administrations execution of the Iraq war Senator John McCain of Arizona said on Face the Nation that Mr Hagels early opposition to the troop surge in Iraq was bizarre Mr McCain is the ranking Republican on the Armed Services Committee which will conduct Mr Hagels confirmation hearing

newspapers publish DUI arrests presumably to shame the accused into driving sober Others probably make you uncomfortable or indignant You might find that the tricky part is articulating why what is the boundary between a public service and an invasion of privacy  My hypothetical editors choice is inspired of course by an unhypothetical event the decision by The Journal News in White Plains to map the names and addresses of 33614 handgun permit holders in two surrounding counties for a project called The gun owner next door Ill return to that decision but the striking thing was the volume and venom of the reader backlash thousands of comments  and not only from gun owners  overwhelmingly outraged some of them suggesting that Journal News journalists deserved to have their identities stolen their homes burgled their children taunted or predictably to be shot When it comes to privacy we are all hypocrites We howl when a newspaper publishes public records about personal behavior At the same time we are acquiescing in a much more sweeping erosion of our privacy  government surveillance corporate datamining political microtargeting hacker invasions  with no comparable outpouring of protest As a society we have no coherent view of what information is worth defending and how to defend it  When our privacy is invaded in the name of national security we  and our elected representatives afraid to be thought soft  generally go along quietly Our complacency is reinforced by a popular culture that has forsaken Orwells nightmares for a benign view of authority In many of my own guiltypleasure television favorites  The Wire the British thriller series MI5 the Danish original of The Killing the addictive Homeland  surveillance is what the good guys do and it saves the day  Meanwhile as Al Qaeda wanes our surveillance state continues to grow more intrusive with woefully little oversight or accountability  Last month Julia Angwin of The Wall Street Journal disclosed that Attorney General Eric Holder had authorized the National Counterterrorism Center to copy and examine pretty much any information the government has collected about you In the past the agency couldnt store information about ordinary Americans unless they were suspects in or party to a specific investigation Under the new orders flight records lists of Americans hosting foreignexchange students financial records of people seeking federally backed mortgages health records of patients at veterans hospitals  pick a database and this obscure agency has permission to study it for patterns that ostensibly predict terrorist behavior and to share it with foreign governments whether or not you are suspected of any wrongdoing The new rules were subjected to robust official debate  all behind closed doors Likewise while we were all distracted by the dance on the fiscal cliff the 112th Congress in its final days whisked through a renewal of the law that governs eavesdropping by American intelligence agencies on Americans phone calls and email traffic A couple of senators made modest attempts to hold the eavesdroppers more accountable by for example disclosing the number of lawabiding citizens whose communications have been intercepted Their efforts were voted down The Obama administrations position on privacy is basically Trust us were good guys  said Daniel Solove of George Washington University whose book Nothing to Hide challenges the myth that lawabiding citizens have nothing to fear from government snooping Thats exactly what Bush said And its also the same thing that any despot says We shouldnt have to trust Rigorous independent oversight he added not only protects against abuses but also helps assure that what we do in the name of security actually works But it doesnt happen if we dont demand it The government of course is not the only  not even the most aggressive  invader You can take your pick of the ways Facebook and Google are monetizing you by serving up your personal profile and browsing habits to advertisers for profit Some of this feels harmless or even useful  why shouldnt my mobile device serve me ads tailored to my interests But some of it is flatout creepy One of the more obnoxious trends is the customtargeting of that irresistibly vulnerable market our children When our personal information is exploited this way we may grumble or we may seek the largely false comfort of tweaking our privacy settings but we feel helpless before the mystifying rush of technology  You would think the one sort of invasion just about everyone deplores was hacking But even there we are ambivalent When Rupert Murdochs tabloids were caught pillaging the voice mail of celebrities the public response was muted when it turned out that they had hacked the phone of a 13yearold murder victim the pitchforks and torches came out  Or take the Steubenville case In Steubenville Ohio authorities charged two members of the high school football team with the repeated rape of a passedoutdrunk 16yearold but did not charge the many others who allegedly cheered them on and made videos So the online activists of Anonymous took it upon themselves to hack into private accounts recover deleted and incriminating videos and make them public Amanda Marcotte wrestled with the moral dilemma on Slate By stepping in and holding people accountable Anonymous stands a very good chance of taking action that actually does something to stop rape But This type of online vigilante justice is potentially invading the privacy of or defaming innocent Steubenville residents and even if everything published is true there are very serious legal limits to the Anonymous strategy As a journalist Im more often on the side of the invaders than the invaded I cherish the freedom to publish But the freedom to publish includes the freedom not to publish when the cost outweighs the benefit Which brings me back to The Journal News and its gun project I sympathize with the papers effort to dramatize the commonplace reality of gun ownership at a time when the subject is so sadly on our minds I dont buy the gun owners assertion that the disclosure is an invitation to burglars in search of firearms on the contrary the publicity sends criminals the same message as those frontdoor notices of your home alarm system Try next door Its also conceivable that the attention will prompt some owners to lock up unsecured weapons  But when you are going to make a sizable population of lawabiding citizens feel violated you have to ask yourself what is the offsetting gain In this case I think not much The information The Journal News provided its readers is so far from complete as to be misleading The public records identify only legal handguns They tell you nothing about the neighbor who has an equally legal and equally lethal rifle or shotgun let alone an illegal weapon The publication has not spurred a healthy debate it has merely escalated a shouting match and given the NRA a new rallying cry The outcry may even provoke state legislatures to withdraw gun databases from public records so they will not be available when they might really be useful Its a close call but Id have found a different way to make the point 
Core Beliefs of the G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/14/opinion/core-beliefs-of-the-gop.html,To the Editor Re GOP Begins SoulSearching After Tax Vote front page Jan 6 If you look at the antics of the Tea Partytype Republicans one can easily view the Republicans as a divided even leaderless party However if you look at the core beliefs shared by both Tea Party and nonTea Party Republicans its hard to see any basic differences They both worship the wealthy want to shrink government so it cannot help the less privileged seek to slash spending except on military expenditures would try to strip women of the right to abortion would work to make all labor unions disappear and would disenfranchise millions of voters Its only on tactics and vehemence that they differ ROGER CARASSO Los Angeles Jan 8 2013
"Outsize Personality Joins, and Jostles, Mayorâ€™s Race",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/nyregion/joseph-lhota-stands-out-in-new-yorks-mayoral-race.html,To pump himself up for tense negotiations with the City Council Joseph J Lhota listened to the soaring theme song to the film Top Gun and afterward relaxed to the soothing tones of Gregorian chants  Dispensing with diplomacy he loudly challenged a 77yearold Holocaust survivor to be a man at a public meeting of the regions transit authority and he once gave the middle finger to a reporter in the rotunda of City Hall  And acting on instinct he raced into the streets of Lower Manhattan on Sept 11 2001 to direct traffic and then at days end delivered a copy of a Winston Churchill biography to his boss Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani for inspiration  In a city whose once raucous and colorful politics have become remarkably buttondown and tranquil over the past decade Mr Lhota who filed documents on Thursday to become a Republican candidate for mayor is something of a throwback an unapologetically outsize personality known throughout his career for big emotions and an uninhibited style  His combination of experience  on Wall Street in the Giuliani administration and most recently running the Metropolitan Transportation Authority  differs significantly from the backgrounds of the Democratic elected officials who have so far dominated the 2013 campaign changing the character of the race But above all Mr Lhotas candidacy presents a question Is the New York that elected Michael R Bloomberg a relatively measured dataadoring technocrat ready to embrace a larger than life occasionally profane figure reminiscent of a more theatrical era in the citys politics  a man who as a deputy mayor once paused in the middle of a closely watched legal deposition to quote Aristotle and playfully contemplate the derivation of the word ejectment a new word form when I first heard it he told his interrogators  Lhota advisers say his candor and authenticity are his disarming charm distinguishing him from a field made up of candidates they see as predictable political players Asked in an interview on Thursday about his flashes of hotheadedness Mr Lhota replied You forgot my humor People should be respected for the strength of their convictions he added And I also believe in freedom of expression It is what it is Personality aside even Mr Lhotas supporters acknowledge that his challenges are daunting He is largely unknown and his party is vastly outnumbered for every registered Republican in the city there are six Democrats His most significant credentials are also his biggest liabilities The transit authority is a lifeline that New Yorkers love to hate and Mr Giuliani remains a polarizing figure in the city especially with nonwhite voters Mr Lhota said he was proud of his work with Mr Giuliani I cannot be separated from Rudy Giuliani he said But I am also not Rudy Giuliani  He described himself as a practical Republican determined to control spending and resist giveaways to public unions even as he supports abortion rights and samesex marriage He described himself as a hunter who grew up around guns but he said there is no reason for anybody to have an assault weapon He declared that New York voters do not vote based on party labels  no Democrat has won a mayoral race in 24 years  and seemed to take pains to project a nonpartisan streak He wore a bright purple tie and conducted the interview inside the Roosevelt House on the Upper East Side of Manhattan where he said Franklin D Roosevelt had formulated his thinking about what would become the New Deal Mr Lhota allowed that he had voted for several Democrats over the years including Andrew M Cuomo in his 2010 run for governor but he did little to hide his reservations about President Obama Lets get it all out of the way he said I have voted for a Republican for president ever since I was voting and since I was 18 years old Mr Lhota 58 who lives in Brooklyn Heights has a biography that seems readymade for a mayoral race his father was a New York police lieutenant his grandfathers a New York firefighter and a taxi driver In conversations he wields an encyclopedic knowledge of New York history architecture and politics  After graduating from Georgetown and Harvard Business School he became a leader in the fastgrowing Wall Street business of municipal finance Like many young conservatives frustrated by the citys problems with crime and homelessness in the 1980s he was drawn to Mr Giulianis toughtalking message of reform Mr Lhota began showing up for weekly tutorial sessions  quickly called mayor university  for Mr Giuliani then a United States attorney  When Mr Giuliani was elected mayor in 1993 he persuaded Mr Lhota to join him at City Hall as an assistant in the economic development office where Mr Lhotas rise was rapid even by city government standards By Mr Giulianis second term Mr Lhota was deputy mayor for operations overseeing threefourths of the citys work force and standing in as mayor when Mr Giuliani was out of town Mr Lhota was an influential figure in many of Mr Giulianis signature pushes  a huge reduction in the citys welfare rolls the closing of Fresh Kills on Staten Island the last landfill in the city and a hardnosed style of budgeting that sought to deprive the Council of coveted dollars it had long relied on Mr Lhota working with Mr Giuliani pushed for drastic reductions in mainstays like financing for the arts knowing well that council members would demand their return The resulting fury would be calmed by the return of basic financing but often little else Joe was the person who helped formulate that strategy Mr Giuliani said Joe knew the inner secret He was however the rare Giuliani loyalist liked by the mayors enemies Ronnie Eldridge who represented the Upper West Side on the Council from 1989 to 2001 said Mr Lhota was an uncommon ally in a truculent City Hall that she recalled once halted construction on a project she had championed because her husband the newspaper columnist Jimmy Breslin had criticized Mr Giulianis plans to overhaul Times Square I had a terrible relationship with the Giuliani administration she said in a telephone interview But not with Joe ever He was respectful he was responsive and funny and willing to at least give you the impression that he was agreeing with you After leaving City Hall at the end of the Giuliani term Mr Lhota reentered the corporate world as a top executive at Cablevision and Madison Square Garden His return to public service at the transportation authority in 2011 became the unexpected platform for a mayoral run Under his supervision the subway system made a rapid recovery after Hurricane Sandy hastened by a prescient decision to shut down the system before the storm But Mr Lhota who resigned as the authoritys chairman last month also left it with an unresolved labor contract and a major downtown subway station still shuttered from the hurricane The irony is he didnt lift a finger to put the system back together said John Samuelsen president of Transport Workers Union Local 100 He didnt settle the contract with us and now off the work that we did hes trying to launch a mayoral candidacy What voters may remember though is the looming subway and bus fare increase passed under his watch raising rates by a quarter to 250 Advisers to a presumptive rival Christine C Quinn the Council speaker call it the Lhota fare hike But Mr Lhota had pointed words of his own for Ms Quinn on Thursday when she was described as his fiercest competitor I thought you would say Billy Thompson he said referring to a former city comptroller  He minimized Ms Quinns experience and her role in government Understanding the legislative side of how it operates is just one small area of whats necessary for a chief executive   Over the past year Mr Lhota has endeared himself to a wider audience with an active and frequently impolitic Twitter account where he offered unguarded commentary on sports politics and his own alcohol consumption Too much wine he posted apologetically In his original Twitter profile he described himself as a 911 cancer survivor a subject he is not shy about discussing  Shortly after he received a diagnosis of cancer in 2005 Mr Lhota emailed friends with characteristic defiance and humor Anticipating hair loss from chemotherapy he asked for ideas for temporary tattoos to slap on the side of my head He asked for prayers but made clear he had already turned once again to Churchill for words of comfort Never give in never give in never never never he wrote quoting his hero Mr Lhotas cancer is in remission and he says he is ready for the rigors of a mayoral run
"Gussie Moran, a Tennis Star Who Wore a Daring Wimbledon Outfit, Dies at 89",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/19/sports/tennis/gussie-moran-tennis-star-dies-at-89.html,Gussie Moran who as a ranked American tennis player in 1949 caused an international stir and gained worldwide fame for competing at Wimbledon while wearing a short skirt and lacetrimmed underwear died on Wednesday at her home in Los Angeles She was 89 She had recently been hospitalized with cancer Jack Neworth a tennis writer and friend said Morans daring outfit worn in a bastion of English propriety won her more renown than her tennis playing though she was ranked as high as No 4 in the United States won the United States womens indoor championship in 1949 and reached the quarterfinals that year at Wimbledon By the end of her life she had come to know hardship  bouncing from job to job living in near squalor telling of abortions and rape At her death she lived in a small apartment But for a time more than half a century ago she was a household name around the world A racehorse an airplane and a sauce were named after her Moran who was 25 at the time arrived in London for Wimbledon in June 1949 with a new outfit in mind having already reached out to the British designer Teddy Tinling to create one I wrote him a letter prior to Wimbledon asking him if he would design me something with one sleeve one color the other sleeve another color and the shirt another color Moran told The Orlando Sentinel in 1988 He wrote back Have you lost your mindÂ  Tinling a former tennis player and for many years the official Wimbledon host told The Associated Press during the tournament that Moran had asked him to make her look more feminine Sticking to Wimbledons allwhite dress code Tinling came up with a white silk suntop jersey with a tight waist and bodice and a short skirt that boldly bared her knees Underneath were matching white silk jersey panties trimmed with two inches of open lace Moran displayed her outfit during a pretournament tea party at the Hurlingham Club instantly inspiring a nickname Gorgeous Gussies LaceFringed Panties No 1 Attraction on Wimbledons Courts a headline in The New York Times declared after the tea party preview By the time of her opening match photographers were jostling for position many lying flat the better to catch the most risqu angle as she served the ball They were not disappointed The fringed panties are very much in evidence when Gussie races across the court or leaps for a high shot The AP reported Moran who was noted for a powerful forehand won her match defeating Bea Walter of Britain but it was her underwear that became frontpage news and a subject of debate in the British Parliament The All England Lawn Tennis and Croquet Club the home of Wimbledon accused Moran of bringing vulgarity and sin into tennis Although Moran did not wear the lace panties for the rest of the tournament the sensation they caused made her one of the biggest attractions in womens tennis She made a cameo appearance in the 1952 sports movie Pat and Mike with Spencer Tracy and Katharine Hepburn The newspapers reported on her romantic life And her underwear soon christened Gussie panties started a trend Women began taking to the court in lace panties Tshirts and plunging necklines Gussie was the Anna Kournikova of her time the former tennis champion Jack Kramer told The Los Angeles Times in 2002 referring to the Russian star and sometime model Gussie was a beautiful woman with a beautiful body If Gussie had played in the era of television no telling what would have happened Because besides everything else Gussie could play But there were negative repercussions too Wimbledon banned short dresses from the tournament By 1950 there were grumblings among the tennis elite that the attention Moran had received was unmerited in light of her being ranked seventh among American women at the time In 1951 the United States Lawn Tennis Association banned lace panties and lowneckline attire from its tournament in Forest Hills Queens that would become the United States Open Tinling had to resign as official Wimbledon host and was not to be welcomed back until 1983 seven years before his death In the meantime he had designed tennis wear for players like Chris Evert Evonne Goolagong Martina Navratilova and Virginia Wade Tennis wear evolved as well rendering Morans outfit relatively tame by todays standards Gussie wasnt a revolutionary Tinling once told The Times She wore the dress for two reasons She wanted to look good and the shorter dresses allowed her to move more freely on the court Gertrude Agusta Moran was born on Sept 8 1923 in Santa Monica Calif and grew up in a grand Victorian house overlooking the Pacific Ocean Her father Harry was a sound technician at Universal Studios and her mother Emma was a housewife Moran said she learned to play tennis when she was 11 While competing on a junior circuit she and other young players were sometimes invited to play at Charlie Chaplins house on Sunday afternoons trading volleys with stars like Greta Garbo and Olivia de Havilland During World War II after her older brother was declared missing in action Moran joined the war effort going to work at the nearby Douglas Aircraft Company She was well into her 20s when she joined the amateur tennis circuit in 1947 relatively late for a newcomer But in nine months she won three major tournaments Her victory in the National Indoor Tennis Tournament in March 1949 was on the wooden courts at the Seventh Regiment Armory in Manhattan where she defeated Nancy Chaffee Moran retired from amateur tennis in August 1950 and signed a oneyear 75000 contract to play on a professional tour run by Bobby Riggs Playing alongside Pauline Betz Moran did not do well on the tour and left it after the year was up She then began playing exhibition matches at military bases and hospitals as part of a tour managed by the tennis great Bill Tilden She also joined a USO tour Moran went on to work in radio as a sports director and in television hosting interview shows all in Los Angeles She was also a radio sportscaster in New York on WMGM marketed her own line of tennis clothes wrote for tennis magazines and taught tennis In 1970 she joined a USO tour in Vietnam and sustained broken bones when a helicopter in which she was riding was shot down She continued to compete in tournaments into her early 40s Neworth said She also publicly spoke of having abortions and of being found backstage beaten and raped during a Lawrence Welk concert at a Santa Monica centennial celebration There was no arrest Moran had three marriages none lasting more than two years She had no children In her later years she went from job to job often living in reduced circumstances after losing her home in the 1980s At one point largely supported by friends and fans she was reported to be living with cats in a single room in a rundown building in Hollywood the curtains made of bedsheets In recent years she sold her tennis memorabilia and autographs online At the height of her celebrity Moran expressed frustration with all the attention she was receiving some of it in the gossip columns exasperating It was a Wimbledon title that she wanted more than anything else she said Publicity follows me she wrote in an article for The AP at the time I cannot help it if people cook up phony quotes about engagements with tennis players Ive never even seen off the court I am interested in clothes I can play tennis in not in creating a sensation and certainly not in anything anyone at all would consider in poor taste
Will China Have to Abandon Its One-Child Rule?,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/18/will-china-have-to-abandon-its-one-child-rule/,"Chinese officials released data on Friday showing that the countrys economy grew faster than previously anticipated at the end of last year Investors greeted that news enthusiastically                                        while virtually ignoring another more worrying development The countrys working age population has officially started declining
                                        In 2012 for the first time in recent memory the number of Chinese between the ages of 15 and 59 fell  by 345 million to 93727 million Although the decline is tiny in percentage terms less than 1 percent it marks an important turning point for the country and the global economy which has come to rely on Chinese workers to assemble its iPhones and
                                        stitch its Tshirts Beijing will now have to seriously confront the pleas of families economists and others to abandon the draconian onechild rule Nobody knows exactly what the decline in the workingage population and the growing ranks of senior citizens will mean for China but most analysts seem certain that this demographic change will pose significant challenges
                                        At a fundamental level young Chinese people without siblings  not everyones an only child since the onechild policy has some exceptions  will have to support as many as four grandparents
                                        and two parents in their old age For the economy as a whole there will be far fewer workers to produce the goods and services for a still mammoth population China will in effect have a supersized version                                        of the problem that Japan and other developed countries with lowbirth rates have too many dependents not enough workers
                                         For the rest of the world Chinas demographic trends are a mixed blessing As the labor force shrinks Chinese workers will be able to demand and get higher wages which
                                        means that countries like Bangladesh Vietnam Cambodia and India will be able to better compete for unskilled or semiskilled jobs in textile electronics and other manufacturing sectors Three years ago I
                                        wrote about how Bangladeshs garment industry had benefitted from rising salaries in China Of course the transfer
                                        of these jobs to poorer countries comes with a host of problems like weak safety standards and labor rights violations Simultaneously
                                        the changes in China could drive up prices for some consumer goods in the United States and Europe So what can Beijing do about its demographics Any change in the onechild policy at this stage will not have much of an impact immediately Even if Chinese couples suddenly started having more children  and there are reasons to believe that many of them
                                        are no longer interested in having more than one child  those young people wouldnt join the labor force for another 20 years It would have been far better if China had abandoned the restriction
                                        years ago Another potential answer to its labor problems could come in the form of immigration Historically China has been a supplier of workers to the rest of the world But as it ages the flow could reverse and the country
                                        might seek to recruit immigrants from neighbors like India the Philippines and Indonesia which have large and relatively younger populations China however like Japan
                                        might find it hard to integrate or accept large numbers of foreigners in its midst There are of course moral as well as economic reasons to dislike the rule It represents an invasion of privacy                                        that leads to hardship and trauma including unwanted abortions or sterilization Some China experts like my colleague Nick Kristof are hopeful                                        that Chinas next president Xi Jinping is a reformer who will support more liberal policies Lets hope they are right and that one of the first changes he undertakes is to get rid of the onechild

Democrats  streamed into a dressedup capital city this weekend as organizers prepared for an inauguration that while not as grand as four years ago is still cause for celebration among supporters of President Obama Barbara and Loren Ing drove their minivan here from rural Ohio lugging a trailer filled with glass centerpieces As a volunteer for the society representing her native state Illinois Mrs Ing  who ordinarily works in the layaway department of her local Kmart  spent months creating the table dcor for the societys inaugural ball one of countless unofficial parties marking Mr Obamas second swearingin At the historic Willard Hotel  where the fournight inaugural rate for elegant Oval Suites is 22800 with a 27000 catering minimum  women in mink coats and pearls milled about the lobby The bartender mixed Blue Hawaiians in honor of Mr Obamas birthplace In the kitchen the pastry chef spent last week baking delicate French macarons in red white and blue  By Saturday afternoon outoftowners clutching maps strolled past the White House in the bright sunshine as street vendors hawked inaugural trinkets Parade reviewing stands were decked with patriotic bunting Pennsylvania Avenue was lined with flags and across town at the Washington Convention Center workers were busy erecting lighting and stages for Mr Obamas two official inaugural balls Tens of thousands of ticket holders will cram into the 23millionsquarefoot convention center Monday night to hear Smokey Robinson Stevie Wonder Alicia Keys and the cast of TVs Glee  all while hoping for a glimpse of Mr Obama and his wife Michelle twirling around the dance floor Its clearly not as big or as plentiful or elaborate as the last time but in many ways for Democrats its even sweeter said Hilary Rosen a prominent Obama supporter People are thrilled about the president there are a record number of women in the Senate Gay people are happy and Latinos You have these pillars of the election it meant something different to everybody but it culminated in this collectively powerful feeling For Donna Hardy a federal employee from Oakland Calif who walked in front of the White House on Saturday clutching a newly purchased Obama hat the second swearingin is more historic than the first An African American being elected back to back she asked I dont think well ever see that again Officials expect 600000 to 800000 people to turn out on the National Mall for Mondays ceremony on the West Front of the Capitol  a crowd typical for inaugurations but far short of the 18 million who clogged the city in 2009 creating pedestrian gridlock that kept many from getting to their seats This year the Congressional committee overseeing the ceremony arranged for extra cellphone towers on the Mall and devised a mobile phone app with a GPS system to help inauguralgoers navigate the city said Senator Charles E Schumer Democrat of New York and the committee chairman Mr Schumer spent Saturday at the Capitol overseeing preparations as tables were set in Statuary Hall for Mondays inaugural luncheon He will make opening remarks and introduce the participants he said the thought that so many people who have been waiting with anticipation for months wont be able to get their seats was one of two fears that had kept him awake at night The other is that he will miss his cue to introduce the chief justice Im practicing my speech but Im less worried about that and more worried about when Im supposed to get up and say Ladies and gentlemen Mr John Roberts Jr the chief justice of the Supreme CourtÂ  he said Im worried I wont get up in time Mr Obama will take his official oath on Sunday just before noon in the Blue Room of the White House the Constitution states that presidential terms expire at noon on Jan 20 Mondays festivities which coincide with Martin Luther Kings Birthday are ceremonial Mr Obama will use one of Dr Kings Bibles along with one that belonged to Abraham Lincoln when he retakes the oath on Monday To honor Dr King Mr Obama designated Saturday a national day of service He Mrs Obama and their daughters Malia and Sasha spent part of the afternoon helping to refurbish a school in Northeast Washington with hundreds of other volunteers organized by the City Year nonprofit group Mr and Mrs Obama stained a bookshelf While much of Washington is gearing up for a party some Republicans are lying low  or getting out of town My wife had a partial knee replacement so I am staying with her in Mississippi Trent Lott the former senator from that state wrote in an email Most Republicans will be otherwise busy Some will attend events and parties because it does only happen every four years But Democrats are in the mood to celebrate Emilys List which helps elect Democratic women who favor abortion rights was planning a party for 1400 to welcome female Congressional newcomers Were celebrating our shattering of glass ceilings everywhere said Jen Bluestein the groups communications director  The Futuro Fund which mobilized Hispanic voters in support of Mr Obama staged a symposium on Latino issues on Saturday as part of a threeday Latino Inaugural It planned a celebration at the Kennedy Center on Sunday night headlined by Eva Longoria Jos Feliciano Chita Rivera Rita Moreno and other Hispanic entertainers Although Bruce Springsteen  a staple of Obama campaign events  will not return to Washington for this years inauguration James Taylor will perform America the Beautiful Kelly Clarkson will sing My Country Tis of Thee and Beyonc will close the ceremony with the national anthem In 2009 hotels were sold out months in advance marketing representatives said rooms were finally booking up last week in part because celebrities and their entourages were making lastminute decisions to come The amount of celebrities the wattage may be a little dimmer said Barbara Martin whose business BrandLinkDC represents luxury clients including the W Hotel on the Pennsylvania Avenue parade route Like I dont think Beyonc is partyhopping That being said I feel that there are just as many Alist and Blist celebrities There are probably fewer Aplus ones This being Washington all sorts of companies organizations and federal agencies are trying to get in on the act Knob Creek the Kentucky bourbon maker is promoting itself as the exclusive whiskey being served at a candlelight celebration Mr Obama is hosting for his donors at the National Building Museum on Sunday night The National Archives in a rare treat for history buffs is marking the inauguration by putting two pages of George Washingtons first Inaugural Address  a document ordinarily in a vault  on display Its one of those documents that I informally call a goose bump  it gives me goose bumps said Michael Hussey the curator of the exhibit which closes at the end of the month Though some view the inauguration as partisan Steve Kerrigan chairman of Mr Obamas inaugural committee said he and his staff hoped that Americans would walk away from this with the sense that it is not just a celebration of the president but a celebration of the entire country That is the view of Mrs Ing the volunteer from Ohio She voted for Mitt Romney Mr Obamas Republican opponent This is her fifth inaugural making centerpieces for the Illinois ball Every inaugural seems different she said Different energy different people I think everybody should do it at least once
Women Are Majority on Governorâ€™s Staff,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/us/women-are-a-majority-on-gov-rick-perrys-staff.html,When Gov Rick Perry looks up from his desk these days more often than not he is surrounded by women  For the first time in his tenure his chief of staff and deputy chief of staff are women So are his director of communications his press secretary his heads of scheduling and administration and his human resources director along with the bulk of his appointments staff  In all about 60 percent of the 256 governors office employees are women Among Mr Perrys most senior staff  those charged with making key decisions for the governor  twothirds are women  Rick Perry has never needed a binder full of women said Deirdre Delisi who was Mr Perrys first female chief of staff alluding to Mitt Romneys comments during a presidential debate about how he sought help recruiting women for cabinet posts while he was the governor of Massachusetts  The governors opponents suggest that his tenure has not been kind to women in Texas Mr Perry the states longestserving governor has worked to further restrict access to abortion And he has been unwavering in his desire to force all Planned Parenthood clinics  which may not provide abortions if they accept state or federal tax dollars  out of a program that provides family planning services to the states poorest women  But no one can argue about his hiring practices especially in light of a recent controversy about President Obamas inner circle being dominated by men  In an interview Mr Perry said no one should be shocked by the number of women in his administration I live every day with four strong women he said referring to his wife Anita his daughter Sydney and his two dogs Rory and Lucy  And it just so happens Mr Perry added that this particular staff lineup is probably the most experienced capable and knowledgeable group of people working around me since I started  But he confessed that the gender makeup of his office while meaningful is hardly intentional  I looked up one day and thought Thats kind of interestingÂ  he said then turned to the lone male staff member in the room and joked Where are all the guys  Ms Delisi a political consultant who became chairwoman of the states Transportation Commission at Mr Perrys urging after leaving the governors office said that although the number of women in leadership roles in his administration has reached a new high it is not novel  Mr Perry surrounded himself with strong capable women at the Agriculture Department in the lieutenant governors office and when he became governor she said Being his first female chief of staff she added didnt feel like breaking new ground  Ann S Bishop the former executive director of the Employees Retirement System whom the governor named his chief of staff in November is accustomed to women stocking the executive offices of state agencies She for one has been a deputy comptroller and was the inaugural head of the states Department of Information Resources Still Ms Bishop said she was pleasantly surprised to walk into her first staff meeting at the governors office and see how many of her colleagues were women  The governor surrounds himself with the brightest and best she said and women are obviously part of that mix
"Obama Sworn In for 2nd Term, This Time Quietly",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/21/us/politics/president-obama-inauguration.html,WASHINGTON  With only his family beside him Barack Hussein Obama was sworn into office for a second term on Sunday in advance of Mondays public pomp facing a bitterly divided government at home and persistent threats abroad that inhibit his effort to redefine Americas use of power It was a brief and intimate moment in the White House held because of a quirk of the calendar that placed the constitutionally mandated start of the new term on a Sunday  But the lowkey event seemed to capture tempered expectations after four years of economic troubles and nearconstant partisan confrontation And it presaged a formal inauguration on Monday that will be less of a spectacle than the first one when the nations first black president embodied hope and change for many Americans at a time of financial struggle and war For Mondays festivities with the traditional parade balls and not least the reenacted swearingin outside the Capitol there will be fewer parties and fewer people swarming the National Mall organizers expect less than half the 18 million people who flocked to the city last time Once the parties end Mr Obamas secondterm challenges are formidable not least given his ambitious priorities of addressing the national debt illegal immigration and gun violence The economy while recovering steadily remains fragile The unemployment rate is as high as it was in January 2009 though it is down from the 10 percent peak reached late that year and there is no consensus with Republicans about additional stimulus measures  or virtually anything else And as the terrorist attack in Algeria last week illustrated Mr Obama continues to confront threats around the globe both from state actors like Iran and North Korea and from Qaedainspired extremists seeking to exploit power vacuums in the Mideast and across Africa and Asia At home the emphasis is on reducing the deficits that piled up because of the economic downturn and the soaring costs of caring for an aging population Yet Mr Obama and Republicans in Congress divided by opposing views on the role of government are no closer to a budget agreement that would overhaul taxes and costly fastgrowing entitlement programs like Medicare The next showdown in what has seemed a neverending loop of fiscal brinkmanship and halfmeasures is likely to come as soon as next month over spending cuts The persistent partisan battles underscore Mr Obamas inability to make good on an original promise  that he would open a bipartisan era of problem solving While Mr Obamas words have become less soaring and more confrontational toward Republicans after four years in which they sought to foil him David Plouffe a senior adviser to Mr Obama said on the CNN program State of the Union on Sunday that the president had written a hopeful inaugural address for Mondays ceremony But Senator John Barrasso Republican of Wyoming said on the same program The president seems so fixated on demonizing Republicans that he is blinded to the opportunities as well as the obligations that he has to deal with the big problems of this country on debt and the entitlements Mr Obama draws approval from just over half of Americans  down 11 percentage points from his popularity in a New York TimesCBS News survey just after his first inauguration  with Republicans united in opposition and independents split If history is a guide he has a limited time to act before his postelection leverage fades The official swearingin of Mr Obama 51 was just the seventh time in history that a president was sworn in privately before the public ceremony and the first since President Ronald Reagans second inauguration Each instance since 1821 occurred because the constitutionally mandated date for the inauguration fell on a Sunday The simplicity of Mr Obamas minutelong taking of the oath of office suggested a marriage before a justice of the peace with a big ceremony and party planned for later Only Michelle Obama holding her family Bible for the ceremony and the Obamass daughters Malia and Sasha stood beside Mr Obama in the grand Blue Room as he recited the 35word oath in the Constitution that was administered as it was four years ago by Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr About a dozen relatives of the Obamas and Jane Roberts the justices wife watched out of camera range By contrast the swearingin hours earlier of Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr at the vicepresidential mansion while simple was large enough to suggest that Mr Biden is indeed looking beyond the next four years to the 2016 election Among the 120 guests who watched Justice Sonia M Sotomayor swear in Mr Biden were Democratic dignitaries from the early presidentialnominating states including Gov Maggie Hassan of New Hampshire On Saturday evening Mr Biden attended a party of Democrats from Iowa the first presidential caucus state The private ceremonies were held because under the Constitution the two mens first terms ended at noon on Sunday In between their events Mr Obama and Mr Biden went together to Arlington National Cemetery to lay a wreath at the Tomb of the Unknowns And they prayed separately the Obamas attended services at the 175yearold Metropolitan African Methodist Episcopal Church where the enthusiastic congregation engaged in a callandresponse with the pastor evoking the presidents Forward campaign slogan the Bidens and their guests celebrated a Mass in the vicepresidential mansion  In the evening Mr Obama Mr Biden and their wives attended a gala for donors to both the 2012 campaign and the inaugural expenses where performers included Stevie Wonder Â  For Mr Obama the solemnity of his swearingin was broken by his younger daughter Sasha who seemed to recall the problem four years earlier when a garbling of the oath by both her father and Chief Justice Roberts at the Capitol forced them to repeat the oath at the White House the next day  With warmth that belied their political differences especially over campaign spending law Justice Roberts congratulated Mr Obama and the president thanked him twice as they shook hands Mr Obama then embraced his wife and daughters in turn Good job Daddy Sasha said I did it he replied only to have her quip You didnt mess up  leaving the president chuckling and rolling his eyes as he pivoted to thank the small group of witnesses and exit the room Elsewhere on a sunny winter Sunday the streets of Washington were snarled with traffic and hotels and homes were filling with the tens of thousands of visitors who along with area residents began partying through the weekend in bars and at receptions hosted by corporations and political groups Democratic women especially were feted At a party sponsored by Emilys List which helps elect Democratic women who favor abortion rights the talk was of 2016  and whether Hillary Rodham Clinton the departing secretary of state might run for president Flags bunting and red white and blue lights festooned streets buildings and grounds but as usual for such events also ubiquitous were cement and metal security barriers along with police and troops on downtown blocks  Much is changed since January 2009 and much of it not in the way Mr Obama planned His challenges ahead are perhaps not so great as then  779000 people lost their jobs that January a onemonth record the financial and auto industries were teetering and millions of Americans were losing homes and savings  but they are nonetheless daunting While Democrats controlled Congress for his first two years when Mr Obama passed his signature laws for economic stimulus expanded health insurance and financial industry regulation Republicans captured the House majority in a conservative backlash at his midterm and are expected to keep it for his second term given their success in drawing districts to keep them safe for Republicans That means Mr Obamas other priorities for a second term  chiefly addressing illegal immigration and gun violence  likewise will hardly come easy if at all 
Roe at 40: Judging a Motherâ€™s Choice,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/20/roe-at-40-judging-a-mothers-choice/,"It began with a knock at the door An old friend had popped in to visit and told me out of the blue that she was pregnant I played my giddy role and jumped up to offer her a congratulatory hug She didnt return my embrace This pregnancy was not welcome She and her husband already had more children than theyd planned to have she said Supporting their family was a struggle Her husband did
                                        not know that she was pregnant He never would I imagine that she chose me as her confidante because I openly and outspokenly support abortion rights  I always have As a teenager I signed petitions and admired friends who had the courage to go to abortion
                                        clinics and escort women through lines of protestors I vote for political candidates who pose no threat to Roe v Wade But something changed once I became a mother Pregnancy went from Scarlet Letter to Holy Grail  something deeply desired and no longer feared Abortions seemed more something in a campaign platform What felt
                                        most real was the fact that my husband and I wanted another child Ive had friends tell me about abortions before but on that day as that friend sat beside me and planned to terminate her pregnancy my reaction was more gutwrenching than sympathetic She would use my phone
                                        number as an emergency contact in case something went wrong I agreed to this plan but felt duplicitous Part of me wanted to say Dont do this Please  A bigger part of me knew that I wouldnt I didnt But Im still wrestling with how much I wanted to It was an eerie moment of dj vu when the next month a second friend called me to say that she and her husband were sitting together in a clinic waiting to terminate a pregnancy Im done
                                        she said more than once She ticked off the their reasons some financial and others emotional They did not want more children Yet there they were  birth controls statistical anomaly They went
                                        to their appointment together My friend did not seek my approval but she said she wanted to explain this decision to her closest friends After hanging up with me she called two other friends She told me later that their disapproval was fierce
                                        and those friendships are damaged The women she called were like me mothers with liberal social and political leanings Still they could not reconcile the fact that a mother would choose to terminate a pregnancy Somehow motherhood had slyly changed us We went from basking in the rights that feminism had afforded us to silently pledging never to exercise them Nice mommies dont talk about abortion  it is relegated
                                        to the dark and dirty corners of our conscious only to emerge favorably in the voting booth Yes we believe in a womans right to choose No we dont actually believe she should use it in the face
                                        of women choosing to have their children This is the feminist mothers greatest taboo My choice was either to be true to myself and my politics supporting women or give in to my emotions as my friends described their choice More than anything I wanted another baby I wanted what they had and didnt
                                        want
                                     The following month I was pregnant Then I wasnt Just like that Because that really is how it happens sometimes Women can go from feeling exuberant and full to empty and exhausted in a matter of days My doctor called it a lost pregnancy
                                        rather than miscarriage and that helped That felt less threatening I was sad and disappointed both of those friends comforted and reassured me as women always do We tacitly ignored any irony Part of me still wants to avoid the truth that my friends are mothers who sometimes have abortions Do I support them or not Can I live with myself if I dont As with so many aspects of parenting we make decisions now and are haunted by them for the rest of our lives I am a woman who supports abortion rights Before having children I would have said that reflexively As

"Leeches, Lye and Spanish Fly",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/leeches-lye-and-spanish-fly.html,WHY would a woman put a leech inside her body in the most private of female places Why would she put cayenne pepper there  Why might a woman swallow lye Gunpowder Why would a woman hit herself about the abdomen with a meat pulverizer A brickbat Throw herself down the stairs  Why would she syringe herself internally with turpentine Gin Drink laundry bluing Why might she probe herself with a piece of whalebone A turkey feather A knitting needle Why would she consume medicine made of pulverized Spanish fly How about powdered ergot a poisonous fungus Or strychnine a poison  Why would she take a bath in scalding water Or spend the night in the snow Because she wanted to end a pregnancy Historically women have chosen all those methods to induce abortion The first known descriptions appeared around 1500 BC in the Ebers Papyrus an ancient Egyptian medical text that mentioned an abortion engineered by a plantfiber tampon coated with honey and crushed dates  For most of history abortion has been a dangerous procedure a woman attempted to perform on herself In private Without painkillers  What is most striking about this history of probes and poisons is that throughout all recorded time there have been women so desperate to end a pregnancy that they were willing to endure excruciating pain and considerable risk including infection sterility permanent injury puncture and hemorrhage to say nothing of shame and ostracism Where abortion was illegal they risked prosecution and imprisonment And death of course  The newspapers of the mid1800s were full of advertisements for potions pills and powders that claimed to cause miscarriage French Periodical Pills Warranted to Have the Desired Effect in All Cases was one such knowing ad that appeared in The Boston Daily Times in 1845 Those ads spoke euphemistically of curing female complaint or renovating or unblocking the womb They treated a problem that women called suppression of the courses the idea being that monthly turns were the norm and that any cessation of normal periods meant they were suppressed or that the womb was obstructed  Many of the cures for these ailments were nothing but sugar and dust But some of them were nonetheless quite effective Those were the dangerous ones containing as they commonly did turpentine opium pennyroyal aloes snakeroot myrrh or oil of rue One of the most common ingredients was ergot or claviceps purpurea a fungus found on the stalks of grain Women as early as the 16th century had observed that cows that consumed ergot miscarried their calves The fungus however had disastrous side effects called ergotism also known as St Anthonys fire Symptoms included a burning sensation in the limbs because of blood constriction which led to gangrene The poison could also cause seizures itching psychosis vomiting contractions diarrhea and death  Oil of tansy was another common abortifacient Here is John Irvings unforgettable description from his scrupulously researched novel The Cider House Rules of a doctor trying to save a woman after too many tansyoil miscarriages Her abdomen was full of bloodbut when he tried to sew up [the] uterus his stitches simply pulled through the tissue which he noticed was the texture of a soft cheesehis finger passed as easily through the intestine as through gelatin Tansy oil rots internal organs  Notwithstanding such ghastly scenarios abortion did not always  or even usually  result in death Many women survived it which is why for most of history it was one of the main forms of birth control If they did choose to enlist help they most often called upon another woman usually a skilled midwife But by the 1850s male doctors began to take over all aspects of womens reproductive care sidelining midwives and leading the movement to outlaw the practice of abortion Did they save some womens lives by unmasking the dangers of medicines to cause miscarriage Undoubtedly But by withholding midwives knowledge of how to provide a relatively safe abortion in the early stage of pregnancy they drove other women to undergo the procedure at the hands of the unskilled until the United States Supreme Court made abortion legal on Jan 22 1973 Womens historical willingness to endure horrible dangers to submit to extreme and prolonged pain to risk grave injury and death rather than remain pregnant tells us something important about female desperation and determination and the price women were  and still are  willing to pay to control their own bodies What it tells us is that women will always find ways to end an unwanted pregnancy no matter what the law says no matter the risks to themselves  If the Supreme Court were ever to overturn Roe v Wade or if antiabortion forces continue to successfully chisel away at a womans access to safe abortion many women will still choose abortion  by their own hands Leeches lye and Spanish fly are still among the many tools available to the selfabortionist So are knitting needles with predictable disastrous consequences There is no law that will end the practice of abortion only laws that can protect a womans right to choose it or not and to keep it the safe and private procedure still available to us in 2013 40 years after the Supreme Court made it legal 
Better Reporting for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/22/opinion/better-reporting-for-abortions.html,WASHINGTON FORTY years after Roe v Wade Americans seem to be traveling in opposite directions on abortion The Democratic Partys latest platform opposes any and all efforts to weaken or undermine legal abortion On the other hand the last two years saw the adoption by state legislatures of the highest number of laws regulating or restricting abortion in decades Is there anything the contending sides in the abortion debate can agree on I have a suggestion wherever we stand on the issue we ought to have access to highquality uptodate information on how many women in each state are undergoing the procedure by what method at what stage of pregnancy and how many times We should know the age of the women involved and if relevant whether there was parental notice Americans should insist that abortion statistics be comprehensively gathered rapidly totaled and assessed and reliably published by a publicly accountable body Many would be surprised to know that this is not already the case As a recent study by my organization the Charlotte Lozier Institute documents abortion reporting varies considerably state by state Most states mandate the gathering of data most publish some type of report and most share data with the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention which publishes an annual report And of course all keep the names of individual women seeking abortions confidential But many states report annual abortion information on a delayed and sometimes desultory basis As of the end of December the majority of states still had not released their annual reports covering 2011 The CDCs most recent report which showed a significant 5 percent drop in total abortions was released on Nov 23 and provided data for 2009 the first year of President Obamas first term Compare this with other public health metrics in October the CDC released its preliminary report on state rates of infant mortality for 2011 Data from 2010 on childrens dental visits became available last May  Worse a small number of states including two that are central to the abortion debate  California which has the countrys sixth highest abortion rate and Maryland which has the fifth highest and a reputation for serving as a haven for lateterm abortions not permitted in other states  do not provide information to the CDC at all  We know what Californias and Marylands abortion rates are because their doctors and clinics like those across the nation voluntarily submit data to the Guttmacher Institute Guttmacher is an independent enterprise but it was once affiliated with Planned Parenthood the largest abortion provider in the United States There is no reason to think that the institute whose abortion totals are consistently about a third higher than the CDCs because of these omitted states is not a reliable source of data for the number of legal abortions occurring nationwide And yet we would not be comfortable with our primary information on tobacco or manufacturing pollution coming from entities rooted in those sectors Fortunately several states are moving ahead with their own 21stcentury reporting systems Minnesota and Arizona require prompt reporting making information available on state Web sites or to researchers in some cases within weeks of the end of each month They publish annual reports that are researcherfriendly at low cost to the taxpayer But we still need a national government body to do this work In 1993 the CDC abandoned its last effort to make the states participate in a comprehensive system for consistent state reporting I believe a rebirth of federalism might be a good thing But as long as the federal government spends close to one in every three health care dollars and as long as the states accept money from Uncle Sam to finance family planning then the states should be required to set and maintain reasonable reporting standards on abortion and to share their data with Washington Bill Clinton coined the phrase that abortion should be safe legal and rare Most Americans can agree on at least twothirds of that formula  women should be safe and abortion should be rare  from the getgo Very few people would be sad to learn that the abortion rate in our country was going down The least we can do is track those numbers in a reliable way  No one believes that reporting is the most important issue ethical or otherwise in this profoundly important social question Numbers do not determine morality But unless we know the full scope and truth about abortion were debating in darkness

Misconceptions,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/23/misconceptions/," Francis Lorson the longtime chief deputy clerk of the Supreme Court once told me the following story On a January day in the mid1970s he and Justice Potter Stewart were in an official car traveling from the court
                                        to the White House where the justice was to preside at a swearingin ceremony As they rode along Pennsylvania Avenue they saw a crowd heading in the opposite direction up Capitol Hill toward the court  Justice Stewart clearly oblivious to the anniversary of Roe v Wade asked his companion what was going on These were people marching in protest against legalized abortion Mr Lorson explained  The justice shook his head in puzzlement I dont understand he said Weve decided that  As still another Roe v Wade anniversary came around this week I thought of Frank Lorson
                                        who died this month at 69 and his little story His point of course had been to illustrate how simple it all looked back then Potter Stewart an Eisenhower appointee who was one of five Republicanappointed

                                      Many of the articles have focused on how strategic and successful the antiabortion side has been in erecting obstacles to women seeking abortions and doctors willing to perform them Last year alone 19 state legislatures
                                        enacted a total of 43 new restrictions on access to abortion six states accounted for more than half the new restrictions with the everreliable

                                        USA Today True enough but I think one lesson of Frank Lorsons story is that to the justices who decided the case Roe v Wade really was about abortion nothing more or less To read the actual opinion
                                        as almost no one ever does is to understand that the seven middleaged to elderly men in the majority certainly didnt think they were making a statement about womens rights women and their voices

                                        files at the Library of Congress  In decriminalizing abortion the justices were reflecting a rapid sea change in public opinion that moved over the course of a decade from the elites of the public health and legal professions to ordinary people who
                                        viewed the issue as one of policy rather than as many later would personal identity A Gallup poll in the summer of 1972 found 64 percent of Americans agreeing with the statement that The decision to have
                                        an abortion should be made solely by a woman and her physician A majority of all identified groups including Catholics agreed with that statement There was almost no difference between men and women

                                        backlash narrative There was conflict over abortion before the court ruled driven by the Catholic hierarchys opposition to the early stirrings of state legislative reform well before most people even
                                        anticipated an eventual Supreme Court ruling There was conflict after the ruling late in the decade of the 1970s as evangelicals who had not previously expressed categorical opposition to abortion joined forces
                                        with Catholics in a profamily movement with a broad agenda that included opposition to the proposed Equal Rights Amendment and other goals of the womens movement unrelated to abortion The

                                        Southern strategy one that took longer to achieve  20 years by some measures  but that eventually resulted in todays upsidedown world where the once prochoice Republican
                                        majority has disappeared and the Democratic base embraces abortion rights With Roe v Wade having narrowly survived other anniversaries the heightened focus on Roe at 40 may appear something of a puzzle Its in part because of the focus on reproductive issues during the presidential
                                        campaign and of the incremental gains by antiabortion forces in the state legislatures Its also because of the surprisingly rapid evolution of the samesex marriage issue and of the marriage cases awaiting

                                        unmistakable reference to Roe v Wade in a question to Theodore B Olson as the trial neared its conclusion in June 2010 Isnt the danger Judge Walker asked the plaintiffs lawyer
                                        not that youre going to lose this case either here or at the Court of Appeals or at the Supreme Court but that you might win it And then in the case now before the Supreme Court the
                                        judge went on to hand victory to Ted Olson David Boies and the two samesex couples they represented To look back at earlier Roe anniversaries is to witness the ebb and flow of the abortion issue at the intersection of law and politics At age 10 in January 1983 support for abortion on the court seemed secure But
                                        Ronald Reagan had won the presidency on an antiabortion platform the Republican Partys first such platform since the party still offered a big tent on abortion in its first postRoe platform in 1976
                                        and his first Supreme Court appointee Sandra Day OConnor had yet to cast her first vote in an abortion case When that vote came in the Akron case                                        on June 15 1983 the new justice expressed deep reservations about Roe and raised expectations that she would vote to overturn it if presented with the right case By 1993 when Roe turned 20 the precedents future was looking bright Bill Clinton was in the White House and the previous June in Planned Parenthood v Casey
                                        the Supreme Court had reaffirmed the core abortion right with the unexpected support of Justice OConnor and Justices Anthony M Kennedy and David H Souter two other Republican appointees widely assumed
                                        to be hostile to Roe  At 30 in 2003 Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg had succeeded Justice Byron R White one of the two dissenters in Roe who had never reconciled himself to the decision By a 5to4 vote the court had overturned Nebraskas partialbirth abortion law
                                        But by 35 the tide had turned yet again With Justice Samuel A Alito Jr having replaced Justice Sandra Day OConnor a new 5to4 majority repudiated the Nebraska precedent without formally overturning
                                        it and upheld the federal PartialBirth Abortion Ban Act that President George W Bush had signed into law  And what will be Roes fate at 50 Until recently I shared the sense of doom that pervades the abortionrights community But as the history of the last 40 years shows elections matter and the 2012 election
                                        matters a great deal Those looking for signs of regime change as my colleague Jack Balkin at Yale Law School puts it can find them in unexpected places The decision last week by Arizonas

                                        governors had fought as part of their lawsuit against the Affordable Care Act was I believe an underappreciated portent of shifting tectonic plates And as was widely reported this week more Americans than ever
                                        before  70 percent  told a national poll that they didnt want to see Roe v Wade overturned  On one of New Havens main streets a few blocks from my office is a building that houses the local Planned Parenthood affiliate Its clinic provides a full range of womens health services including
                                        contraception and abortion I grew up about five miles from that location  not then a Planned Parenthood clinic of course At the time I graduated from high school a year before the Supreme Court decided
                                        Griswold v Connecticut not only was abortion still illegal in my home state but so was birth control even for married couples Every time I drove
                                        by the building and especially this week I think to myself that despite all the worries and perturbations of the last 40 years theres progress"
"Redistricting in Virginia Hurts Blacks, Democrats Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/us/politics/virginia-senates-redistricting-is-protested.html,On Monday one of Virginias state senators attended the inauguration Henry L Marsh III a longtime civil rights lawyer who played hooky to witness a milestone for an AfricanAmerican president The same day Republicans back in the state capital Richmond took advantage of his absence to win a partyline vote 20 to 19 to redraw electoral maps in a way that Democrats say dilute AfricanAmericans voting strength The move not only has Democrats howling about a power grab it has also been criticized by Virginias Republican governor and lieutenant governor Redrawing districts to favor the party in power is hardly new in Virginia or elsewhere Democrats redrew the state map in 2011 when they held the majority in the Senate although their efforts to achieve electoral gains were less than successful they lost control of the chamber later that year Republican senators say the new map increases the number of Senate districts in Virginia with black majorities to six from five and is necessary to shield the state from lawsuits under federal civil rights law But Democrats are furious that the map also dilutes the partys power by removing blacks from as many as a dozen districts and under the guise of bowing to the Voting Rights Act they say it would pack blacks in fewer districts over all This was nothing more than what I call plantation politics said Senator Donald McEachin the chairman of the Democratic caucus The issue has reintroduced partisan rancor in the State Senate which is evenly split 20 to 20 between the parties Many Virginia lawmakers had hoped to avoid conflict after last years divisions over a bill requiring ultrasounds for women seeking abortions cast a harsh light on the state nationally One displeased official is Gov Bob McDonnell a Republican who needs Democratic support as he seeks to enact ambitious proposals on transportation and education in his last year in office This is not an issue that I advocated Mr McDonnell told reporters on Tuesday I certainly dont think thats a good way to do business Lt Gov Bill Bolling also opposed his partys move He is concerned that it could create a hyperpartisan atmosphere said Mr Bollings spokeswoman Ibbie Hedrick Republicans who pushed through the map said it was needed to right historic wrongs Although 19 percent of Virginias population is black according to the census and President Obama carried the state twice only 5 of the 40 state senators are black All represent districts drawn with black majorities in 1991 Since then no other district has sent an AfricanAmerican to the Senate The leader of the new effort Senator John C Watkins said that in creating a sixth district in Southern Virginia with a black majority the state would be protected from litigation under the Voting Rights Act No one can dispute that racially polarized voting is present in Virginia Mr Watkins said on the Senate floor on Monday according to a transcript of the proceedings Senator Richard L Saslaw the Democratic minority leader used an expletive to describe Republican concerns for black voters He said Republicans blocked efforts in 2011 to create a new Congressional district with a high percentage of blacks Mr Saslaw who is known for not holding back said that on the Senate floor he compared the Republican move to the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor Both Republicans and Democrats he said have traditionally agreed to map districts in the back room to protect incumbents  When I did the redistricting I went to every single Republican except four or five and gave them the districts they wanted he said of the effort he led in 2011 By contrast he said the new map guts about a dozen of our senators Democrats say the extensive changes passed by Republicans which are now before the legislatures lower chamber the House of Delegates where Republicans hold a supermajority violate the states Constitution They foresee a lengthy court fight if the map is adopted Before then however it must get past the governor not a sure bet at all  As for Mr Marsh who missed the vote he rejected any notion that Republicans were acting in AfricanAmericans interests He called the plan shameful

                                        is profoundly committed  morally and ideologically  to traditional values Youre asking groups of people to change who were brought together by their resistance to change

                                            they change their spots thoroughly The success of the Republican Party in rural areas exurbs and in the South has come at a cost Socially conservative voters will resist changing their spots When and if Republican leaders determine that the demands
                                        of these voters for massive resistance to abortion contraception and immigration are futile they will have to decide whether to cut them loose No matter what happens social conservatives are
                                        unlikely to become Democrats It may not be too long before they find themselves with a choice of their own withdraw from party politics or hold their noses and stick with the Republicans"
Cardinal Jozef Glemp of Poland Is Dead at 83,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/24/world/europe/cardinal-jozef-glemp-of-poland-is-dead-at-83.html,Cardinal Jozef Glemp the spiritual leader of Polands Roman Catholics for 25 years who helped steer his nation through a historic and relatively peaceful transition from Communism to democracy in 1989 but who was dogged by allegations of antiSemitism died on Wednesday in Warsaw He was 83 Jozef Kloch a church spokesman announced the death The Polish news agency PAP said Cardinal Glemp had lung cancer For a thousand years the church has been a repository of nationhood in overwhelmingly Catholic Poland and for decades Cardinal Glemp as the archbishop of Warsaw and Gniezno and the primate of Poland was both mediator and power broker in the struggle between the Communist government and the resistance led by the Solidarity labor union His approach was nonconfrontational urging calm when the government declared martial law in 1981 and even when state security officers murdered a popular dissident priest the Rev Jerzy Popieluszko in 1984 Through repeated crises Cardinal Glemp was an ally though a fitful one of the Solidarity leader Lech Walesa and a hostile but pragmatic and useful intermediary for Warsaws Communist leader Gen Wojciech Jaruzelski Cardinal Glemp was named primate by his countryman Pope John Paul II in 1981 becoming the representative of 34 million Catholics about 95 percent of the population He became a cardinal in 1983 But he disappointed Poles who wanted a national savior to fight Communism with the dynamism of his predecessor Cardinal Stefan Wyszynski Unlike Cardinal Wyszynski a thundering autocrat Cardinal Glemp was a quiet unprepossessing man with a homespun modesty strangely becoming in the ornate splendor of great cathedrals and his palatial Warsaw residence He listened to subordinates strived for consensus and sometimes appeared indecisive Though criticized by priests and laity who supported the outlawed Solidarity Cardinal Glemp insisted that his mission was the preservation of the church not the overthrow of Communist rule He opposed violence and general strikes urged restraint by the government and conferred with both sides to ease tensions as Soviet communism and the walls dividing Eastern and Western Europe crumbled In 1988 when labor unrest shook Poland Cardinal Glemp named Tadeusz Mazowiecki his close associate and a Solidarity adviser to mediate the peace and pave the way for talks on political reforms and national elections In 1989 the cardinal was a voice in Mr Mazowieckis selection as Polands first nonCommunist prime minister since the 1940s He burnished his standing by accompanying John Paul during his pilgrimages to Poland After the democratic transition he backed Mr Walesas successful presidential campaign in 1990 but his support was less helpful in 1995 when Mr Walesa lost to a former Communist Aleksander Kwasniewski whom the cardinal called a neopagan Despite an increasingly secularized population Cardinal Glemp advanced his agenda Compulsory religious education resumed in public schools a law requiring the news media to conform to Christian values was adopted and abortions were sharply restricted His appeals to abolish a constitutional separation of church and state went unheeded but he gave his blessing to Polands market economy Cardinal Glemp was repeatedly accused of antiSemitism notably for his 1989 remarks resisting an agreement to move a Carmelite convent from Auschwitz where about a million Jews were killed by the Nazis After Jews complained the Vatican agreed in 1987 to put the convent in a nearby interfaith center But as a deadline passed and Jews staged protests the cardinal went on the offensive saying Do you esteemed Jews not see that your pronouncements against the nuns offend the feelings of all Poles and our sovereignty which has been achieved with such difficulty Your power lies in the mass media that are easily at your disposal in many countries Let them not serve to spread antiPolish feeling He added Dear Jews do not talk with us from the position of a people raised above all others and do not dictate conditions that are impossible to fulfill The ensuing firestorm reignited old controversies in a largely rural land where the prewar Jewish population of 35 million had dwindled to a few thousand But the cardinal did not back down until the Vatican reaffirmed the popes determination to move the convent The issue resurfaced in 1991 when Cardinal Glemp touring the United States encountered more protests and told Jewish leaders that he regretted the pain his statements had caused In 1997 Cardinal Glemp belatedly rebuked a rabidly antiSemitic radio station Radio Maryja and the Rev Tadeusz Rydzyk who mingled daily outpourings of hate with prayer The cardinal acted only after Vatican hints and a prosecutors slander charges In 2001 Cardinal Glemp was again accused of antiSemitism when he refused to accompany President Kwasniewski to the village of Jedwabne to apologize for the 1941 massacre of 1600 Jews most of them burned alive in a barn by Polish neighbors The cardinal disavowed ostentatious penance in advance and said I prefer not to have politicians impose on the Church the way it is to fulfill its act of contrition for the crimes committed by certain groups of people Cardinal Glemp retired as Archbishop of Warsaw in 2006 having surrendered the Archdiocese of Gniezno in a reorganization in 1992 He was primate of Poland until he turned 80 in 2009 Jozef Glemp pronounced YOOzeff GLEMP was born on Dec 18 1929 in Inowroclaw Poland He decided early to be a priest but his schooling was interrupted when the Nazis invaded in 1939 His father a salt miner joined the resistance but Jozef his mother sister and two brothers became slave farm laborers Ordained in 1956 Cardinal Glemp was a parish priest and a teacher before earning doctorates in civil and canon law in Rome He returned to Poland in 1964 and was Cardinal Wyszynskis legal adviser for 12 years He was Bishop of Warmia a diocese of 13 million from 1979 to 1981 when he succeeded Cardinal Wyszynski on his death As he settled into his role as protector of the church in a national crisis he asked Poles to pray instead of taking to the streets when martial law was imposed and Mr Walesa was jailed And before 350000 spread out over a hillside at the Jasna Gora shrine to the Virgin Mary he assured them that the voice of the church was on their side

                                        The biggest reason why blue states often have lower outofwedlock birth rates than more conservative states is that the blue states have higher abortion rates and the relative stability of the blue model
                                        of postsexual revolution family life  which is really the upper middle class blue model in which serial monogamy in your late teens and twenties is followed by late marriage and parenting  depends
                                        on a willingness to abort as well as a facility with contraception But where prolife writers like myself tend to raise this point in order to cast doubt on the comfortingbutdubious idea                                        that liberal policies will inevitably lower the abortion rate Cahn and Carbone invoke it to cast doubt on the idea that one can simultaneously be opposed to abortion and in favor of stable twoparent families
                                        After all if a willingness to abort helps keep outofwedlock birth rates low among welleducated blue staters then surely opposition to abortion can plausibly be held responsible for the steady
                                        rise in single parent households in the rest of the country  and especially in white conservativetilting middle America  why do those wringing their hands over the rise in singleparent families never blame much less even mention opposition to abortion  If abortion is not an option then more singleparent births
                                            are pretty inevitable Think of it as the Bristol Palin effect after Sarah Palins 17yearold daughter announced her pregnancy shortly after her mothers selection in 2008 as the Republican vicepresidential
                                            candidate Republican women applauded the Palins choice to support their daughters decision to have the child They wrote that unlike other Republican leaders the Palins were sticking to their
                                            values rather than doing what others had done and quietly arranged an abortion  The big increase in AfricanAmerican nonmarital births occurred in the 1960s and 1970s For whites the development has been more recent and it has occurred at the same time as the emergence of antiabortion
                                                sentiment as a key constituent of conservative political identity Has the hardening of antiabortion attitudes among white workingclass conservatives helped cause the increase in white nonmarital births
                                                Did it contribute to the erosion of the stigma on nonmarital births The answer I think depends on whether you take Roe v Wade as a given or not and how you assess the abortion rulings consequences for the culture Its true that since
                                        the 1970s social conservatives have had more success encouraging doubts about the moral acceptability of abortion than they have had on almost any other cultural front which means that there are many communitiesÂ 
                                        often in more conservative regions of the country  where taboos surrounding premarital sex have allbutcollapsed but some kind of antiabortion sentiment has endured or strengthened This combination probably
                                        makes some kind of Bristol Palin effect inevitable All things being equal a sexually permissive culture that permits abortion but tries to discourage it will probably end up with more single parents than a sexually
                                        permissive culture that supports and subsidizes the procedure But prolifers dont want to keep all things equal and I think theyre justified in seeing this argument as something as an evasion of responsibility on the part of prochoicers Yes in a postRoe world
                                        social conservatives often find themselves accepting single parenthood as the lesser by far of two potential evils But theres good reason to think Roe itself was instrumental in creating the kind of sexual
                                        culture that makes the Bristol Palin dilemma as commonplace as its become While the frequentÂ use of abortion can limit outofwedlock births that is the sudden mass availability                                        of abortion almost certainly had the opposite effect  mostly byÂ changing the obligations associated with pregnancy and by legitimating male irresponsibility where sex and its consequences are concerned This was the conclusion that George Akerlof and Janet Yellen reached in a mid1990s Brookings Institution analysisÂ Although
                                        many observers expected liberalized abortion and contraception to lead to fewer outofwedlock births they wrote in fact the opposite happened mostly because the availability of abortion
                                        dramatically undermined the expectation that a man would marry and support a woman he impregnated By making the birth of the child the physical choice of the mother they concluded the
                                        sexual revolution has made marriage and child support a social choice of the father Â which in turn has made it much easier for fathers to choose noninvolvement in cases where the mother decides
                                        not to use abortion as a birth control of last resort The trajectory of nonmarital births lends credence to this hypothesis If the Bristol Palin effect were the crucial factor in determining the outofwedlock birth rate and with it family stability more generally one
                                        would expect the rate of single parenthood to either drop or rise more slowly after Roe and then rise more swiftly across the 1990s as prolife sentiment began its preTodd Akin climb
                                        But Cahn and Carbones suggestion notwithstanding for whites as well as minorities the steepest increase in the outofwedlock birth rate actually occurred in the years immediately following Roe itself
                                        If you look at figure 13 in this document youll see that the white outofwedlock birth rate nearly quadrupled between 1970 and 1990 it has only
                                        risen by about fifty percent in the two decades since Meanwhile divorce rates and teen pregnancy rates both rose with the abortion rate and then fell with it from the early 1990s onward  which
                                        again is not exactly the pattern youd expect if abortionondemand was aÂ major boon to the twoparent household and prolife sentiment a significant driver of family breakdown This is not to say that the Bristol Palin effect is nonexistent and its perfectly fair for liberals especially liberals untroubled by the ethics of abortion to critique the instability that currently seems inherent                                        in the red family model of sexuality and parenting But prolifers are justified in believing that some of this models weaknesses are themselves a legacy of abortions impact on the
                                        culture of sex and marriage Â and justified as well in believing that absent a sweeping abortion license more children would have probably been born into twoparent families overall than have enjoyed
                                        that privilege in the America of Roe v Wade"
G.O.P. Rebranding,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/25/g-o-p-rebranding/,"There is no shortage of people in the Republican Party who think the message voters sent in November was that Mitt Romney and Paul Ryan werent conservative enough In Kentucky USA Today reports Tea Party groups are hoping to oust Senator Mitch McConnell because he has only
                                        paid lip service to the causes of the right wing Its hard to imagine anyone more dedicated to those causes than Mr McConnell who infamously declared at the start of President Obamas
                                        first term that his top priority would be denying him a second one But there also are an increasing number of influential Republicans who at least sound like they are trying to drag their party back from the edge
                                         Gov Bobby Jindal of Louisiana whose name is often mentioned as a future presidential candidate had a very blunt message for the Republican National Committee at its winter meeting
                                        this week We must stop being the stupid party he said Im serious Its time for a new Republican Party that talks like adults He said the GOP is guilty of insulting the intelligence of voters and has spent too much time dumbing down its ideas We must reject the notion that demography is destiny
                                        the pathetic and simplistic notion that skin pigmentation dictates voter behavior he said He added that the first step in getting voters to like you is to demonstrate that you like them It seemed like an extraordinary acknowledgment of what the polls showed in November which was that minority voters  including a large percentage of Hispanic voters  overwhelmingly rejected the Republicans
                                        candidates and policies But the rest of Mr Jindals remarks suggested that he wants to change the jingle on the commercial rather than the product itself As I indicated before I am not one of those who believe we should moderate equivocate or otherwise abandon our principles he said This badly disappoints many of the liberals in the national
                                        media of course For them real change means supporting abortion on demand without apology abandoning traditional marriage between one man and one woman embracing government growth as the key to American success
                                        agreeing to higher taxes every year to pay for government expansion and endorsing the enlightened policies of European socialism That he said is what real change looks like to the New York
                                        Times editorial board I appreciate the product placement but thats a rather extreme caricature of our positions Yes we support samesex marriage but that doesnt mean we want to abandon traditional marriage
                                        We think they can coexist Another leading Republican political figure at least in his own mind Newt Gingrich told the same Republican gathering I am for 100 percent of the American people believing that they have a party that cares
                                        about their future I would like to say to every consultant in this party if you think you can target less than 100 percent youre not going to get any more business Mr Gingrich was referring to Mr Romneys infamous 47 percent comment but just like Mr Jindal he didnt seem to be calling for a change in policy so much as a change in tone Lawmakers he said should
                                        stop complaining about Mr Obamas agenda and practice cheerful persistence We need to be the happy party he said Mr Jindal and Mr Gingrich both seem to assume that those who oppose the Republican Party dont object to Republican programs and goals They just dont understand the GOP message If thats

"In Fight Over Life, a New Call by Catholics",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/us/politics/catholics-raise-issue-of-guns-amid-call-to-end-abortion.html,The March for Life in Washington on Friday renewed the annual impassioned call to end legalized abortion 40 years after the Roe v Wade decision But this year some Roman Catholic leaders and theologians are asking why so many of those who call themselves prolife have been silent or even opposed when it comes to controlling the guns that have been used to kill and injure millions of Americans  More than 60 Catholic priests nuns scholars and two former ambassadors to the Vatican sent a letter this week saying that if marchers and politicians truly want to defend life they should support commonsense reforms to address the epidemic of gun violence in our nation  They called in particular on Catholic lawmakers naming the House speaker John A Boehner and Representative Paul D Ryan of Wisconsin both Republicans as well as Senators Joe Donnelly of Indiana and Heidi Heitkamp of North Dakota both Democrats who they said have A ratings from the National Rifle Association to stand up to the gun lobby They urged support for legislation limiting the sale of militarystyle assault weapons and highcapacity magazines like those used in the massacre last month at a school in Newtown Conn Were addressing life said one of the signers Thomas P Melady a Republican who served as ambassador to the Holy See under the first President George Bush I accept the Catholic teachings which promote the sanctity of life from conception to natural death And certainly the death of the 20 young kids and 6 adults in Newtown was not natural Why cant we take some steps with regards to these killings These sophisticated weapons should be controlled  A theologian who signed the letter Tobias Winright an associate professor of theological ethics at St Louis University a Catholic institution said that Pope John Paul II promoted the notion of a culture of life that encompassed opposition to abortion as well as euthanasia and the death penalty  Professor Winright a former law enforcement officer said he was encouraged when the Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi recently praised American religious leaders and the Obama administration for proposals to limit guns Jeanne Monahan the president of the March for Life Education and Defense Fund which organizes the march said that as a Catholic in the antiabortion movement We absolutely support the idea of being prolife from conception to natural death  Really the difference between the little ones in Connecticut which is so heartbreaking and the little ones in the womb is their size and their age But asked about the letter from the Catholic leaders she said I definitely have nothing to say about gun control Thats so out of the parameter of what were about  Since the killings in Newtown a broad spectrum of religious leaders have joined Faiths United to Prevent Gun Violence to demand controls on guns but leaders of evangelical churches have been conspicuously absent The National Association of Evangelicals surveyed its board of more than 100 members in December and found that 73 percent of them said that government should increase gun regulations However the association has not taken a position publicly  A poll released this week by the Public Religion Research Institute a nonpartisan research group in Washington found that among the roughly twothirds of white evangelical Protestants who say the term prolife describes them very well 64 percent are opposed to stricter gun control laws while 33 percent favor them  The picture among Catholics is the opposite The poll found that of the 4 in 10 Catholics who say that prolife describes them very well 61 percent support stricter gun control laws and 33 percent oppose them The survey was taken in January and included more than 1000 respondents with a margin of error of plus or minus four percentage points  The nations Catholic bishops supported the unsuccessful effort to renew the ban on assault weapons that expired in 2004 and recently reiterated a call to control the sale and use of firearms said Kathy Saile the director of the bishops office of domestic social development  It wasnt a tough call Ms Saile said All of our policy work is rooted in our consistent ethic for life and our belief in the sacredness of all life  Cardinal Timothy M Dolan of New York the president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops told the Catholic News Service this month that he had told Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr who is managing the White House response to the recent shootings that the bishops would assist in the fight for greater gun control in the country  But John Gehring the Catholic program director at Faith in Public Life a liberal advocacy group in Washington said that bishops who had demanded that Catholic legislators vote against abortion rights should do the same on gun control  He said Catholic lawmakers who call themselves prolife and are pretty cozy with the NRA shouldnt be getting a free pass 
The N.C.A.A.â€™s Ethics Problem,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/26/opinion/nocera-the-ncaas-ethics-problem.html,In late March 2009 Yahoo Sports published a story alleging that the University of Connecticut had violated NCAA rules in its efforts to recruit Nate Miles a 6foot7 basketball player from Toledo Ohio The NCAA enforcement staff led by Tim Nevius one of its top investigators opened an inquiry By then Miles was back in Toledo hed been expelled from UConn in October 2008 before ever playing a game No longer a studentathlete Miles refused to cooperate Yet Nevius interviewed Dr Chris MacLaren a Florida orthopedic surgeon who had once operated on Miless foot Without any consent from the patient Nevius asked for and MacLaren provided details of Miless surgery and its costs  This of course was a gross violation of medical ethics It was also in all likelihood a violation of medical privacy laws But when several lawyers involved in the case brought this potential illegality to the attention of the Committee on Infractions  which metes out punishment to rules violators and which includes a number of lawyers  the response was coldly dismissive A medical release from Miles was not required replied Shepard Cooper then the committee director How did he know Because Nevius had told him so So much for the law Earlier this week Mark Emmert the NCAA president acknowledged that the enforcement staff had once again done something deeply unethical Except he didnt phrase it like that In recounting the sordid details involving an investigation into the University of Miami Emmert made it sound as if they were aberrations the actions of several rogue employees who were no longer there Describing the transgressions as stunning Emmert announced that he had hired a lawyer to review its investigative practices insisting that his goal was to ensure that NCAA investigations were consistent with our values  What sanctimonious claptrap The only thing stunning about this latest outrage is that Emmert acknowledged it My guess is that it was about to leak anyway  To recap Nevin Shapiro the man at the center of the Miami scandal  who is now in prison for running a Ponzi scheme  claims to have given University of Miami athletes cash prostitutes jewelry and on one occasion an abortion for a players girlfriend according to Yahoo Sports which broke this news as well Incredibly NCAA investigators engaged one of Shapiros bankruptcy lawyers Maria Elena Perez which would seem like an insurmountable conflict of interest Then they used her ability to conduct depositions in the Shapiro bankruptcy case to gather information it could not otherwise obtain Though Perez insists she did nothing wrong this is the sort of ethical breach that can cost a lawyer her license When I expressed astonishment at this turn of events to Richard G Johnson a lawyer who has tangled with the NCAA he scoffed This is not unusual he replied This is part and parcel of the way the NCAA does business Andy Oliver a former client of Johnsons who is now a pitcher for the Pittsburgh Pirates became the subject of an NCAA investigation after his former lawyer violated lawyerclient confidentiality in speaking to the NCAA Oliver ultimately won a reported 750000 settlement In the case of former University of Southern California assistant football coach Todd McNair which I wrote about several weeks ago the enforcement staffs evidence against him was so dubious that a judge has ruled that he will likely win a defamation suit he brought against the NCAA In another case that I wrote about the boyfriend of an NCAA investigator bragged that his girlfriend was going to nail a player she was investigating  months before her investigation had been completed Indeed in the Miami case this is not even the NCAAs only ethically dubious stunt Just before Thanksgiving the enforcement staff sent out letters to numerous former athletes who had refused to cooperate  as is their right The letters said that if they didnt talk in the next few days the NCAA would assume that they were guilty of rules violations and punish their alma mater The NCAA thinks it is the 51st state Johnson told me Its investigators regularly solicit the assistance of law enforcement officials acting as if they have some kind of equal standing But they dont The NCAA is not a regulatory body It is merely an association that creates rules designed to prevent its labor force  college football and basketball players  from making any money Most of its investigations  investigations that are selective highhanded and a mockery of due process  are aimed at enforcing its dubious rules Over the last year as Ive stumbled across one outrage after another Ive wondered when someone in a position to do something about the NCAA  college presidents maybe Members of Congress  would stand up and say enough Its getting awfully hard to look the other way 
A Flood of Suits Fights Coverage of Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/health/religious-groups-and-employers-battle-contraception-mandate.html,In a flood of lawsuits Roman Catholics evangelicals and Mennonites are challenging a provision in the new health care law that requires employers to cover birth control in employee health plans  a highstakes clash between religious freedom and health care access that appears headed to the Supreme Court  In recent months federal courts have seen dozens of lawsuits brought not only by religious institutions like Catholic dioceses but also by private employers ranging from a pizza mogul to produce transporters who say the government is forcing them to violate core tenets of their faith Some have been turned away by judges convinced that access to contraception is a vital health need and a compelling state interest Others have been told that their beliefs appear to outweigh any state interest and that they may hold off complying with the law until their cases have been judged New suits are filed nearly weekly  This is highly likely to end up at the Supreme Court said Douglas Laycock a law professor at the University of Virginia and one of the countrys top scholars on churchstate conflicts There are so many cases and we are already getting strong disagreements among the circuit courts President Obamas health care law known as the Affordable Care Act was the most foughtover piece of legislation in his first term and was the focus of a highly contentious Supreme Court decision last year that found it to be constitutional  But a provision requiring the full coverage of contraception remains a matter of fierce controversy The law says that companies must fully cover all contraceptive methods and sterilization procedures approved by the Food and Drug Administration including morningafter pills and intrauterine devices whose effects some contend are akin to abortion As applied by the Health and Human Services Department the law offers an exemption for religious employers meaning those who meet a fourpart test that their purpose is to inculcate religious values that they primarily employ and serve people who share their religious tenets and that they are nonprofit groups under federal tax law But many institutions including religious schools and colleges do not meet those criteria because they employ and teach members of other religions and have a broader purpose than inculcating religious values We represent a Catholic college founded by Benedictine monks said Kyle Duncan general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which has brought a number of the cases to court They dont qualify as a house of worship and dont turn away people in hiring or as students because they are not Catholic In that case involving Belmont Abbey College in North Carolina a federal appeals court panel in Washington told the college last month that it  could hold off on complying with the law while the federal government works on a promised exemption for religiouslyaffiliated institutions The court told the government that it wanted an update by midFebruary Defenders of the provision say employers may not be permitted to impose their views on employees especially when something so central as health care is concerned Ninetynine percent of women use contraceptives at some time in their lives said Judy Waxman a vice president of the National Womens Law Center which filed a brief supporting the government in one of the cases There is a strong and legitimate government interest because it affects the health of women and babies She added referring to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Contraception was declared by the CDC to be one of the 10 greatest public health achievements of the 20th century  Officials at the Justice Department and the Health and Human Services Department declined to comment saying the cases were pending A compromise for religious institutions may be worked out The government hopes that by placing the burden on insurance companies rather than on the organizations the objections will be overcome Even more challenging cases involve private companies run by people who reject all or many forms of contraception The Alliance Defending Freedom  like Becket a conservative group  has brought a case on behalf of Hercules Industries a company in Denver that makes sheet metal products It was granted an injunction by a judge in Colorado who said the religious values of the family owners were infringed by the law  Twothirds of the cases have had injunctions against Obamacare and most are headed to courts of appeals said Matt Bowman senior legal counsel for the alliance It is clear that a substantial number of these cases will vindicate religious freedom over Obamacare But it seems likely that the Supreme Court will ultimately resolve the dispute The timing of these cases remains in flux Half a dozen will probably be argued by this summer perhaps in time for inclusion on the Supreme Courts docket next term So far two and threejudge panels on four federal appeals courts have weighed in granting some injunctions while denying others One of the biggest cases involves Hobby Lobby which started as a picture framing shop in an Oklahoma City garage with 600 and is now one of the countrys largest arts and crafts retailers with more than 500 stores in 41 states  David Green the companys founder is an evangelical Christian who says he runs his company on biblical principles including closing on Sunday so employees can be with their families paying nearly double the minimum wage and providing employees with comprehensive health insurance Mr Green does not object to covering contraception but considers morningafter pills to be abortioninducing and therefore wrong  Our family is now being forced to choose between following the laws of the land that we love or maintaining the religious beliefs that have made our business successful and have supported our family and thousands of our employees and their families Mr Green said in a statement We simply cannot abandon our religious beliefs to comply with this mandate The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit last month turned down his familys request for a preliminary injunction but the company has found a legal way to delay compliance for some months  These cases pit the First Amendment and a religious liberty law against the central domestic policy of the Obama administration likely affecting many tens of thousands of employees The First Amendment says that Congress shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion or prohibiting the free exercise thereof and much attention has been focused in the past two decades on the issue of free exercise meaning preventing governmental interference with religious practices Freeexercise cases in recent years have been about the practices of small groups  the use of a hallucinogen by a religious group for example  rather than something as central as the Affordable Care Act The cases also test the contours of a 1993 law known as the Religious Freedom Restoration Act The law prohibits the federal government from imposing a substantial burden on any religious practice without a compelling state interest The burden must also be the least restrictive possible  Professor Laycock of the University of Virginia said The burden is clear especially for religious organizations which ought to be able to run themselves in accordance with their religious teachings They are being asked to pay for medications they view as evil He added that because the health care law had many exceptions including for very small companies the government might find it hard to convince the courts that contraception coverage is in fact a compelling interest But William Marshall a First Amendment scholar at the University of North Carolina Law School said the Supreme Court asserted in a 1990 opinion by Justice Antonin Scalia that religious groups had a big burden in overcoming a valid and neutral law of general applicability  You could have an objection of conscience to anything the government wants you to do  pay taxes because they will go to war or to capital punishment or having your picture on your drivers license Mr Marshall said The court has made clear that religious groups have no broad right for such exceptions Mr Laycock said that while judges are supposed to be neutral they too can get caught up in the culture wars Judges sympathetic to womens sexual autonomy would probably come down on one side of the dispute and those more concerned with religious liberty on the other he said There is a lot of political freight on this issue he

"Divided by Abortion, United by Feminism",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/27/opinion/sunday/douthat-divided-by-abortion-united-by-feminism.html,IN 1942 71 years before last weeks Pentagon decision allowing women on the front lines of combat the United States government established the Womens Army Corps with Athena as its insignia and welcomed our countrys first female military recruits One of these pioneering women was a corporal from Big Spring Tex named Nellie Gray After the war ended Gray finished college with an assist from the GI Bill and moved to Washington DC where she worked for decades at the State Department and the Department of Labor earning a law degree at night from Georgetown University along the way Then the social upheavals of the 1970s arrived the soldierturnedbureaucratturnedlawyer helped found one of Americas most enduring mass movements establishing an annual protest march that continues to the present day That protest is the March for Life the annual rally against Roe v Wade  When she organized the first march in January 1974 it drew 20000 antiabortion marchers to the capital On Friday 40 years after Roe and six months after Grays death at the age of 88 the marchers numbered in the tens or even hundreds of thousands If she had chosen a different political cause Grays trajectory  from soldier to working woman to professional activist  would be a case study for students of secondwave feminism But the cause she did choose  and in whose service she issued strident attacks on feminist abortionists  has endured precisely because it has had a more complicated relationship to female advancement than some cultural stereotypes would suggest Those stereotypes link the antiabortion cause to traditionalist ideas about gender roles  to the belief that a womans place is in the home or at least that her primary identity should be maternal rather than professional Writing in the Reagan era the sociologist Kristin Luker argued that this dimension of the debate trumped the question of whether unborn human life has rights While on the surface it is the embryos fate that seems to be at stake the abortion debate is actually about the meaning of womens lives  This remains a dominant prochoice understanding of the abortion conflict  and not without reason since it finds vindication to this day in the idiot mansplaining of amateur gynecologists like Todd Akin  But such an understanding was too simplistic when Nellie Gray founded the March for Life and its grown steadily less compelling with time As Jon Shields of Claremont McKenna College pointed out last year prolife sentiment has been steady over the last four decades even as opposition to women in the work force or the military or the White House has largely collapsed Most antiabortion Americans today are also gender egalitarians indeed Shields notes prolife attitudes toward womens professional advancement have converged so quickly with prochoice attitudes that the average moderately prolife citizen is a stronger supporter of gender equality than even the typical strongly prochoice citizen was in the early 1980s Among the younger generation any divide over womens roles nearly disappears entirely The prolife cause has proved unexpectedly resilient in other words not because millions of Americans are nostalgists for a world of stricter gender norms but because they have convinced themselves that the opportunities the feminist revolution won for women can be sustained without unrestricted access to abortion  This conviction is crucial to understanding why opinion on abortion has been a persistent exception to the liberalizing cultural trends that have brought us gay marriage medical marijuana and now women in combat It helps explain too why public opinion on the issue doesnt break down along the gendered lines that many liberals expect  why more women than men for instance told the latest Pew survey that abortion was morally wrong and in smaller numbers that Roe should be overturned It also has longterm implications for how the abortion debate plays out The best way to argue with a Todd Akin is to dismiss him as a chauvinist a creep and the enemy of a more enlightened future But the best prochoice rebuttal to the young idealists at the March for Life or the professional women who lead todays antiabortion groups isnt that theyre too reactionary  its that theyre too utopian too radical too nave This means that the abortion rights movement once utopian in its own fashion is now at its most effective when it speaks the language of necessary evils warning Americans that while it might be pretty to think so the equality they take for granted simply cant be separated from a practice they find troubling For its part if the prolife movement wants not only to endure but to triumph then it needs an answer to this argument That means something more than just a defense of a universal right to life It means a realists explanation of how in policy and culture the feminist revolution could be reformed without being repealed
Indonesia's Sexual Education Revolution,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/world/asia/28iht-educlede28.html,YOGYAKARTA INDONESIA  Dozens of teenagers who had just finished a Planned Parenthood training session met with a local official in this provincial capital and questioned him about the lack of sex education in their schools  One student held up a poster that read We only live once why marry early referring to a common situation in which young couples are forced to wed because of unwanted pregnancies  Sumarsono head of reproductive health at the womens and social empowerment agency in Yogyakarta responded that there were already too many subjects in school Due to the limitations in the curriculum our effort now is to make sex education an extracurricular activity he said The meeting was part of a larger effort to push for legislation that would make sex education a mandatory part of Indonesias national curriculum Yogyakarta a university town known for its vibrant student and cultural life has been at the forefront of Indonesias sexual education revolution  Were trying to ensure information reaches a broader audience said Andreas Nugahita 13 who attended the meeting The more people understand the more they can take responsibility for their own sexual behavior That could change teenagers attitudes toward sex all across Indonesia  Andreas is one of hundreds of students who have been trained as peer educators by Planned Parenthood in Yogyakarta a province with one of the countrys most progressive reproductive rights communities The hope is that they will pass along information about HIVAIDS contraception and sexual orientation to their classmates most of whom learn about sex through the Internet  Here sex is considered taboo and as a result talk about sex is filled with myths said Mariana Amiruddin executive director of Jurnal Perempuan or Womens Journal  Jurnal Perempuan is one of three private organizations forming the Sexual and Reproductive Health and Rights Task Force which has drafted a sex education curriculum that is to be tested in the coming months Selected schools in 10 districts across Indonesias vast archipelago will be part of the project  People need to know that the lack of knowledge is really bringing youth down said Dyana Savina Hutadjulu a program officer for sexual and reproductive rights at Hivos a global development agency helping to coordinate the effort We have this conservative point of view because for generations sex has been seen as a bad thing  Ms Hutadjulu said the effort to make sex education mandatory was an uphill battle  Sex education advocates were initially encouraged when Dr Nafsiah Mboi a physician who has promoted youth outreach and condom use was appointed as Indonesias health minister in June  According to a 2011 survey by the Ministry of Health only 20 percent of Indonesians aged 15 to 24 had comprehensive knowledge of HIV a figure that Dr Nafsiah said required a dramatic improvement  I believe in reaching out to youth  I do believe they have the right to information she said in an interview after a media briefing by the UN AIDS agency in October Dr Nafsiah however stepped back from her support for sex education after her campaign to promote condom use among groups at risk of contracting HIV provoked a public backlash last year  This backandforth is indicative of the wider effort to promote sex education In Indonesia many conservative officials feel that sexual topics are too sensitive to be discussed publicly and oppose mandatory sex education Groups like the Indonesian Council of Ulema are also influential in the majorityMuslim country Students dont need to be taught about sexuality  they can do that on their own Maruf Amin chairman of the Indonesian Council of Ulema said in an interview last year What they need to know is about limitations so they will know not to have sex before marriage  Maesur Zaky director of Planned Parenthood in Yogyakarta said the mayor of Kulon Progo was pushing for sex education to be compulsory which would make it the first district in Indonesia to do so The mayor had backed a decree to allow schools to integrate sex education in the curriculum but had run into resistance from the local department of education  There must be a better understanding about reproductive health said the mayor Hastro Wardoyo It would be better if it became a part of the curriculum but whats important is that the substance is taught to the students Sri Mulatsih head of the local department of education said the curriculum had to be tested first We dare not launch the program without making sure its suitable That would be dangerous she said  Its a tricky issue said Mr Zaky who explained that officials did not want to be seen as promoting promiscuity by advocating protected sex among youths They dont want to be judged as immoral  Still advocates are making some headway in getting sex education into schools  Planned Parenthood in Yogyakarta has been providing sex education since 2008 More than 50 schools in Yogyakarta Province have agreed to start using the organizations curriculum which includes lessons about contraception and sexually transmitted diseases The Yogyakarta curriculum has been used a loose model for the proposed national one  Last year Planned Parenthood in Yogyakarta started holding workshops to help parents discuss protected sex with their children  We dont talk about this with our parents said Farah Suhailah 15 a Planned Parenthood peer educator And if teachers talk about it they feel uncomfortable Reproductive rights advocates warn that low awareness about sex and sexuality is fueling a rise in cases of HIV unwanted pregnancy early marriage and unsafe abortions  The way we convince teachers to be brave and sensitive is by showing them the facts Mr Zaky said  A study last year by the Ministry of Health found that 42 percent of patients with HIVAIDS in Indonesia were aged 20 to 29 A survey commissioned by international health organizations in 2011 for World Contraception Day showed that nearly half of Indonesians surveyed had a close friend or family member who had an unplanned pregnancy in recent years more than Thailand India or China  Michelle Bachelet executive director of UN Women who visited Jakarta in December to attend meetings about womens rights said at the time If we see the facts we see that young people are starting their sexual life very young with no information and making bad choices  Inna Hudaya director of Samsara a Yogyakartabased organization that provides counseling and advice mostly to girls and women about safer sex and abortion said talking about unwanted pregnancy opened the door to discussions of other issues  Many youths know how to have sex but they dont know the consequences she said  Samsara has a sexuality and reproductive health school that hosts villagelevel workshops where they talk about body image and teach women how to perform selfexams for breast cancer  Sex education is not just about biology said Zoya Amirin an Indonesian sexologist who is writing a book to dispel common myths about sex It might teach you about reproduction but it doesnt teach you how to say no to premarital sex how to tell your boyfriend or girlfriend I think I need to wait for sex until Im ready
Where Abortion Bans Lead,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/01/28/where-abortion-bans-lead/,"Often lost in the neverending national argument over abortion is what a ban on the medical procedure would actually entail what penalties would actually apply to scofflaws But State Rep Cathrynn Brown of New Mexico
                                        is bringing such pesky practical issues into the limelight Last week she introduced a bill that read literally would make it a thirddegree felony for women to terminate pregnancies resulting from rape  by classifying such abortions as tampering with evidence
                                        Heres the exact phrasing Tampering with evidence shall include procuring or facilitating an abortion or compelling or
                                        coercing another to obtain abortion of a fetus that is the result or criminal sexual penetration or incest with the intent to destroy evidence of the crime Complicating the debate over whether a fetus is a person Ms Brown offers a third possibility A fetus is evidence Â A rape victim would have to carry her fetus to term lest she
                                        impede the criminal investigation into her own rape
                                         After a totally predictable outcry Ms Brown reworked her bill to exempt victims from prosecution and insisted she never even meant it to apply to victims only to whoever
                                        committed rape or incest The latest version is a garbled mess Tampering with evidence shall include a person committing criminal sexual penetration or incest procuring or facilitating an abortion or compelling or coercing another to obtain an abortion of a fetus that is
                                            the result of the persons act of criminal sexual penetration or incest with the intent to destroy evidence of the crime In no circumstance shall the mother of the fetus be charged under this subsection Scott Forrester the executive director of the New Mexico Democratic Party said on Friday that since the bill still makes it a crime to facilitate
                                        an abortion in cases of rape or incest it leaves the door open for criminal prosecution of doctors nurses or anyone else who works at a health care clinic where this is one of the services
                                        provided It also continues to classify a fetus as evidence If Roe were overturned and states banned abortion in some or all circumstances state legislatures would inevitably pass bills similar to Ms Browns Legions of otherwise lawabiding women doctors and nurses

                                        Democrat Representative Edward J Markey
                                        whom he will face in a primary in April  A new 60second campaign video introduces Mr Lynch 57 a former ironworker from South Boston to voters as someone who pulled himself up by the bootstraps  He has never forgotten where he came from the narrator says noting that Mr Lynch voted against the Wall Street bailout The video ends with this tag line Hell go to Washington to
                                        stand up not fit in  In advance of a threecity announcement tour Thursday Mr Lynch indicated in a radio interview with WBUR that the workingman image was a central part
                                        of his campaign strategy   He said he was running because he could bring that perspective to the exclusive Senate club He described himself as having slapped on a pair of work boots and growing up in housing projects  Ive struggled with a lot of the things that average people struggle with Mr Lynch said suggesting that Mr Markey 66 had not  Mr Lynch who started in Congress in 2001 suggested that Mr Markeys 38 years in Washington had distanced him from average people  Im not sure hes ever had a connection with the private sector or worked at a job that most people relate to and I think theres something missing Mr Lynch said of Mr Markey
                                        I dont think electing someone whos been in Washington for 38 years is going to provide that connection to average people  Mr Markey has about 3 million saved up for the race as well as the backing of much of the Democratic establishment including the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Mr Lynch enters the race with about 750000
                                        on hand and no major endorsements  Mr Lynch indicated that he would try to use Mr Markeys advantages against him  Im not going to try to purchase the election he said Im going to try to earn it  As for Mr Markeys backing by the national Democrats Mr Lynch said he thought the people of Massachusetts would want to pick their own senator rather than have the Washington establishment pick it for them  Shame on us to allow someone to clear the field box out all the other candidates and buy the election Mr Lynch said in Springfield on Thursday morning as he began his announcement tour  Mr Lynch is the most conservative member of the states Congressional delegation and has a record of voting against abortion rights Aware that most voters in deepblue Massachusetts support abortion rights
                                        Mr Lynch suggested he would not try to overturn Roe v Wade the Supreme Court                                        decision that legalized abortion Ive never viewed attacking Roe v Wade as part of any solution and I certainly wouldnt do that in the United States Senate he said He said he supported the use of birth control  Mr Markey released a statement in the afternoon saying I welcome Stephen Lynch into the race for US Senate He said he hoped Mr Lynch would join him in a pledge to discourage outside special interests
                                        from running expensive ads in the campaign  He also indicated that his strategy against Mr Lynch would be to emphasize his own more liberal voting record which he believes is more in line with the states Democratic tradition  We need a senator who continues to stand up for the progressive values that John Kerry                                        and Massachusetts believe in and whos focused on creating the jobs our economy needs Mr Markey said in his statement Thats why Im running for Senate  The primary is set for April 30 So far no Republican candidate has announced for the Senate seat which was vacated this week by John Kerry upon his confirmation as secretary of state Former Senator Scott P Brown could be the Republican candidate for the special election set for June 25 but he has not indicated his intentions"
Perryâ€™s Agenda Touches on Both Policy and Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/01/us/perrys-agenda-touches-on-both-policy-and-politics.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor at The Texas Tribune writes a column for The Tribune Two years ago in his State of the State speech Gov Rick Perry set up the legislative session and a future presidential run with a laundry list of issues dear to Republican primary voters His address on Tuesday was subtler but still political Trust state legislators to give less than their complete devotion and attention to his suggestions but the key word is complete Some of his ideas make it into state policy and some dont And the speeches are best read as hybrids of policy and politics setting up the governors agenda for a legislative session as well as the foundation for his next election cycle With Mr Perrys interest in national office those cycles come every two years now instead of every four The politics are easy this time Mr Perry has not said whether he will seek reelection in 2014 or whether he will run for president again in 2016 But a politician planning for a race in either year could have done a lot worse than the governors performance He talked about fiscal conservatism and how well the Texas economy is doing because of a light regulatory touch He reiterated his loathing of the federal governments health care plans while also saying the state stands ready to work with the reelected president And he spent something like 68 billion on tax breaks water roads and a financing swap involving highway money and state police Mr Perry stayed out of the redmeat market on social issues for instance he didnt talk about his support for a proposal to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy to prevent fetal pain though he had been at an antiabortion rally on the Capitol grounds three days earlier Social conservatives didnt get much This is a fiscal program The tax breaks deserve particular attention Mr Perry wants lawmakers to set 18 billion aside for tax refunds or breaks He asked them to back a constitutional amendment that would allow refunds Should the Legislature agree voters would see that amendment in November probably after a campaign with a slogan like Hey you dont want money back do you Five months later those voters will be passing judgment  in party primaries  on the lawmakers who offered the breaks on the November ballot That is pretty good politics Not that lawmakers listen to what governors want this was Mr Perrys seventh effort and if the Legislature took these things more seriously it would be different around here We wouldnt have a staterun lottery  it would have been sold to create an endowment fund for public education and an insurance program for the poor Thats from Mr Perrys 2007 speech Thats also where he raised the idea of a 3 billion fund to fight cancer also paid for with money from the sale of the Texas Lottery It turned into the Cancer Prevention and Research Institute of Texas financed with government bonds and it turns out riddled with problems of great interest to auditors and perhaps prosecutors We would be building a huge network of roads rail and utility easements across the state called the TransTexas Corridor That one didnt survive the opposition of property rights activists Texas is still building roads but the idea of 1200footwide ribbons of infrastructure draped across the state is dead Students in Texas would be allowed to pay for private schooling with public money  a voucher or school choice proposal that was in the governors 2003 speech and that reappeared periodically after that including in this weeks address Those misses have not had much effect on Mr Perrys success in state elections and the rhetoric sometimes has as much political value as the idea behind it The governor was less overtly political this time out but he was political just the same He has not put any items on emergency status  a designation that allows the Legislature to consider a bill during the first 60 days of a session Two years ago Mr Perry stoked the government furnaces with emergency proposals for immigration voter photo identification required sonograms for women seeking abortions a call for a balanced federal budget and property rights The emergencies are missing this time but not the politics Watch the spending ideas  and the declarations against participating in the federal health care law Those could be in play in 2014 Or 2016 Or both
"Edward I. Koch, a Mayor as Brash, Shrewd and Colorful as the City He Led, Dies at 88",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/nyregion/edward-i-koch-ex-mayor-of-new-york-dies.html,Edward I Koch the master showman of City Hall who parlayed shrewd political instincts and plenty of chutzpah into three tumultuous terms as New Yorks mayor with all the tenacity zest and combativeness that personified his city of golden dreams died Friday He was 88 Mr Kochs spokesman George Arzt said he died of congestive heart failure at 2 am at NewYorkPresbyterianColumbia hospital The former mayor had experienced coronary and other medical problems since leaving office in 1989 But he had been in relatively good health despite  or perhaps because of  his whirlwind life as a television judge radio talkshow host author law partner newspaper columnist movie reviewer professor commercial pitchman and political gadfly Ebullient flitting from broadcast studios to luncheon meetings and speaking engagements popping up at show openings and news conferences wherever the microphones were live and the cameras rolling Mr Koch in his life after politics seemed for all the world like the old campaigner running flat out Only his bouts of illness slowed Mr Koch most recently forcing him to miss a screening on Tuesday of Koch a documentary biographical film that opened in New York City on Friday Mayor Michael R Bloomberg praised him as an irrepressible icon our most charismatic cheerleader and champion calling him a great mayor a great man and a great friend Mr Kochs 12year mayoralty encompassed the fiscal austerity of the late 1970s and the racial conflicts and municipal corruption scandals of the 1980s an era of almost continuous discord that found Mr Koch caught in a maelstrom day after day But out among the people or facing a news media circus in the Blue Room at City Hall he was a feisty slippery egoist who could not be pinned down by questioners and who could outtalk anybody in the authentic voice of New York as opinionated as a Flatbush cabby as loud as the scrums on 42nd Street as pugnacious as a West Side reform Democrat mother Im the sort of person who will never get ulcers the mayor  eyebrows devilishly up grinning wickedly at his own wit  enlightened the reporters at his 475 rentcontrolled apartment in Greenwich Village on Inauguration Day in 1978 Why Because I say exactly what I think Im the sort of person who might give other people ulcers His political odyssey took him from independentminded liberal to pragmatic conservative from streetcorner hustings with a little band of reform Democrats in Greenwich Village to the pinnacle of power as the citys 105th mayor from Jan 1 1978 to Dec 31 1989 Along the way he put an end to the career of the Tammany boss Carmine G De Sapio and served two years as a councilman and nine more in Congress representing with distinction the East Side of Manhattan With his trademark  Howm I doin  Mr Koch stood at subway entrances on countless mornings wringing the hands and votes of constituents who gave him 21 electoral victories in 26 years with only three defeats a forgettable 1962 State Assembly race a memorable 1982 primary in a race for governor won by Mario M Cuomo and a last Koch hurrah a Democratic primary in 1989 won by David N Dinkins who would be his oneterm successor Led New York Into Prosperity In retrospect how did he do By the usual standards of measuring a former mayors legacy  the city he inherited the challenges he faced the resources available to meet those challenges and the extent to which his work endured beyond his term  historians and political experts generally give Mr Koch mixedtogood reviews Most important he is credited with leading the city government back from near bankruptcy in the 1970s to prosperity in the 1980s He also began one of the citys most ambitious housing programs which continued after he left office and eventually built or rehabilitated more than 200000 housing units revitalizing onceforlorn neighborhoods Politically Mr Kochs move to the right of center was seen as a betrayal by some old liberal friends but it gained him the middle class and three terms in City Hall He was also the harbinger of a transformation in the way mayors are elected in New York with candidates relying less on the old coalition of labor unions minority leaders and Democratic clubhouses and more on heavy campaign spending and television to make direct appeals to a more independentminded electorate In the end however he was overwhelmed by corruption scandals in his administration and by racial divisions that his critics contended he sometimes made worse Mr Koch for whom the headline Hizzoner seemed to have been coined was a bachelor who lived for politics Perhaps inevitably there were rumors some promoted by his enemies that he was gay But no proof was offered and except for two affirmations in radio interviews that he was heterosexual he responded to the rumors with silence or a rebuke Whether I am straight or gay or bisexual is nobodys business but mine he wrote in Citizen Koch his 1992 autobiography Mr Koch was New Yorks most colorful mayor since Fiorello H La Guardia Tall squintyeyed baldish with a nimbus of gray and a Ushape smile more satanic than cherubic Mr Koch told a story like a raconteur in a deli kvetching and ahhahing with the timing of a Catskill comic He loved to clown for photographers on the streets of New York on a camel in Egypt or on a mechanized sweeper in China His image on television his highpitched voice on the radio his round shoulders and gangly arms and baggy pants and especially his streetwise gusts of candor  saying what people said over the dinner table in Queens the Bronx and Brooklyn  gave New Yorkers the illusion that he was a rumpled familiar acquaintance But for all his selfpromoting stream of consciousness he was an intensely private man who revealed little about himself and had no patience for introspection Even at the small dinner parties he gave for close political associates and innercircle friends whether at Gracie Mansion or in his postmayoral apartment at 2 Fifth Avenue there were few real intimacies some participants recalled The conversations were eclectic a dance of politics public affairs and Mr Kochs city of art and culture His first term students of government say was his best Confronted with the deficits and the constraints of the citys brush with bankruptcy in 1975 he held down spending subdued the municipal unions restored the citys creditworthiness revived a moribund capital budget began work on longneglected bridges and streets cut antipoverty programs and tried to reduce the friction between Manhattan and the more traditionminded other boroughs Reelected in 1981 with 75 percent of the vote  he became the first mayor in the citys history to get both the Democratic and the Republican nominations  Mr Koch markedly improved the citys finances in his second term Helped by a surging local economy state aid and rising tax revenues the city government with a 500 million surplus rehired workers and restored many municipal services He also made plans for major housing programs improvements in education and efforts to reduce welfare dependency A Troubled Third Term Mr Koch riding a huge crest of popularity was elected in 1985 to a third term with an amazing 78 percent of the vote Only two other mayors in modern times La Guardia and Robert F Wagner Jr had achieved third terms and both found them to be quagmires For Mr Koch the storm clouds had already begun to gather Less than two weeks after Mr Kochs inauguration his ally Donald R Manes the Queens borough president attempted suicide  he succeeded two months later  in a troubling prelude to one of the worst corruption scandals in city history What followed was a series of disclosures indictments and convictions for bribery extortion perjury and conspiracy that touched various city agencies Much of the skulduggery centered on the Transportation Department and the Parking Violations Bureau Stanley M Friedman and Meade H Esposito  the Democratic bosses in the Bronx and Brooklyn respectively and Koch supporters  were convicted Mr Friedman went to prison and Mr Esposito who was in ill health received a suspended twoyear sentence and a fine Anthony R Ameruso the transportation commissioner was forced to resign and the scandal snared businessmen lawyers parking meter attendants sewer inspectors and others Scores of convictions were obtained by the United States attorney in Manhattan Rudolph W Giuliani No one accused Mr Koch of any wrongdoing Most of the accused were not his appointees and none were senior advisers he had always kept a distance from his commissioners letting them run their departments with relative independence Mr Koch said that he was shocked that he had been blindsided by subordinates and associates whose schemes he could not possibly have divined He always said he had befriended Mr Friedman Mr Esposito Mr Manes and others because they controlled votes that could make or break legislation he wanted approved or killed But critics said Mr Koch had become too close to the Democratic bosses in pursuit of his own ambitions and accusations of complacency and cronyism dogged him for the rest of his tenure Mr Koch was also harshly criticized for what was called his slow inadequate response to the AIDS crisis in the 1980s Hundreds of New Yorkers were desperately ill and dying in a baffling public health emergency By the end of his mayoralty more than 5000 AIDS patients had died in New York City Critics especially in the gay community accused him of being a closeted gay man reluctant to confront the crisis for fear of being exposed For years Mr Koch was upset and defensive about the criticism In a 1994 interview with Adam Nagourney a New York Times correspondent and coauthor with Dudley Clendinen of Out for Good The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America Mr Koch said that New York had done more than San Francisco for people with AIDS But that never got through to the gay community Mr Koch said They were brainwashed that they were getting shortchanged in New York City and in San Francisco they were getting everything And it wasnt true but you could never convince them The scandals and the scourges of crack cocaine homelessness and AIDS were compounded by a widening rift between Mr Koch and black New Yorkers The mayor traced his contentious relationship with black leaders to his firstterm decision to close Sydenham Hospital in Harlem where he said the city was paying too much for inadequate care He would regret the decision It was the wrong thing to do Mr Koch who rarely secondguessed himself said in 2009 Closing the hospital saved 9 million he said but there was such a psychological attachment to Sydenham because black doctors couldnt get into other hospitals  it was the psychological attachment that I violated Black leaders were also unhappy with Mr Kochs decision to purge antipoverty programs and comments he made that they considered insensitive He said for example that busing and racial quotas had done more to divide the races than to achieve integration and that Jews would be crazy to vote for the Rev Jesse Jackson in his 1988 presidential campaign after Mr Jacksons 1984 reference to New York as Hymietown and his call for a Palestinian homeland in Israel In a city where minorities had long held grievances against a largely white police force Mr Kochs 1983 appointment of Benjamin Ward as New Yorks first black police commissioner hardly appeased critics and a series of ugly episodes came to symbolize mounting racial troubles In 1984 a white officer with a shotgun killed a black woman Eleanor Bumpurs 66 as she was being evicted from her Bronx apartment he was acquitted In 1986 a gang of white teenagers assaulted three black men in Howard Beach Queens chasing one Michael Griffith to his death on a highway And in 1989 a black youth Yusuf K Hawkins 16 who went to Bensonhurst Brooklyn to see a used car was attacked by white youths and shot dead Mr Hawkinss death came just a month before Mr Koch faced Mr Dinkins the Manhattan borough president and the only black candidate in the 1989 Democratic primary By then City Hall was lurching from crisis to crisis The racial divisions the corruption scandals the failures to cope with crack and homelessness all contributed to a sense it was time for a change Mr Dinkins pledging to bring the city together again in a gorgeous mosaic narrowly defeated Mr Koch in the primary and went on to beat Mr Giuliani who ran on the Republican and Liberal lines by a slender margin in the general election I was defeated because of longevity not because Yusuf Hawkins was murdered six weeks before the election although that was a factor Mr Koch wrote in New York magazine People get tired of you So they decided to throw me out And so help me God as the numbers were coming in I said to myself Im free at lastÂ  Son of Immigrants Edward Irving Koch was born in Crotona Park East in the Bronx on Dec 12 1924 the second of three children of Louis and Joyce Silpe Koch Polish Jews who had immigrated to New York separately in the early 1900s Louis was a furrier and a partner in a shop until it folded in the Depression in 1931 The family then moved to Newark sharing an apartment with Louiss brother who ran a catering business At age 9 Edward like his humbled father began working for his uncle in a hatandcoatcheck concession He later worked as a delicatessen clerk and went to South Side High School in Newark One day when he was 13 and vacationing in the Catskills he leapt into a lake swam out and saved his sister Pat 6 from drowning Though a B student he was president of his school debating society While his brother Harold was athletic Edward pursued stamp collecting and photography After Edwards graduation in 1941 the Koches back on their feet in the fur business moved to Ocean Parkway in Brooklyn For the next two years the young man went to City College in Manhattan and worked as a shoe salesman He was drafted into the wartime Army in 1943 and earned two battle stars in Europe as an infantryman After VE Day because he could speak German he was sent to Bavaria to help remove Nazi public officials from their jobs and find nonNazis to take their place He was a sergeant when discharged in 1946 After the war he moved back in with his parents but did not return to undergraduate studies City College awarded him a bachelors degree in 1981 Instead he went to law school at New York University He received his law degree in 1948 was admitted to the bar in 1949 and over the next 20 years practiced law in New York City becoming a founding partner of Koch Lankenau Schwartz  Kovner in 1963 Mr Koch began his life in politics in 1952 as a streetcorner speaker for Adlai E Stevenson who lost the presidential election to Dwight D Eisenhower In 1956 already in his 30s Mr Koch moved out of his parents home took an apartment in Greenwich Village and joined the Village Independent Democrats a club opposed to Mr De Sapio and the Manhattan Democratic organization known as Tammany Hall Mr De Sapio a power broker whose dark glasses gave him a sinister air could make or break legislators judges even mayors But as district leader in Greenwich Village he had a narrow base He had lost his post in 1961 to a reformer James Lanigan But it was Mr Koch supported by Mayor Wagner who ended the De Sapio era thwarting his return to power in the district primary elections in 1963 and 1965 Heading a growing reform movement Mr Koch won a City Council seat in 1966 and befriended liberal causes like antipoverty programs and rent controls By 1968 he was ready to move up An opponent of the Vietnam War and a supporter of Senator Eugene J McCarthys presidential candidacy Mr Koch with Democratic and Liberal backing upset Whitney North Seymour Jr in what was called a classic American race  a son of immigrants versus the scion of a family rooted in national history  and became representative for the 17th Congressional District the first Democrat to occupy the seat since 1934 The seat representing the affluent Upper East Side parts of Midtown and Greenwich Village was held by John V Lindsay until he became mayor in 1966 Mr Koch later represented the 18th District after a redistricting Mr Koch in Congress from 1969 to 1977 became known as a hardworking independent liberal able to work with conservatives He cosponsored a law that gave citizens access to their government files and introduced legislation for a national commission on drug abuse He supported public transportation and housing Social Security and tax reform home health care for the elderly aid to Israel amnesty for draft resisters solar energy research federal financing of abortions and consumer protection measures He was reelected to the House four times by majorities of 62 percent to 77 percent While in Congress he stayed in Washington two weekends He said he got the bends when outside New York too long Every Thursday night he went home for a weekend of campaigning and meeting constituents Still he was almost unknown outside his district when he ran for mayor in 1977 facing six people in the Democratic primary including the incumbent Abraham D Beame Mario Cuomo then New Yorks secretary of state Representatives Herman Badillo and Bella S Abzug the Manhattan borough president Percy E Sutton and Joel W Hartnett a businessman and civic watchdog But there was wide dissatisfaction with Mayor Beames handling of the fiscal crisis in 1975 Time magazine put him on the cover as a beggar with a tin cup Many New Yorkers were also worried about rising crime and spending on social programs Mr Koch benefited from support by The New York Post but he made the crucial moves In one master stroke he hired the consultant David Garth to run his campaign Sensing the citys rightward drift Mr Garth devised a more conservative image for Mr Koch a formidable task because the candidate had portrayed himself as a liberal and he had no wife and children with whom to pose for the decorous voter To the rumors about his sexuality his standard answer was that it was no ones business but his own Placards sprouted in the 1977 mayoral campaign saying Vote for Cuomo Not the Homo Mr Koch did not respond at the time but 12 years later in his book His Eminence and Hizzoner he recalled When I first saw those posters I cringed and I wondered how I would be able to bear it Although Mr Cuomo always disclaimed responsibility for the posters Mr Koch never forgave him as he made clear with a pointedly disparaging reference to Mr Cuomo in a recorded interview with The Times that was not to be made public until Mr Kochs death Asked on a WMCA radio show in 1989 about his sexuality Mr Koch said that he was heterosexual I happen to believe that there is nothing wrong with homosexuality he said Its whatever God made you It happens that Im heterosexual but I dont care about that I do care about protecting the rights of 10 percent of our population who are homosexual and who dont have the ability to protect their rights Mr Koch appeared often in the 1977 race with his close friend and adviser Bess Myerson a former Miss America and a popular former city commissioner of consumer affairs In the campaign Mr Koch attacked Mayor Beames clubhouse politics and proclaimed himself a liberal with sanity  a competent manager who would see the city right He made frequent campaign trips to the boroughs outside Manhattan where he denounced welfare abuse unconscionable demands by municipal unions and wasteful spending by city agencies He vowed to crack down on crime advocated the death penalty in some cases and promised to abolish the Board of Education as a lard barrel of waste It worked Mr Koch received 20 percent of the primary vote to Mr Cuomos 19 percent Mr Koch then won a runoff against Mr Cuomo and went on to take the general election against State Senator Roy M Goodman a Republican Barry Farber a Conservative and Mr Cuomo who had the Liberal Party line and the dubious distinction of losing three times to Mr Koch that autumn Tackling Financial Ills Resigning his House seat Mr Koch took the reins of a city government that faced a 400 million deficit crumbling streets and bridges heavy demands from labor leaders and a bond market that put city securities somewhere between unreliable and unsalable Many businesses and middleclass residents were leaving with concomitant losses in tax revenues and jobs The mayor rolled up his sleeves After reaching a settlement with the unions he scaled down the budget ordered the attrition of 10 percent of the citys 200000member work force and with state officials revised a fiscal recovery plan that sought the aid of banks and the state and federal governments Congress approved loan guarantees of 2 billion enabling the city to get back into the bond markets and the road to recovery was paved Mr Koch cut city services and patronageladen antipoverty programs There were outcries from some black and Hispanic leaders that he was favoring the middle class but he balanced the budget in his first term He also issued an order prohibiting discrimination in city jobs on the basis of sexual orientation and proposed laws to limit smoking in public places and to provide public financing of political campaigns But he had little success in taking back some of the power that had been diffused in previous administrations He failed to gain control of the quasiindependent Health and Hospitals Corporation and the Board of Education But he got his man Frank J Macchiarola hired as schools chancellor and his former deputy mayor  Robert F Wagner Jr son of former Mayor Wagner  named president of the school board After winning his second term Mr Koch ran for the Democratic nomination for governor It was a mistake compounded by campaign blunders he conceded later In an interview with Playboy magazine he called suburbia sterile and rural America a joke The comments provoked an uproar from insulted suburbanites and upstate residents whose votes he needed Mr Cuomo the lieutenant governor won the primary and went on to become governor In the end Andy Logan wrote in The New Yorker the joke was on Koch He had always been frank leaving himself open to charges of callousness At various times he skewered and provoked the wrath of Jews and gentiles business and union leaders blacks and whites feminists and male chauvinists He vilified his Tammany foes as crooks and moral lepers goodgovernment panels as elitists black and Hispanic leaders as poverty pimps neighborhood protesters as crazies and Ms Abzug as wacko He was never a man of deep intellect or great vision students of government and even his associates conceded But they said he was more complex than his blurted assessments and gratuitous insults implied Critics said he could be petty selfrighteous and a bully when his ideas or policies were attacked But associates and admirers pressed to explain how the mayor could be so popular while reducing city services and apparently alienating so many groups insisted that Mr Koch had extraordinary political instincts and theatrical flair and that his candor only reflected what many New Yorkers had long thought themselves It was one thing for a politician to offer excuses for litter crime and poor transit service as so many did But it was another to say as Mr Koch did It stinks Over time many New Yorkers especially the middle class came to accept and relish his puckish candor The honeymoon lasted two terms After the corruption scandals broke however the politics of candor paled and critics said the mayor began to lose his touch flipflopping on issues as political winds shifted He first sought more accountability from his commissioners then softened he first opposed then supported immunity for those who confessed to bribing public officials Mr Kochs thirdterm agenda was ambitious plans to improve education and to cut the welfare rolls and a 10year 51 billion capital proposal to attack homelessness and the housing shortage by building or rehabilitating hundreds of thousands of units The housing plan based on dozens of city financing and ownership programs would become a notable and longlasting success It began with a stock of 10000 properties abandoned by owners or seized by the city for tax delinquency By the end of the Koch administration 3000 apartments had been created in formerly vacant buildings 13000 more were under construction and design work had begun on 20000 more In the next 15 years over four mayoral administrations 200000 more units were built or restored the number of vacant lots dropped sharply and the original stock of 10000 abandoned buildings was reduced to under 800 But in Mr Kochs final years in office his programs were all but overshadowed by scandals As the mayor waffled prosecutors charged that thousands of parking meter attendants and sewer electrical and housing inspectors had taken graft An avalanche of indictments and convictions ensued And the administrations troubles multiplied 50000 homeless people crowded into shelters and roamed the streets and subways and there was a surge of crackrelated crimes and growing outrage in minority communities over claims of police brutality Then in 1987 the stock market collapsed and even the prosperity that had sustained the treasury and the mayors popularity began to flag Mr Koch had a mild stroke that August and associates said he seemed for a time to lose heart By the end of his third term Mr Koch was tired His original faith in governments capacity to solve the problems of families and communities had been eroded the old liberal had embraced the new creed of Reaganesque reliance on selfhelp and it seemed that he had lost some of his old selfconfidence Its a big city you dont know how to get your arms around it and government becomes the enemy he told Sam Roberts of The Times a few months before he left office Twelve years ago if someone attacked me I wouldnt let them get away with it Id take them on I now perceive my job to include allowing people to vent their rage After leaving office Mr Koch gave up his rentcontrolled flat for a twobedroom apartment on lower Fifth Avenue but he gave no thought to retiring He instead became a oneman media show with forums on television and radio and in newspapers magazines and books besides being a lawyer endorsing commercial products lecturing and teaching He earned over 15 million a year Mr Koch had occasional medical problems He suffered what doctors called a moderate heart attack in 1999 and in 2009 he underwent quadruple bypass surgery and replacement of his aortic valve He had worn a pacemaker since collapsing with an irregular heartbeat in 1991 There were subsequent hospitalizations for various ailments On March 22 1999 he was briefly hospitalized with low blood pressure hours before he was to be arrested with scores of others in protests organized by a onetime foe the Rev Al Sharpton over the police shooting of Amadou Diallo an unarmed immigrant from Guinea Getting himself arrested for a cause raised only a few eyebrows Mr Koch almost a decade out of office still wanted to march at the head of the parade In 2008 approaching 84 he was still pitching  endorsing Barack Obama for president shaking the hand of the visiting Pope Benedict XVI even generating publicity with his own burial plans Koch Resolved to Spend Eternity in Manhattan Buys a Cemetery Plot a Times headline said In 2010 Mr Koch took on his most ambitious fight in years leading a coalition New York Uprising against what he called a dysfunctional Legislature in Albany He traveled the state on a mission to shame lawmakers who failed to sign a pledge to promote reforms Throw the bums out he shouted in Buffalo Youre either on the side of angels or youre a bum And if the angels betray their pledges Im going to run around the state screaming Liar liar pants on fireÂ  At various times he wrote columns for The Post The Daily News the online magazine Jewish World Review and the rightwing Web site NewsMaxcom He also wrote movie and restaurant reviews for local weeklies He made regular appearances on WCBSTV had talk shows on Fox television and on WNEW and WABC radio teamed with former Senator Alfonse M DAmato for a Bloomberg Radio program and was a frequent commentator on the local news television station NY1 His remarks often sounded like pronouncements by an officeholder proposing policy changes and oozing invective for political opponents and journalistic rivals Mr Koch denied he was wreaking vengeance on old foes but as he told New York magazine Its a lot more fun being a critic than being the one criticized Political Influence Lasted Out of office Mr Koch remained influential in New York politics He crossed party lines to support Mr Giuliani in the 1993 mayoral election an endorsement crucial to Mr Dinkinss defeat But Mr Koch later turned against Mr Giuliani flaying him as a good mayor but a terrible person and refusing to endorse him for a second term Mr Koch endorsed Mr Bloombergs successful races for mayor as a Republican in 2001 and 2005 calling him about as Republican as I am Mr Bloomberg later refashioned himself as an independent And when Mr Bloomberg engineered a legislative finesse of termlimits laws to run for a third term in 2009 Mr Koch backed him and called for an end to term limits In presidential races Mr Koch went back and forth He supported the losing Democratic ticket of Al Gore and Joseph I Lieberman in 2000 but joined the BushCheney reelection bandwagon in 2004 and promoted the Republican National Convention in New York urging New Yorkers to make nice to conventioneers By 2008 he was back with the Democrats supporting Hillary Rodham Clintons bid for the nomination and when she lost switching to Mr Obama Mr Kochs only official work in recent years was a 2007 appointment to a panel examining the state comptrollers office after a scandal that forced out Comptroller Alan G Hevesi Mr Koch appeared mostly as himself in a score of movies including The Muppets Take Manhattan and The First Wives Club and in cameo roles on television shows including Sex and the City And he was the star of course of Koch the documentary film by Neil Barsky that had its premiere on Tuesday at the Museum of Modern Art Mr Koch hospitalized was forced to miss the event For years Mr Koch worked out with a personal trainer almost every morning at a gym He became a partner with Robinson Silverman Pearce Aronsohn  Berman which in a 2002 merger became Bryan Cave an international law firm and one of the largest real estate practices in New York He provided advice and brought in many clients He became an adjunct professor at New York University Brandeis University and Baruch College of the City University of New York and gave lectures across the country and abroad with minimum fees of 20000 for offthecuff talks on race relations drugs antiSemitism or Koch on the City Koch on the State or Koch on Everything From 1997 to 1999 he was the judge on the nationally syndicated show The Peoples Court hearing small claims and ribald testimony like that of a man who claimed he suffered whiplash from a topless dancers breasts Mr Koch was done in by the competing Judge Judy  Judith A Sheindlin a retired New York City Family Court judge  and was replaced by her husband Gerald Sheindlin a retired State Supreme Court justice Mr Koch had appointed both to the bench He wrote more books  17 in all  murder mysteries commentaries on politics and other subjects Most were a blend of his insights experiences and observations with coauthors providing the workaday prose In office he produced Mayor 1984 Politics 1985 and His Eminence and Hizzoner 1989 Later came All the Best Letters From a Feisty Mayor 1990 Ed Koch on Everything 1994 Im Not Done Yet 2000 and Buzz How to Create It and Win With It 2007 Mr Koch and his sister Pat Koch Thaler wrote Eddie Harolds Little Brother a childrens book that appeared in 2004 His brother Harold M Koch a carpet distributor died in 1995 Besides his sister a former dean at NYU whom he saw regularly in later years Mr Koch is survived by New York itself as an old friend put it a few years ago The city was and is his family said Maureen Connelly a former press secretary and veteran political adviser We used to be scared about what would happen to Ed if he lost We said it would be best if he just died in the saddle But he never had any intention of getting off the horse
Tales From the Pressroom About a Man Who Relished Publicity,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/nyregion/memories-of-koch-by-times-reporters-who-covered-him.html,Former Mayor Edward I Koch who died on Friday at age 88 loved to be in the spotlight and to spar with the press Here are the recollections of the man from three reporters at The New York Times who covered him  Joyce Purnick What was it like to cover the unavoidable Ed Koch people used to ask me Exhausting exhilarating frustrating endless persistent  did I say exhausting His voracious appetite for speaking out on anything and everything kept us going 247 long before the Internet He guaranteed us constant headlines and airtime and he made the journalistic practice of recording his every word a matter of selfdefense Once I missed a major story because I did not cover him on a routine visit to a public school Scrambling to catch up I told Mr Koch that someone should invent a way to plug into him and record him permanently Not a bad idea he said deadpan For those of us who covered his mayoral campaign of 1977 the colorful Koch emerged as if overnight He was forgive me a dull candidate heavy on the data Lots of studies Turns out he was being purposely dull following the orders of campaign advisers who knew his propensity for going off message There was in fact a pronounced informality to him When he was mayorelect he and his helpful friend Bess Myerson the former Miss America visited President Jimmy Carter We were on the same shuttle flight so they offered me a lift to the White House Somehow I found myself in the Oval Office introduced by the mayorelect Mr President this is uh Joyce My invasion lasted about two minutes until the Secret Service ushered me on out Sorry Mr Koch said Things did tighten up somewhat once he moved into City Hall  everything but the mayors need for making news for approval and for attention They were his oxygen I think But underlying the mayors flamboyance was a keen intelligence and he used it to bring New York City back to life after the fiscal crisis Covering him was more than anything else a matter of pulling off a balancing act not letting the shtick overwhelm the substance He could be deadly serious When traces of plutonium were found in the city water supply he sensed that the news could cause panic So he brought scientists from the federal government into City Hall to put the finding into perspective at a crowded news conference  but only after he called and briefed the top editors of each major daily newspaper I never saw him show much emotion But he did show interest in someone elses emotions  mine When my mother was terminally ill he spotted me looking distraught after a new doctor said my mother might have had a chance to live longer if shed gotten a different treatment Her course of treatment had been basically my call Mr Koch without my knowledge asked a top city health official to examine my mothers records then called me into his office to tell me that in the judgment of that official a doctor she had gotten the appropriate treatment Just another opinion but it helped That is a side of Ed Koch few knew and I only glimpsed Its the other Koch the selfabsorbed showman that most saw  probably too often But for most of his time as mayor Ed Koch presided in vivid color after the drab black and white of the troubled 1970s From the moment he walked into City Hall he was home He loved the job after all And oh did he love making sure that everyone knew it Â   Sam Roberts Ed Koch was a publicityhungry city councilman when I covered him for the first time but from the beginning he defied the stereotype of a grandstanding politician He invited me along on an unannounced raid at a Manhattan shelter to expose animal cruelty only to be persuaded by shelter officials that the animals in their care were being humanely treated No scandal No kneejerk righteous indignation No story There would be plenty of opportunities to cover him again since 1983 alone my byline has appeared on 466 articles that mentioned him as a mayor or former mayor not counting this one But I rarely encountered another politician who was as candid and who willingly eschewed a cheap shot He was not reticent of course He would almost always speak his mind Whatever was on it Unlike his successors he was perpetually accessible to the press almost to a fault A reporter having exhausted every other avenue of inquiry once playfully asked Mr Koch his favorite color To which he earnestly replied Blue Mr Koch was also the last mayor with a deep sense of humor even about himself Mayors are judged by the challenges they inherited the resources they mustered and the legacy they left By those measures Mr Koch belongs in New Yorks pantheon of great mayors along with the likes of Fiorello La Guardia New Yorkers have a knack for choosing the right mayoral candidate at the right time In 1977 when Mr Koch was first elected the city faced a fiscal crisis and needed a cheerleader in chief He was more than that though While he was lucky to inherit stateimposed fiscal constraints that empowered him to say no to the usual supplicants he managed to restore the city to a sound financial footing ahead of schedule He had the city build or renovate hundreds of thousands of apartments and attracted talent to government jobs And he instituted merit selection of judges campaign finance reform and further protections for preservation of landmarks and gay rights His critics said he overstayed his welcome by seeking an unprecedented fourth term  Its Koch against Koch Mario M Cuomo said and Koch is losing And he demonstrated a tin ear to voices of despair from the citys black neighborhoods But you always knew where he stood like it or not And he remained relevant fully a generation after his defeat in 1989 He wanted to be mayor for life he said and he succeeded Many New Yorkers thought mayor was his first name With Ed Koch almost no subject was off limits his life his death he paid 20000 for a burial plot and already had his tombstone inscribed and installed his net worth his eating habits his weight the revelation that his mother had an abortion his bout with depression But he did refuse to respond to questions about his sexual orientation beginning back when Greenwich Village bachelor was code for gay When New York legalized gay marriage in 2011 I asked Mr Koch if the cultural climate had progressed to the point where he was ready to reveal what was widely perceived as his sole remaining secret None of your business he replied along with a profanity  Clyde Haberman It may safely be said that Ed Koch had few unexpressed thoughts a trait that both delighted and frustrated reporters who trailed him on a daily basis as I did for much of his first term as mayor No one Mirandized Ed Koch to inform him that he did in fact have the right to remain silent Sometimes the endless flow of his pronouncements were translated into formal New York policy If you have ever wondered why restaurants in this city from the greasiest spoons to the most haute of cuisines must display Heimlich maneuver posters it is because a choking Mr Koch was rescued by that technique at a Chinatown restaurant in the summer of 1981 The next thing you knew he invited Dr Henry J Heimlich to City Halls Blue Room allowing himself to be used as a guinea pig while the doctor demonstrated his maneuver for reporters In short order the posters became mandatory Several things about that episode spoke volumes about Mr Koch One undeniable fact was that he had a sense of humor Not every mayor would have stood at the lectern looking amused or maybe bemused while two reporters  me and a New York Times colleague  tried to make light of his publicity stunt by bringing in Chinese takeout to the news conference and dipping chopsticks into our cartons while he spoke Another undeniable fact is that he sensed the political ramifications of almost any situation Mr Koch who was Jewish but did not keep kosher said he had choked on a piece of watercress Six years later he acknowledged to reporters that he had also been eating spare ribs There is little question that the watercress was a wedge of pork But back in August 1981 Election Day was three months away Under no circumstance as he himself said later was he about to needlessly alienate even one observant Jewish voter There were times however when Mr Kochs inability to keep thoughts to himself betrayed him In 1982 in what he later admitted to have been a bout of hubris he ran for governor When he first began talking about that race I reminded him that he used to say how he once stood at the Western Wall in Jerusalem and promised God that he would never seek higher office if only he could become mayor Mr Koch bristled He jabbed his finger in my direction and said angrily That was a pledge between God and me not with you and me I felt obliged to point out to him that he had not kept his prayers to himself To which he replied If I were to take an action God would consider violative he would punish me And he was punished His old rival Mario M Cuomo cleaned his clock in that race
Seeing Darwin Through Christian Eyes? It All Depends on the Christian,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/us/seeing-darwin-through-christians-eyes.html,On Jan 22 Rush D Holt a Democrat who represents central New Jerseys 12th Congressional District introduced a resolution designating Feb 12 2013  Charles Darwins 204th birthday  as Darwin Day recognizing the importance of science in the betterment of humanity Perhaps a day in honor of Darwin would help the cause of science if only a little I hope we can hold hearings Mr Holt said where people can hear about Darwin and science and the jobs it creates the lives it saves everything Mr Holt a nuclear physicist by training would probably not have the support of his colleague Paul Broun a Republican from Georgias 10th Congressional District Representative Broun a doctor is famous among science lovers for having told the Liberty Baptist Church Sportsmans Banquet last fall that all that stuff I was taught about evolution and embryology and the Big Bang theory all that is lies straight from the pit of hell Evolution he added is one of those lies to try to keep me and all the folks who were taught that from understanding that they need a savior Two congressmen two Christians and two very different views of the man who in 1859 published On the Origin of Species A century and a half after the publication of the book that changed our understanding of the living world this amazingly creative man as Mr Holt called Darwin in an interview this week still gets a whupping from politicians trying to scare up the votes of conservative Christians On Tuesday night Mr Brouns wife told a room of surprised onlookers that her husband would be running for the Senate in 2014 Mr Holt says he is a Christian whose spiritual home is the Quaker meeting in Princeton NJ Mr Broun whose spokeswoman said he was expected to make an announcement about his possible candidacy in the next week attends a Baptist church in Athens Ga and is a member of the Gideons the group that places Bibles in hotel rooms Many Christians of course believe that Darwins theory of evolution by natural selection is compatible with a Christian worldview The Roman Catholic Church for example is comfortable with Darwin especially as his work relates to the evolution of bodies souls come from God In 1996 Pope John Paul II wrote confirming older Catholic teaching that there is no conflict between evolution and the doctrine of the faith Ronald L Numbers a science historian at the University of Wisconsin said that many evangelical Protestants were once willing to accept the theory as long as it was applied only to animals not to humans For example the Tennessee law that gave rise to the famous Scopes trial in 1925 banned the teaching of human evolution not the teaching of evolution Mr Numbers said And the reason was that most people were concerned about its ethical teaching he added If you read the first chapter of Genesis its very clear humans were created perfect then they sinned then degeneration set in Whereas evolutionists of any stripe believed humans had progressed over millennia or longer NonChristians too worried about the way Darwins teachings could be twisted Exposs coming out of World War I indicated that the German high command had been influenced by Darwinism Mr Numbers said The Germans interpreted it as the idea that might makes right that only the strongest will survive he said  As time went on Darwin was blamed for all sorts of moral decay In the trial of Leopold and Loeb two University of Chicago students who murdered a 14yearold boy in 1924 he said there was the argument they had killed little Bobby Franks in cold blood because they had imbibed Darwinism and lost any respect for human life The argument was hinted at by Clarence Darrow their defense lawyer who went on to defend John T Scopes on charges that he had taught human evolution in Tennessee Darrow specifically mentioned the pernicious influence of reading Nietzsche but others saw Darwins malignant hand at work In the 1960s as Americans racing the Russians to the moon embraced science fears of Darwin were calmed a bit But as Chris Mooney the author of The Republican War on Science points out the 1970s a time of rising power for evangelicals also saw a resurgence in Darwinism as a code word for all that they loathed Evolution is connected to the culture of Roe v Wade Mr Mooney said referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized most abortions You take down humans sense of selves as something created therefore you lower and debase them and they act like beasts and do all these immoral things Then you get teen pregnancy and outofwedlock pregnancies et cetera Today Darwins name energizes not only Christians but skeptics  Edwina Rogers executive director of the Secular Coalition for America said that when her coalition polled more than 1800 of its supporters education issues a topic that includes creationism and antiDarwinism in public schools were their top concern This is what they care about more than anything Ms Rogers said They want their kids to be able to go out in the world and get jobs based on scientific knowledge I asked Mr Holt if he had

A Good Compromise on Contraception,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/02/opinion/a-good-compromise-on-contraception.html,The Obama administration has proposed a sensible way to provide women who work for religiously affiliated institutions with free coverage of contraceptives while exempting the organizations they work for from financial or administrative obligations to provide the coverage  For the past year the administration has been battered by lawsuits and denunciations from religious conservatives that its health care reforms violate religious liberties by requiring employers to provide free birth control coverage even if the employers have moral objections Those attacks were designed to try to discredit the health care reform law and hurt President Obama politically by portraying him falsely as an opponent of religious freedom  All along churches and other houses of worship have been exempted from the laws requirements The issue has been whether organizations that have an affiliation with religious institutions like universities and hospitals that employ thousands of people of different faiths and views on contraception should be granted an exemption from providing free contraceptive services as well  Neither the Constitution nor Supreme Court precedents give religiously affiliated institutions the right to be exempted from a neutral law of general applicability The First Amendment is not authorization for religious entities or individuals claiming a sincere religious objection to the law to impose their religious beliefs on society Nevertheless responding to those attacks the administration a year ago proposed a reasonable compromise between religious objections and the right of women to affordable birth control It put the burden on insurance companies to provide free contraceptive coverage to women who work for religiously affiliated employers without requiring any involvement by the employers On Friday the administration issued a more detailed proposal that is now open for public comment It does not seem to depart in any significant way from the earlier policy and some advocates for womens reproductive rights like the American Civil Liberties Union and Naral ProChoice America praised the proposal It modifies the definition of a religious employer and certain affiliated organizations to follow a section of the Internal Revenue Code more closely And for the first time it provides guidance for the large religiously affiliated institutions that selfinsure or pay their own medical costs rather than buy insurance coverage These institutions can simply notify the companies that administer their plans that they will not cover contraceptives and those companies would then look for a health insurer to offer separate individual contraceptive coverage at no cost to the women  It will take some close accounting to figure out how best to handle the payment process for the coverage in the short run In the long run contraceptive coverage should save money by improving womens health and reducing the number of unwanted pregnancies abortions and medical complications from pregnancy 
Will Justice Kennedy Vote for Voting Rights?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/opinion/sunday/will-justice-kennedy-vote-for-voting-rights.html,Justice Anthony Kennedy regards himself as a teacher The main role of the Supreme Court he has said is to instruct Americans about the Constitutions fundamental values so they know what it takes to preserve American democracy In Shelby County v Holder which the Supreme Court will hear this month he is likely to cast the deciding vote between the conservatives and moderate liberals in a critical choice about the essence of democracy  the right to vote The case presents a clash between Americas national commitment to racial equality and Alabamas contention that states have the constitutional prerogative to regulate their own elections In other landmark cases like a 2003 decision recognizing privacy rights and a 2005 case striking down the death penalty for juveniles Justice Kennedy voted for fairness In these instances he was a moralist concerned about constitutional values yet willing to balance the importance of court precedents against the weight of the most salient facts That approach should lead him to the fair result in this case too The issue in Shelby County is whether Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act viewed as the nations most effective civil rights law remains necessary to prevent racially biased voting laws in nine states and parts of seven others with egregious histories of discrimination against minority voters Under Section 5 those states and localities must prove to the Justice Department or a special court in Washington DC that any proposed changes in election laws are not discriminatory before they can go into effect Covered jurisdictions in the statutes terms must preclear any changes In 2009 the Supreme Court voted 8 to 1 to uphold Section 5 but Chief Justice John Roberts Jr wrote that the section now raises serious constitutional questions and must be justified by current needs Shelby County argues that it should be struck down because there is no longer proof of the unremitting defiance that existed when the Voting Rights Act was passed in 1965 Justice Kennedys record makes it difficult to know for sure how he will vote in this case But there is reason to hope that he will vote to uphold Section 5 because in cases on constitutional rights where the facts make clear an injustice he tends to hew less to the simplicity of conservative ideology and to look for more nuanced solutions In two important cases in the last decade however he has voted against using race as a factor in government policy In a 2007 case involving the Seattle public schools he cast the deciding vote with the conservatives in a 5to4 decision against letting the school system take account of a students race in assignment of students to achieve or maintain diversity in each school And in a 2003 case also decided 5 to 4 that preserved the use of race as one factor to consider in university admissions he dissented But in both rulings he wrote opinions distinguishing his views from those of the conservative bloc In the case about public school diversity he rejected colorblindness as a basis for the courts decision calling it an alltoounyielding insistence that race cannot be a factor in instances when in my view it may be taken into account In the case about university admissions he endorsed the use of race as a plus factor in admissions but said the courts majority had failed to scrutinize the program as rigorously as it must when it examines a racial preference In the Shelby County case as a federal trial court and a federal appeals court found there is no room for equivocation If Justice Kennedy votes to strike down Section 5 he will be calling a halt to an unfinished effort to end what the Supreme Court once called an insidious and pervasive evil Congress gathered an enormous amount of evidence in 2006 about the persistence of voting discrimination in covered jurisdictions It found that discrimination was still heavily concentrated in those places and so widespread that casebycase litigation  what Justice Kennedy has called very expensive very long and very inefficient  is inadequate Without Section 5 from 1968 through 2004 more than 1500 discriminatory voting changes  would have gone into effect And last year Section 5 blocked attempts to discriminate against voters in many parts of the country In three momentous constitutional cases Justice Kennedy voted to expand or uphold rights Writing the 2003 majority opinion that found the Texas sodomy law unconstitutional Justice Kennedy declared that liberty protected by the Constitution allows homosexual persons the right to express their sexuality as they choose In the death penalty case in 2005 he recognized that under the evolving standards of decency it was no longer constitutional to impose capital punishment for crimes committed by juveniles under 18 And in a landmark case in 1992 about abortion rights Justice Kennedy joined Justices Sandra Day OConnor and David Souter to uphold the core of Roe v Wade Justice Kennedy in each of these cases balanced facts precedents and constitutional values differently but in each one reached the conclusion that ultimately struck the American people as fair and proper The Shelby County case presents the same kind of task Justice now calls on him and the court to ensure the right to vote by upholding Section 5Â 
Battered California Republicans Find Hope in a Long Shot,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/03/us/kevin-l-james-a-long-shot-in-race-for-mayor-of-los-angeles.html,LOS ANGELES  Kevin L James a conservative talk show host running for mayor of Los Angeles was sitting in his campaign office recently pondering which was his bigger obstacle to victory being openly Republican or being openly gay Depending on what room youre in here sometimes its easier coming out gay to Republicans than it is coming out Republican to gays he said By any measure Mr James 49 is a bit of a long shot He is a Republican brassy former prosecutor running in a Democratic city at a time when California is marching steadily to the left making his first bid for office in a field of establishment candidates Yet in the first major election since President Obamas victory in November  voting that relegated the California Republican Party to the margins  Mr James has become at least for a few national Republicans something of a lifeline They see in his candidacy in the March 5 vote an outside chance to grab what could be a spiritlifting victory and perhaps even signal a way to get back in the game in California Fred Davis a Republican ad producer based in the Hollywood Hills who worked for the presidential campaign of Senator John McCain created a political action committee to finance an advertising campaign to help Mr James compete with his betterfinanced competitors Mr Davis was looking to raise 4 million from Republicans across the nation he has since scaled back that goal a bit he had raised 700000 as of Friday And Mr James has retained John Weaver a Republican political consultant who has long advised Mr McCain as his senior political adviser Mr Weaver has increasingly warned that Republicans are marginalizing themselves by moving to the right on issues like abortion gay rights and immigration He is from central casting about what a future Republican candidate can look like in an urban or blue state and win Mr Weaver said Its important for the party We have not done well nationally since we stopped winning in California Mr Jamess draw for these men is not only that he is a fiscal conservative who supports abortion rights and samesex marriage or that he is a colorful show horse in a field of gray At a debate the other night he kept standing up when it was his turn to speak even as everyone else settled politely into their chairs It is also who he is  or rather what he is Here I am talking to this intelligent Republican guy that no one has ever heard of who didnt have any personal money and Im thinking no way Mr Davis said recounting his first meeting with Mr James A couple of days later in researching the guy there was some mention that he was gay It was a great moment Mr Davis said Because all of a sudden all those social ills go away Theres nothing to be scared of Its one of the things that made me decide we should go ahead with this venture In theory this is as good a place as any to testdrive new Republican appeals States do not get much bluer than California in no small part because of the increase in the numbers of Latinos and AsianAmericans who are voting Democratic Even a partial victory by Mr James could be instructive for Republicans not to mention a tonic for a party that needs one It will not be easy On the national stage he is the perfect example of the Republican dilemma said Bill Carrick a Democratic consultant advising one of Mr Jamess Democratic rivals Eric Garcetti a member of the City Council He has to both energize a shrinking base of Republican voters who are decidedly more conservative than the rest of the citys electorate at the same time he reaches out to the ultimate Democratic voters Its a hell of a challenge But Mr James could well affect the final outcome here Given Mr Daviss effort and the crowded field Mr James is positioned to squeeze his way into a twoway runoff this spring If he does it will probably be at the expense of Wendy Greuel the city comptroller who is competing for the same votes in the San Fernando Valley where Mr James has a constituency Mr James has directed most of his attacks against her Whether he could beat a Democrat in a twoway race  polls suggest that the opponent would be Mr Garcetti  is decidedly less likely Mr James has not always been a Republican he registered as a Democrat during the height of the AIDS crisis when he was a member of the board of the AIDS Project Los Angeles viewing Democrats as much more concerned about AIDS issues He declined to say for whom he voted in November Mr Obama won 61 percent of the vote in California Im not going to go into the presidential race he said Its history its behind us and it doesnt apply to my race At the very least Mr James has provided a dash of drama to what has otherwise been a lowspark election to succeed Mayor Antonio R Villaraigosa At a League of Women Voters debate recently the moderator asked the candidates whether they would renegotiate the 56 percent raises due for city workers next year if the city was still in a fiscal crisis Mr Garcetti responded with a barely audible no Ms Greuel gave an equivocal answer that produced a rustle of laughter among a few in the audience Mr James jumped to his feet My opponents gave them those raises he said They must be renegotiated and I will do that Michael Saltz who hosted a block party for Mr James in the Woodland Hills neighborhood of the San Fernando Valley responded to that kind of appeal He is the only person running for mayor who is not responsible for the worst decline in the history of LA he said Mr Davis is known for making or proposing political advertisements intended to be provocative sometimes too much so He wrote an advertising plan for a political action committee working on behalf of Mitt Romney the Republican presidential candidate suggesting that it do exactly what John McCain would not let us do and produce advertisements linking Mr Obama to the racially incendiary sermons delivered by Mr Obamas former minister the Rev Jeremiah A Wright Jr The advertisement was never made Mr Davis said that while he was spending much of his energy on this race  his other clients include Rick Snyder the Republican governor of Michigan  he was careful not to exaggerate its potential symbolism Its a little tiny start he said Im not silly I dont think the mayor of Los Angeles is going to be the next face of the Republican Party But I think it would be an enormous wakeup call to the Republican Party if we succeeded
Fox News Monitors Geraldo as He Mulls Political Office,https://mediadecoder.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/04/fox-news-monitors-geraldo-as-he-mulls-political-office/,"Geraldo Riveras stated interest in running for a Senate seat in New Jersey has been derided as a joke                                        and a publicity stunt But his employers are taking it seriously Hed have to leave his weekend Fox News Channel show Geraldo at Large as soon as he formally decided to run a spokeswoman for the channel said Mr Rivera 69 has been a television reporter and commentator for decades and hes never sought political office before But last Thursday he floated the possibility of running for the Senate seat currently

                                        that he will vie for the seat Mr Rivera said he would run as a Republican if he decided to actually do so Although widely perceived to be one of the more liberal commentators on Fox News hes been a registered Republican for years Mr Rivera initially brought up his interest in running for the Senate seat on his talk radio show last Thursday The oneyearold show is distributed by Cumulus Asked whether Mr Rivera would have to quit or suspend
                                        the show if he decided to run a spokesman for the distributor said Talk radio hosts talk about lots of things and if at some point this is more than talk well address the issue appropriately then A Fox News spokeswoman went a little further saying in an email message Geraldo would have to step aside as soon as he made a formal decision and were continuing to monitor the situation Fox has faced similar situations in the past In 2011 when two of its paid contributors Newt Gingrich and Rick Santorum were considering running for president the network suspended their contracts                                        while they made up their minds The two men eventually did decide to run and severed their ties with the network For the time being Fox and the radio show are forums for Mr Rivera to talk about the possibility of running thereby drumming up attention and potential supporters In one of several interviews on Fox last Friday he said he had public service in the back of his mind when he decided to register as a Republican after moving to New Jersey in 1989 He said all of his
                                        elected heroes growing up were Republican But he was quite critical of the GOP in the interviews calling Republicans a party of scolds and proposing a more inclusive way forward Mr Rivera has long favored immigration reform and a womans

A Convenient Morality,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/opinion/bruni-a-convenient-morality.html,Last week the Obama administration proposed a further tweak to its rules about insurance coverage of contraception trying to quiet religious organizations complaints that the edict tramples on their beliefs Roman Catholic officials have been especially vociferous Their moral conviction they insist cannot be slave to secular convention Except that is when it works to their advantage When it profits them And this twotracked approach was illustrated by another recent news story one that flickered onto and then off the publics radar more quickly than it should have and deserves a closer look  The news story brought to light a wrongfuldeath suit by a widower Jeremy Stodghill in regard to his wife and the twin 28weekold fetuses inside her when she died in a Catholic hospital St Thomas More in Caon City Colorado The hospitals lawyers argued that the womans death couldnt have been prevented As to whether proper medical attention might have yielded the delivery of two healthy baby boys lawyers argued that the question was ultimately irrelevant because wrongful death can apply only to people and legally speaking fetuses arent human lives This isnt how the Catholic Church is supposed to see things Its the opposite The church staunchly opposes abortion holding that life begins at conception and has even raised concerns about the morningafter pill And the fetuses inside Lori Stodghill 31 were four weeks past whats generally considered viability  Lawyers by nature use the best strategies available to them in a brutal arena where failing to do so puts clients at a disadvantage And the Colorado litigation is just one case involving one Catholic hospital which may not have gotten any green light for its arguments from highranking church officials In fact Colorados three Catholic bishops on Monday released a statement that articulated their objection to the hospitals legal approach and said it should be abandoned henceforth But the hospital isnt some random outlier Its run by Catholic Health Initiatives which operates 78 hospitals in more than a dozen states And a habit of clinging to a religious identity one moment and abandoning it the next is visible beyond this case especially in the churchs management of its child sexual abuse crisis Weve been getting a fresh and galling peek into that with the courtcompelled release of documents from the Los Angeles Archdiocese which engaged in a pattern of willful blindness and outright coverup so egregious that the current archbishop Jos Gomez took the shocking step last week of publicly reprimanding his predecessor Cardinal Roger Mahony  The documents show that Mahony and his lieutenants repeatedly failed to report allegations to law enforcement officials and urged accused priests to leave or stay out of the state lest they face prosecution They decided in short that the churchs representatives and reputation mattered more than justice that the church could hold itself above laws that governed everybody else This was hardly isolated behavior Around the country the church has beaten back lawsuits by priests victims and tried not to furnish information about priests wrongdoing by claiming that such scrutiny violates the free exercise of religion said Jeffrey Anderson a Minnesota lawyer who has represented hundreds of victims over three decades Its audacious its bold and its across the board he said But the church has simultaneously reserved the right to behave just like any other institution leaning on legal technicalities smearing victims and demonstrating no more compassion than a tobacco company might show In the name of Jesus Anderson told me they do things that Jesus would abhor They do things erratically thats for sure From my extensive reporting on the sexual abuse crisis in the 1990s I dont recall any great push to excommunicate priests who forced themselves on kids But when Sister Margaret McBride in 2009 was part of a Phoenix hospitals decision to abort an 11weekold fetus inside a 27yearold woman whose life was gravely endangered by the pregnancy she indeed suffered excommunication later reversed So a fetus matters more than the ravaged psyche of a raped adolescent And Sister McBride deserved harsher rebuke than a rapist Its hard not to conclude that a church run by men shows them more mercy than it does women or for that matter children And its hard to keep track just when is the church of this world and when not It inserts itself into political debates trying to shape legislation to its ethics But it also demands exemption from taxes from accountability from health care directives And in the Colorado wrongfuldeath case the hospital suddenly adopted the courts not the churchs definition of life Only now with that argument already made is Catholic Health Initiatives saying it made a moral error  A district court rejected Jeremy Stodghills wrongfuldeath claims He and his lawyer Beth Krulewitch have appealed to the states Supreme Court One final verdict is already in On the charge of selfserving hypocrisy the church is guilty
"Bishop John Dâ€™Arcy, Who Sounded Alarm on Sex Abuse, Dies at 80",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/05/us/bishop-john-darcy-dies-at-80-sounded-alarm.html,Bishop John DArcy who was ignored by his superiors in the 1980s when he warned about priests who later figured in the sexabuse scandal that rocked the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston died on Sunday at his home in Fort Wayne Ind where he had led the Diocese of Fort WayneSouth Bend for 24 years He was 80 The cause was cancer said Sean McBride a diocese spokesman Bishop DArcy who retired in 2009 drew national attention that year when he led a boycott to protest the University of Notre Dames invitation to President Obama to speak at its commencement ceremony Bishop DArcy whose diocese encompassed the university campus objected that the presidents abortionrights views were in opposition to Roman Catholic teachings In Boston where he spent the first half of his clerical career Bishop DArcy then an auxiliary bishop wrote a series of letters to his superiors raising alarms about priests he considered troubled and dangerous The priests were being reassigned to new pastoral duties despite their known histories of substance abuse sexually abusing children or both and he urged his superiors to reconsider The letters became public in the early 2000s when archdiocese documents were released by court order as a result of lawsuits In one of his bluntest letters Bishop DArcy asked the newly appointed archbishop of Boston Bernard F Law to rescind the appointment of the Rev John J Geoghan as pastor of a parish in Weston Mass Father Geoghan has a history of homosexual activity with young boys Bishop DArcy wrote to the archbishop on Dec 7 1984 Father Geoghan was later accused of sexual abuse by 130 former parishioners many of them from the Weston parish He was strangled to death in a Massachusetts state prison by a fellow inmate in 2003 while serving a sentence for child sexual abuse Archbishop Law who became a cardinal in 1985 said he could not recall Bishop DArcys letter when asked about it years later in depositions concerning the abuse cases Bishop DArcy wrote cautionary letters about three other priests Thomas Forry Richard Buntel and Robert Meffan all of whom were later accused publicly of sexually abusing children In 1985 after writing a second letter about Father Geoghan to Cardinal Law Bishop DArcy was elevated from auxiliary bishop to full bishop status and appointed to the post in Fort WayneSouth Bend He never spoke publicly about his letters Terrence McKiernan founder of the Web site bishopsaccountabilityorg a repository of church documents released as a result of lawsuits and government investigations of sexual abuse by priests said letters like Bishop DArcys were rare There have been many internal memos about priests whom fellow clerics considered liabilities to the church Mr McKiernan said in an interview on Monday But I have read through thousands tens of thousands of these documents he added and seen very few with DArcys level of expression of concern for the victims John Michael DArcy was born on Aug 13 1932 in Boston and ordained in 1957 He served as a parish priest for nine years before being appointed the vicar for spiritual development at  St Johns Seminary in Boston In that role in 1979 he recommended a comprehensive rethinking of the archdioceses system of recruiting men for the priesthood Among other things he urged that candidates undergo psychological testing in part to screen out those who might not be sincere in taking vows of celibacy A 2003 report on sexual abuse by priests in the archdiocese issued by Attorney General Thomas Reilly of Massachusetts concluded It does not appear that the archdiocese adopted Bishop DArcys recommendations in any meaningful way Bishop DArcys boycott of Mr Obamas address at Notre Dame was one of two he led at the university when he was bishop of Fort WayneSouth Bend In the other in 1992 he protested the universitys plans to give an award to Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York again because of Mr Moynihans abortionrights views When Mr Obama was invited to give the commencement address in 2009 Bishop DArcy declared in an open letter to the university Notre Dame must ask itself if by this decision it has chosen prestige over truth Neither boycott changed the universitys commencement plans though both sparked national debate among Catholics He was very clear in his thinking and never hid his views from anyone no matter whom said the Rev John Sassani a parish priest in Boston who was a friend Bishop DArcys survivors include two sisters Sister Anne DArcy a nun with the Sisters of Saint Joseph and Joan Sheridan

                                        this subject among academics but before getting to that lets look back at some election results In the 16 presidential elections between 1952 and 2012 only one Democratic candidate Lyndon B Johnson in 1964 won a majority of the white vote There have been nine Democratic presidential nominees                                        who received a smaller percentage of the white vote than Obama did in 2008 43 percent and four who received less white support than Obama did in 2012 39 percent
                                         In 2012 Obama won 39 percent of the white electorate
                                        Four decades earlier in 1972 George McGovern received a recordsetting low of the ballots cast by whites 31 percent In 1968 Hubert Humphrey
                                        won 36 percent of the white vote in 1980 Jimmy Carter got 33 percent in 1984 Walter Mondale took 35 percent of the ballots cast by whites As far back as 1956 Adlai Stevenson tied Obamas 39 percent
                                        and in 1952 Stevenson received 40 percent  both times running against Dwight D Eisenhower Two Democratic nominees from Massachusetts Michael Dukakis in 1988 40 percent and John Kerry in 2004 41 percent
                                        got white margins only slightly higher than Obamas in 2012  and worse than Obamas 43 percent in 2008 In other words Obamas track record with white voters is not very different from
                                        that of other Democratic candidates Ballots cast for House candidates provide another measure of white partisanship These contests have been tracked in exit polls from 1980 onward
                                        Between 1980 and 1992 the white vote for Democratic House candidates averaged 496 percent It dropped sharply in 1994 when Newt Gingrich orchestrated the Republican takeover of the House averaging just 427
                                        percent from 1994 through 2004 White support for Democrats rose to an average of 467 percent in 2006 and 2008 as public disapproval of George W Bush and of Republicans in Congress sharply increased In the aftermath of Obamas election white support for Congressional Democrats collapsed to its lowest level in the history of House exit polling 38 percent in 2010 Â  at once driving and driven

                                            blacks have gotten less than they deserve 4 Its really a matter of some people not trying hard enough if blacks would only try harder they could be just as well off as whites The General Social Survey included questions asking respondents to rate competing causes of racial discrimination and inequality The scale was constructed from responses to the following 4 items 1 Irish Italian Jewish and many other minorities overcame prejudice and worked their way up Blacks should do the same without any special favors

                                        for their racialresentment scale The percentage of voters with explicit antiblack attitudes rose from 476 in 2008 and 473 percent in 2010 to 509 percent in 2012 Crucially Pasek found that Republicans drove the change People who identified themselves as Republicans in 2012 expressed antiBlack attitudes more often than did Republican identifiers in 2008 In 2008 Pasek and his collaborators note the proportion of people expressing antiBlack attitudes was 31 percent among Democrats 49 percent among independents and 71 percent among Republicans By 2012 the numbers
                                        had gone up The proportion of people expressing antiBlack attitudes they write was 32 percent among Democrats 48 percent among independents and 79 percent among Republicans At the moment the population of the United States 314 million
                                        is heading towards a majorityminority status in 2042 The American electorate on the other hand 126 million is currently 72 percent white based on the voters who cast ballots
                                         last November
                                     Obamas ascendency to the presidency means that on race the Rubicon has been crossed 2008 and recrossed 2012 What are we to make of these developments Is the country more or less racist How can the percentage of people holding antiblack attitudes have increased from 2006 to 2008 at a time when Obama performed better among
                                        white voters than the two previous white Democratic nominees and then again from 2008 to 2012 when Obama won a second term In fact the shifts described by Tesler and Pasek are an integral aspect of the intensifying conservatism within the right wing of the Republican Party Many voters voicing stronger antiblack affect were already Republican
                                        Thus in 2012 shifts in their attitudes while they contributed to a 4 percentage point reduction in Obamas white support did not result in a Romney victory Some Republican strategists believe the partys deepening conservatism is scaring away voters We have a choice we can become a shrinking regional party of middleaged and older white men or we
                                        can fight to become a national governing party John Weaver a consultant to the 2008 McCain campaign said after Obamas reelection Mark McKinnon an adviser to former President George W Bush
                                        made a similar point The party needs more tolerance more diversity and a deeper appreciation for the concerns of the middle class Not only is the right risking marginalization as its views on race have become more extreme it is veering out of the mainstream on contraception                                        and abortion positions that fueled an 11 point gender gap                                        in 2012 and a 13 point gap in 2008 Given that a majority of the electorate will remain white for a number of years the hurdle that the Republican Party faces is building the partys white margins by 2 to 3 points
                                        For Romney to have won he needed 62 percent of the white vote not the 59 percent he got Working directly against this goal is what Time Magazine recently described as the Republican brand
                                        identity that has emerged from the stars of the conservative media ecosystem Rush Limbaugh Sean Hannity Bill OReilly Ann Coulter and others It is not so much Latino and black voters that the Republican Party needs To win the White House again it must assuage the social conscience of mainstream moderate white voters among whom an ethos of tolerance has
                                        become normal These voters are concerned with fairness and diversity even as they stand to the right of center It is there that the upcoming political battles  on the gamut of issues from race to rights

Ã‰galitÃ© Meets Gay Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/opinion/global/the-gay-marriage-debate-in-france.html,In everything but name Frances Parliament system is in the throes of a filibuster  Since Feb 2 when the Socialist majority in the National Assembly voted to redefine marriage as an agreement between two people of the same or opposite sex the conservative opposition has filed more than 5000 amendments none of which they expect to pass into law in order to drag out the nations seemingly ineluctable march to legal recognition of gay marriage Many of the proposed amendments are meant to outrage A member of the UMP the neoGaullist party leading the resistance demanded that incestuous and polygamous marriages also be legalized in the name of equal rights  But of course the impact of such provocations can only be diluted when so many are launched During the first weekend of the debate the transcript of the proceedings announced Le Monde weighed in at more than 240000 words For all of its excess  one of the oppositions leaders is Frigide Bardot the stage name of brash comedian who describes herself after a pilgrimage to Lourdes as Jesus press attache  the debate reflects a deep and abiding moral and ideological divide in France  At the heart of the matter is the meaning of the trio of revolutionary values  liberty equality and fraternity  that France has made its own since 1789 In essence how are these powerful but abstract rights to be applied when it comes to sexuality and parenting And nowhere is the complexity and importance of the affair better and more brilliantly expressed than in the debate between two of Frances most influential intellectuals Elisabeth Badinter and Sylviane Agacinski  Both are professional philosophers both are republicans both are on the political left and both are married to towering political figures Robert Badinter was minister of justice under Franois Mitterrand while Agacinski is the wife of Lionel Jospin who served as a Socialist prime minister  And yet despite  or perhaps because of  these commonalities Badinter and Agacinski have repeatedly clashed over the character and implications of equality In particular they have fiercely disagreed over the role of gender and sex in the republican scheme of things The two first crossed swords in the 1990s during the debate over parit A number of womens groups exasperated by the persistently small percentage of women in political office argued for a law imposing sexual parity in political office  Agacinski rallied to the cause She felt that the Enlightenment conception of equality abstract and universal superbly ignored the flesh and blood realities of human existence Yet it was only natural given the revolutions emphasis on fraternity that 18th century men believed they were more equal than women Can one blame them As Agacinski observed no matter how much you try to abstract equality from the world the world  or more precisely our biology  will always pull you back Lifes fundamental dichotomy is the biological difference between a man and a woman Rather than pretending that this difference can be transcended Agacinski insisted on its recognition Hence the importance of political parity Only by acknowledging the difference between the sexes could inequitable situations be remedied The law was passed in 1999 despite the formidable barricade thrown up by Elisabeth Badinter On the eve of the vote she published an open letter in which she denounced the antirepublican essence of the proposed law In fact essence was the problem Badinter rejected what amounted to Agacinskis essentialist claims concerning sexual differences If France were to mandate political parity she warned it would mock revolutionary Frances liberating credo one based on the universal character of human rights  Attributing rights based on difference instead of sameness would reduce the nation to a motley collection of tribes each pursuing its own instead of the nations interest France would become little better than America where the range of hyphenated citizens would be as varied as the coffees at Starbucks A decade later the political context has changed but the positions staked out by these antagonists are the same  For both women the struggle is less over gay marriage  Agacinski has overcome her earlier diffidence on the subject and now supports its legalization  than over gay adoption and parenting In a number of books and articles Agacinski worries that the legal and medical advances that allow homosexual couples to adopt or procreate will unravel societys fabric The family she affirms is yoked to biological filiation  If we truly sought what is most universal in our lives we could go no further than the fact that a child can only issue from a father and mother that is to say a man and a woman We ignore this fundamental value only at our own and societys peril Agacinski warns Most alarming in her eyes is the burgeoning market in surrogate mothers women engaged in what she calls a commerce in human beings Where Agacinski glimpses the end of civilization as we know it Badinter sees civilization as we should know it Im fed up with those who label this an economic exchange she says  Desire not biology is essential The family she contends is the convergence of individual liberty and shared goals It is immaterial whether a couples child issues directly from the couple or a surrogate mother If anything is sacred it is not the womb but a couples desire whether they are infertile or gay to raise a child  The irony for Badinter is that scarcely a generation ago parents were compelled by law to have children they did not want while parents who do want children today are prevented by law from doing so The distance from antiabortion to antigay legislation she suggests is shorter than we might think In fact the distance between these struggles and 1789 is also shorter than it might first appear Both Agacinski and Badinter after all claim their respective positions have universal foundations For Badinter our common humanity is founded upon human reason whereas for Agacinski it issues from the universal character of human nature It turns out that even universalism is not universal Badinter lost the first round of her debate with Agacinski when the parity law passed if public opinion polls on the issue of gay marriage and adoption are reliable it seems certain Agacinski will lose the second round  But this remarkable match between these philosophers and the popular forces they represent will not be resolved anytime soon The future of the past has many more than 15 rounds in store for us  and this perhaps is yet another universal truth   Robert Zaretsky is a professor

Birth Control and Religious Freedom,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/09/opinion/birth-control-and-religious-freedom.html,To the Editor Re Bishops Reject Birth Control Compromise news article Feb 8 Were facing a critical moment in how we understand religious freedom in this country The continuing objections to the contraception requirement are only the most prominent of a series of objections to antidiscrimination rules in the name of religion All across the country we see inns and bakeries closing their doors to samesex couples religious schools firing employees who are unmarried and pregnant and nurses protesting even taking the blood pressure of abortion patients  all in the name of religious beliefs Real religious freedom gives to all the right to make personal decisions about how they practice their religion or dont It doesnt give them the right to impose their beliefs on others or to use religion as an excuse to discriminate by closing the door  of their office emergency room or bakery  because they disagree with the person seeking services LOUISE MELLING Director Center for Liberty American Civil Liberties Union New York Feb 8 2013  To the Editor When we let our bosses pick and choose what medical care we have access to we are protecting the private beliefs of a few to deny the essential needs of many Contraception is fundamental health care It supports and improves the health of women and children by enabling women to plan the spacing and timing of their pregnancies It is also used to prevent ovarian cysts and endometrial and ovarian cancers We should not trade away the health and individual liberties of the vast majority of American women who will use birth control at some point in their lives to quell a misdirected debate about religious freedom The employees who use birth control have a right to their religious freedom too JEAN BUCARIA Deputy Director NOWNYC New York Feb 8 2013  To the Editor A Good Compromise on Contraception editorial Feb 2 calls the administrations revision of the Health and Human Services mandate sensible An editorial at the beginning of this controversy labeled religious liberty a phony crisis Feb 11 2012 If this latest revision of the mandate suitably protects religious freedom one might assume that your earlier judgment may well have been a deliberate affront to those who protested its infringement on their religious liberty Moreover the mandate required and requires free insurance not only for contraception but also for abortioninducing drugs chemical and surgical sterilizations and a broad range of contraceptives approved by the Food and Drug Administration None of these are neutral issues for the Catholic Church which long advocated a broad new health care law that it then had to oppose when the HHS mandate was included forcing it to violate its moral principles Claiming that the opposition was contrived to defeat President Obama is a false if not nefarious claim The reasonableness you attribute to this latest revision which calls for a careful evaluation is that of the pragmatist Lets cut our losses declare victory and move on Msgr DANIEL S HAMILTON Lindenhurst NY Feb 4 2013  To the Editor  Your editorial missed the mark on a number of issues At stake was not just whether religiously affiliated organizations would be exempt Many including the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops wanted any employer who provided insurance to have the ability to opt out The socalled Taco Bell exemption that the bishops demanded went far beyond religious organizations A more important problem with the new policy that does depart in a significant way from the earlier policy is that many more organizations are included in the new accommodation Employees of a far wider range of institutions affiliated with a religion including schools and soup kitchens will now have to go through extra hoops to gain access to coverage for family planning It is unacceptable that so many women and men will be forced to do this because the bishops and their conservative allies dont recognize that the First Amendment prescribes a system that includes freedom from religion as well as freedom of religion JON OBRIEN President Catholics for Choice Washington Feb 5 2013
"Young, Liberal and Open to Big Government",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/us/politics/in-montana-young-liberal-and-open-to-big-government.html,MISSOULA Mont  This funky college town nestled along two rivers where five mountain ranges converge has long been a liberal pocket an isolated speck of blue in a deeply red state Now Montana is electing more politicians who lean that way thanks to a differentminded generation of young voters animated by the recession and social issues Sam Thompson a 22yearold environmental studies major at the University of Montana here considers himself fiscally conservative but opposes cuts to Medicare he expects to need health coverage when he grows old Aaron Curtis 27 a graduate student admired Jon Huntsman a moderate Republican but could not stomach Mitt Romneys opposition to samesex marriage Billie Loewen and Heather Jurva editors at the student newspaper speak of a Depressionera mentality that is pushing their generation to back Democrats Saddled with student debt they worry about health care and are terrified that they will not find good jobs MsÂ Jurva has worked 40 hours a week waiting on tables to put herself through school You might be just one accident away from losing everything said Ms Loewen It is no secret that young voters tilt left on social issues like immigration and gay rights But these students and dozens of other young people interviewed here last week give voice to a trend that is surprising pollsters and jangling the nerves of Republicans On a central philosophical question of the day  the size and scope of the federal government  a clear majority of young people embraces President Obamas notion that it can be a constructive force a point he intends to make in his State of the Union address on Tuesday Young people absolutely believe that theres a role for government said Matt Singer a founder of Forward Montana a leftleaning though officially nonpartisan group that seeks to engage young people in politics At the same time this is not a generation of socialists They are highly entrepreneurial and know that some of what it takes to create an environment where they can do their own exciting creative things is having basic systems that work Here in Montana a state that backed John McCain in 2008 and Mr Romney last year voters under 30 have helped elect two Democratic senators and a new Democratic governor Nationally young voters have since 2004 been casting their ballots for Democrats by far wider margins than previous young generations  a shift that could reshape American politics for decades Under30 voters are the only age group in which a majority said the government should do more to fix problems the nonpartisan Pew Research Center reported in November In a Pew survey a year earlier more than 8 in 10 said they believed that Social Security and Medicare had been good for the country and they were especially supportive of seeing the programs overhauled so they would be intact when they retire Young people were also more open than their elders to privatizing the programs And while Washington fights about how to cut the federal deficit young voters believe that it is more important to create jobs have affordable access to health care and develop a worldclass education system according to the Institute of Politics at Harvard Those sentiments were borne out in interviews here When Forward Montana convened a focus group at a Missoula cafe to develop a youth agenda last week the deficit did not register a mention One attendee Michael Graef an 18yearold who started a fitness business rather than attend college said he rarely thought about the deficit Education is top on my list he said If everybody is better educated most of the other issues can work themselves out Steve Bullock the new Democratic governor won after campaigning on a promise to freeze college tuition Young voters also helped Senator Jon Tester another Democrat who narrowly ousted a Republican incumbent in 2006 and won reelection last year Both times polls stayed open hours past their official closing time to accommodate huge lines of students Both times Forward Montana ran huge voter registration drives  an effort that may pay really big dividends for Democrats in the future said Christopher Muste a political scientist here The victories rattled Republican state lawmakers who are now trying to undo a Montana law that permits voters to register on Election Day Republicans say lastminute registration creates long lines and confusion On campus here last week dozens of students crowded into a stuffy conference room to hear Jorge Quintana a Democrat and chief counsel to the Montana secretary of state warn that their voting rights are under attack Nationally voters under 30 accounted for 19 percent of the electorate last year up from 18 percent in 2008 These millennials are by far the most ethnically and racially diverse voter cohort whites account for just 58 percent of them according to the Pew center while 76 percent of older voters are white That diversity is partly why young voters skew liberal said Scott Keeter the centers director of survey research As more young people come of age the electorate will grow more diverse Unless Republicans break the bonds between Democrats and minorities Mr Keeter said this alignment is going to be baked into the younger generation Kristen Soltis Anderson who studies young voters for the Winston Group which advises House Republicans said her party ignores young voters at its peril She sees a real risk that Republicans could lose millennials in the coming years So as Republican leaders focus on trying to attract more Hispanics and women Ms Anderson is urging them to develop a message that will appeal to the under30 crowd by emphasizing nongovernmental alternatives to solving problems as opposed to just limiting government When you ask young voters what caused the recession this whole idea that there wasnt enough regulation or it was George W Bushs fault is present she said When conservatives make the argument Hey the government needs to get out of the way and let you make decisions for yourself a lot of young people dont have this idea of the government as a boogeyman So it makes the conservative message less resonant There is of course no guarantee that millennials will hold onto their current liberal tendencies Studies show that voters are heavily influenced by the president with whom they came of age the Franklin D Roosevelt generation for instance stayed Democratic for decades while many in the Reagan generation remained Republican But views can evolve baby boomers who supported big government in their 20s and 30s have become more conservative over time the Pew center has found While todays young voters are more likely to identify as Democrats than Republicans or independents their ideas and philosophies are not quite fixed yet said John Della Volpe the polling director at Harvards Institute of Politics Here in Missoula young people who voted for Mr Obama last year said in interviews that they would be open to voting Republican particularly if a candidate supports samesex marriage Young Republicans too hope their party will shift on that issue The social issues are hard said Ashley Nerbovig a 19yearold who backed Mr Romney Its not realistic that you can be against gay marriage and abortion If the economy had been in better shape she said I would have picked Obama over Romney for social issues Mr Della Volpe said he saw opportunities for Republicans in the future if they could rebrand themselves Democrats meanwhile are looking ahead convinced by the data that their philosophy  if not their party  will prevail My analysis has been for a while that its going to come down to not whether the government should address certain problems but how said Ruy Teixeira a senior fellow at the leftleaning Center for American Progress in Washington Well shift from Does government even have a role to Given that government needs to play a role whats the best way of doing thatÂ  He added I expect those to be the arguments 10 or 15 years from now That would be a big shift but I think its coming
The Conscience of a Corporation,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/11/opinion/keller-the-conscience-of-a-corporation.html,DAVID GREEN who built a family pictureframing business into a 42state chain of arts and crafts stores prides himself on being the model of a conscientious Christian capitalist His 525 Hobby Lobby stores forsake Sunday profits to give employees their biblical day of rest The company donates to Christian counseling services and buys holiday ads that promote the faith in all its markets Hobby Lobby has been known to stick decals over Botticellis naked Venus in art books it sells  And the companys inhouse health insurance does not cover morningafter contraceptives which Green like many of his fellow evangelical Christians regards as chemical abortions  Were Christians he says and we run our business on Christian principles This has put Hobby Lobby at the leading edge of a legal battle that poses the intriguing question Can a corporation have a conscience And if so is it protected by the First Amendment The Affordable Care Act a k a Obamacare requires that companies with more than 50 fulltime employees offer health insurance including coverage for birth control Churches and other purely religious organizations are exempt The Obama administration in an unrequited search for compromise has also proposed to excuse nonprofit organizations such as hospitals and universities if they are affiliated with religions that preach the evil of contraception You might ask why a clerk at Notre Dame or an orderly at a Catholic hospital should be denied the same birth control coverage provided to employees of secular institutions You might ask why institutions that insist they are like everyone else when it comes to applying for federal grants get away with being special when it comes to federal health law Good questions You will find the unsatisfying answers in the Obama handbook of political expediency But these concessions are not enough to satisfy the religious lobbies Evangelicals and Catholics cheered on by antiabortion groups and conservative Obamacarehaters now want the First Amendment freedom of religion to be stretched to cover an array of forprofit commercial ventures Hobby Lobby being the largest litigant They are suing to be exempted on the grounds that corporations sometimes embody the faith of the individuals who own them The legal case for the religious freedom of corporations does not start with Does the corporation pray or Does the corporation go to heaven  said Kyle Duncan general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which is representing Hobby Lobby It starts with the owner For owners who have woven religious practice into their operations he told me an exercise of religion in the context of a business is still an exercise of religion and thus constitutionally protected The issue is almost certain to end up in the Supreme Court where the betting is made a little more interesting by a couple of factors six of the nine justices are Catholic and this court has already ruled in the Citizens United case that corporations are protected by the First Amendment at least when it comes to freedom of speech Also we know that at least four members of the court dont think much of Obamacare In lower courts advocates of the corporate religious exemption have won a few and lost a few Hobby Lobby has lost so far and could eventually face fines of more than 1 million a day for defying the law The companys case is now before the Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit  You can feel some sympathy for David Greens moral dilemma and even admire him for practicing what he preaches without buying the idea that la corporation cest moi Despite the Supreme Courts expansive view of the First Amendment Hobby Lobby has a high bar to get over  as it should For one thing under Title VII of the Civil Rights Act  which was enacted at the behest of religious groups  companies cannot impose religious tests on their employees They cant hire only Catholics or refuse to hire Catholics They cannot oblige you to practice the same faith their owners do Companies are by legal design zones of theological diversity and tolerance So Green whose company is privately held can spend his own money to promote his faith but it would be an act of legal overreach to say that he can impose his faith on his employees by denying them benefits the government has widely required  If an employer can craft a benefits system around his religious beliefs thats a slippery slope said Marci Hamilton a professor at the Benjamin N Cardozo School of Law and a critic of religious exemptions Can you deny treatment of AIDS victims because your religion disapproves of homosexuals What if your forprofit employer is a Jehovahs Witness who doesnt believe in blood transfusions Also courts tend to distinguish between laws that make you do something and laws that merely require a financial payment In the days of the draft conscientious objectors were exempted from conscription A sincere pacifist could not be obliged to kill But a pacifist is not excused from paying taxes just because he or she objects to the money being spent on war Doctors who find abortions morally abhorrent are not obliged to perform them But you cannot withhold taxes because some of the money goes to Medicaidfinanced abortion Anybody who pays taxes can find something deeply offensive in what the government does said Robert Post a First Amendment expert at Yale Law School  Im not paying my taxes because of torture at Guantnamo Im not paying my taxes because of drones People cant pick and choose their taxes because you couldnt have a functioning tax system I dont know what the courts will say but common sense says the contraception dispute is more like taxation than conscription Nothing in the Obamacare mandate obliges anyone to use contraception if for example she is in the tiny minority of American Catholics who take the churchs doctrine on birth control seriously And Hobby Lobbys policy doesnt prevent the use of morningafter pills it just assures that if an employee does use emergency contraception she pays for it out of her Hobby Lobby paycheck rather than her Hobby Lobby insurance Douglas Laycock a law professor at the University of Virginia who often sides with proponents of broader religious liberty has taken to warning his friends that their aggressive positions on abortion gay rights and now contraception are undermining the longstanding American respect for free exercise of religion The religious community cannot take religious liberty for granted he said in a speech before the contraceptive issue blew up It needs to expend a lot more energy defending the right to religious liberty and it would help to spend a lot less energy attacking the liberty of others  Cases like Hobby Lobby he told me have compounded his worry  Interfering with someone elses sex life is a pretty unpopular thing to do he said These disputes are putting the conservative churches on the losing side of the sexual revolution I think they are taking a risk of turning large chunks of the population against the idea of religious exemptions altogether But Laycocks is a lonely voice among advocates of religious exemptions More typical is Rick Warren the evangelical megachurch pastor who says the battle to preserve religious liberty in all areas of life may be the civil rights movement of this decade Warren goes on to say  I am not making this up  that Hobby Lobbys courageous stand in the face of enormous pressure and fines is the equivalent of the Birmingham bus boycott When I read that kind of rhetoric from our countrys loftier pulpits I understand why the fastestgrowing religious affiliation in America is none

                                                        then he has a right and under some circumstances also an obligation to resign  ROBERT MACKEY The White House released the following statement on Monday in response to the popes resignation On behalf of Americans everywhere Michelle and I wish to extend our appreciation and prayers to His Holiness Pope Benedict XVI Michelle and I warmly remember our meeting with the Holy Father in 2009

                                                    This is clearly a decision which the Holy Father has taken following careful consideration and deep prayer and reflection It reflects his profound sense of duty to the Church and also his deep appreciation
                                                    of the unique pressures of spiritual leadership in the modern world Two years ago Mr Kenny also attacked the Vatican after a report found that officials there had discouraged efforts by bishops to report cases of sex abuse to the police In a speech to the Irish Parliament                                                    after the release of the Cloyne Report in 2011 which detailed abuse and coverups by church officials Mr Kenny said for the first time in Ireland a report into child sexual abuse exposes an attempt by the Holy See to frustrate an inquiry in a sovereign democratic republic  as little as three years ago not

                                                    also the fact of the living man He added that although a Vatican spokesman insisted that the pope

                                                    Church History and the development of canonization at Jacksonville State University in Alabama explained that the last pope to resign was Pope Gregory XII who stepped down almost 600 years
                                                    ago so that the council of Constance could assume his power and appoint a new pope and in so doing bring an end Great Western Schism Mr Prudlo added that the popes resignation does not have to be accepted by anyone  At the end of the 13th century a very holy hermit named Peter was elected as Pope Celestine V in order to break a deadlock in the conclave that had lasted nearly three years He was elected because
                                                        of his personal holiness sort of a unity candidate And once he got there being a hermit not used to the ways of the Roman Curia he found himself somewhat unsuited to the task that it wasnt
                                                        just holiness but also some shrewdness and prudence that was also required So within six months he knew that he was really unequal to the task and so he gathered the cardinals together in a consistory
                                                        just as was recently done a couple hours ago and he announced to the cardinals his intention to resign Because of the Popes position as the supreme authority in the Church Celestine declared
                                                        that the pope could freely resign that it was permissible and that because as supreme authority it did not have to be accepted by anyone
                                                     The professor also noted that one of the few previous popes to step down also named Benedict apparently
                                                    had second thoughts about his decision Celestine V and his advisers were aware that this was an unusual process And so what they did is they went back through history they looked at the Liber Pontificalis and they could go all the way
                                                        back to Pope St Pontian in 235 one of the first bishops of Rome who was arrested and sent to the salt mines and in order for a successor to be able to be elected in Rome he resigned his office
                                                        And so as early as 235 we have evidence of the possibility of Popes resigning for the good of the church Several others they tried to force them to resign The Byzantines attempted to force Pope
                                                        Silverius to resign but he refused to But that also demonstrates the possibility of resignation And then at a rather low point in the Churchs history Pope Benedict IX in the 1040s
                                                        resigned and attempted to reacquire the papacy several times But according to good reports he too died in penance at the monastery of Grottaferrata outside of Rome   ROBERT MACKEY As our Rome bureau chief Rachel Donadio reports Rev Federico Lombardi the Vatican spokesman told reporters

"Four Years Later, Slain Abortion Doctorâ€™s Aide Steps Into the Void",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/us/kansas-abortion-practice-set-to-replace-tiller-clinic.html,WICHITA Kan  For nearly four years the site has been abandoned a lowslung windowless beige building just off a highway on the east side of town But the overpowering smell of fresh paint inside hints of activity soon to come This spring Julie Burkhart an abortionrights advocate who lives in Wichita is planning to reopen the abortion clinic that occupied this space for decades setting the stage for a reemergence of the fiery passions that once made this conservative manufacturing town the center of the abortion battle in the United States Ms Burkhart was a colleague and close friend of Dr George R Tiller the clinics proprietor who was fatally shot in church by an antiabortion advocate in 2009 and whom abortion opponents viewed as enemy No 1 in part because he performed lateterm abortions His clinic the states only abortion provider outside the Kansas City area has been shut ever since Abortion opponents have vowed to keep it closed Already they have filed complaints with the city accusing Ms Burkhart of renovating the clinic without proper permits They have collected around 14000 signatures in opposition to her plan They have asked Wichita officials to change zoning rules to prohibit the clinic from operating in its current location They have prayed If Ms Burkhart is successful they say they will resume the endless protests that were a staple of the Tiller era when they accosted everyone who stepped in and out of the clinic  pizza deliverers included In reality Id like them to be closed forever and ever amen said David Gittrich the development director for Kansans for Life later adding We dont want to be known as a community where you go to get your babies killed Such statements hardly faze Ms Burkhart an articulate laidback 46yearold with deepred hair Im not going to be intimidated out of what I feel passionate about she said On a recent day she went around town in a relaxed manner immersed in her smartphone a bright orange leather handbag swinging from her shoulder She was driving an old BMW sedan far less imposing than Dr Tillers armored SUV Opponents of the clinic have already picketed outside of her house and have walked around distributing handbills with her picture that list her home address and label her an abortionhomicide promoter We cant let fear rule our lives Ms Burkhart said her cowboy boots clopping loudly as she walked through the clinic The plan is to perform abortions only within the first 14 weeks of pregnancy she said She hopes to have two doctors regularly fly into town to perform the procedures and have another physician work full time at the clinic on other womens health issues In the years after Dr Tillers death another woman Dr Mila Means tried to bring abortion services back by opening a practice elsewhere in Wichita but ultimately failed The biggest challenge to Ms Burkharts effort could come from two hours away in Topeka the state capital where a Legislature that has turned further right in recent years is considering new restrictions on abortion Last year lawmakers introduced legislation to shield doctors from lawsuits accusing them after a woman or her child has health problems of withholding information that would have led the woman to have an abortion The bill also included provisions prohibiting abortion providers from receiving tax credits requiring doctors to warn women that abortion increases the risk of breast cancer a theory widely disputed in medical circles and forbidding state employees to perform abortions The bill stalled last year in the Senate but will be advanced again this year in the more conservative Legislature Kansas is and has been the sort of testing ground for antiabortion strategies and tactics and has been sort of ground zero in that fight for many many years decades said Peter Brownlie the president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood of Kansas and MidMissouri In 2011 Gov Sam Brownback a Republican and a staunch abortion opponent signed into law a bill that limited abortion coverage in health care plans placed stringent logistical restrictions on abortion clinics mandating for instance the size of surgical and equipment rooms required doctors to obtain admitting privileges at a local hospital and be present when women take abortion medication and required minors to have the consent of both parents before terminating a pregnancy Some of the provisions are being delayed while they are challenged in court Local abortion opponents are not waiting on legislation to stop Ms Burkhart Mr Gittrich told the City Council that the clinic would create a nuisance for the neighborhood because of the protests it would attract The planning commission is scheduled to meet this month to consider Mr Gittrichs request to rezone the area to prohibit the clinic from opening Operation Rescue another antiabortion group plans to send mailings encouraging residents in the area to ask the Wesley Medical Center not to allow the clinics doctors to have admitting privileges there a potential requirement for them to be able to perform abortions in Wichita The operation has contacted a plumbing company it believes is working on the clinic to urge it not to work there Imagine a KKK place set up on the street corner said Troy Newman the president of Operation Rescue We find it morally reprehensible that these people set up in our town and say Were going to kill your childÂ  Naturally Ms Burkhart who worked alongside Dr Tiller at the clinic for seven years as a spokeswoman and director of political advocacy had a different view of what the clinic represented This was a building that was full of love and compassion for women she said To me this feels like a very positive space The clinic was also the focal point of the Summer of Mercy protests in 1991 when tens of thousands of abortion protesters descended  and more than 2000 were arrested  in an event that transformed a local abortion skirmish into a national brawl For now Ms Burkharts days are filled with raising money obtaining permits and overseeing renovations The clinic is a construction zone with rippedup tile and dust and paint suffusing the air Wires stick out of walls and plastic hangs from doorways A pink feather boa frames a bookshelf in the woodwalled reception area The two square surgery rooms where abortions will be performed are empty and appear polished under fluorescent lights with numerous red power outlets dotting the walls With all the remodeling Ms Burkharts long dining room table at home serves as a temporary office On a recent afternoon her team of five women  mostly recent college graduates  fiddled with their laptops at the table which was strewed with Subway wrappers stacks of paper and books Among the framed photographs in Ms Burkharts entry foyer is a closeup of her caressing her newborn daughter who is now 12 One member of the team an obstetriciangynecologist in her mid40s said she was still deliberating whether to work at the clinic There is a moral code inside of me that feels like I have to step up to that plate said the doctor who asked that her name be withheld But she added there are safety concerns Every part of me is afraid
"Use of Morning-After Pill Is Rising, Report Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/14/health/use-of-morning-after-pill-is-rising-report-says.html,The use of morningafter pills by American women has more than doubled in recent years driven largely by rising rates of use among women in their early 20s according to new federal data released Thursday The finding is likely to add to the public debate over rules issued by the Obama administration under the new health care law that require most employers to provide free coverage of birth control including morningafter pillsÂ to females covered by their plans Some religious institutions and some employers have objected to the requirement and filed lawsuits to block its enforcement Morningafter pills which help prevent pregnancy after sex were used by 11 percent of sexually active women from 2006 to 2010 the period of the study That was up from just 4 percent in 2002 Nearly one in four women between the ages of 20 and 24 who had ever had sex have used the pill at some point the data show Morningafter pills are particularly controversial among some conservative groups who contend they can cause abortions by interfering with the implantation of a fertilized egg that the groups regard as a person Medical experts say that portrayal is inaccurate and that studies provide strong evidence that the most commonly used pills do not hinder implantation but work by delaying or preventing ovulation so that an egg is never fertilized in the first place or thicken cervical mucus so sperm have trouble moving This month the Obama administration offered a proposal that could expand the number of groups that do not need to provide or pay for birth control coverage But the proposal did not end the political fight over the issue which legal experts say may end up in the Supreme Court The new data was released by the National Center for Health Statistics and based on interviews with more than 12000 women from 2006 to 2010 Researchers asked sexually active women if they had ever used emergency contraception also known as Plan B Preven or morningafter pills as well as about their use of other forms of birth control Over all 99 percent of sexually active women ages 15 to 44 have used contraception at some point in their lives or about 53 million women up slightly from 2002 An earlier report found that 62 percent of all women of reproductive age were currently using some form of birth control The new report found that 986 percent of sexually active Catholic women had used contraception at some point but the data did not show how many Catholic women currently use contraception Condom use has risen markedly More than 93 percent of women said they had partners who had used condoms at some point compared with 82 percent of women in 1995 a likely effect of strong public advocacy for condom use during the AIDS epidemic In contrast women who had used intrauterine devices or IUDs at some point in their lives declined to about 8 percent from 10 percent in 1995 The use of birth control pills has remained steady since 1995 at 82 percent Eightynine percent of white women said they had used birth control pills at some point compared with 67 percent of Hispanic women 78 percent of black women and 57 percent of Asian women Education played a role in the type of contraception used Forty percent of women without a high school diploma said they chose sterilization while just 10 percent of women with a bachelors degree said they used that method Those without a high school diploma were also far more likely to use threemonth injectables like DepoProvera  36 percent compared with 13 percent of women with a college degree About 12 percent of college graduates said they had used emergency contraception while 7 percent of women with only a high school degree said they had used it Educated women were far more likely to have practiced periodic abstinence based on the menstrual cycle About 28 percent of women with a masters degree or higher had practiced this method while just 13 percent of women without a high school diploma had the report found White women Americanborn Hispanic women and black women were most likely to practice withdrawal with more than half of women in each group saying they have used that method Just 44 percent of foreignborn Hispanics said they practiced withdrawal
Can the Republicans Be Saved From Obsolescence?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/magazine/can-the-republicans-be-saved-from-obsolescence.html,One afternoon last month I paid a visit to two young Republicans named Bret Jacobson and Ian Spencer who work in a small office in Arlington Va situated above an antique store and adjacent to a Japanese auto shop Their fiveman company Red Edge is a digitaladvocacy group for conservative causes and their days are typically spent designing software applications for groups like the Heritage Foundation the Republican Governors Association and the US Chamber of Commerce Lately however Jacobson and Spencer have taken up evangelizing  and the sermon delivered day after day to fellow conservatives in the form of a 61point presentation is a pitiless wetoldyouso elucidation of the ways in which Democrats have overwhelmed Republicans with their technological superiority They walked me through a series of slides showing the wide discrepancies between the two campaigns And just to make them feel really bad Jacobson said as he punched another image onto the overhead screen We say Just wait  this is the most important slide And this is what kills them because conservatives always look at young voters like the hot girl they could never date He read aloud from the text 125 million more young people supported Obama in 2012 over 2008 In the light of his Apple monitor Jacobsons grin took on a Luciferian glow He is 33 wiry and well dressed and has the twitchy manner of a highly caffeinated techie And then we continue with the cavalcade of pain he said The next chart showed that while the Romney campaign raised slightly more money from its online ads than it spent on them Obamas team more than doubled the return on its onlinead investment Spencer chimed in Thats when one of our clients moaned Its even worse than I thought  Spencer who is 29 possesses the insectlike eyes of a committed programmer He and Jacobson are alumni of the University of Oregon where they both worked on the Commentator a conservative alternative paper whose slogan was Free Minds Free Markets Free Booze Then once people think weve gotten them through the worst Jacobson said we pile on more  just the way Obama did He put up Slide 26 titled Running Up the Score Obama was the very first candidate to appear on Reddit We ask our clients Do you know what Reddit is And only one of them did Then we show them this photo of Obama hugging his wife with the caption Four more years  an image no conservative likes And we tell them Because of the way the Obama campaign used things like Reddit that photo is the singlemost popular image ever seen on Twitter or Facebook Just to make sure theres plenty of salt in the wound Back in August 2011 Jacobson wrote an oped in Forbes alerting Republicans to Obamas lead on the digital front His warnings were disregarded Then last summer he and Spencer approached the conservative super PAC American Crossroads with their digitaltoolbuilding strategies and they say were politely ignored Its understandable then that a touch of schadenfreude is evident when Jacobson and Spencer receive the policygroup gurus and tradeassociation lobbyists who file into Red Edgess office to receive a comeuppance Business is booming for us Jacobson said Well double or triple our bottom line this year easily But this isnt about getting new business We need the entire right side of the aisle to get smart fast And the only way they can do that is to appreciate how big the chasm was Exhibit A is the performance of the Romney brain trust which has suffered an unusually vigorous postelection thrashing for badly losing a winnable race Criticism begins with the candidate  a selfdescribed datadriven chief executive who put his trust in alarmingly offthemark internal polls and apparently did not think to ask his subordinates why for example they were operating on the assumption that fewer black voters would turn out for Obama than in 2008 Romneys senior strategist Stuart Stevens may well be remembered by historians as one House Republican senior staff member put it to me as the last guy to run a presidential campaign who never tweeted It was raised many times with him a senior Romney official told me and he was very categorical about not wanting to and not thinking it was worth it Under the stewardship of Zac Moffatt whose firm Targeted Victory commandeered the 2012 digital operations of the Romney campaign American Crossroads and the Republican National Committee Team Romney managed to connect with 12 million Facebook friends triple that of Obamas operation in 2008 but Obama in 2012 accrued 33 million friends and deployed them as online ambassadors who in turn contacted their Facebook friends thereby demonstrably increasing the campaigns getoutthevote efforts in a way that dwarfed the Republicans While Romneys muchhyped getoutthevote digital tool Orca famously crashed on Election Day Obamas digital team unveiled Narwhal a stateoftheart data platform that gave every member of the campaign instant access to continuously updated information on voters volunteer availability and phonebank activity And despite spending hundreds of millions of dollars the Romney televisionadmaking apparatus proved to be no match for the Obama operation which enlisted Rentrak the data corporation for satellite and cable companies through which it accrued an entirely new layer of information about each and every consumer giving the campaign the ability to customize cable TV ads They were playing chess while we were playing checkers a senior member of the campaigns digital team somberly told another top Romney aide shortly after the election Later the top aide would participate in a postelection forum with Obamas campaign manager He told me albeit like a few people I spoke to under the condition that he not be identified criticizing his party I remember thinking when Jim Messina was going over the specifics of how they broke down and targeted the electorate I cant play this game I have to play a different game so that I dont look like an idiot in front of all these people  But the problem for the GOP extends well beyond its flawed candidate and his flawed operation The unnerving truth which the Red Edge team and other younger conservatives worry that their leaders have yet to appreciate is that the Republican Partys technological deficiencies barely begin to explain why the GOP has lost the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections The party brand  which is to say its message and its messengers  has become practically abhorrent to emerging demographic groups like Latinos and AfricanAmericans not to mention an entire generation of young voters As one of the partys most highly respected strategists told me It ought to concern people that the most Republican part of the electorate under Ronald Reagan were 18to29yearolds And today people I know who are under 40 are embarrassed to say theyre Republicans Theyre embarrassed They get harassed for it the same way we used to give liberals a hard time It was not long after the election that elder statesmen of the GOP began offering assurances that all would soon be right But younger Republicans were not buying it On Dec 6 Moffatt addressed an audience of party digital specialists at the RNCs Capitol Hill Club Moffatt spoke confidently about how among other things the Romney digital team had pretty much all the same tools the Obama campaign possessed Bret Jacobson was shocked when he read about Moffatts claim the next day Thats like saying This Potemkin village will bring us all prosperity  Jacobson told me Theres something to be said for putting on a happy face  except when it makes you sound like Baghdad Bob A few days after the Moffatt gathering the RNCs chairman Reince Priebus announced that the committee would conduct a wideranging investigation  called the Growth and Opportunity Project  into the ways the party was going astray To guide the investigation were familiar names like the former Bush White House press secretary Ari Fleischer the longtime Florida operative Sally Bradshaw and the RNC veteran Henry Barbour Erik Telford the 28yearold founder of the RightOnline bloggers convention told me that he found himself wondering aloud Do you want an aggressive investigation from people whove built their careers on asking skeptical questions Or do you want a report from people who are symptomatic of whats gone wrong Equally galling to younger Republicans was the oped Stuart Stevens wrote in The Washington Post on Nov 28 In it Romneys top strategist struck an unrepentant tone proudly noting that the candidate carried the majority of middleclass voters and that the party therefore must be doing something right From her office near the Capitol Kristen Soltis Anderson a 28yearold GOP pollster tried not to come unglued But you didnt win the election she told me she thought at the time Im really glad you scored that touchdown in the third quarter I am  but you lost the game Anderson is a fantasyfootball fanatic with the ratatat argumentative cadence that gives her away as a former highschool debater Upon graduating from college she became the lead singer of the Frustrations a rockska group that folded as only a DCbased band could when one member decided to attend law school and another needed more time to study for the bar exam Anderson for her part is now a pollster and vice president of the Winston Group Like the Red Edge partners and virtually every other young Republican with whom I spoke she regards herself as a socially tolerant limitedgovernment fiscal conservative Today Republicans of all age groups strenuously avoid describing themselves as moderate a term that the far right has made radioactive Cameraready and compulsively perky  she has twice appeared on Bill Mahers Real Time panel as a token conservative  she nonetheless lapses into despondency when talking about her partys current state of denial During one of the postelection panels Anderson heard a journalist talk about his interviews with Romney staff members who had hoped to build a winning coalition of white voters That just stunned me she told me one afternoon over coffee I thought Did you not see the census Because there was one And it had some pretty big news  like that Americas biggest growing population is the Latino community Surprise surprise How have we not grasped that this is going to be really important One afternoon last month I flew with Anderson to Columbus Ohio to watch her conduct two focus groups The first consisted of 10 single middleclass women in their 20s the second of 10 20something men who were either jobless or employed but seeking better work All of them voted for Obama but did not identify themselves as committed Democrats and were sufficiently ambivalent about the presidents performance that Anderson deemed them within reach of the Republicans Each group sat around a large conference table with the pollster while I viewed the proceedings from behind a panel of oneway glass The allfemale focus group began with a sobering assessment of the Obama economy All of the women spoke gloomily about the prospect of paying off student loans about what they believed to be Social Securitys likely insolvency and about their childrens schooling A few of them bitterly opined that the Democrats care little about the working class but lavish the poor with federal aid You get more off welfare than you would at a minimumwage job observed one of them Another added And if you have a kid youre set up for life About an hour into the session Anderson walked up to a whiteboard and took out a magic marker Im going to write down a word and you guys freeassociate with whatever comes to mind she said The first word she wrote was Democrat Young people one woman called out Liberal another said Followed by Diverse Bill ClintonChangeOpenmindedSpendingHandoutsGreenMore sciencebased When Anderson then wrote Republican the outburst was immediate and vehement Corporate greedOldMiddleaged white men Rich Religious Conservative Hypocritical Military retirees Narrowminded Rigid Not progressive Polarizing Stuck in their ways Farmers Anderson concluded the group on a somewhat beseeching note Lets talk about Republicans she said What if anything could they do to earn your vote A selfidentified antiabortion very conservative 27yearold Obama voter named Gretchen replied Dont be so right wing You know on abortion theyre so out there That allornothing type of thing thats the way Romney came across And you know come up with ways to compromise What would be the sign to you that the Republican Party is moving in the right direction Anderson asked them Maybe actually pass something suggested a 28yearold schoolteacher named Courtney who also identified herself as conservative The session with the young men was equally jarring None of them expressed great enthusiasm for Obama But their depiction of Republicans was even more lacerating than the womens had been Racist out of touch and hateful made the list  and put 1950s on there too one called out Showing a reverence for understatement Anderson said A lot of those words you used to describe Republicans are negative What could they say or do to make you feel more positive about the Republican Party Be more proscience said a 22yearold moderate named Jack Embrace technology and change Stick to your strong suit advised Nick a 23yearold AfricanAmerican Clearly social issues arent your strong suit Stop trying to fight the battle thats already been fought and trying to bring back a movement Get over it  you lost Later that evening at a hotel bar Anderson pored over her notes She seemed morbidly entranced like a homicide detective gazing into a pool of freshly spilled blood In the previous few days the pollster interviewed Latino voters in San Diego and young entrepreneurs in Orlando The findings were virtually unanimous No one could understand the GOPs hotblooded opposition to gay marriage or its perceived affinity for invading foreign countries Every group believed that the first place to cut spending was the defense budget During the whiteboard drill every focus group described Democrats as openminded and Republicans as rigid There is a brand the 28yearold pollster concluded of her party with clinical finality And its that were not in the 21st century Of course many conservatives like their brand just the way it is regardless of what century it seems to belong to Anderson did not relish a tug of war over the partys identity between them and more openminded Republicans She talked to me about Jon Huntsman the presidential candidate whose positions on climate change and social issues she admired and the unseemly spectacle of his denigrating the far right To prosper the party should not have to eat its own she maintained Still to hear her focusgroup subjects tell it the voice of todays GOP is repellent to young voters Can that voice belonging to the partys most fevered members still be accommodated even as young Republicans seek to bring their party into the modern era This conundrum has been a frequent postelection topic as youthful conservative dissidents huddle in taverns and homes and  among friends in the manner of early20thcentury Bolsheviks  proceed to speak the unspeakable about the ruling elite I sat in on one such gathering on a Saturday evening in early February  convened at a Russian bar in Midtown Manhattan over Baltika beers The group of a halfdozen or so conservative pundits and consultants calls itself Proximus which is Latin for next and they seem to revel in their internal disagreements One of them argued Not all regulation is bad while another countered I hate all regulations every single one of them  including he cheerfully admitted minimumwage and childlabor laws Nonetheless the focal point of Proximuss mission is not policy formulation but salesmanship how to bring new voters into the fold while remaining true to conservative principles This is a longterm play conceded John Goodwin a founder of the group and former chief of staff to the outspoken conservative congressman Ral Labrador This isnt going to happen by 2014 But we want to be able to show voters that we have a diversity of opinion Right now Republicans have such a small number of vocal messengers What we want to do is add more microphones and eventually drown out the others And we cant be afraid to call out Rush Limbaugh said Goodwins fiance S E Cupp a New York Daily News columnist and a cohost of The Cycle on MSNBC If we can get three Republicans on three different networks saying What Rush Limbaugh said is crazy and stupid and dangerous maybe thatll give other Republicans cover to denounce the talkshow host as well Cupp who is 33 defines her brand of conservatism as rational  and optimistic She is staunchly antiabortion but also progaymarriage and a warheads on foreheads hawk whose heroes are Barry Goldwater and William F Buckley Jr Like many Republicans today  and indeed like liberal Democrats in the 1980s before Bill Clinton came along and charted a more centrist course  Cupp finds herself in the unenviable position of maintaining that Americans largely side with her partys worldview even if their votes suggest otherwise Public polling still puts the country centerright on a host of issues she told me The problem is that her partys loudest voices sound far more right than center The voters in Kristen Soltis Andersons focus groups condemned Republicans for their unchecked hatred of Obama and for threatening to take away financing for Planned Parenthood ban abortion outlaw gay marriage and wage war From where they stood at the centerright of S E Cupps domain the party had been dragged well out of plain view Proximus seeks to marginalize the more strident talking heads by offering itself up to  or if necessary forcing itself upon  the party as a 21stcentury mouthpiece If I were training a candidate whos against gay marriage Cupp told me Id say Dont change your beliefs just say legislatively this is not a priority and Im not going to take away someones right And if abortion or gay marriage is your No 1 issue Im not your guy  I tried to imagine how Cupps kindergentler messagecoaching would go over with the Tea Party a group that was never mentioned by the young Republicans I spoke with until I broached it Still the influence of the far right on the partys image remains hard to ignore When I brought up the subject of the Tea Party to Cupp she said People arent repelled by the idea of limited government or balancing the budget or lowering taxes Those Tea Party principles are incredibly popular with the public even if they dont know it Again thats a messaging issue thats not a principle issue She went on to say I dont think we win by subtraction  meaning by casting out the partys right wing to entice the centrists Instead Cupp and her fellow travelers hope to revive Lee Atwaters bygone big tent under which gay people and Tea Party members and isolationists and neocons would coexist without rancor But Atwater the legendary RNC chairman did not have to worry about freelance voices like Limbaugh and Todd Akin offending whole swaths of emerging demographic groups Nor during the Atwater era when Ronald Reagan was president did the partys most extreme wing intimidate other Republicans into legislating like extremists themselves thereby further tarnishing the partys image When I mentioned this to the Proximus gathering Goodwin explained the dilemma faced by Republicans in Congress What forces them to vote that way 9 times out of 10 is a fear of a primary challenge he said What we hope to accomplish is to bring more voters into Republican primaries so that it isnt just the far right that shows up at the polls The dilemma Goodwin acknowledged is that the farright rhetoric may well repel such voters from participating in GOP primaries to begin with We recognize that this isnt something thats going to happen anytime soon he said On Nov 30 more than 2000 progressives shuffled into the Washington Convention Center to participate in RootsCamp an annual series of seminars hosted by the New Organizing Institute where the most cuttingedge digital and grassroots organizing techniques are discussed The shaggy and the achingly earnest are well represented at RootsCamp which makes it an easy target of derision from the right A reporter from the conservative publication The Daily Caller attended the postelection gathering in 2010 and made great sport of the unconference with its selfconscious inclusiveness which the reporter termed multilingual multicultural and multiunpurposeful But the handful of conservatives who attended the conference this past November were in no mood to sneer One was Patrick Ruffini a 34yearold leader of the GOPs youngandrestless digerati At RootsCamp his breathless tweets of the sessions held by top Obama organizers  In eight years calling people will be obsolete Digital organizing director and field director will be one and the same  set off a buzz among Republican techies Ruffini was plainly impressed by the openness of the experience Im like Wow theyre doing this in front of 2000 people and the system seems to actually work he told me a month later The thing I was struck by at RootsCamp was that in many ways the Democratic technology ecosystem has embraced the free market  whereas the Republican one sort of runs on socialism with the RNC being the overlord The success of the RootsCamp and its smaller and more intensive offshoot gathering the New Media Boot Camp helps explain the yawning digital divide between the two parties In 2006 a few holdovers from the Howard Dean and John Kerry campaigns eschewed lucrative offers from Washington consulting firms in order to devote some of their time to the communal informationsharing ideals of the New Organizing Institute Since then numerous Boot Camp alumni have gone on to help run the tech operations of the Obama campaign and throughout the Democratic Party infrastructure while RootsCamp has served as a crash course in best practices for thousands of lefties Young Republicans now lament that no one from their side has stepped up to organize a conservative version of RootsCamp Michael Turk a 42yearold Republican digital guru suggested that the failure of GOP technologists to do this springs from a uniquely Republican trait They all wanted to make money he said And so as a result Katie Harbath who was one of my deputies at the RNC is now at Facebook and Mindy Finn  a longtime GOP digital operative  is at Twitter and Patrick and I each started our own companies We all found ways to parlay that into a living for our families as opposed to just doing it for the cause Several GOP digital specialists told me that in addition they found it difficult to recruit talent because of the values espoused by the party I know a lot of people who do technology for a living Turk said And almost universally theres a libertarian streak that runs through them  information should be free do your own thing and leave me alone that sort of mindset Thats very much what the Internet is And almost to a person that Ive talked to they say Yeah I would probably vote for Republicans but I cant get past the gaymarriage ban the abortion stance all of these social causes Almost universally they see a future where you have more options not less So questions about whether you can be married to the person you want to be married to just flies in the face of the future They dont want to be part of an organization that puts them squarely on the wrong side of history Many young conservatives also said that technological innovation runs at crosspurposes with the partys corporate rigidity Theres a feeling that Republican politics are more hierarchical than in the Democratic Party Ben Domenech a 31yearold blogger and research fellow at the libertarian Heartland Institute told me There are always elders at the top who say Thats not important And thats where the left has beaten us by giving smart people the space and trusting them to have success Its a fundamentally antientrepreneurial model weve embraced Erik Telford explained it this way I think theres a very incestuous community of consultants who profit off certain tactics and that creates bias and inhibits innovation Telford was suggesting that many of the party leaders like Karl Rove and his American Crossroads super PAC saw no financial advantage to bringing in avantgarde digital specialists the types who were embraced by the Obama operation For that matter Zac Moffatt and his firm Targeted Victory enjoyed a virtual monopoly on the GOPs digital business during the lackluster 2012 cycle which has made Moffatt an irresistible symbol for all thats clubby and backwardthinking about the party As Bret Jacobson said halfjokingly If you have one firm thats doing the top candidate plus the RNC plus the top outside group  the Department of Justice in any other industry would be actively asking questions One of several GOP digital whizzes who went unused by Moffatts shop in 2012 was Vincent Harris a savvy 24yearold socialmedia consultant whose efforts in Texas helped catapult Ted Cruz to an upset victory over a betterknown candidate in the US Senate primary Harris told me he saw the Romney campaign as a very insular closed operation symptomatic of a partywide affliction Theres an old guard in Republican politics and that old guard is mostly made up of television and directmail consultants he said And you can say thats generational  but at the same time David Axelrod has to be the same age as Karl Rove right The old guard in the Democratic Party made the adjustment with the Obama digital operation There hasnt been a concerted effort among the established GOP folks to figure this stuff out Harris suffers no illusions that the Roves of his party will turn over the keys to young techies like him Were the second rung he told me The first tier isnt going away for another 20 years It is Harriss last point    that the GOP is stuck with its current leadership for the next decade or more  that incites particular angst in young Republicans With palpable envy they describe the forwardleaning impulses of the Obama campaign Axelrods tweeting endlessly the deputy campaign manager Stephanie Cutters becoming a YouTube dynamo with her sassy Web rebuttals to the Romney campaign Jim Messinas traveling westward to receive wisdom from Eric Schmidt Steve Jobs and Steven Spielberg From Spielberg about not trying to replicate their 2008 campaign You can only be the Rolling Stones from 1965 once And then youre a touring band that has to sell tickets each time you come to town One leading GOP digital operative told me Were looking for someone who comes to us and is like All right what do we need to do Im going to trust you to do it Im going to give you a real budget youll have a seat at the table and will be just as important as the communications guy and the field guy And you know what those other guys need to be more modern too and thats the campaign were going to run So lets start plotting out how were going to do that  Echoing the opinion of nearly every other young Republican with whom I spoke the operative concluded sadly And we havent had that person yet The person they are seeking is the Republican incarnation of David Plouffe  the seemingly unremarkable Hill staffer and itinerant consultant who like the Howard Dean strategist Joe Trippi before him recognized that the only way his relatively unknown and underfinanced candidate could prevail over the frontrunner would be to muster a guerrilla operation To accomplish this in 2007 Plouffe met with a 25yearold former Dean techie named Joe Rospars and promptly enlisted him to help marshal candidate Obamas volunteer support through hightech means Plouffe Rospars told me became the champion of using digital to build the campaign from the bottom up Employing thennascent social media channels like Facebook YouTube and Twitter Rosparss team raised enormous sums of money online while also plugging a nationwide grassroots network into Obamas getoutthevote efforts Four years later Stephanie Cutter said Plouffe was a big proponent of completely reimagining the 2008 effort A few days before this years inauguration  after which he would take leave of the Obama White House and of politics as a profession  Plouffe met with me in his small and uncluttered West Wing office He wore a blue shirt and a purple tie and with his work now done was uncharacteristically expansive He told me he was surprised by the Romney campaigns strategic shortcomings After naming one particular member of Romneys high command he said We had 15 people more qualified to do that job than him Plouffe cut his teeth as the deputy chief of staff of Representative Dick Gephardt whose impressive farm team also included those who would go on to be White House advisers like Paul Begala George Stephanopoulos and Bill Burton Now it was the Obama operation that he said is going to generate a lot of people who are going to run presidential and Senate campaigns They were apt pupils of a campaign that was a perfectstorm marriage between grassroots energy and digital technology He continued Not having that is like Nixon not shaving before his first debate  youve got to understand the world youre competing in Our thinking always was We dont want people when they interact with the Obama campaign to have it be a deficient experience compared to how they shop or how they get their news People dont say Well youre a political campaign so I expect you to be slower and less interesting Right We wanted it to be like Amazon And I still dont think the Republicans are there But I asked Plouffe wasnt the GOP just one postmodern presidential candidate  say a Senator Marco Rubio  away from getting back into the game Pouncing he replied Let me tell you something The Hispanic voters in Nevada Colorado and New Mexico dont give a damn about Marco Rubio the Tea Party CubanAmerican from Florida You know what We won the Cuban vote And its because younger Cubans are behaving differently than their parents Its probably my favorite stat of the whole campaign So this notion that Marco Rubio is going to heal their problems  its not even sophomoric its juvenile And by the way the bigger problem theyve got with Latinos isnt immigration Its their economic policies and health care The group that supported the presidents health care bill the most Latinos Plouffe readily conceded that he and his generation held no iron grip on political wisdom but then he flashed a grin when I brought up the RNCs Growth and Opportunity Project composed of party stalwarts If theres a review board the Democrats put together in 2032 or even 2020 and Im on it he said were screwed The Republicans did in fact recently have a David Plouffe of their own As one GOP techie elegantly put it We were the smart ones back in 04 eons ago Referring to the campaign that reelected George W Bush Plouffe told me You know how in fantasy baseball you imagine putting up your team against the 1927 Yankees We wouldve liked to have faced off against the 2004 Republicans Beating the Clintons  during the 2008 primaries  that was in terms of scale of difficulty significantly above beating Romney But going up against the Bushies  that wouldve been something we all wouldve relished Plouffe wasnt referring to competing against Bushs oftdescribed architect Karl Rove  but rather against the campaign manager Ken Mehlman Mehlman got technology and organization and the truth is  I think its completely misunderstood  it was Kens campaign Plouffe said He added that he and Mehlman were friends and that during the 2012 cycle Mehlman  who had been informally advising the Romney campaign  was also very free with advice about structure how they dealt with an incumbent president how they dealt with debate prep Similarly the former Bush senior strategist Matthew Dowd told me that Axelrod reached out to him for advice and they sat down together Which never happened with me and Romneyworld Mehlman according to Bush campaign officials persuaded Rove to invest heavily in microtargeting a datadriven means of identifying and reaching select groups of voters which helped deliver Ohio and thus the election He advocated reaching out to minority voters both as Bushs campaign manager and later as chairman of the RNC where he also instructed his staff to read Moneyball I was like What does a baseball book have to do with politics  said Michael Turk who worked for Mehlman at the RNC Once I actually took the time to digest it I realized what he was trying to do  which was exactly the kind of thing that the Obama team just did understanding that not every election is about home runs but instead getting a whole bunch of singles together that eventually add up to a win I met with Mehlman one morning in his office near the Capitol He left politics in 2007 and subsequently came out as gay  and after that became a vigorous if behindthescenes supporter of legalizing samesex marriage in New York and beyond Mehlman is now a partner at the privateequity giant Kohlberg Kravis Roberts wealthy and free from his partys fetters He was nonetheless hesitant to criticize his fellow Republicans though implicitly his comments were damning Theres an important book by Ben Wattenberg and Richard Scammon called The Real Majority published in 1970 Mehlman said as he leaned back in his chair The book explains in part how the Republican Party would go on to win five out of six presidential elections through the eyes of the typical voter  a workingclass couple in Dayton Ohio Theyre white worried about crime feel burdened by taxes and feel like too many Democrats dont understand these concerns Todays typical voter he went on to say could be that same white couple in Dayton But heres the difference he said They worry about economic mobility  can their kids get ahead or even keep up Their nextdoor neighbors are Latino whose mom gets concerned when she hears talk about selfdeportation or no drivers licenses And that couple has a gay niece and an AfricanAmerican brotherinlaw And too many folks like the couple in Dayton today wonder if some of the GOP understands their lives anymore I asked him whether as even some Republicans have suggested Ronald Reagan would have trouble building a winning coalition today I think he could win partly because Reagan wouldnt be the Reagan he was in 1980 Mehlman replied Reagan had an unbelievable intuitive understanding of the electorate because hed spent his life as the president of a large union as an actor who understands his audience as the governor of the largest state as a corporate spokesman who traveled  Reagan spent his life listening to people and learning from them and adapting to their concerns Thats why there were Reagan Democrats  ethnics workingclass voters Southern voters So I think a modern Reagan would understand the demography and where the new voters are and wouldve applied his principles accordingly But could a modernday Reagan even with Ken Mehlman running his campaign overcome the partys angry and antiquated image To win a reincarnated Reagan  or a Rubio or a Chris Christie or a Bobby Jindal  would still have to satisfy his base of hardline conservatives and captivate a new generation of voters at the same time I ran this quandary by Kristen Soltis Anderson Its a big challenge she acknowledged But I think that if you can earn the trust of the people there are ways you can say Heres why I take this position I dont know that someone like Rubio who may be young and attractive and well spoken could attract young voters despite his views on gay marriage I do think that in the absence of a very compelling reason to vote for a candidate those social issues can be dealbreakers for young voters The challenge is Can you make a case thats so compelling that you can overcome those dealbreaker issues And I dont know the answer to that question Bret Jacobson the Red Edge entrepreneur insisted that the solution was ultimately a simple one I think the answer for a vibrant Republican Party is to make our North Star empowering every individual in this country to follow their own dream free of legislative excesses he told me There are millions of Americans who take seriously their religious culture as well as traditions that have been handed down for centuries And the party has to empower them to fight those battles in the social sphere not in the government sphere Thats harder work than taking control of the country for four years But its the appropriate battle But I asked him dont social conservatives feel a moral obligation to legislate their beliefs Did Jacobson really expect the Rick Santorums of his party to let a new generation of Republican leaders tell them what to accept and how to behave Jacobson did not back down Even the Republican Party rejected Santorum he said He got some attention and he certainly received votes But he didnt win In a sense however Santorum and his fellow archconservatives did win by tugging Mitt Romney and his pliable views rightward Then Romney lost and so did the Republicans Two days after Obamas inauguration Bret Jacobson flew to Charlotte to attend the RNCs winter conference and sit on a panel devoted to discussing new digital techniques Brets presentation was one of the bestreceived of the panel by far the seminars organizer Ryan Cassin told me Still Jacobson was disappointed to see only 30 people in attendance President Obama meanwhile announced the previous week that his campaign juggernaut would be transformed into an advocacy group Organizing for Action that would use the vast social network amassed during the 2012 cycle to advance the administrations policy goals The Republican panel amounted to a first step  a baby step  while the competition was lapping them Jacobson did not stick around the next day to hear Reince Priebus declare to the conferees Were the party of innovation Instead he left his own panel early to catch a plane back to Washington Calls were continuing to come into Red Edges office from establishment Republicans inquiring about Jacobson and Spencers cautionary slide presentation Jacobson wanted to interpret this interest as a good thing But I could tell from his voice that the experience at the RNC conference deflated his hopes about Republicans being well on the road to enlightenment My primary worry he told me without his characteristic levity is that Im going to become the Al Gore of the right  meaning a forecaster of doom appreciated and unheeded as the clever if somewhat lonely guy who told them so
"Ronald Dworkin, Scholar of the Law, Is Dead at 81",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/us/ronald-dworkin-legal-philosopher-dies-at-81.html,Ronald Dworkin a legal philosopher and public intellectual of bracingly liberal views who insisted that morality is the touchstone of constitutional interpretation died on Thursday in London He was 81 The cause was leukemia said Richard Revesz the dean of the New York University School of Law who announced the death Professor Dworkin had been a member of the schools faculty for many years and also taught at University College London Professor Dworkin was the primary legal philosopher of his generation said Judge Guido Calabresi a former dean of Yale Law School who now sits on the federal appeals court in New York He was also one of the most closely read as a mainstay of The New York Review of Books to which he contributed articles for decades Professor Dworkins central argument started with the premise that the crucial phrases in the Constitution  the freedom of speech due process of law equal protection of the laws  were as he put it drafted in exceedingly abstract moral language These clauses he continued must be understood in the way their language most naturally suggests they refer to abstract moral principles and incorporate these by reference as limits on the governments power It is not hard to hear echoes of Professor Dworkins approach in the writings of Justice Anthony M Kennedy who often holds the crucial vote in morally charged debates before the United States Supreme Court and is quite likely to play a decisive role in two pending cases on samesex marriage Professor Dworkin in a 2005 interview discussed Justice Kennedys majority opinion in Lawrence v Texas a 2003 decision that struck down laws making gay sex a crime The dominant voice you hear Professor Dworkin said is about justice and injustice and what a decent society will tolerate and what it wont Thomas Nagel a philosopher and Professor Dworkins partner in a colloquium in legal political and social philosophy offered for many years at New York University said in a 2007 tribute that his friends analytic power was amplified by the vigor and verve of his writing Professor Dworkin he said could explain difficult moral issues about law politics and society in lucid terms to a general nonacademic audience  without in any way watering them down or simplifying them His critics said Professor Dworkins approach was a smoke screen Dworkin writes with great complexity but in the end always discovers that the moral philosophy appropriate to the Constitution produces the results that a liberal moral relativist prefers Robert H Bork the onetime Supreme Court nominee who died in December wrote in 1997 in The Tempting of America Judge Richard A Posner who sits on the federal appeals court in Chicago wrote in a 2001 study of public intellectuals that Professor Dworkins popular writings were slippery partisan and predictable Dworkins dominant bent as a public intellectual Judge Posner wrote is to polemicize in favor of a standard menu of leftliberal policies Ronald Myles Dworkin was born in Providence RI on Dec 11 1931 Â His parents divorced when he was young and he said his memories of his father were hazy though he believed his father had emigrated from Lithuania as a child Â His mother Madeline raised three children on her own by teaching piano Â He went to Harvard on a scholarship reserved for graduates of Providences public schools Â There were rarely any takers Professor Dworkin recalled Â  After graduating from Harvard he attended Oxford as a Rhodes scholar and obtained law degrees from both places He spent much of his life with one foot in the United States and the other in Britain living part of the year in each place Professor Dworkin was dashing witty well connected and open to earthly delight Dworkin is probably the least ascetic person I know and one of the most worldly Professor Nagel said in 2005 After graduating from Harvard Law School Mr Dworkin served as a law clerk to Judge Learned Hand a federal appeals court judge in New York and a towering figure in the law In a letter to Justice Felix Frankfurter of the United States Supreme Court Judge Hand called the young man the law clerk to beat all law clerks a compliment he undermined only slightly by calling him Roland Dworkin Mr Dworkin turned down an opportunity to serve as a clerk to Justice Frankfurter a decision he later called a very serious mistake Instead he joined a prominent New York law firm Sullivan  Cromwell where he working as an associate from 1958 to 1962 specializing in international transactions In 1962 Professor Dworkin joined Yale Law School and began a glittering academic career He returned to Oxford seven years later and soon put down roots in London In 1975 he turned down an offer from Harvard for a joint appointment in favor of New York University whose law school is now among the best in the nation but had not yet achieved that status at the time Enticing Professor Dworkin to join the faculty helped start the transformation In later years he switched his primary British academic affiliation to University College London but the connection with NYU endured Professor Dworkins first wife the former Betsy Ross died in 2000 He is survived by his wife Irene Brendel Dworkin his twin children Anthony a writer and expert on war crimes and Jennifer Dworkin a philosopher and filmmaker and two grandchildren Professor Dworkins academic work was in many ways a reaction to that of H L A Hart the British legal philosopher whose 1961 masterwork The Concept of Law set out his theory of positivism which held that law is a system of rules similar in structure to those of games like chess Legal reasoning positivism says is merely descriptive and need not take account of morality The two men first met when Professor Hart was by happenstance assigned to evaluate Mr Dworkins final examination at Oxford The American student excited and scared Professor Hart his biographer Nicola Lacey wrote in 2004 referring to Professor Hart by his first name Herbert went on to express considerable anxiety about this students views for the arguments of The Concept of LawÂ  she wrote Professor Dworkins later work she added amounted to a devastating critical onslaught on Professor Harts overschematic account of adjudication Years later when Professor Dworkin succeeded Professor Hart in the Oxford chair of jurisprudence the older man gave an afterdinner speech quoting from the student paper which he had saved Professor Dworkins most influential book was Laws Empire on the nature and role of adjudication It was among the mostcited books on law of the last century He also wrote Lifes Dominion on abortion euthanasia and the questions they raise Sovereign Virtue on equality and three collections of essays Taking Rights Seriously A Matter of Principle and Freedoms Law In 2011 he published Justice for Hedgehogs an overview and summation I am trying he said in 2005 as he was working on the book to bring together my work in law and my work in political philosophy and moral philosophy and the theory of interpretation and the kitchen sink That ability to synthesize and improvise served Professor Dworkin well Professor Nagel said recalling seeing his friend give a beautifully constructed 50minute lecture at Stanford having been introduced by the universitys president After it was over Professor Nagel said the president got up again and explained that he had inadvertently picked up Dworkins detailed lecture notes from the lectern after introducing him but discovered this only after Dworkin was launched
A Laboratory for Revitalizing Catholicism,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/15/world/americas/in-brazil-growing-threats-to-catholicisms-sway.html,RIO DE JANEIRO  At one new megachurch in So Paulo a Roman Catholic priest who was a personal trainer before joining the clergy energetically belts out songs rockstar style before 25000 worshipers Other Brazilian priests are donning cowboy hats and crooning country tunes at Mass or writing bestselling advice tomes emblazoned with heartthrob photographs on the cover  If there is any place that captures the challenges facing Catholicism around the world it is Brazil the country with the largest number of Catholics and a laboratory of sorts for the churchs strategies for luring followers back into the fold  Reflecting the shifting religious landscape that Pope Benedict XVIs successor will contend with Brazil rivals the United States as the nation with the most Pentecostals as a Catholic monolith gives way amid a surge in evangelical Protestant churches  Despite the iconic Christ the Redeemer statue that towers over this city there is deep anxiety among some Catholics about the future of their faith given rising secularization and indifference to religion here Only 65 percent of Brazilians now say they are Catholic down from more than 90 percent in 1970 according to the 2010 census The decline has been so steep and continuous especially in Rio de Janeiro that one of Brazils top Catholic leaders Cardinal Cludio Hummes has remarked We wonder with anxiety how long will Brazil remain a Catholic country  Before Benedict announced that he would vacate the papacy at the end of the month he had been expected to visit Rio in July for World Youth Day a gathering of millions aimed at bolstering new generations of Catholics Many of Brazils faithful were hoping that the trip would represent a new focus by the Vatican on the doublebarreled threat of evangelical competition and growing secularism Some here hold out hope that the new pope could still visit Rio early in his papacy and they are even encouraged that two Brazilians Cardinal Joo Braz de Aviz and Odilo Scherer the archbishop of So Paulo are among those mentioned as possible candidates to succeed Benedict But others seem resigned to what they describe as a combination of neglect and condescension from the Vatican I think theyre going to maintain the same line of Benedict said Silvia Fernandes a sociologist at the Federal Rural University of Rio de Janeiro who specializes in Catholicism  Ms Fernandes said that big schisms persisted within the church in Brazil between bishops in the Amazon who are focused on human rights illegal deforestation and indigenous struggles and the more conservative and traditional Catholic leadership in relatively prosperous southeastern Brazil Then there is the array of singing priests who belong to what is called Brazils Charismatic Catholic Renovation a movement seeking to invigorate Catholic services with the kind of liveliness that parishioners often find at other churches These priests have been embraced by the Vatican but only to a point  The most famous among them the Rev Marcelo Rossi a 45yearold former personal trainer has sold more than 12 million CDs and has celebrated Mass in a soccer stadium filled with tens of thousands of worshipers Still he complained about feeling humiliated during Benedicts visit to Brazil in 2007 when Catholic leaders prevented him from even getting close to the pope  In an extension of the charismatic practices some Catholic priests now perform liberation Masses resembling group exorcisms and welcome congregants who speak in tongues While such aspects may be frowned upon by some in the Roman Catholic establishment the charismatic movement has clearly struck a chord among many worshipers  Through this movement many people are finding themselves again inside the church said Almir Belarmino 53 a technician at a sewage treatment company who was one of 1200 people attending a retreat here over the Carnival holiday for people in the charismatic movement  Why not dance in the place where the presence of God is so great Mr Belarmino asked Joy and excitement are part of the worship we do Catholic priests blending of new practices into their services is nothing new in Brazil Many people for instance say they are Catholic while practicing Africanderived religions like Candombl which merges the identities of Roman Catholic saints and African deities Religious practice in Brazil is often highly hybridized said Stephen Selka an expert on African diaspora religions at Indiana University At the same time exceptionally successful evangelical churches in Brazil are wielding more clout Building on their influential voting bloc in the Brazilian Congress they are expanding operations elsewhere in Latin America and in Africa and even securing Brazilian diplomatic passports for their top preachers giving them a similar status here to the Vaticans envoys  In competition with the charismatic priests evangelicals are building their own megachurches In So Paulo the Universal Church of the Kingdom of God a multinational Pentecostal organization founded in Brazil in 1977 is spending 200 million to build a 10000seat replica of Solomons Temple  Evangelical singers also have huge fan bases like Aline Barros a Grammywinning gospel singer with almost a million followers on Twitter Television preachers like Silas Malafaia a Pentecostal leader from Rio de Janeiro have grown prominent after lashing out at supporters of legalized abortion and gay rights  But while evangelicals have grown more powerful in Brazil a new shift threatens churches of all stripes the rise of secularism Andrew Chesnut an expert on Latin American religions at Virginia Commonwealth University said that the fastestgrowing segment in Brazils religious landscape may now be nonbelievers and people unaffiliated with any church making up as much as 15 percent of the population  For a country that as recently as 1980 had negligible levels of people saying they were atheists this development points to big shifts in society Compounding the problem for the Vatican many people in Brazil who say they are Catholic rarely attend Mass and practicing Catholics often express frustration with the Vaticans policies Across Latin America growing numbers of people say they have no religious affiliation a phenomenon similar to what has happened in Europe and the United States but somewhat less pronounced said Philip Jenkins a history professor who teaches at the Institute for Studies of Religion at Baylor University One sign of this experts say is the drastic drop in fertility rates which for the church means fewer children to be baptized and confirmed fewer young candidates to become priests and nuns and diminishing ties for Catholic parents to the church Brazils fertility rate one of Latin Americas lowest at about 183 children per woman is below the level needed to keep the population stable If I were a Brazilian cardinal I would be even more worried about family size and fertility rates which are a very good augur of secularization than Pentecostalism Dr Jenkins said One reveler during Rios Carnival Thiago Assis 30 a systems analyst who is a Catholic said he was disappointed with Benedicts conservative views and hopeful that his replacement could bring the church closer to him and other Brazilians There is a great expectation for the next one to take more liberal positions Mr Assis said as he relaxed with a group of friends on the sidewalk amid the blaring music of a street party He added that he was particularly at odds with the churchs stance on condom use which he called a health issue 
The End of a Catholic Moment,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/opinion/sunday/douthat-the-end-of-a-catholic-moment.html,THE last time the Chair of St Peter stood vacant during Pope John Paul IIs funeral in 2005 the Roman Catholic Church enjoyed a wave of unusually favorable coverage from the American press The Polish pope had a way of disarming even his most stringent critics and that power extended beyond his death turning his funeral into a madefortelevision spectacle that almost felt like an infomercial for the Catholic faith Perhaps not coincidentally the mid2000s were the last time the Catholic vision of the good society  more egalitarian than American conservatism and more moralistic than American liberalism  enjoyed real influence in US politics At the time of John Pauls death the Republican Partys agenda was still stamped by George W Bushs compassionate conservatism which offered a rightofcenter approach to Catholic ideas about social justice The Democratic Party meanwhile was looking for ways to woo the values voters many of them Catholic who had just helped Bush win reelection and prominent Democrats were calling for a friendlier attitude toward religion and a bigger tent on social issues  That was a long eight years ago Since then the sex abuse scandals that shadowed John Pauls last years have become the defining story of his successors papacy and the unexpected abdication of Benedict XVI has only confirmed the narrative of a church in disarray His predecessor was buried amid reverent coverage from secular outlets but the current pope can expect a sendoff marked by sourness and shrugs The collapse in the churchs reputation has coincided with a substantial loss of Catholic influence in American political debates Whereas eight years ago a Catholic view of economics and culture represented a center that both parties hoped to claim todays Republicans are more likely to channel Ayn Rand than Thomas Aquinas and a strident social liberalism holds the whip hand in the Democratic Party  Indeed between Mitt Romneys comments about the mooching 47 percent and the White Houses cynical decision to energize its base by picking fights over abortion and contraception both parties spent 2012 effectively running against Catholic ideas about the common good This transformation suggests that we may have reached the end of a distinctive Catholic moment to repurpose a phrase from the late Catholic priestintellectual Richard John Neuhaus in American politics one that began in the 1980s after John Pauls ascension to the papacy and the migration of many Catholic Reagan Democrats into the Republican Party  This was hardly the first era when Catholic ideas shaped American debates New Dealera liberalism for instance owed a major debt to Catholic social thought But it was the first era when the Catholic vote was both frequently decisive and genuinely up for grabs and it was an era when Catholic debates and personalities filled the vacuum left by the decline of the Protestant mainline  The fact that the Second Vatican Council had left the church internally divided limited Catholic influence in some ways but magnified it in others Because the churchs divisions often mirrored the countrys a politician who captured the typical Catholic voter was probably well on his way to victory and so wouldbe leaders of both parties had every incentive to frame their positions in Catholicfriendly terms The church might not always be speaking with one voice but both left and right tried to borrow its language  If this era is now passing and Catholic ideas are becoming more marginal to our politics its partially because institutional Christianity is weaker over all than a generation ago and partially because Catholicisms leaders have done their part and then some to hasten that deChristianization Any church that presides over a huge coverup of sex abuse can hardly complain when its worldview is regarded with suspicion The present pope has too often been scapegoated for the sex abuse crisis but Americas bishops have if anything gotten off too easily and even now seem insufficiently chastened for their sins The recent turn away from Catholic ideas has also been furthered by a political class that never particularly cared for them in the first place Even in a more unchurched America a synthesis of social conservatism and more egalitarianminded economic policies could have a great deal of mass appeal But our elites seem mostly relieved to stop paying lip service to the Catholic synthesis professional Republicans are more libertarian than their constituents professional Democrats are more secular than their partys rankandfile and professional centrists get their encyclicals from Michael Bloomberg rather than the Vatican  Nothing that happens in Rome over the next few months is likely to convert the Acela Corridors donors and strategists and think tankers to a more Catholicfriendly worldview The next pope may be more effective than Benedict or he may be clumsier he may improve the churchs image in this country or he may worsen it  But if there is another Catholic moment waiting in our nations future it can only be made by Americans themselves 
Officialâ€™s Speeding Fine Builds to Lurid Scandal,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/world/europe/a-ticket-a-lie-and-a-british-officials-downfall.html,LONDON  It began mundanely enough with a speeding violation 10 years ago But it escalated through the tangled explosive passions of a failed marriage and one partners new love affair into one of the most tawdry political scandals Britain has seen in years And it has claimed the political career of an ambitious cabinet minister Chris Huhne a Liberal Democrat who resigned his position as energy and climate change secretary in Prime Minister David Camerons coalition government and his parliamentary seat He now finds himself facing what the judge in the case has described as the strong likelihood of a prison sentence Mr Huhnes former wife Vicky Pryce a prominent Greekborn economist who was joint head of the Government Economic Service until 2010 may go to prison too if a verdict expected this week finds her guilty of perverting the course of justice by falsely certifying that she and not her husband was the driver who had been speeding That was the offense to which Mr Huhne pronounced HEWN pleaded guilty when the trial began two weeks ago though he had maintained for years  up to the moment the court sat  that he was innocent of any wrongdoing Along the way the trial veered far from the speeding offense into painfully intimate details of the couples family life in what some British commentators have described as an egregious invasion of their privacy The court has heard that Ms Pryce 60 a mother of five twice faced demands from her husband that she have an abortion and that she acceded the first time to her bitter regret It has been told of her fury and humiliation when Mr Huhne who is 58 left her for a female political aide Carina Trimingham who was previously in a relationship with another woman It heard too of her subsequent decision to reveal the speeding ticket switch to one of Britains most widely read newspapers the Rupert Murdochowned Sunday Times in order to nail her former husband and bring Huhne down as she expressed it in emails shown to the court Evidence at the trial showed The Sunday Times aggressively encouraging Ms Pryce to join in an effort to end Mr Huhnes career In the emails introduced by the prosecution the papers political editor Isabel Oakeshott assured Ms Pryce that going public with the story of the subterfuge over the speeding ticket in frontpage articles without naming her as the person who falsely signed as the driver would inflict maximum perhaps fatal damage to Mr Huhne by then a minister in the government and in the process of divorcing Ms Pryce This Ms Oakeshott said would achieve the dual purpose of bringing Huhne down if we can without seriously damaging your own reputation The evidence also included a string of text messages between Mr Huhne and the couples youngest child Peter now a 20yearold college student Distressed by what Mr Huhne had done to his mother the youth responded to overtures for understanding with expletivelittered repudiations in which he said You are the most ghastly man I have ever known I hate you and You make me sick The justification given in court for venturing so deeply into the couples family life was that Ms Pryce had employed the rarely used marital coercion defense adopted into English law in 1925 Using this as a plea a woman can be found not guilty of any crime other than treason or murder if she can show she committed it under coercion from her husband while he was physically present Ms Pryce asserts that her husband pressured her insistently to take the blame for the speeding violation while the prosecution has argued that she was a willing partner in the subterfuge and constructed her account of the episode out of a desire for revenge for her husbands affair and his abrupt ending of their 25year marriage shortly after he became a minister That has made the entire sweep of the couples troubled marriage and divorce an open book in court in a way that has made allies of powerful groups that have not always seen eye to eye Among those are womens rights advocates deeply sympathetic to Ms Pryce and people critical of the judiciary for leaping to the defense of individuals privacy rights in some cases and for adopting a seeming indifference to the same rights in others One commentator David Aaronovitch of The Times of London compared the court revelations about the HuhnePryce marriage with the outrage stirred in Britain last week by the publication in Europe of photographs of the pregnant Duchess of Cambridge walking in a bikini along a Caribbean beach with her husband Prince William Everything revealed in the court about Mr Huhnes and Ms Pryces private lives he said has been published republished reported and analyzed and  frankly  gloated over by sections of society who sneer at beach shots The case before the London court began late one night in March 2003 when a police camera captured a black BMW 7 Series traveling south to London from Stansted Airport at 69 miles per hour on a stretch of highway with a 50 mph limit Mr Huhne a former journalist for The Financial Times who later made millions of dollars in his own investment consultancy would have been fined 100 if he had acknowledged being the driver But with three other speeding offenses in the previous 14 months he faced the loss of his license for a year and told his wife there would be serious consequences for his hopes ultimately successful to win a parliamentary seat in a general election in 2005 Ms Pryce said she had rejected Mr Huhnes demands to name herself as the BMWs driver only to discover from a summons in her name that arrived at their London home that he had gone ahead and named her in response to the initial police notice She told the court that he had confronted her in the hallway of their home holding the summons waving a pen and saying Youve absolutely got to sign this now She said she had done so feeling that I absolutely had no choice Mr Huhne has denied that or that he applied unfair pressure on his wife It is on that moment that the case now hinges The prosecution counsel Andrew Edis said in closing arguments that Ms Pryce was one of Britains most powerful talented intelligent women not the quivering jelly kind and that she had

Small Shift in Numbers Gives House Democrats a Fresh Shot at Relevance,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/us/in-texas-house-balancing-act-for-democrats-and-republicans.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor of The Texas Tribune writes a column for The Tribune Joe Straus became the speaker of the Texas House in 2009 when Democrats and Republicans had nearly even numbers in that body Every deal had to be brokered Party lines were soft Republicans clobbered the Democrats in the 2010 elections and ran over them in Mr Strauss second term as speaker They had a supermajority and they acted like it As a bloc of votes the Democrats were broken Demoralized they never coalesced behind any particular leader They had a caucus head in Representative Jessica Farrar of Houston And they had a brawler Representative Trey Martinez Fischer of San Antonio But the Democrats did not show up as a unified force in 2011 Now they get to choose between cooperation and resistance and you can find Texas Democrats in both camps The trick for their leaders is to figure out where they want to go In Mr Straus they have a speaker who is probably less of what they fear from the right than any of his wouldbe replacements might be If Republicans who dont like Mr Straus are right he is more moderate than the rest of the party And if thats the case how could the Democrats do better On the other hand they are Democrats any Republican successes weigh against them and some would prefer to oppose Straus and Company no matter what Some important things have changed since the last time around The 2010 election left Republicans with the idea that they didnt need to compromise on anything what with a supermajority and the national mood coming out of those midterm elections Moderate Republicans mostly stuck with their party even when they didnt like what was being served because the alternative was a potentially risky primary in 2012 with a more conservative Republican at home Two years ago the governor was putting together his bona fides for what turned out to be a presidential run Remember that list of emergency issues at the beginning of the session two years ago Sanctuary cities photo identification for voters statemandated preabortion sonograms and eminent domain protection were all tailored to please Republican primary voters The formula is different this time Republicans dont have a supermajority in either chamber of the Legislature and the governor hasnt declared anything worthy of emergency status that must be handled in the first two months of the session The Democrats are also in a better place They have recovered from the spurning of 2010 Their overall numbers still stink but not as much as before Republicans suffered some lumps in the presidential race The partys urgent designs on Hispanic voters  spurred by the presidential results  has made some Republican lawmakers more interested in dealing with Hispanic lawmakers of either party Instead of Republicans pillaging and looting in 2011 in a Texas House that had previously been evenly balanced this session finds Democrats seeking a way back into power and Republicans trying to woo Latinos and also needing alliances with Democrats on some votes The early days of a legislative session are marked with warm and optimistic feelings so its hard to tell how the relationships will go But even if the parties hated each other they would have to work together on some things Its a Republican room  95 members versus 55  but some things require 100 votes or more The Republicans cant get there alone but members from both parties wonder whether anyone can pull together a regular Democratic voting bloc The Democrats started the session by electing Representative Yvonne Davis of Dallas to lead the caucus She is not known as a great orator You are unlikely to see her very often on television  she doesnt particularly like having her picture taken But she is one of the best in the House at working members and votes on the floor putting deals together and she can raise money for the caucus And Mr Martinez Fischer who heads the Mexican American Legislative Caucus which includes 37 of the 55 Democratic members is still around Last week he was part of a bipartisan group working to restore some of the education cuts made last session Ms Davis was working the floor on a linked appropriations bill Mr Straus and the others are in there too wondering if it will be different this year Will anyone follow the leaders
Cuomo Bucks Tide With Bill to Ease Limits on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/17/nyregion/cuomo-bucks-tide-with-bill-to-lift-abortion-limits.html,ALBANY  Bucking a trend in which states have been seeking to restrict abortion Gov Andrew M Cuomo is putting the finishing touches on legislation that would guarantee women in New York the right to lateterm abortions when their health is in danger or the fetus is not viable Mr Cuomo seeking to deliver on a promise he made in his recent State of the State address would rewrite a law that currently allows abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy only if the pregnant womans life is at risk The law is not enforced because it is superseded by federal court rulings that allow lateterm abortions to protect a womans health even if her life is not in jeopardy But abortion rights advocates say the existence of the more restrictive state law has a chilling effect on some doctors and prompts some women to leave the state for lateterm abortions Mr Cuomos proposal which has not yet been made public would also clarify that licensed health care practitioners and not only physicians can perform abortions It would remove abortion from the states penal law and regulate it through the states public health law  Abortion rights advocates have welcomed Mr Cuomos plan which he outlined in general terms as part of a broader package of womens rights initiatives in his State of the State address in January But the Roman Catholic Church and antiabortion groups are dismayed opponents have labeled the legislation the Abortion Expansion Act  The prospects for Mr Cuomos effort are uncertain The State Assembly is controlled by Democrats who support abortion rights the Senate is more difficult to predict because this year it is controlled by a coalition of Republicans who have tended to oppose new abortion rights laws and breakaway Democrats who support abortion rights New York legalized abortion in 1970 three years before it was legalized nationally by the Supreme Court in Roe v Wade Mr Cuomos proposal would update the state law so that it could stand alone if the broader federal standard set by Roe were to be undone Why are we doing this The Supreme Court could change said a senior Cuomo administration official who spoke on the condition of anonymity because the governor had not formally introduced his proposal But opponents of abortion rights already upset at the high rate of abortions in New York State worry that rewriting the abortion law would encourage an even greater number of abortions For example they suggest that the provision to allow abortions late in a womans pregnancy for health reasons could be used as a loophole to allow unchecked lateterm abortions I am hard pressed to think of a piece of legislation that is less needed or more harmful than this one the archbishop of New York Cardinal Timothy M Dolan wrote in a letter to Mr Cuomo last month Referring to Albany lawmakers in a subsequent column he added Its as though in their minds our state motto Excelsior Ever Upward applies to the abortion rate National abortion rights groups have sought for years to persuade state legislatures to adopt laws guaranteeing abortion rights as a backup to Roe But they have had limited success Only seven states have such measures in place including California Connecticut and Maryland the most recent state to adopt such a law is Hawaii which did so in 2006 Pretty much all of the energy all of the momentum has been to restrict abortion which makes what could potentially happen in New York so interesting said Elizabeth Nash state issues manager at the Guttmacher Institute a research group that supports abortion rights Theres no other state thats even contemplating this right now In most statehouses the push by lawmakers has been in the opposite direction The past two years has seen more provisions adopted at the state level to restrict abortion rights than in any twoyear period in decades according to the Guttmacher Institute last year 19 states adopted 43 new provisions restricting abortion access while not a single significant measure was adopted to expand access to abortion or to comprehensive sex education Its an extraordinary moment in terms of the degree to which there is government interference in a womans ability to make these basic health care decisions said Andrea Miller the president of NARAL ProChoice New York For New York to be able to send a signal a hopeful sign a sense of the turning of the tide we think is really important Abortion rights advocates say that even though the Roe decision supersedes state law some doctors are hesitant to perform lateterm abortions when a womans health is at risk because the criminal statutes remain on the books Doctors and hospitals shouldnt be reading criminal laws to determine what types of health services they can offer and provide to their patients said M Tracey Brooks the president ofÂ Family Planning Advocates of New York State For Mr Cuomo the debate over passing a new abortion law presents an opportunity to appeal to women as well as to liberals who have sought action in Albany without success since Eliot Spitzer made a similar proposal when he was governor But it also poses a challenge to the coalition of Republicans and a few Democrats that controls the State Senate the chamber that has in the past stood as the primary obstacle to passing abortion legislation in the capital The governor has said that his Reproductive Health Act would be one plank of a 10part Womens Equality Act that also would include equal pay and antidiscrimination provisions Conservative groups still stinging from the willingness of Republican lawmakers to go along with Mr Cuomos push to legalize samesex marriage in 2011 are mobilizing against the proposal Seven thousand New Yorkers who oppose the measure have sent messages to Mr Cuomo and legislators via the Web site of the New York State Catholic Conference A number of antiabortion groups have also formed a coalition called New Yorkers for Life which is seeking to rally opposition to the governors proposal using social media  If you ask anyone on the street Is there enough abortion in New York no one in their right mind would say we need more abortion said the Rev Jason J McGuire the executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms which is part of the coalition Members of both parties say that the issue of reproductive rights was a significant one in Novembers legislative elections Democrats who were bolstered by an independent expenditure campaign by NARAL credit their victories in several key Senate races in part to their pledge to fight for legislation similar to what Mr Cuomo is planning to propose Republicans who make up most of the coalition that controls the Senate have generally opposed new abortion rights measures Speaking with reporters recently the leader of the Republicans Dean G Skelos of Long Island strenuously objected to rewriting the states abortion laws especially in a manner similar to what the governor is seeking You could have an abortion up until the day the child would be born and I think thats just wrong Mr Skelos said He suggested that the entire debate was unnecessary noting that abortion is legal in New York State and saying that is not going to be changed The Senate Democratic leader Andrea StewartCousins of Yonkers who is the sponsor of a bill that is similar to the legislation the governor is drafting said she was optimistic that an abortion measure would reach the Senate floor this year  New York States abortion laws were passed in 1970 in a bipartisan fashion she said It would be a sad commentary that over 40 years later we could not manage to do the same thing
Catholicism Inc.,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/18/opinion/keller-catholicism-inc.html,Behold a global business in distress  incoherently managed resistant to the modernizing forces of the Internet age tainted by scandal and corruption It needs to tweak its marketing straighten out its finances up its recruiting game and repair its battered brand Ecce Catholicism Inc Yes the business of the church is saving souls but it is nevertheless a business a closely held conglomerate with a work force of more than a million 12 billion moreorless regular customers 10 times as many outlets as Starbucks more real estate than Donald Trump dreams of and lobbying clout to rival that of any secular industry Now its CEO physically and mentally depleted at age 85 is stepping down creating an opportunity for a serious relaunch  Catholicism is mostly a service industry  Canyon Ranch for the spirit if you will  and its deliverables have stood the test of millenniums instruction in how to live a good life sacraments to consecrate major milestones comfort in times of distress the cleansing therapy of confession penance and absolution a sense of place in the universal order and the promise of a celestial payoff The fundamental problems are not in the catalog There is still a robust market for the faith The problem  evident in the waning confidence of the customers as well as the rising market share of evangelical startups and none of the above  is with the management  As we wait for the ecclesiastical board of directors to fill the Chair of St Peter Ive been asking professional consultants including some who work with the church what Catholicism Inc might learn from the temporal business world After all while the church adapts at a glacial pace it does adapt The churchs teachings have evolved not just on the liturgy but also on issues as fraught as priestly celibacy slavery moneylending war and peace wealth and poverty divorce and the role of women even that most divisive of issues abortion was not always defined as strictly as it is now For starters my experts generally agree it would help to have a pope with the drive and charisma to reboot the mission someone with the gift of persuasion a bit of media savvy and enough years ahead of him to follow through I dont want to make it all about age but wouldnt it be nice to have somebody who was closer to 60 than to 80 said a consultant who has helped reverse the fortunes of a major airline and a global fastfood chain Like some of my experts he preferred to speak on background Pope John Paul II became pope at age 58 and before his papacy sank into scandal and Parkinsons he was a beloved globetrotting dynamo Benedict XVI was 78 at the start and he felt a bit like a caretaker The first major task facing Benedicts successor will be to get past the lingering horror story of predatory priests to restore the trust of the faithful and the respect of the general public The business world has much to teach about surviving scandal Michael Useem director of the Center for Leadership and Change Management at the Wharton School told me the church might learn from the way Warren Buffett cleaned up Salomon Brothers after a bondtrading scandal and Ed Breen revived Tyco International after its chief executive went to prison for theft The remedies were bold and effective First a purge of those responsible for the abuses and the coverup Managing out as it is called in the corporate vernacular has been a major weakness in the church so it was heartening to hear the Vatican spokesman say that Benedicts retirement could open the door for a potential wave of resignations Second unstinting disclosure to investigators waiving any privileges Third appointment of a compliance officer with impeccable credentials ethical tenacity and conspicuous support at the top At Tyco the new leadership went on a highprofile road show of the companys outposts to drive home the reforms Can you imagine Useem said if the new pope went on a tour and at every stop he met with the local clergy and said Its a new church Weve been at it for a couple thousand years and at this point we need to uphold the principles we all hold dear and here are my 10 steps for making that happen   Once the new pope has dealt with the legacy of past disgrace it will be time to look ahead Ted Stenger a corporate turnaround expert at the consulting firm AlixPartners and a devoted Catholic pointed out that most big companies assemble their executives every few years for an intensive strategic review The last time the church took stock was the Second Vatican Council half a century ago The mission of the church is not going to change Stenger said But how you set objectives and tactics to deliver on the mission may in fact change One question on the agenda might be to borrow a Michael Useem analogy does the Vatican want to be Nokia or Apple Nokias strategy is to sell everyone on the planet a 20 phone Apples is to market a much pricier product to a more elite highincome market Does the Catholic Church change its standards to be more inclusive or does it hold its dogmatic line and appeal to a smaller but loyal base Or can it strike a balance Either way its time for a reckoning A second big question might be how much latitude to give to the more than 220000 parishes McDonalds has a basic menu that is consistent around the globe but it gives local franchises license to adapt to local preferences  wine with your Big Mac in France vegetarian dishes in India You will find Catholic parishes in cities like New York and San Francisco where gay couples are warmly welcomed women participate in the liturgy and the sermons and music are joyously unconventional You will find others that favor the Latin mass incense and everything by the book Rome could encourage the parishes to be laboratories of worship Useem notes that in business and in the military by the way giving field officers freedom to execute the mission produces creative solutions and its also just a tremendous energizer Another headache the new pope will inherit is recruiting especially in North America and Europe In the United States the Catholic work force is shrinking by 50 priests and 175 nuns every month One parish in five has no pastor An obvious solution is to ordain women and let priests marry The monopoly of celibate males after all is a longestablished custom but it is not core Catholic doctrine Then again if the church decides to be smaller the Apple model it wont need so much ministering As you might expect of an institution that measures time in centuries the church has been slow to join the digital world Pope Benedict tweeting as Pontifex has 15 million followers which is pretty good but he has tweeted exactly 35 times  and the messages read like boilerplate composed by a dutiful intern Bill Derrough a specialist in corporate restructuring and a fundraiser for Catholic charities said that if parishes simply got the names of their members into the computer they could organize meetups share best practices spread news If the pope wanted to send a message to all parishioners I dont know how hed do it Derrough said Learning from product marketers and political campaigns I think you could drive an increase in attendance I think you could drive an increase in collections My wifes church has hired an online collection service called ParishPay to put the Sunday offering on digital autopilot but most churches still pass a basket Finally and obviously the church could use some public relations help Its stock response to criticism from without or dissent from within has been to drop into a defensive crouch stonewall or go negative That can come across as bullying and arrogant  in other words not very Christian One of the costliest examples of dumb messaging is the tendency of church defenders to treat nuns and women in general with condescension Did the Vatican really expel an order of nuns from their cloister so the place could be refurbished as a suite for the retiring Benedict Whose idea was that  I realize that many devout Catholics recoil from suggestions of change especially if the suggestions come from deserters like me But troubled enterprises often benefit from a little outside counsel And in the unlikely event that a new pope wants to bring the church closer to the 21st century he will need all the help he can get This is a far tougher turnaround than the ones I have led said an executive who has helped save more than one foundering Fortune 500 company You might need to tap the guy that turned water into wine

The Popeâ€™s Muffled Voice,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/opinion/bruni-the-popes-muffled-voice.html,There were reports over the weekend that cardinals might tweak the rules and begin the conclave to choose Pope Benedict XVIs successor sooner than March 15 which had been the earliest date mentioned That would be a blessing Already in the American news media its all pope all the time a tsunami of papal coverage and until a new pope is named the tide wont quit Youd be forgiven for concluding that hell actually have significant sway over Catholics in this country He wont not over the majority of them not in any immediate sense And its worth pausing amid this hoopla to remember that In large parts of the Roman Catholic world certainly in North America and Western Europe most Catholics dont feel any particular debt or duty to the selfappointed caretakers of their church They dont feel bound by the popes interpretation of doctrine or moral commands And many regard him and other Vatican officials as totems a royal family of dubious relevance partly because these officials have often shown greater concern for the churchs reputation than for the needs and wounds of the people in the pews The blanket coverage of matters papal is deceptive a function to some degree of habit and convenience We in the media love the clearcut drama of transitions Theyre easy to grasp and frame And in the case of the Vatican they come with majestic visual backdrops colorfully costumed characters a pageant extraordinaire It looks splendid on the front page and even better on the nightly news We traffic in celebrities and the pope qualifies as one We also relish the narrative of any winnertakeall contest in which there are multiple hopefuls murky dynamics and a familiar brand of suspense This informs the way we approach presidential elections focusing on the horse race It explains all the cookoffs the singoffs the analyses of the faceoff between Argo and Lincoln for Best Picture The papal selection process is in one sense Top Chef without the cooking Its the ecclesiastical Oscars It fits a mold regardless of import Theres import certainly The Roman Catholic Church is a worldwide organization with enormous financial resources with a network of charities and agencies that provide crucial help to the downtrodden and with parishes in which the prayerful nurture their relationship with God And the pope is its CEO ultimately responsible for where the money flows and for the placement and policing of its staff The policing part matters as the child sexual abuse crisis made agonizingly clear But the trend over the last half century has been for the prayerful in this country to feel less invested in that organization less attached to its traditions Polls chart a decline in churchgoing among American Catholics and a robust disobedience A 2011 survey published in the National Catholic Reporter showed that while 73 percent of American Catholics described their belief in Jesus resurrection as very important to them only 30 percent described the teaching authority of the Vatican that way and only 21 percent characterized an allmale celibate priesthood in those terms More than 60 percent supported the ordination of women as priests When it comes to divorce premarital sex abortion and more Catholics routinely break with the churchs edicts Pew pollingÂ last yearÂ foundÂ thatÂ more than halfÂ of American Catholics support samesex marriage which church leaders vociferously opposeÂ This particular renunciation of church teaching travels beyond the United States Spain Portugal and Argentina have legalized samesex marriage all have populations that are more than 75 percent Catholic at least nominally A Gallup poll last year showed that 82 percent of American Catholics had no qualms about birth control Church leaders do and during the presidential campaign they railed against President Obamas health care reform for mandating insurance coverage of contraception He won the Catholic vote anyway Andrew Cuomo certainly doesnt sweat the churchs ire the way his father did Three decades ago Mario Cuomo felt the need for a major address at the University of Notre Dame to explain the discrepancy between his support for abortion rights and the churchs antiabortion position Without any such handwringing his son is plotting to shore up abortion rights in New York Andrew Cuomo also lobbied for and signed New Yorks gay marriage law Divorced he lives outside of wedlock with Sandra Lee Theres been no Notre Dame soulbaring about any of this  Does the pope fully appreciate this drift Every Sunday he looks from his window onto St Peters Square and sees adoring rapt masses Everywhere he goes traffic parts and cameras follow him But here in America the Catholics watching closely are fewer and fewer Theyre Christian Theyre caring Theyre moral But they have minds and wills of their own and no conclave will change that
Can There Be a Catholic Moment?,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/19/can-there-be-a-catholic-moment/,"My weekend column made the case that Catholicisms influence on American political culture went into steep
                                        decline across the eight years of Benedict XVIs pontificate as the Republicans turned from the solidarityinflected language of compassionate conservatism to the rhetoric of makers versus takers
                                        and the Democrats swung leftward on abortion and picked religiousliberty fights with Catholic institutions The American Conservatives
                                        Rod Dreher agrees with me but basically argues that it was inevitably going to be thus because the patterns of American modernity
                                        make any hope a Catholic moment in our politics or culture essentially chimerical It is too convenient to blame the execrable behavior of the bishops in the abuse scandal for the end of the Catholic moment  The rotten behavior of the bishops among others hastened the decline of Catholic
                                            authority in American life but if were honest we will have to admit that even if the bishops had been luminous saints to the man the second coming of the Apostles things wouldnt be all that
                                            different from where they stand today The fact of the matter is that Roman Catholic Christianity also Orthodox Christianity and some forms of Protestantism cannot be reconciled with the expressive individualism that is the hallmark of late modern
                                            civilization Â there never was a possibility for a Catholic moment in America Not even American Catholics agree on what it means to be Catholic and what is required of them as Catholics 
                                            Catholicism in this country has lost its distinctives because many probably most actual Catholics have no sense that the faith they profess calls them to accept and to live by a set of theological and moral
                                            precepts that they may struggle to accept but must accept because God revealed them authoritatively through His church One may say this is a good thing this Protestantization of Catholicism or one may decry it as a bad thing But I dont see how one can credibly say that it doesnt exist Catholicism understood
                                            on its own terms is radically opposed to American culture and to the essence of modernity Catholicism as understood by most American Catholics is not Theres the problem with the Catholic moment
                                            and why it was never going to happen Of course the behavior of the bishops in the abuse crisis didnt help but ultimately it was beside the point I share Drehers doubts about the essential compatibility of Catholicism and liberal modernity but I think this is much too absolute a line A kind of Catholic moment in our politics and culture
                                        need not require perfect unity within the church nor a sweeping renunciation of individualism on the part of those outside it It only requires that distinctively Catholic ideas about the common good enjoy more
                                        influence and prestige than they do at present  and even in an age of institutional Christian weakness this seems to me an attainable goal America can remain a minority Catholic country and orthodox believers
                                        can remain a minority within the larger group of selfidentified Catholics without Catholic influence on American society necessarily tracing an arc of permanent decline Certainly the experience of the last century suggests as much To generalize a bit Catholicism enjoyed more influence in the United States in the 1950s than in the 1920s and more influence
                                        in the 1990s than in the 1970s The Republican Party took more cues from Catholic social teaching in 2000 than in 1994 and the Democratic Party seemed friendlier to Catholic ideas in 2006 than in 1992 And while
                                        deep structural forces  mass immigration the Cold War the sexual revolutionÂ Â mattered to the ebbs and flows of Catholic influence individual personalities and thinkers mattered immensely
                                        as well The Catholic liberals of the 1930s and the Catholic neoconservatives of the 1970s shaped law and public policy debates more decisively than either the Catholic left or right does today John Paul II and

                                        Cuomo and Andrew Cuomo are both cafeteria Catholics but the father was straining however unpersuasively to keep a certain kind of Catholic liberalism alive whereas the son is a functionally postCatholic creature

                                        had been not luminous saints regarding sex abuse but just more competent and courageous and less selfprotective and corrupt the church they shepherd would enjoy and deserve significantly more

                                        the American religious story I also think that Catholic social thought would enjoy more bipartisan appeal today if the Bush presidency had ended in something other than disaster that Catholic ideas would find
                                        a wider audience if Catholic pundits and intellectuals were more critical of their respective teams of left and right and that the churchs media image would be less tarnished if the Vatican
                                        bureaucracy could be dragged into the 20th century let alone the 21st Im sure I could come up with many more such counterfactuals given world and time enough Â and I dont think Im
                                        pining for an impossible Arcadia by imagining that at least some of them were plausible Again Im not denying that the Catholic faith will always be rowing against the currents of a latemodern mass democracy like ours But boats can beat successfully against a current and make room for more passengers
                                        on board or they can just be carried backward toward the sea A Catholic moment exists in this sense when the barque of Peter seems to be making some headway Â and to the extent that
                                        such a moment has vanished in our own era as much blame has to belong to the rowers who ignored obvious rocks smashed their oars or kicked holes in the bottom as to the river of modernity itself"

Reproductive Rights in New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/20/opinion/strengthening-reproductive-rights-in-new-york.html,New York State once led the nation in advancing womens rights Gov Andrew Cuomo wants to reestablish that preeminence with an omnibus agenda on womens equality The most important piece of that agenda would essentially enshrine in state law existing federal protections for abortion rights Antiquated language in the states abortion law bans the procedure after 24 weeks of pregnancy unless the womans life is at risk Federal rulings also require an exception to protect a womans health Mr Cuomos proposal would bring New York into line with those standards  This is important because complications severely affecting a womans health often arise later in pregnancy Although New Yorks law cannot be enforced because it is superseded by federal law as a practical matter some New York doctors fear prosecution and as a result some women are forced to leave the state to get the care they need Mr Cuomos proposal is a crucial move at a crucial time A strong law would help inoculate New Yorks abortion laws against future watering down of reproductive rights at the federal level Seven other states  California Connecticut Hawaii Maine Maryland Nevada and Washington  have already passed similar protections In contrast lawmakers in Mississippi Arkansas North Dakota South Dakota and Wyoming have made state laws so restrictive that each of these states has just a single abortion provider Some states could soon have no abortion services at all  According to a report in The Times on Sunday the Cuomo bill would shift the states abortion law from the criminal code to the health care laws where it belongs It would also make it clearer that licensed health care practitioners as well as physicians could perform abortions  Updating the abortion law would be only one section of Mr Cuomos 10part agenda on womens rights His proposal would provide new protections for pregnant workers and victims of domestic violence It would ban job housing and salary discrimination against women with children who he says are less likely to be recommended for hire and promoted These are all worthy changes  With so many forces working across the country to undermine a womans reproductive rights lawmakers in New York should move solidly and swiftly in the other direction

                                        say and not to say We felt Carmona told me last week that science was being politicized And if the surgeon general is not empowered to state the nonpartisan case based on the best science then who will Good question Because its the surgeon generals job  or should be  to evaluate science and present a considered impartial recommendation Carmona thinks a State of the Nations
                                        Health should be a required annual report like the State of the Union Lacking that there is no official and identifiable spokesperson for the nations public health and the obfuscation and confusion
                                        sown by Big Food along with its outright lies and lobbying might has created a situation in which no one in power will speak the truth that our diet is making us sick causing millions of premature deaths each

Irked British Judge Sets Retrial for Ex-Wife of Ex-Official,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/21/world/europe/british-judge-sets-retrial-for-vicky-pryce-in-ticket-case.html,LONDON  After nearly 15 hours of jury deliberations over four days a judge on Wednesday abruptly ordered a retrial for Vicky Pryce the exwife of a former energy minister who became entangled in a feud with her husband over a decision 10 years ago to accept responsibility for a speeding ticket he incurred on a highway outside London The judges order for a new trial to begin on Monday prolonged most likely for weeks what has been one of Britains most closely followed criminal cases in years The controversy assumed a new dimension when the judge Sir Nigel Sweeney abruptly dismissed the jury after members failed to reach a majority 10to2 verdict an option the judge granted after the jury reported being deadlocked  In winding up the trial the judge strongly suggested that the jurors had been incompetent He said they appeared to have a fundamental deficit of understanding about the British justice system including the role of a trial and a jury after they plied him with basic questions about the system in the Southwark Crown Court in south London  In 30 years of criminal trials he said I have never come across this at this stage never The judge noted that one of 10 questions the jury sent him on Tuesday after three days of deliberations sought an explanation of the requirement to prove a defendants guilt beyond a reasonable doubt  an issue the judge said he had already explained in writing saying that the wording was in plain English and its meaning selfevident Another question involved a jurors right to make a decision on the basis of reasons not presented in court and not supported by facts or evidence cited by the juror to others in the jury room Yet another question involved Ms Pryces religion also unmentioned in court and whether she could be found not guilty on the presumption of faithbased subservience to her husband The new trial for the Greekborn Ms Pryce 60 meant a further delay for Chris Huhne her former husband a multimillionaire investment consultant before entering politics in learning whether he will go to jail as Justice Sweeney warned that he might after he pleaded guilty to perverting the course of justice the charge Ms Pryce also faces After years of denying that he was the driver Mr Huhne 58 changed his plea as soon as the court sat earlier this month and simultaneously resigned his parliamentary seat effectively ending his political career He had quit as energy minister after the couple were charged last year Ms Pryce has admitted to having falsely signed as the driver in the speeding case saying she did so to spare her husband losing his license after a series of previous speeding convictions She has coupled this with a defense of marital coercion saying she felt she had absolutely no choice after her husband mailed a form to the police naming her as the driver then harassed her into signing a followup summons something he has denied  With the case hinging on the issue of coercion evidence roamed freely through intimate aspects of the couples 25year marriage Ms Pryce an economist and mother of five testified that her husband citing his need to avoid distractions from his business career twice pressed her to have abortions successfully on one occasion She has also admitted that she teamed up with an editor for The Sunday Times of London in a planned expos about the ticket swap in revenge for her husbands leaving her in 2010 for an aide Carina Trimingham

What Facebook's Search Engine Tells Us,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/23iht-letter23.html,NEW YORK  Oh the things you learn on Facebooks new search engine Among them that the hardware chain Home Depot wins the top ranking among employers of people who like sadomasochism that a lot of people are not embarrassed to profess a like of Hitler but only nine of them reside in Germany including one man with an apparently Muslim name who claims to work for NASA and that abortion is prominently labeled a disease and more than 6000 people like it anyway You learn that some women call themselves the wives of men who call themselves single That either a lot of people from conservative nonEnglishspeaking societies want the world to know theyre bisexual or they dont share Facebooks definition of being interested in people That there is support for democracy in North Korea but on Facebook at least it comes from one man And that yes there are people from Chengdu China now living in central Iowa and yes four of them are single Facebooks new tool is called Graph Search Imagine the ferocious analytical horsepower of Google applied to Facebooks data your pictures likes and dislikes when and where you were born where you were educated where you work your religion sexual orientation and political views  though the engine searches only those things that you have chosen to make public or more to the point with Facebook neglected to make private The new tool is being rolled out slowly after signing up some weeks ago I recently gained access Even at its most basic Graph Search changes the kind of thing that Facebook is It converts it from a virtual coffeehouse where you come to hang out with people you know into a zone of discovery For the first time the vast universe of your nonfriends feels as real and accessible and interesting as your little galaxy of friends Graph Search can find you the Goldman Sachs employee and mind you there is no factchecking on Facebook so these are selfauthored identities who likes the drinking game beer pong or who is in an open relationship It can lead you to restaurants in South Africa favored by those who also like Amman and Dallas It can if this is your thing show you pictures of Christians taken at the beach Playing around with the tool what becomes clear is that many people have not factored an extraordinary appetitive and curious search engine into their decisions about what to confess to Facebook As Graph Search is more widely disseminated a number of people may be stunned to learn how they can be found as a man named Tom Scott argued last month in a Tumblr he created called Actual Facebook Graph Searches which received considerable attention The new tool makes it easy for example to find the names of people who live in Utah like polygamy and are married Its equally painless to find people living in Cuba who are fans of capitalism and Milton Friedman himself It empowers officials in Uganda and Iran where homosexuality is illegal to look up which of their citizens are interested in members of the same sex As Mr Scott has pointed out the tool would be very helpful to a Chinese official looking for family members of residents who like the banned spiritual movement Falun Gong These may seem like extreme cases The perils for ordinary uncontroversial people though different remain real The discourse about privacy tends to assume that some things require sacred protection and other things are better disclosed than not But much of the information circulating about you online is in an inbetween category obscure Graph Search makes the obscure nonobscure which is why the Web site GigaOM after playing with the tool quickly declared the end of privacy by obscurity If Graph Search changes anything about how we live it may be that it decisively shifts the burden of privacy onto you It is now your duty to opt out of being discovered And yet the creepiness of Graph Search is matched by a lessheralded loveliness It offers reminders search after search of how marvelously complicated this little planet can be If our politics often devolve into blackandwhite struggles Facebook reveals that most of us live in the grays  In digital life as in life itself people are multiple  and yet on the Internet there may be less pressure to flatten multiplicity than there is at work or at home You neednt just be a mom or a humanresources person or a Parisian Graph Search points to a world in which you can be a Muslim and like the Web series Old Jews Telling Jokes Or work for an American university in Bangladesh and like the Taliban leader Mullah Muhammad Omar You can be Brazilian and like Argentina You can admire Al Qaeda in Iraq and the rapper Eminem You can be a gay Mormon You can support abortion and still think that its murder I know what youre thinking Yes stop reading and get thee to your Facebook settings  before your Facebook settings get you  Join an

"Alan F. Westin, Who Transformed Privacy Debate Before the Web Era, Dies at 83",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/23/us/alan-f-westin-scholar-who-defined-right-to-privacy-dies-at-83.html,Alan F Westin a legal scholar who nearly half a century ago defined the modern right to privacy in the incipient computer age  a definition that anticipated the reach of Big Brother and helped circumscribe its limits  died on Monday in Saddle River NJ He was 83 The cause was cancer his family said A lawyer and political scientist Mr Westin was at his death emeritus professor of public law at Columbia where he had taught for nearly 40 years Through his work  notably his book Privacy and Freedom published in 1967 and still a canonical text  Mr Westin was considered to have created almost singlehandedly the modern field of privacy law He testified frequently on the subject before Congress spoke about it on television and radio and wrote about it for newspapers and magazines  He was the most important scholar of privacy since Louis Brandeis Jeffrey Rosen a professor of law at George Washington University and the legal affairs editor of The New Republic said in a telephone interview on Thursday He transformed the privacy debate by defining privacy as the ability to control how much about ourselves we reveal to others Since the first hominid grunted gossip about the hominid next door every new communications medium has entailed new impingements on privacy In a seminal 1890 article in The Harvard Law Review Mr Brandeis the future Supreme Court Justice and his law partner Samuel D Warren were the first to articulate privacy as a legal right defining it as the right to be let alone Brandeis and Warren were concerned primarily with covert photography later scholarship including work by Mr Westin in the 1950s centered on things like illegal wiretapping But by the 1960s and 70s as the widespread computerization of legal financial medical and other personal records loomed technology had outrun the law Reproductive rights cases of the period  including the landmark Supreme Court cases Griswold v Connecticut in 1965 and Roe v Wade in 1973  held that the Constitution protected an individuals right to privacy in matters of the human body including contraceptive use and abortion rights But the law was largely silent on the question of how personal data might be used by government or the private sector During these years long before the personal computer and longer still before the Internet Mr Westin set out to codify just this kind of privacy for the modern age  He knew social history and he could appreciate the directions that the technology was pushing the social contract Lance J Hoffman the director of George Washingtons Cyber Security Policy and Research Institute said in an interview Individuals Mr Westin argued in Privacy and Freedom have the right to determine how much of their personal information is disclosed and to whom how it should be maintained and how disseminated This concept became the cornerstone of our modern right to privacy said Marc Rotenberg the executive director of the Electronic Privacy Information Center an advocacy group in Washington Part of Privacy and Freedom is the argument that privacy enables freedom Privacy and Freedom received two prestigious journalism prizes the George Polk Award and the Hillman Prize The book along with other work by Mr Westin is widely considered the foundation of a spate of modern privacy laws among them the Privacy Act of 1974 the first law to delimit the gathering and use of personal information by the federal government Mr Westin was no absolutist In his early work on wiretapping for instance he condoned its use in certain instances including cases where national security was at stake His argument prefigured the current national debate about privacy engendered by post911 legislation like the Patriot Act which Mr Westin in a 2003 interview called a justified piece of legislation  He insisted on a balance between the competing demands of privacy disclosure and surveillance Mr Rosen said Much of his work in the 1960s and 70s appears so prescient after 911 and in the age of Internet When it came to the use of consumers personal data by corporations Mr Westin also steered a middle course Consumers were entitled to withhold such data he argued but were equally entitled if they wished to have it used to alert them to products and services targeted to their interests This stance caused Mr Westin to be accused by some critics of allying himself too closely with business interests Mr Westin who in the 1970s was editor in chief of The Civil Liberties Review a publication of the American Civil Liberties Foundation published and edited the newsletter Privacy  American Business from 1993 to 2006 He was a consultant on privacy issues to major corporations including Equifax the consumer credit reporting giant GlaxoSmithKline the pharmaceutical concern and Verizon Communications  Mr Westins wife died before him as did a son David His survivors include a son Jeremy a daughter Debra Westin and three grandchildren A posthumous book by Mr Westin about privacy as a historically and philosophically Jewish construct is being completed by Mr Rosen In recent years Mr Westin turned his attention to the Niagara of personal data loosed by Google Facebook and their ilk Trying to stem this tide was a hopeless task and he knew it  He recognized that the problems of protecting privacy are now so daunting that they cant be dealt with by law alone but require a mix of legal social and technological solutions Mr Rosen said The son of Irving Westin and the former Etta Furman Alan Furman Westin was born in Manhattan on Oct 11 1929 received a bachelors degree in political science from the University of Florida in 1948 followed by a law degree from Harvard in 1951 was admitted to the bar in 1952 married Bea Shapoff a teacher in 1954 in a ceremony in which the bride wore a waltzlength white gown joined the Columbia faculty in 1959 earned a PhD in political science from Harvard in 1965 his dissertation topic was Privacy in

"C. Everett Koop, Forceful U.S. Surgeon General, Dies at 96",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/us/c-everett-koop-forceful-surgeon-general-dies-at-96.html,Dr C Everett Koop who was widely regarded as the most influential surgeon general in American history and played a crucial role in changing public attitudes about smoking died on Monday at his home in Hanover NH He was 96 His death was confirmed by Susan A Wills an assistant at the Geisel School of Medicine at Dartmouth College which has an institute named after Dr Koop Dr Koop had never served in public office when President Ronald Reagan appointed him surgeon general of the United States in 1981 By the time he stepped down in 1989 he had become a household name a rare distinction for a public health administrator Dr Koop issued emphatic warnings about the dangers of smoking he almost singlehandedly pushed the government into taking a more aggressive stand against AIDS and despite his moral opposition to abortion he refused to use his office as a pulpit from which to preach against it These stands led many liberals who had opposed his nomination to praise him and many conservatives who had supported his appointment to vilify him Conservative politicians representing tobaccogrowing states were among his harshest critics and many Americans for moral or religious reasons were upset by his public programs to fight AIDS and felt betrayed by his relative silence on abortion As much as anyone it was Dr Koop who took the lead in trying to wean Americans off smoking and he did so in imposing fashion At a sturdy 6foot1 with his bushy gray biblical beard Dr Koop would appear before television cameras in the goldbraided darkblue uniform of a vice admiral  the surgeon generals official uniform which he revived  and sternly warn of the terrible consequences of smoking Smoking kills 300000 Americans a year he said in one talk Smokers are 10 times more likely to develop lung cancer than nonsmokers two times more likely to develop heart disease Smoking a pack a day takes six years off a persons life When Dr Koop took office 33 percent of Americans smoked when he left the percentage had dropped to 26 By 1987 40 states had restricted smoking in public places 33 had prohibited it on public conveyances and 17 had banned it in offices and other work sites More than 800 local antismoking ordinances had been passed and the federal government had restricted smoking in 6800 federal buildings Antismoking campaigns by private groups like the American Lung Association and the American Heart Association had accelerated Dr Koop also played a major role in educating Americans about AIDS Though he believed that the nation had been slow in facing the crisis he extolled its efforts once it did particularly in identifying HIV the virus that causes the disease and in developing a blood test to detect it Where he failed in his own view was to interest either Reagan or his successor as president George Bush in making health care available to more Americans Dr Koop was completing a successful career as a pioneer in pediatric surgery when he was nominated for surgeon general having caught the attention of conservatives with a series of seminars films and books in collaboration with the theologian Francis Schaeffer that expressed antiabortion views At his confirmation hearings Senate liberals mounted a fierce fight against him Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts said Dr Koop in denying a right to abortion adhered to a cruel outdated and patronizing stereotype of women Womens rights organizations public health groups medical associations and others lobbied against his appointment An editorial in The New York Times called him Dr Unqualified But after months of testimony and delay he was confirmed by a vote of 68 to 24 garnering more support than many had expected Some senators who had been hesitant to support him said he had convinced them of his integrity Dr Koop himself said he had taken a principled approach to the nomination As he and his wife Elizabeth had driven to Washington for the confirmation hearings he recalled telling her If I ever have to say anything I dont believe or feel shouldnt be said well go home An Only Child in Brooklyn Charles Everett Koop was born on Oct 14 1916 in Brooklyn and grew up in a threestory brick house in South Brooklyn surrounded by relatives his paternal grandparents lived on the third floor and his maternal grandparents as well as uncles aunts and cousins lived on the same street He was the only child of John Everett Koop a banker and descendant of 17thcentury Dutch settlers of New York and the former Helen Apel Dr Koop traced his interest in medicine to watching his familys doctors at work as a child To develop the manual dexterity of a surgeon he practiced tying knots and cutting pictures out of magazines with each hand At 14 he sneaked into an operating theater at Columbia Universitys medical college At home he operated on rabbits rats and stray cats in the basement after his mother had administered anesthesia By his account not one of the animals died While attending high school at the private Flatbush School he worked as a summer volunteer in hospitals near his familys vacation home in Port Washington on Long Island He attended Dartmouth College and after graduating entered Cornell University Medical College in Manhattan and married Elizabeth Flanagan of New Britain Conn a Vassar student Dr Koop completed his residency at the University of Pennsylvania Hospital where he acquired a reputation for boldness Afterward his surgery professor Dr I S Ravdin offered him a job as surgeon in chief of Childrens Hospital in Philadelphia a rare offer for someone so young Dr Koop held that position until the Reagan administration recruited him 35 years later By then he had become renowned in medicine as an innovator in surgery on infants He and his colleagues performed thousands of operations to correct birth defects in premature babies or other newborns 475 operations alone were on those with esophageal atresia a condition previously fatal in which the esophagus and the stomach are not connected In one case after cutting open the side of a babys chest to find an entire section of the esophagus missing he built on the spot a new link out of tissue from the babys colon It became standard procedure for repairing such a defect He also did groundbreaking work in separating conjoined twins Faith and Principle His experience in correcting birth defects compelled him to thrust himself into the middle of a controversy in the early 1980s over the rights of infants with congenital defects to receive medical care In two cases involving infants identified as Baby Doe and Baby Jane Doe those who favored government intervention to save a disabled child were pitted against liberals libertarians and medical groups who argued that parents had the right to withhold treatment from a child who was severely impaired Though courts sided with the parents Dr Koop spoke out against the parents decisions in both cases saying that the medical and legal establishments had a duty to protect citizens against neglect and discrimination no matter their age and that a governments authority to override the rights of parents had been established in truancy law and in child abuse and immunization laws Baby Doe died while the case was being appealed to the United States Supreme Court Baby Jane Doe survived though a delay in treatment was believed to have contributed to her severe retardation Dr Koop often said that his Presbyterian faith had helped him and his wife cope with the death of his 19yearold son David who was killed in 1968 when a cliff gave way while he was climbing in New Hampshire Dr Koop and his wife wrote about the loss of a child in Sometimes Mountains Move published in 1974 Dr Koops religion was also central to his opposition to abortion which he considered a violation of divine principle But once in public office he said he found it necessary to declare  to the disappointment of the White House  that evidence did not support the contention that abortions were essentially unsafe In taking that position he later said he was being nave He had failed to realize that the Reagan administration expected him to oppose abortion zealously he wrote in his 1991 autobiography Koop The Memoirs of Americas Family Doctor And in an interview for this obituary in 1996 he said he had declined to speak out on abortion because he thought his job was to deal with factual health issues like the hazards of smoking not to express opinions on moral issues Abortion presented little health hazard to women he said so it was a moral and religious matter not a health issue Taking On Big Tobacco Dr Koop said he had begun campaigning against smoking after studying the research into its link to cancer heart disease stroke and other diseases He was dumbfounded he said and then plainly furious at the tobacco industry for attempting to obfuscate and trivialize this extraordinarily important public information In taking on the tobacco lobby he was also taking on powerful politicians from tobaccogrowing states After Dr Koop accused the industry of directing advertising at children and threatening human lives Gov Jim Hunt of North Carolina a Democrat called for his impeachment and Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina tried in vain to have Congress investigate him Dr Koop came to believe that the Reagan administration itself offered only lukewarm support for the antismoking publiceducation campaign A SmokeFree Society by the Year 2000 Feeling stymied he said he asked himself What if I called on America itself So he embarked on a national speaking tour in 1984 often wearing the uniform of his office The uniform he said was intended to help restore his diminishing authority as the surgeon general and director of the Public Health Service In 1986 a surgeon generals report expanded the alarm about smoking stating that secondhand smoke had also been conclusively proved to cause cancer Over the next year federal state and local governments and private businesses began to restrict smoking in public and quasipublic places like restaurants airports and workplaces In 2004 he joined with three other former surgeons general to offer a plan to cut cigarette smoking in part with a 2apack tax increase AIDS had just been discovered when Dr Koop was awaiting confirmation in 1981 But within weeks with 108 cases reported in the United States and 43 deaths I knew we were in big trouble he said He realized later he said that the Reagan administration had been slow to address the disease because the election had brought to power people who were antithetical to homosexuals then thought to be its only victims As the epidemic worsened reaching drug addicts infected with contaminated needles and hemophiliacs who had received a contaminated bloodclotting factor Reagan in 1986 asked Dr Koop to prepare a special report Dr Koop proceeded cautiously knowing the report would be unpopular with many in the administration with conservatives in Congress and with church groups opposed to homosexuality He wrote 17 drafts A Public Profile With its release he was attacked as advocating that third graders be taught about sodomy and that 8yearolds be given condoms What the report said was that the best protection against AIDS was abstinence and monogamy but that for those who practiced neither condoms were a necessary precaution White House aides tried to get him to delete the reference to condoms but he refused to alter the report or make it more morally judgmental He prevailed and the government eventually printed more than 20 million copies of the report Dr Koop later wrote that political meddlers in the White House had complicated his work on the disease and that at least a dozen times I pleaded with my critics in the White House to let me have a meeting with President Reagan on AIDS in the mid1980s Too many people he said placed conservative ideology far above saving human lives He added Our first public health priority to stop the further transmission of the AIDS virus became needlessly mired in the homosexual politics of the early 1980s We lost a great deal of precious time because of this and I suspect we lost some lives as well Dr Koop had no success in pushing the Reagan administration to take action on delivering health care to Americans who could not afford it He announced his resignation after Mr Bush was elected president in 1988 and did not name him secretary of health and human services as Dr Koop had hoped Dr Koops first wife died in 2007 he is survived by their three children Allen Norman and Elizabeth Thompson eight grandchildren and his second wife Cora Hogue whom he married in 2010 In 1992 Dr Koop founded the Koop Foundation in Hanover NH to help strengthen humanitarian values among doctors In 1995 nearing his 80th birthday he became chief executive of a TimeWarner division Time Life Medical to produce videos for sale in pharmacies Dr Koop appeared in the videos each tailored to patients with a newly diagnosed disease to explain the ailment alternative treatments and anticipated outcomes In 1997 he founded DrKoopcom a popular medical information Web site whose critics said blurred the line between objective information and advertising and promotional content The site was valued at more than 1 billion before it went bankrupt in the collapse of the Internet bubble Dr Koop also came under criticism in 1999 when a panel of scientists he led investigated claims that certain chemicals used to make plastics more flexible  in hospital tubes and some childrens toys for example  were dangerous The panel determined that they were safe a finding disputed by Health Care Without Harm an international coalition of health workers advocacy groups and environmentalists Dr Koop maintained a public profile well into his later years In January 2010 he appeared in an advertisement opposing the Democratic health care proposal then being negotiated in Congress saying it threatened to ration health care for older people an assertion that drew criticism as misleading When he stepped down as surgeon general however Dr Koop had won over many of his original detractors The skeptics and cynics this page included were wrong to fear that Surgeon General C Everett Koop would use his office only as a pulpit for his antiabortion views an editorial in The Times said in 1989 as he was leaving office Throughout he has put medical integrity above personal value judgments and has been indeed the nations First Doctor
Which Catholic Church?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/opinion/global/which-catholic-church.html,Being about the only professor at a liberal tolerant cosmopolitan Western university who is known to be a practicing Catholic  baptized at the age of two weeks  I have been asked frequently in recent times about what I think will happen to the church in the light of Pope Benedicts resignation Will it split further between conservatives and liberals Will there be an African pope When will there ever be female priests then bishops What about declining attendance of the European congregations as opposed to the surging populations in the southern world I sigh When I turn to my daily newspapers I sigh further at the stereotyping the false assumptions the hostility in some quarters the focus upon protocol rather than substance the obsession with fiscal laxities at the Vatican rather than the proclaimed mission of Christ Much of this criticism is boringly predictable I may be wrong but I suspect it might be hard to find a month for example when New York Times columnist Maureen Dowd does not launch an attack upon the papacy and the Catholic Church And when the College of Cardinals announces the successor to Benedict there will be fervid speculation about the new popes attitude toward divorce abortion the Jews secularism in Italy and so on That is one view of the Catholic Church the church of hierarchy tradition formalism its bursts of reform soon restrained by a return to conservatism It is the church so familiar to the minds of secularists pagans and antiCatholics everywhere It is the church of the 19thcentury popes It is the church of infallibility incense candles and of Latin masses Pushing it further it is the church of financial corruption and sexual abuse It is the church of stereotype which is not wise In the early 1790s as Europe reeled under the shock of the French Revolution the great English politician and philosopher Edmund Burke warned against condemning an entire nation a France of about 30 million souls for the troubles and wars Shouldnt we be wary of condemning a church of roughly 1 billion believers On Wednesday last week I went as I usually do to work in the lunchtime soup kitchen of the St Thomas More Catholic chaplaincy at Yale University in downtown New Haven Connecticut founded almost 30 years ago to meet the needs of the poor and hungry Among our customers there was the usual group of permanent downandouts meth addicts drinkers druggies and dignified older ladies and gentlemen who had recently lost their jobs and decided to take our food so they could spend their pittances on energy bills There was a father with four young kids the local schools had closed because of a blizzard so they could not get their free school lunches To talk with our clients is sometimes a revelation Just a few weeks ago I talked with a young man never seen before or since who wanted to discuss the poems of Shelley and Keats  plus Eliots Four Quartets The helpers at the soup kitchen are all volunteers they would never expect to be remunerated Not everyone is Catholic but most are They are the parishioners who live around Yale and come in for Sunday Mass and collegiality They are the Yale students who also work in the downtown evening soup kitchen or in the mens overflow night shelter A number of them are going off to Guatemala in midMarch to help rebuild a village still hurting from the civil wars They welcome guest speakers and participate in theological discussion groups This is not a dead or decaying church It is vibrant and pulsing rejoicing also in the beauty of the services especially the sung Masses and the sheer intellectualism of the homilies It is our Catholic Church Nobody is leaving it What happens in Rome is well distant A few Sundays ago the Gospel featured that very familiar tale of the Good Samaritan Luke 102537 A man going to Jericho from Jerusalem was assaulted by robbers then left to die in the ditch A priest came by and rode on A Levite came by and did not stop But the despised Samaritan stopped took the unknown victim to an inn and paid for all that he needed Note that the benefactor did not assist a family member or a college friend or a favored charity Thats simply not enough Even the pagans do that scoffed Jesus in another address The litmus test is whether you help the unknown the desperatelooking person at the soup kitchen the beggar on the street At the end of his striking homily upon this passage the remarkable Catholic chaplain at Yale told us bluntly This is the test Do you love your unknown neighbor as yourself Do you love your dirty hairy smelly dispossessed neighbor as yourself and will you reach out to help Loving your God and loving your known and unknown neighbors as yourself is the core Everything else said Father Bob is footnotes Wow The marriedpriests issue is a footnote the femalepriests issue is a footnote so is divorce contraception Latin Masses changes in the liturgy even perhaps the death penalty What matters is your reaching out to help Thats the sole question you will be asked when you reach the Pearly Gates Does this mean that Catholics do not need a worldwide church structure Not at all We need the parish the parish priest the parish church where most of us will be baptized take Communion and confession get married and eventually enjoy the last rites But those parishes reside under the protective umbrella of a diocese and its bishop  and the line from a bishop goes straight to Rome  The physical parish church offers not only a place for public worship but also a place for study groups social and fundraising events soup kitchens and the like Nobody surely wants to be like the early Christians wandering through deserts and hillsides without a physical place of worship without roots We need the Church Physical just as we need the Church Ethical and the Church Social Even the modest Quakers with their great commitment to prayer and social justice need meeting houses organization and a network But no one launching an attack upon the papal elections Vatican finances sexism and the rest should think that they are attacking Catholicism per se From my perspective our Catholic Church is vibrant helpful intellectual and working in so many ways to fulfill the message to love God and to love and reach out to ones unknown neighbor Everything else is well footnotes   Paul Kennedy is Dilworth Professor of History and director of International Security Studies at Yale University and the author of many

Dependents of the State,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/26/dependents-of-the-state/,"Of all the sins to which an American can succumb the worst may be dependence on the state Think back for a moment to the two biggest missteps in the 2012 presidential election Mitt Romneys dismissal of the 47 percent of people dependent on the government and President
                                        Obamas you didnt build that intended to remind American business owners that their success wasnt all due to smarts and hard work but also to the roads and bridges built
                                        by others the governmentsponsored research that produced the Internet and the unbelievable American system we have that allowed you to thrive Both statements came off as stinging insults directed
                                        at large groups of voters and both were seen as tactical disasters  Conservatives champion an ethos of hard work and selfreliance and insist  heroically ignoring the evidence  that peoples life chances are determined by the exercise of those virtues Liberals
                                        meanwhile counter the accusation that their policies encourage dependence by calling the social welfare system a safety net there only to provide a leg up to people who have fallen
                                        on hard times Unlike gay marriage or abortion issues that divide left from right everyone no matter where they lie on the American political spectrum loathes and fears state dependence If dependence
                                        isnt a moral failing to be punished its an addictive substance off which people must be weaned
                                         Like so many politically important notions the concept of state dependence purports to do no more than describe the way things are but contains within it a powerful and suspect moral judgment What
                                        is it for one thing to depend on another Put most simply X depends on Y when its the case that X wouldnt exist if Y didnt exist More subtly X depends on Y when its the case that
                                        X wouldnt be in the state it is in without Ys being in the state it is in Americans who collect food stamps Medicaid unemployment insurance or welfare checks are said to be dependent on the state
                                        because the lives they lead would be different indeed worse if the state did not provide these services  at least without their working harder and longer Despite the symbolic resonance of Ronald Reagans
                                        fictitious welfare queen most of the people who rely on meanstested social services either cannot work have been recently laid off thanks to the economic downturn or are already working in poorly
                                        paid immiserating jobs Of the 32 million American children currently being raised in lowincome families  families who cannot afford to meet their
                                        basic needs  nearly half have parents who are in fulltime yearround jobs But if the poor are dependent on the state so too are Americas rich The extraordinary accumulation of wealth enjoyed by the socioeconomic elite  in 2007 the richest 1 percent                                        of Americans accounted for about 24 percent of all income  simply wouldnt be possible if the United States werent organized as it is Just about every aspect of Americas economic
                                        and legal infrastructure  the laissezfaire governance of the markets a convoluted tax structure that has hedge fund managers paying less than their office cleaners the promise of state intervention when
                                        banks go bellyup the legal protections afforded to corporations as if they were people the enormous subsidies given to corporations in total about 50 percent more                                        than social services spending electoral funding practices that allow the wealthy to buy influence in government  allows the rich to stay rich and get richer In primitive societies people can accumulate
                                        only as much stuff as they can physically gather and hold on to Its only in advanced societies that the state provides the means to socioeconomic domination by a tiny minority The
                                        poverty of our century is unlike that of any other the writer John Berger said about the 20th century though he might equally have said it of this one It is not as poverty was before the result
                                        of natural scarcity but of a set of priorities imposed upon the rest of the world by the rich The irony isnt only that the poor are condemned for being dependent on the state while the rich are not Its also that the rich get so much more out of their dependence on the state than the poor Without
                                        the support of the state poor peoples quality of life would certainly drop but only by degrees their lives would go from bad to worse Take the states assistance away from the rich however and
                                        their lives would take a serious plunge in comfort No wonder rich people are on the whole conservative the most ferocious defenders of the status quo are usually those who are most dependent on the system So the question should not be why Americans loathe and fear dependence on the state but rather why do Americans loathe and fear some forms of state dependence but not others Why is state dependence condemned when
                                        evinced by the poor but tolerated even unrecognized when enjoyed by the rich What justifies this double standard Heres one possible answer While the rich are dependent on the state the state is in turn dependent on them The elite might enjoy levels of comfort and prosperity that the majority can scarcely imagine but
                                        its no more than they deserve they are after all the job creators the engines of economic growth The poor by contrast are just a drag on the system Even if it were granted that some sort of marketdriven economy is in the public interest or to adapt Churchills quip about democracy that it is the worst option except for all the rest the case would remain
                                        to be made that the sort of marketdriven economy we have in the United States serves that interest Indeed this case would be especially difficult to argue at a time when we are living with the effects of an economic
                                        recession caused by the wealthiest among us the cost of which is being paid largely by the poor and middle classes  in the loss of their homes and jobs but also in the form of taxdollardriven bank bailouts
                                        The orthodoxy is that inequality is the necessary price of economic growth but research strongly suggests that inequality of income causes economic instability and slows overall growth and that the rapid rise
                                        in inequality in the last few decades is to blame for the current economic recession The case for our current arrangements is still harder to make once one acknowledges the argument put forward by Richard G Wilkinson and Kate Pickett in their book The Spirit Level
                                        that economic inequality has a negative multiplier effect making poor people in very unequal societies like the United States worse off  in terms of mortality education imprisonment rates social
                                        mobility and so on  than they would be in more equal societies even if they were just as poor In other words when the rich get richer it doesnt just make them better off it makes everyone else
                                        worse off Neither will it help anyone trying to make the case for the American way to compare the United States with other developed nations where the average citizen is healthier happier better educated and enjoys more social
                                        mobility Here we have a reallife chance to apply the political philosopher John Rawlss test for a just society what he called the veil of ignorance If you didnt know what kind
                                        of person you were going to be  your gender family circumstances ethnicity  which of the developed nations would you choose to be born into Would you be hoping to have a home a job and good medical
                                        care Would you like to be able to clothe feed and educate your children someday In that case youd be foolish to pick the United States Youd be better off choosing Norway or any one of a number
                                        of countries that have better evened the balance between rich and poor state dependence with higher taxes and greater investment in social services Heres another answer one might give when asked why we should tolerate state dependence on the part of the rich but not of the poor the rich earn the benefits they accrue from the state while the poor get
                                        something for nothing Sure the rich might have needed the states help to get rich but they have also had to work for their success the poor can just sit back and wait for the welfare check to arrive
                                        But this is to ignore the fact that most rich Americans didnt earn their wealth they were given it either directly through inheritance from their parents or only slightly less directly through their access
                                        to elite secondary and higher education  Despite the sustaining myth of American meritocracy one of the most significant determinants of where a child will end up on the socioeconomic ladder is which rung his or her parents occupied This reminds me of a
                                        story I heard from a fellow philosopher Jason Stanley about a guy he met in a bar who explained that he had lost his job in the economic downturn
                                        but that he had pulled himself up by his own bootstraps and relaunched his career as an entrepreneur If he could do it he said anyone could It turned out that he got his startup capital from his father a
                                        venture capitalist While middleclass and rich children no doubt have to burn the midnight oil to get into Harvard and Yale they mostly end up at those places because of the huge advantages that wealth confers
                                        in the context of a failing public education system Liberals and conservatives alike pin their hopes on education as the great leveler but the data tells us                                        that the American education system magnifies the advantages of wealth and the disadvantages of poverty The unearned advantages enjoyed by the children of rich parents dwarf the sums given to welfare recipients To claim that the rich earn what they have also ignores the fact that most of the people who depend on social services do work  only they work for their poverty rather than their wealth Many of them depend
                                        on the state because the jobs available to them  the ones produced by the muchvaunted job creators  dont pay enough to allow them to live Thus welfare payments to the poor effectively operate
                                        as yet another kind of corporate subsidy making up for the difference between the increasing cost of living and declining real wages California taxpayers alone pay 86 million dollars annually to subsidize Walmart                                        via state assistance to its employees and their children Americas socioeconomic elite has been successful in part because it has been allowed to get away with the argument that its success has nothing to do with the state with a little elbow grease the rich seem
                                        to say the poor can be just like them And the poor may all be too ready to agree Socialism never took root in America John Steinbeck said because the poor see themselves not as an exploited
                                        proletariat but as temporarily embarrassed millionaires Its a myth dear to the American psyche the myth that Obama tried to pierce when he insisted that you didnt build that
                                        And while Obama might have retained the presidency Romney and his ideological comrades have won it seems the long fight against state dependence  The tax bill passed by Congress just in time to avert the fiscal cliff making the Bush tax cuts permanent for households under the 450000 threshold will cost the government 36 trillion over the
                                        next decade as compared with the 45 trillion it would have cost if the Bush tax cuts had stayed in place That isnt a lot in savings  and isnt enough to allow the government to continue
                                        funding social services at current levels In the short term Americas rich those earning above 450000 will see their tax bills increase But in the long term its Americas poor who will
                                        be paying Under the terms of the latest deal the poor will enjoy a temporary extension on refundable tax credits at the same time the Bushera estate tax cut which will cost about 375 billion                                        over the next decade as compared with the Clintonera estate tax policy and will benefit only millionaires and their children was made permanent Now the once unthinkable sequester will almost surely go into effect

                                        but the Republicans arent budging The sequester will almost certainly come into force by the end of this week and is estimated to cost 700000 jobs
                                        Meanwhile of the 47 percent that Romney lambasted for not paying taxes and scrounging off the state 7000 are millionaires We are all dependents of the state not just the poor and its certainly not the poor who benefit most from their dependence The question isnt who is dependent on the state but whether the current
                                        political settlement treats everyone with fairness and dignity whether the odds are stacked in particular peoples favor whether some are able to prosper only at the expense of others whether everyone
                                        has an equal opportunity to make a decent human life That we may not like the answers to these questions is the very reason we should ask them

Conservativesâ€™ Love Affair With Christie Is Over,https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/27/christies-honeymoon-with-conservatives-is-over/,"In September 2011 when Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey was considering making a lastminute entry into the presidential race I pointed out                                        an incongruity in Republican attitudes toward him Many Republican organizations and activists including some very conservative ones were enthusiastic about the possibility that Mr Christie might enter the presidential
                                        race But Mr Christies history of actions and issue statements was fairly moderate Roughly 18 months later the attitude toward Mr Christie has changed Mr Christie has not been invited                                        to the annual Conservative Political Action Conference or CPAC which will gather next month Mr Christies failure to be invited is not a mere oversight virtually every other prominent Republican who
                                        might be a plausible nominee in 2016 has been asked to participate Isnt it premature to conclude very much about 2016 dynamics based on something that is happening in February 2013 Actually as I wrote in my piece on Marco Rubio week the Republican primary is already under way Candidates like
                                        Mr Rubio Rand Paul Jeb Bush and Bobby Jindal are already positioning themselves with an eye toward 2016 The broader public certainly wont be paying much attention to what they do or say for a very long time But the nomination process is as much an inside game as an exercise in voting The candidates who perform
                                        well in the socalled invisible primary  the phase of the campaign when candidates seek to accumulate scarce resources
                                        like money endorsements staff talent and favorable relationships with the news media  will be far better positioned to succeed once voters in Iowa and New Hampshire get to have their say The veto of Mr Christie by CPAC which represents a relatively broad coalition of conservative and Republican interest groups is an ominous sign for him Candidates who have won the CPAC straw poll in the recent past                                        include Mitt Romney and Rudolph W Giuliani other Republicans with whom some conservatives have had considerable disagreements So the fact that Mr Christie has not even been invited to the conference this year
                                        says something Mr Christie was in good graces of CPAC as recently as last June when he was the headliner at a regional
                                        conference the group sponsored in Chicago So what has changed Is it Mr Christie or is it CPAC In fact Im not sure that either has Instead what seems to have changed is the salience of different issues as driven by major news events over the past year Mr Christie has long been an advocate of guncontrol policies for example But that issue has become far more relevant since the shootings in Newtown Conn Mr Christie has also taken moderate positions on immigration Immigration was an issue in the 2012 campaign but it seems to have grown in importance now after the poor performance of the Republicans with Hispanic
                                        voters in November and the push by President Obama and by some Republicans in Congress for immigration legislation Of course there was Hurricane Sandy which yielded Mr Christies literal and figurative embrace of Mr Obama
                                        and his later criticism of Congressional Republicans for failing to pass a disasterrelief
                                        bill This is an important symbolic issue but would Mr Christie have behaved differently if the storm had hit in 2010 or 2011 And on Tuesday Mr Christie became the eighth Republican governor to announce that he will accept Medicaid expansion under the presidents health care law in spite of his partys general opposition to
                                        the law Contrast this to the political climate in late 2011 when Mr Christie was winning praise from conservatives for his statements toward teachers unions                                         an issue that was then in the news because of the protests against efforts by Gov Scott Walker of Wisconsin to curtail benefits for publicsector unions in that state Mr Christie also takes relatively
                                        conservative views on gay marriage and abortion social issues that had the stage more to themselves in 2011 but which may have to compete more against immigration and gun control in the next political cycle So far as I can tell Mr Christie hasnt changed his positions on any of these issues very much Rather its that Mr Christie had a number of relatively moderate positions to begin with along with
                                        some conservative ones Does that mean there could be a reconciliation between Mr Christie and conservative groups later on Its certainly possible Surely the news cycle will shift again And Mr Christie could shift his stances
                                        to the right especially once he secures reelection in New Jersey next year as he is heavily favored to do But my premise when I wrote about Mr Christie in 2011 was that conservatives had been underrating how moderate Mr Christie was  perhaps because they were so desperate at that time to find alternatives to Mr
                                        Romney and their other candidates Now that hes been outed as a moderate it may be hard to close the closet door Mr Christie meanwhile will need to consider whether to compete for the Republican nomination in 2016 While the mainstream media tends to chronically overrate                                        the likelihood of a viable independent bid for the presidency Mr Christie would be better positioned to seek one than most with very high favorability ratings among independent voters and the access to money
                                        and news media attention that comes from being a prominent politician in the Northeast Or he could shoot for another office Because of the ethical cloud                                        surrounding Senator Robert Menendez the Democratic incumbent in New Jersey the Senate race in New Jersey could be very competitive in 2018 Mr Christies relationship with conservative Republicans however may have been doomed from the start"
Massachusetts Primary Battles Heat Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/us/politics/massachusetts-primary-battles-heat-up.html,BOSTON  Republicans and Democrats are bracing for bruising primaries over the next few weeks as five candidates begin to campaign in earnest to fill the United States Senate seat left vacant by John Kerrys departure to become secretary of state Two Democratic congressmen will square off in the April 30 primary Republicans have a threeway race The winners will face each other in a special election scheduled for June 25 All five candidates submitted at least 10000 signatures on Wednesday to earn a spot on their respective primary ballots The signatures still have to be verified but the field is almost certainly set The surprise entry on the Republican side was Michael J Sullivan a former United States attorney and former acting director of the Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives He managed to collect more than 23000 signatures in 12 days without the aid of hired hands which he called a groundswell of support for his candidacy The two other Republicans are State Representative Daniel B Winslow and Gabriel E Gomez a businessman and former member of the Navy SEALs both of whom used paid workers to help gather the requisite signatures The Republicans had to scramble for signatures in a brief time frame made all the more narrow by the announcement just four weeks ago by former Senator Scott P Brown that he would not seek the seat Mr Brown would have had no competition in a primary Until he bowed out the field was frozen The Democratic primary has been set for some time A lengthy list of possible candidates  including the actor Ben Affleck and Edward M Kennedy Jr  evaporated after Representative Edward J Markey the liberal dean of the Massachusetts Congressional delegation indicated early on that he would run The Democratic establishment quickly coalesced around Mr Markey in an attempt to stave off challengers who could drain the party of money and resources in a primary But Representative Stephen F Lynch a former ironworker who is the most conservative member of the delegation entered the race anyway and has been whipping up support among the unions He and Mr Markey have agreed to a series of six debates in the roughly 10 weeks before the primary If Mr Markey wins it seems likely that he will prevail in June if only because Massachusetts is so heavily Democratic Mr Markey supports abortion rights and samesex marriage and has sought action to stop global warming If Mr Lynch is the winner the political calculus will change Some of this positions  he opposed President Obamas health care plan and has been against abortion rights  put him out of sync with many in his party Since entering the race he has softened his stance against abortion but still calls himself prolifeÂ At one time he opposed gay marriage but changed his view many years ago He supports a ban on assault weapons he said he voted against such a ban in Massachusetts once several years ago because it was too weak which reflected the view of the gun lobby but he supported the federal ban If Lynch wins the primary it gets dicier for the Democrats to win the general election said Jeffrey M Berry a political scientist at Tufts University Some Democrats might sit it out All three Republican contenders are starting out as relatively obscure and underfunded Mr Berry noted He said they would have to spend money to raise their profiles in the primary which could leave them short of cash by June Mr Sullivan opposes abortion rights and samesex marriage Mr Winslow could have more appeal to Democrats since he supports both Mr Gomez has yet to articulate his positions on numerous issues While the Democratic National Committee is backing Mr Markey the Republican National Committee has not committed to backing the Republican nominee
House Renews Violence Against Women Measure,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/us/politics/congress-passes-reauthorization-of-violence-against-women-act.html,WASHINGTON  The House on Thursday gave final approval to a renewal of the Violence Against Women Act sending a bipartisan Senate measure to President Obama after a House plan endorsed by conservatives was defeated The legislation passed on a vote of 286 to 138 with 199 Democrats joining 87 Republicans in support of the reauthorization of the landmark 1994 law which assists victims of domestic and sexual violence It amounted to a significant victory for the president and Congressional Democrats who have assailed Republicans for months for stalling the legislation  The successful measure passed the Senate last month with 78 votes  including those of every woman all Democrats and just over half of Republicans  The alternative unveiled by the House last Friday immediately came under sharp criticism from Democrats and womens and human rights groups for failing to include protections in the Senate bill for gay bisexual or transgender victims of domestic abuse The House bill eliminated sexual orientation and gender identity from a list of populations that face barriers to receiving victim services  and also stripped certain provisions regarding American Indian women on reservations  With House Republicans divided the leadership agreed that it would allow a vote on the Senate bill if the House version could not attract sufficient votes and it failed on a vote of 257 to 166 Sixty Republicans joined 197 Democrats in opposition 164 Republicans and 2 Democrats voted for it  The newly passed legislation creates and expands federal programs to assist local communities with law enforcement and aiding victims of domestic and sexual abuse Most notably the bill goes further by offering protections for gay bisexual or transgender victims of domestic abuse as well as allowing American Indian women who are assaulted on reservations by nonIndians to take their case to tribal courts which otherwise would not have jurisdiction over assailants who do not live on tribal land The failed House bill offered the same provision but also offered nonIndian defendants the possibility to take their case to a federal court  The legislations approval underscored the divide in the Republican party as it struggles to regain its footing with women after its 2012 electoral drubbing among female voters House Republicans  even split at the leadership level  ultimately bowed to what they saw as the best interests of their party nationally even if that meant overriding the will of the majority of rankandfile Republicans  The vote represented the third time in two months that Speaker John A Boehner has brought a bill to the floor without having the support of most House Republicans A deal to avert automatic tax increases at the beginning of the year as well as a relief package for states hit by Hurricane Sandy also passed the House largely with the support of Democratic votes If were supplying the votes we should be helping to write the bills said Representative Nancy Pelosi of California the Democratic leader highlighting the Republican dilemma on some of these highprofile votes At the leadership level Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia the majority leader who helped engineer the vote ultimately opposed the bill while Representatives Kevin McCarthy of California the No 3 Republican and Paul D Ryan of Wisconsin the House Budget Committee chairman both voted in favor Representative Cathy McMorris Rodgers the chairwoman of the House Republican Conference who spearheaded the Houses bill also voted in favor of the final Senatepassed legislation Republicans said that their version of the bill included protections for all women a point they repeatedly made on the House floor on Thursday But the very public controversy surrounding the reauthorization of the Violence Against Women Act which expired during the last Congress when the House was unable to reach a compromise highlighted problems Republicans are having with female voters During the 2012 presidential election Mr Obama beat Mitt Romney among women by 11 percentage points earning 55 percent of the female vote and Republicans lost several highprofile races amid a backlash from female voters after the Republican candidates made controversial statements about rape or abortion Though Republicans maintained control of the House Democratic House candidates won 56 percent of the female vote according to exit polls Last month more than 1300 womens and human rights groups signed a letter supporting the Senate legislation Over more than two decades this law has saved countless lives and transformed the way we treat victims of abuse Mr Obama said in a statement Todays vote will go even further by continuing to reduce domestic violence improving how we treat victims of rape and extending protections to Native American women and members of the LGBT community Renewing this bill is an important step towards making sure no one in America is forced to live in fear and I look forward to signing it into law as soon as it hits my desk Mr Obama said  On Thursday Democrat after Democrat stood on the House floor urging their colleagues to reject what they said was the weaker House version Representative Gwen Moore Democrat of Wisconsin and a victim of domestic and sexual violence herself spoke passionately about the need to pass the Senates bill I pray that this body will do as the Senate has done and come together as one to protect all women from violence Ms Moore said As I think about the LGBT victims who are not here the native women who are not here the immigrants who arent in this bill I would say as Sojourner Truth would say Aint they womenÂ  Aint they women she repeated emphatically Some Republicans however remained upset that the bill was brought to the floor knowing that it would most likely require Democratic votes to pass  a trend that has worried and angered conservative members of the conference Speaking at a public conversation with fellow conservative members on Wednesday Representative Ral Labrador Republican of Idaho said that while he did not necessarily oppose the content of the Senates version of the Violence Against Women Act he was frustrated that it was unlikely to go through the formal committee process Its a huge concern he said
The Mysteries of Fargo,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/02/28/the-mysteries-of-fargo/,"No statistical trend makes progressives quite as selfsatisfied as the higherthanaverage rates of teen pregnancies and outofwedlock births in many conservative states As Ive had reason to argue before
                                        this selfsatisfaction is somewhat misplaced since higher abortion rates in blue states rather than say varying sex education curricula tend to explain most of the bluered difference But those unstable redstate
                                        family structures are still a real problem and its fair enough for liberals to note that social conservatism whether in policy or in culture doesnt necessarily produce the kind of social outcomes

                                                suggests that women are more likely to delay pregnancy when they perceive future opportunities to climb the social and economic ranksto get an education a job and a committed partner who benefits

                                            states generally tend to have fewer teen pregnancies than urban denselypopulated ones She also mentions but doesnt elaborate on the fact that North Dakota is racially monochrome  presumably

                                            more complicated than the more Planned Parenthood clinics  fewer unintended pregnancies assumptions of contemporary social liberalism allow Those complexities mean that I basically agree with Hesss conclusion Add it all upa sparselypopulated stateÂ heavy in white men
                                            low in sex education and bursting with oiland you dont find many helpful clues for crafting national policy But given how quick so many liberal wonks and social scientists are to assume
                                            that blue states with low teen pregnancy rates simply must offer helpful clues just because liberals happen to agree with the policies those states have adopted I sometimes like to
                                            entertain the counterfactual scenario where our earnest academics and wouldbe reformers are suddenly converted to social conservatism and the Dakota modelor of course the Deseret model                                            of family policy is noisily hailed as an obvious model for the nation as a whole"

                                        not a great way to woo women voters who as the 2012 election showed arent exactly keen on Republicans
                                         Although news coverage has focused on the VAWA todays House action actually ended two longstanding Congressional stalemates not just one In addition to strengthening

Arkansas Law Restricts When Abortion May Occur,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/us/arkansas-puts-new-limits-on-abortion.html,Arkansas adopted new abortion limits Thursday outlawing most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy even as its State Senate approved a more restrictive bill that would ban abortions after 12 weeks of pregnancy Gov Mike Beebe a Democrat had vetoed the 20week limit on Tuesday saying it was likely to be found unconstitutional but the newly Republicancontrolled Senate voted to override Mr Beebes veto on Thursday the House had already done so Wednesday The measure is set to take effect immediately  Arkansas is the 10th state to outlaw abortions after 20 weeks in part based on the theory that fetuses can feel pain at that stage a notion disputed by mainstream medical associations The 20week limit also violates the legal threshold set by the Supreme Court which has held that states cannot ban abortions before the fetus becomes viable Such a limit has not yet been tested by the courts Doctors say viability the ability to survive outside the womb usually occurs after at least 24 weeks  Were seeing a real defiance of what the Supreme Court has held said Elizabeth Nash the state issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute a research group in Washington The Supreme Court says viability is determined by a doctor Jason Rapert an Arkansas state senator who sponsored the 12week limit says the Supreme Court provides too little guidance on determining viability but that a heartbeat is an early sign of life His goal is to prevent what he described as abortion being used as birth control When there is a heartbeat there is life Mr Rapert said We do not need to be killing little babies The 12week limit which Governor Beebe is also expected to veto if it reaches him would be an even greater challenge to existing constitutional standards The bill which passed 26 to 8 includes exceptions for rape incest and medical emergencies In a statement Mr Beebe said he had not made a decision on the 12week ban but accepted the Legislatures override of his earlier veto This is the Legislatures prerogative he said Its part of the process and we all know that They did what they thought they should do and I did what I thought I should do Nine other states have passed 20week limits since 2010 when Nebraska became the first In two states Georgia and Arizona the laws were blocked by legal challenges The American Civil Liberties Union has said it will challenge both of Arkansass laws A Planned Parenthood statement called the 12week ban blatantly unconstitutional and a brazen affront to the needs of women Many states especially in the South are weighing efforts to limit abortions In Alabama the Legislature will vote next week on tighter regulations for abortion clinics In Mississippi the states only abortion clinic is battling new regulations that its leader says could force it to close Last year states across the country passed 43 bills restricting access to an abortion  the secondhighest number of such measures ever passed in a single year according to the Guttmacher Institute

Restoring Family-Planning Cuts Without Ruffling Feathers,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/01/us/texas-may-restore-some-family-planning-budget-cuts.html,The fight to restore familyplanning financing that was cut from the Texas budget in the last legislative session has taken a turn toward primary care Republican state senators have proposed adding 100 million to a staterun primary care program specifically for womens health services an effort that could help avoid a political fight over subsidizing specialty familyplanning clinics  Its a much better way to treat the women because they dont just have familyplanning issues said Senator Robert Deuell Republican of Greenville a family physician who has advocated an increase in primarycare services for women Using taxpayer dollars to finance familyplanning services has become politically thorny in Texas largely because of Republican lawmakers assertions that the womens health clinics providing that care are affiliated with abortion providers In the fiscal crunch of 2011 the Legislature cut the states familyplanning budget by twothirds with some lawmakers claiming that they were defunding the abortion industry Researchers at the University of Texas at Austin found that more than 50 familyplanning clinics had closed statewide as a result Now amid estimates that the cuts could lead to 24000 additional 201415 births at a cost to taxpayers of 273 million Â lawmakers are seeking a way to restore financing without ruffling feathers  Several state senators have suggested earmarking 100 million in general revenue to the Community Primary Care Services Program to be used for womens health services The program contracts community health clinics and nonprofit organizations to provide a range of services for poor Texans who do not qualify for other state health programs The additional money could increase the number of patients served annually in the program to 234000 from 64000 and nearly double the number of participating health care organizations to 100 from 57 according to the Department of State Health Services Health care advocates say the proposal to add state money to a primarycare program could broaden the scope of services and the range of women eligible for assistance  This new way hopefully will invest money in infrastructure to rebuild what the unintended consequences  the impact of the cuts  have been said Jos Camacho executive director of the Texas Association of Community Health Centers The association is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune But some womens health advocates are concerned that without modifications to the primarycare program the strategy would divert money for services like contraception to health services for older women Theres an advantage to guiding that money to the family planning that preventive care piece because thats where the cost savings occur said Janet Realini leader of the Texas Womens Healthcare Coalition But she added her group was happy to have the funding however it gets there Health care advocates say there are reasons to restore federal familyplanning financing rather than putting state dollars into primary care But that money which Texas relied on in previous budgets is no longer a sure thing Two other organizations including Planned Parenthood that have submitted bids to receive and distribute the federal familyplanning dollars  The goal has always been to keep the funds out of the abortion industry said Elizabeth Graham director of Texas Right to Life She hopes the expanded primarycare program will serve a broader population but said Texas Right to Life was still investigating the participating providers to ensure none are affiliated with abortion providers
Sacrifice at the Altar of Intolerance,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/movies/sacrifice-at-the-altar-of-intolerance.html,Two girls grow up together friends and allies in a decrepit Dickensian orphanage When they turn 18 and have to leave one goes abroad in search of work while the other after drifting for a while and out of other options enters a monastery led by a charismatic monk and becomes a nun After a few years the migr returns to visit her friend and finds her changed a bit distant  That is the starting point of the Romanian director Cristian Mungius Beyond the Hills which won two top prizes at the Cannes Film Festival last year and opens in New York on Friday Before long however the story takes a series of odd and increasingly menacing turns as the viewer is plunged into a circumscribed world in which the word iconoclast recovers its original Greek meaning and exorcism is a tool that true believers wield in hopes of keeping apostasy at bay For me it was very important to see all the things this story can reveal Mr Mungiu one of the leading exponents of what has come to be known as the Romanian new wave said in an interview in New York last fall Actually I am speaking about people who are condemned from Moment 1 he added Theres nothing much for them to do in life Beyond the Hills is based on a pair of bestselling nonfiction novels by the Romanian writer Tatiana Niculescu Bran a former Bucharest correspondent and editor for the BBC The books in turn are a dispassionate examination of a notorious reallife incident that took place in a Romanian Orthodox monastery near Romanias northeastern border with Moldova in the spring of 2005 In that case a 23yearold novitiate nun began hearing voices which she believed were the Devil talking to her After efforts to solve her problem failed her fellow believers bound her to a cross gagged her with a towel and left her for three days without food in a damp and chilly room at the monastery where she died of suffocation and dehydration  While in New York in 2007 to promote his awardwinning abortion drama 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days Mr Mungiu saw a stage production based on Ms Niculescu Brans book mounted by the acclaimed RomanianAmerican director Andrei Serban at the East Village theater La MaMa with her collaboration At dinner afterward Mr Serban a theater professor at Columbia said he could feel Mr Mungius fascination with many of the same themes that had also attracted him In the international press a big deal was made of this as an act of witchcraft in the country of Dracula how could this behavior from medieval times happen in a European country in the 21st century and all that nonsense Mr Serban said But what touched me on a deeper level in the book and which is beautifully portrayed in the movie is that everyone wants to do good but this is not possible and everything ends up in tragedy As in Mr Mungius two previous films 4 Months 3 Weeks and 2 Days and Tales of the Golden Age Romania is depicted as a deeply dysfunctional society Under the rule of Nicolai Ceausescu orphanages like the one where the girls met were notorious for their neglect and abuse and the modernday health care system in which the victim was enmeshed was unresponsive and ineffectual By the end an encounter with a byzantine justice system also looms People used to ask So whos guilty and who is guilty are all the institutions present in the film Mr Mungiu said And there is something else about such misfortunes When you live in a very civilized society and something bad happens its an awful thing and you will react But when you live in a very poor society where awful things happen every day this becomes like the way things happen and you are desensitized Still Mr Mungiu cautioned against reading the film as a condemnation of Romanian society His real target he said is any kind of fanaticism religious or otherwise I think this is a local story speaking about things that are very general he said What people are asked to do in the name of love for God for example this is the same in a lot of different religions and often leads to intolerance and authoritarianism I dont think this belongs to a society that is underdeveloped he added I think this can be understood to speak about things in a more general way When it came time to cast Beyond the Hills Mr Mungiu took a bold gamble The role of the monk was no problem he had written the part specifically for Valeriu Andriuta a collaborator on two previous films who was at the time working as a gardener in Ireland telling him to grow his beard before even beginning on the script But for the twin lead roles of Alina and Voichita Mr Mungiu chose a pair of actresses with limited experience Cristina Flutur 34 cast as the seemingly tougher Alina after Mr Mungiu saw her Facebook page and Cosmina Stratan 28 had never made a film At Cannes last year the women ended up sharing the prize for best actress with Mr Mungiu winning the best screenplay award so his instincts proved correct But initially with supporters of the Romanian Orthodox Church predicting that Mr Mungiu intended to make an antireligious film they felt some trepidation about signing on  There was a little moment of doubt because its a taboo issue such a heavy subject Ms Flutur said Im from a religious family with a religious background and shes doing things that are judged very negatively by the Orthodox community I was aware of the case and I knew it would be a controversial character also that many Orthodox people wont probably like will even hate because they will not get under the surface and to the profound level of the character In the movie it is clear that the two women forged a strong emotional bond in their early years with Alina acting to protect the more vulnerable Voichita from bullies and rapists But erotic undercurrents in some scenes suggest that the women may have been lovers not just friends or nearly sisters Alina returns from Germany because of love Ms Flutur said Because no matter what you have no matter where you go if you dont have love you dont have enough You can have a house family whatever but if its not based on love its nothing Mr Mungiu said he deliberately cultivated the ambiguity about the womens relationship even leaving his two actresses guessing They were very close together but its not important for the story to make precisely clear if the relationship was sexual he said  Beyond the Hills was filmed on location last winter with Mr Mungiu pushing his cast and himself to meet an ambitious deadline that would allow him to edit the film to two and a half hours to have it ready for showing at Cannes As a result he shot even in the midst of blinding snowstorms a choice that helped give the film a bleakly beautiful look that echoes the mood of the story All those shots in the snow are so beautifully filmed that it reminds me of a romantic old Russian film Mr Serban said Even though the movie is cold it has warm images and the camera work is extremely lush in the style of Shadows of Forgotten AncestorsÂ   For long stretches Beyond the Hills also has an air of atemporality The monk and his followers shun most of the conveniences of modern life subsisting in medieval simplicity and isolation and cultivating beliefs to match so when outsiders drive up in a battered Ceausescuera Dacia or a cellphone suddenly rings the effect is jolting Ms Flutur recalled a showing of the film at a festival in Vienna where a member of the audience was very angry such a thing could happen in Romania in the 21st century That she said is precisely the wrong lesson to take away from Beyond the Hills Its very comfortable to say Oh its Romanian we dont have that here Its very easy and you just detach yourself from something which is everywhere Because this film is also about violence and how violence enters under the guise of good intentions They really believed they were doing a good thing
"Bonnie Franklin, Steadfast Mom on â€˜One Day at a Time,â€™ Dies at 69",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/02/arts/television/bonnie-franklin-actress-dies-at-69.html,Bonnie Franklin whose portrayal of a pert but determined Ann Romano on the television show One Day at a Time in the 1970s and 80s spun laughter out of the tribulations of a divorced woman juggling parenting career love life and feminist convictions died on Friday at her home in Los Angeles She was 69 The cause was complications of pancreatic cancer family members said They had announced the diagnosis in September Ms Franklin also acted on the stage and in movies and for years sang and danced in a nightclub act But she was most widely known in the role of Ann Romano one of the first independent women to be portrayed on TV wrestling with issues like sexual harassment rape and menopause Ms Franklin  greeneyed redhaired buttonnosed and 5foot3  brought a buoyant comic touch to the part Some saw the show as helping feminism enter the mainstream I know its just a television show and I dont think that I am changing the way the world is structured Ms Franklin told The Washington Post in 1980 but she allowed that sometimes we strike chords that do make people think a bit One Day at a Time ran from December 1975 to May 1984 and its ratings ranked in the top 20 in eight of those seasons and in the top 10 in four Ms Franklin was nominated for an Emmy Award and twice for a Golden Globe The shows topicality fell squarely in the tradition of its developer Norman Lear who had gained renown for introducing political and social commentary to situation comedy with All in the Family and other shows Its cocreator was Whitney Blake a former sitcom star who as a single mother had reared the future actress Meredith Baxter  Like Archie and Edith Bunker in All in the Family Ann and her daughters Julie and Barbara Cooper Mackenzie Phillips and Valerie Bertinelli used comedy in the service of grappling with serious and thorny realworld matters As a divorced mother who had reverted to her maiden name and relocated to Indianapolis Ann fought her deadbeat exhusband for child support for example Or she dealt with a daughter deciding whether to remain a virgin Some story lines continued for up to four weeks as when Julie to Anns consternation dated a man more than twice her age In one plot twist Anns fianc is killed by a drunken driver Later she marries her soninlaws divorced father Comic relief came from the frequent visits of the building superintendent Dwayne Schneider Pat Harrington But Ms Franklin was said to have pushed the producers toward greater realism urging them to take on issues like teenage pregnancy and avoid letting the show lapse into comic shtick  In her 2009 memoir High on Arrival Ms Phillips who had come to the show after gaining notice in the 1973 George Lucas film American Graffiti said that Ms Franklin did not want One Day at a Time to be sitcom fluff She wanted it to deal honestly with the struggles and truths of raising two teenagers as a single mother Ms Phillips wrote By the time the show ended in 1984 Anns daughters had grown and married Ann herself had remarried and become a grandmother In interviews Ms Franklin said she had refused to do anything that might diminish her characters integrity In particular she said it was important for Ann not to rely on a man to make decisions But each year she found herself fighting the same fights And Im not working with insensitive men she told The Boston Globe in 1981 But the men who produce and write the show still dont believe me when I present them with the womens point of view After seven years she continued I just want to say Cmon guys Im an intelligent person why dont you just trust me Im so tired of fighting But you cant give up Bonnie Gail Franklin was born in Santa Monica Calif on Jan 6 1944 one of five children Her father was an investment banker while her mother pushed her children toward the performing arts The family later moved to Beverly Hills where Ms Franklin graduated from Beverly Hills High School An excellent tap dancer by 9 she performed on The Colgate Comedy Hour in 1953 The next year she played Susan Cratchit on A Christmas Carol on the CBS variety show Shower of Stars In 1956 she had uncredited roles in Alfred Hitchcocks Wrong Man and the comedy The Kettles in the Ozarks She turned down an offer to be a Mouseketeer on Disneys Mickey Mouse Club television show After attending Smith College in Massachusetts Ms Franklin transferred to the University of California Los Angeles where she graduated with a major in English in 1966 Her marriage to Ronald Sossi a playwright ended in divorce in 1970 She had her breakthrough as a performer the same year when she was nominated for a Tony for her 10minute songanddance performance on Broadway as a chorus gypsy in Applause which starred Lauren Bacall Ms Franklin also acted in episodes of other television shows as well as in regional theater and movies mainly ones made for television notably playing Margaret Sanger the womens rights and birthcontrol advocate in Portrait of a Rebel The Remarkable Mrs Sanger a 1980 movie on CBS On the Sanger set she met the movies executive producer Marvin Minoff They were married for 29 years before his death in 2009  Ms Franklin is survived by her mother Claire Franklin

The Holocaust Just Got More Shocking,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/sunday-review/the-holocaust-just-got-more-shocking.html,THIRTEEN years ago researchers at the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum began the grim task of documenting all the ghettos slave labor sites concentration camps and killing factories that the Nazis set up throughout Europe What they have found so far has shocked even scholars steeped in the history of the Holocaust  The researchers have cataloged some 42500 Nazi ghettos and camps throughout Europe spanning Germancontrolled areas from France to Russia and Germany itself during Hitlers reign of brutality from 1933 to 1945  The figure is so staggering that even fellow Holocaust scholars had to make sure they had heard it correctly when the lead researchers previewed their findings at an academic forum in late January at the German Historical Institute in Washington The numbers are so much higher than what we originally thought Hartmut Berghoff director of the institute said in an interview after learning of the new data  We knew before how horrible life in the camps and ghettos was he said but the numbers are unbelievable The documented camps include not only killing centers but also thousands of forced labor camps where prisoners manufactured war supplies prisonerofwar camps sites euphemistically named care centers where pregnant women were forced to have abortions or their babies were killed after birth and brothels where women were coerced into having sex with German military personnel  Auschwitz and a handful of other concentration camps have come to symbolize the Nazi killing machine in the public consciousness Likewise the Nazi system for imprisoning Jewish families in hometown ghettos has become associated with a single site  the Warsaw Ghetto famous for the 1943 uprising But these sites infamous though they are represent only a minuscule fraction of the entire German network the new research makes painfully clear The maps the researchers have created to identify the camps and ghettos turn wide sections of wartime Europe into black clusters of death torture and slavery  centered in Germany and Poland but reaching in all directions  The lead editors on the project Geoffrey Megargee and Martin Dean estimate that 15 million to 20 million people died or were imprisoned in the sites that they have identified as part of a multivolume encyclopedia The Holocaust museum has published the first two with five more planned by 2025 The existence of many individual camps and ghettos was previously known only on a fragmented regionbyregion basis But the researchers using data from some 400 contributors have been documenting the entire scale for the first time studying where they were located how they were run and what their purpose was  The brutal experience of Henry Greenbaum an 84yearold Holocaust survivor who lives outside Washington typifies the wide range of Nazi sites When Mr Greenbaum a volunteer at the Holocaust museum tells visitors today about his wartime odyssey listeners inevitably focus on his confinement of months at Auschwitz the most notorious of all the camps  But the images of the other camps where the Nazis imprisoned him are ingrained in his memory as deeply as the concentration camp number  A188991  tattooed on his left forearm In an interview he ticked off the locations in rapid fire the details still vivid  First came the Starachowice ghetto in his hometown in Poland where the Germans herded his family and other local Jews in 1940 when he was just 12  Next came a slave labor camp with sixfoothigh fences outside the town where he and a sister were moved while the rest of the family was sent to die at Treblinka After his regular work shift at a factory the Germans would force him and other prisoners to dig trenches that were used for dumping the bodies of victims He was sent to Auschwitz then removed to work at a chemical manufacturing plant in Poland known as Buna Monowitz where he and some 50 other prisoners who had been held at the main camp at Auschwitz were taken to manufacture rubber and synthetic oil And last was another slave labor camp at Flossenbrg near the Czech border where food was so scarce that the weight on his 5foot8inch frame fell away to less than 100 pounds  By the age of 17 Mr Greenbaum had been enslaved in five camps in five years and was on his way to a sixth when American soldiers freed him in 1945 Nobody even knows about these places Mr Greenbaum said Everything should be documented Thats very important We try to tell the youngsters so that they know and theyll remember The research could have legal implications as well by helping a small number of survivors document their continuing claims over unpaid insurance policies looted property seized land and other financial matters  HOW many claims have been rejected because the victims were in a camp that we didnt even know about asked Sam Dubbin a Florida lawyer who represents a group of survivors who are seeking to bring claims against European insurance companies  Dr Megargee the lead researcher said the project was changing the understanding among Holocaust scholars of how the camps and ghettos evolved As early as 1933 at the start of Hitlers reign the Third Reich established about 110 camps specifically designed to imprison some 10000 political opponents and others the researchers found As Germany invaded and began occupying European neighbors the use of camps and ghettos was expanded to confine and sometimes kill not only Jews but also homosexuals Gypsies Poles Russians and many other ethnic groups in Eastern Europe The camps and ghettos varied enormously in their mission organization and size depending on the Nazis needs the researchers have found  The biggest site identified is the infamous Warsaw Ghetto which held about 500000 people at its height But as few as a dozen prisoners worked at one of the smallest camps the MnchenSchwabing site in Germany Small groups of prisoners were sent there from the Dachau concentration camp under armed guard They were reportedly whipped and ordered to do manual labor at the home of a fervent Nazi patron known as Sister Pia cleaning her house tending her garden and even building childrens toys for her  When the research began in 2000 Dr Megargee said he expected to find perhaps 7000 Nazi camps and ghettos based on postwar estimates But the numbers kept climbing  first to 11500 then 20000 then 30000 and now 42500  The numbers astound 30000 slave labor camps 1150 Jewish ghettos 980 concentration camps 1000 prisonerofwar camps 500 brothels filled with sex slaves and thousands of other camps used for euthanizing the elderly and infirm performing forced abortions Germanizing prisoners or transporting victims to killing centers  In Berlin alone researchers have documented some 3000 camps and socalled Jew houses while Hamburg held 1300 sites  Dr Dean a coresearcher said the findings left no doubt in his mind that many German citizens despite the frequent claims of ignorance after the war must have known about the widespread existence of the Nazi camps at the time  You literally could not go anywhere in Germany without running into forced labor camps POW camps concentration camps he said They were everywhere
The Ratzinger Legacy,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/03/opinion/sunday/douthat-the-ratzinger-legacy.html,THE helicopter that carried Pope Benedict XVI into retirement left behind a Catholicism in crisis So say his critics his admirers and everyone in between The church needs shock therapy from its next pontiff writes one observer Catholicism faces its worst crisis since the French Revolution argues another Not since the Reformation writes a third has the Church been so shaken to its core  Up to a point the language of crisis is justified To the trends weakening institutional faiths across the Western world  the rise of spiritual individualism the influence of the socalled new atheism the gap between traditional Christian sexual ethics and presentday realities  the Roman Catholic Church has added scandals sclerosis and a communications strategy apparently designed to win the news cycles of 1848 In both Europe and America Catholicisms public reputation has worsened since Benedict assumed the papacy and his nearly unprecedented abdication is a sign that the pope emeritus knows it But in assessing Benedicts legacy its worth looking back on the situation in the church in the late 1970s when the man who was then Joseph Ratzinger left his academic career to become first an archbishop then a cardinal and eventually the pope In America the 70s were defined by not just a weakening in the institutional life of the church but a wholesale collapse Thousands of priests and nuns left their holy orders each year Mass attendance had fallen by a third in a generation The church faced a rebellion from Latin Mass traditionalists even as progressive theologians confidently planned for a third Vatican Council Along with institutional instability there was moral laxity and worse revelations of sex abuse and coverup were years away but the rate of abuse was at its peak Beneath these trends was a pervasive sense that Catholic identity was entirely up for grabs  that having dispensed with Latin Mass and meatless Fridays the church might be poised for further revolutions a major schism or both When Walker Percys novel Love in the Ruins imagined Catholicism in the United States splitting in three  a progressive church modeled on liberal Protestantism a rightwing American Catholic Church that plays the StarSpangled Banner during Mass and a tiny remnant loyal to Rome  it seemed more like prophecy than fiction It was the work of Ratzingers subsequent career first as John Paul IIs doctrinal policeman and then as his successor to reestablish where Catholicism actually stood This was mostly a project of reassertion yes the church still believes in the Resurrection the Trinity and the Virgin birth Yes the church still opposes abortion divorce sex outside of marriage Yes the church still considers itself the one true faith And yes  this above all for a man whose chief gifts were intellectual  the church believes that its doctrines are compatible with reason scholarship and science It was understandable that this project made Ratzinger many enemies It turned him into a traitor to his class since it involved disciplining theologians who had been colleagues peers and rivals It disappointed or wounded the many Catholics who couldnt reconcile the churchs teachings with their postsexualrevolution lives And it obviously did not solve the broad cultural challenges facing institutional Christianity in the West But it did stabilize Catholicism especially in America to an extent that was far from inevitable 40 years ago The churchs civil wars continued but without producing major schisms Mass attendance stopped its plunge and gradually leveled off holding up even during some of the worst sex abuse revelations Vocations likewise stabilized and both ordinations and interest in religious life have actually risen modestly over the last decade Todays American Catholics while deeply divided are more favorably disposed to both the pope emeritus and the current direction of the church than press coverage sometimes suggests  This stabilization was not the kind of sweeping revival that some conservative Catholics claimed to see happening and it did nothing to prevent the churchs reputation from suffering deservedly once the abuse epidemic came to light  But for all of Catholicisms problems the Christian denominations that did not have a Ratzinger  those churches that persisted in the spirit of the 1970s and didnt reassert a doctrinal core  have generally fared worse There are millions of lapsed Catholics but the church still has a higher retention rate by far than most mainline Protestant denominations Indeed it is difficult to pick out a major religious body where the progressive course urged by so many of Ratzingers critics has increased vitality and growth  This doesnt mean there isnt some further version of reform some unexpected synthesis of tradition and innovation that would serve Catholicism well And if such a path exists Pope Benedict was probably not the leader to find it  But he helped ensure that something recognizable as Catholic Christianity would survive into the third millennium For one man one lifetime that was enough
U.S. Catholics in Poll See a Church Out of Touch,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/us/poll-shows-disconnect-between-us-catholics-and-church.html,Roman Catholics in the United States say that their church and bishops are out of touch and that the next pope should lead the church in a more modern direction on issues like birth control and ordaining women and married men as priests according to the latest New York TimesCBS News poll Seven out of 10 say Pope Benedict XVI and the Vatican have done a poor job of handling sexual abuse a significant rise from three years ago A majority said that the issue had led them to question the Vaticans authority The sexual abuse of children by priests is the largest problem facing the church Catholics in the poll said  Threefourths of those polled said they thought it was a good idea for Benedict to resign Most wanted the next pope to be someone younger with new ideas A majority said they wanted the next pope to make the churchs teachings more liberal With cardinals now in Rome preparing to elect Benedicts successor the poll indicated that the churchs hierarchy had lost the confidence and allegiance of many American Catholics an intensification of a longterm trend They like their priests and nuns but many feel that the bishops and cardinals do not understand their lives I dont think they are in the trenches with people said Therese Spender 51 a homemaker in Fort Wayne Ind who said she attended Mass once a week and agreed to answer further questions after the poll They go to a lot of meetings but they are not out in the street Even Catholics who frequently attend Mass said they were not following the bishops lead on issues that the church had recently invested much energy money and credibility in fighting  artificial birth control and samesex marriage Eric OLeary 38 a funeral director in Des Moines who attends Mass weekly said I would like them not to be so quick to condemn people because of their sexual preference or because of abortion or to refuse priests the right to get married or women to be priests I dont think the church should get involved in whether or not people use birth control The nationwide telephone poll was conducted on landlines and cellphones from Feb 23 to 27 when many Catholics were still absorbing news of the first resignation of a pope in 600 years The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points for the 580 Catholics who were oversampled for purposes of analysis in the survey of 1585 adults Benedict a softspoken scholar and a church traditionalist had apparently made little impression on American Catholics in his eight years as pope Half of those in the poll said they either had no opinion of him or had not heard enough about him Nevertheless 4 in 10 had a favorable opinion and only one in 10 unfavorable Hes written three or four books and his writings are incredible said Leonard Lefebvre 70 a retired economist in Tequesta Fla Hes continued on course and hes held the religion to where its supposed to be at The poll suggested that the papacy no longer occupies the exalted position it once did Asked whether the pope is infallible when he teaches on matters of morality and faith 40 percent said yes 46 percent said no and 14 percent said they did not know Nearly 8 in 10 Catholics polled said they would be more likely to follow their conscience on difficult moral questions than to follow the popes teachings When asked which one thing they would most like to see the next pope accomplish the most common responses that respondents volunteered were in order bring people back to church modernize the church unify the church and do something about sexual abuse A spate of new information about prelates hiding the misdeeds of pedophile priests appeared to have taken a toll A higher percentage of Catholics said the pope and the Vatican had done a poor job of handling reports of past sexual abuse recently 69 percent compared with 2010 55 percent when the abuse scandal flared in many European countries This is despite the churchs many reforms in the last 10 years and reports of abuse by priests in the United States declining drastically Majorities said they wanted to see the next pope maintain the churchs opposition to abortion and the death penalty even though they themselves were not opposed to them Threequarters of Catholics supported abortion under at least some circumstances and threefifths favored the death penalty I can understand how the Catholic Church stands against it said Geri Toni 57 of abortion We are not supposed to kill That is one of our Ten Commandments But as a woman said Ms Toni who lives in Fort Myers Fla and attends Mass weekly I have to make sense of it and I believe choice comes down to the individual On every other hotly debated issue Catholics wanted the next pope to lead the church in an aboutface Seven of 10 Catholics polled said the next pope should let priests marry let women become priests and allow the use of artificial methods of birth control Nine of 10 said they wanted the next pope to allow the use of condoms to prevent the spread of HIV and other diseases Sixtytwo percent of Catholics said they were in favor of legalizing marriage for samesex couples Catholics approved of samesex marriage at a higher rate than Americans as a whole among whom 53 percent approved John Sadel 28 a supervisor in a plastics production facility in Bethlehem Pa said Im not saying change everything the church stands for but you need to evolve with the times if you want to remain a viable religion The American bishops also appear to have lost ground among their own flock in their campaign to fight the White House rule that requires employers to provide insurance coverage for contraceptives  a campaign the bishops say is about religious freedom One year ago twothirds of Catholics polled said that religiously affiliated employers like hospitals or universities should be allowed to opt out of covering birth control for their female employees because of religious or moral objections In the most recent poll only about half of Catholics said they agreed The issue has become a political litmus test with Catholic bishops and religious conservatives saying that their religious freedom is being threatened by President Obamas policies But when asked what the debate is about only 40 percent of Catholics polled said religious freedom while 50 percent said womens health and their rights  an indication that Mr Obamas framing of the issue is holding sway even among many Catholics Catholics seemed to feel far more warmly toward their local priests than those in the hierarchy Seven in 10 Catholics in the poll said they felt that their parish priests were in touch with the needs of Catholics today Eightyfive percent of those who attend Mass said the sermons were excellent or good Nearly twothirds of Catholics polled said they had not changed the amount of money they contributed to the church in the last few years 16 percent said they gave more 17 percent said less Of those giving less half said it was because of financial circumstances and onequarter cited unhappiness with the church Nationwide bishops are closing parish churches and schools to save money and to respond to changing demographics The reorganization is so sweeping that the poll found that 11 percent of Catholics who attend Mass said their parish church had closed or merged in the last few years
Arkansas: Abortion Law Survives Veto,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/06/us/arkansas-abortion-law-survives-veto.html,The State Senate voted 20 to 14 Tuesday to override Gov Mike Beebes veto of a bill that would establish the countrys most stringent limits on abortion banning the procedure after 12 weeks of pregnancy The governor and most legal experts said the measure would quickly be struck down by federal courts as unconstitutional The Supreme Court has ruled that women have a right to an abortion up to when the fetus is viable outside the womb generally around 24 weeks into pregnancy The motion to override now passes to the House where a vote is expected to be close 
Arkansas Adopts a Ban on Abortions After 12 Weeks,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/07/us/arkansas-adopts-restrictive-abortion-law.html,Arkansas adopted what is by far the countrys most restrictive ban on abortion on Wednesday  at 12 weeks of pregnancy when a fetal heartbeat can typically be detected by abdominal ultrasound The law the sharpest challenge yet to Roe v Wade was passed by the newly Republicancontrolled legislature over the veto of Gov Mike Beebe a Democrat who called it blatantly unconstitutional The State Senate voted Tuesday to override his veto and the House followed suit on Wednesday with several Democrats joining the Republican majority The law contradicts the limit established by Supreme Court decisions which give women a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb usually around 24 weeks into pregnancy and abortion rights groups promised a quick lawsuit to block it Even some antiabortion leaders called the measure a futile gesture Adoption of the law called the Human Heartbeat Protection Act is the first statewide victory for a restless emerging faction within the antiabortion movement that has lost patience with the incremental whittling away at abortion rights  a strategy used by groups like National Right to Life and the Catholic Church while they wait for a more sympathetic Supreme Court When is enough enough asked the bills sponsor in the legislature Senator Jason Rapert a Republican who compared the more than 50 million abortions in the United States since the 1973 Roe v Wade decision to the Holocaust and the Rwandan genocide Its time to take a stand But abortion rights groups and many legal experts including some in the antiabortion movement say the law so deeply contradicts existing constitutional doctrine that it may quickly be voided The 12week ban actually bars abortion within the first trimester said Nancy Northup president of the Center for Reproductive Rights in New York It has no chance of surviving a court challenge The center and the American Civil Liberties Union have vowed to bring a case in federal court aiming to head off the law before it takes effect 90 days after the legislature adjourns in the next month or so Senator Rapert who cited strong backing for his bill from conservative evangelical groups like the Arkansas Family Council hopes the law will start a groundswell of support We crafted a bill that apparently has the ability to stand the test in courts and change abortion policy in our nation coast to coast he said in an interview this week But so far more radical measures elsewhere have fallen short In Mississippi a socalled personhood amendment lost at the polls while in Ohio a fetal heartbeat bill resembling that in Arkansas was defeated in the legislature in part because it was opposed by one of the states leading antiabortion groups Ohio Right to Life Those proposals have caused soulsearching and dissension within some of the largest antiabortion groups with many traditional leaders expressing skepticism or opposition to such sweeping challenges to constitutional law until a more conservative Supreme Court seems ready to scrap the legacy of Roe v Wade Much like Tea Party activists who have caused exasperation among Republican leaders with demands to slash budgets almost indiscriminately the abortion rebels feel there is little to lose by pushing for aggressive curbs and testing the courts But other antiabortion leaders say that strategy exemplified by the Arkansas law is likely to backfire causing courts to endorse the current limits and wasting resources that could bring real if smaller gains As much as we would like to protect the unborn at that point it is futile and it wont save any babies said James Bopp Jr a prominent antiabortion lawyer who opposed the Arkansas law Mr Bopp who lives in Indiana is general counsel of National Right to Life He said that lower courts are virtually certain to affirm existing Supreme Court rulings and like many other legal experts he predicted that the Supreme Court was very unlikely to agree to hear such a case Mr Rapert originally proposed setting the Arkansas ban even earlier at about six weeks after a womans last menstrual period But the nascent fetal heartbeat can be detected at that point only by using intrusive technology like a transvaginal ultrasound Wary of the national firestorm that erupted last year after Virginia tried to require the intrusive procedure Mr Rapert and his allies revised the bill to specify that a fetal heartbeat should be detected by abdominal ultrasound or other external methods which are not feasible at six weeks The strategy of incrementally narrowing abortion rights has yielded results especially since 2010 when Republicans gained control of many more states Measures have been adopted by the dozens in the past few years including waiting periods parental consent for minors ultrasound requirements and stringent regulations aimed at making it harder for abortion clinics to operate In Mississippi a rule requiring doctors performing abortions to have visiting privileges at local hospitals threatens to close down the states only remaining abortion clinic which relies on traveling doctors A court decision on the measure is expected any day Ten states have pushed time limits for abortions down to 20 weeks into pregnancy on the theory disputed by most medical experts that a fetus can feel pain by then Such laws have wider support in the antiabortion movement Arkansas adopted a 20week ban over the governors veto last week and most who supported it went on to vote for Mr Raperts more stringent bill as well The 20week laws also violate the existing standard of fetal viability They are under legal challenge in Arizona and Georgia and on Wednesday a federal judge ruled the 20week ban in Idaho to be unconstitutional Reuters reported But the laws are in effect in seven other states Very few abortions take place so late in pregnancy and those are often for serious medical reasons that may be permitted in any case By contrast a 12week ban would affect an estimated 12 percent to 15 percent of abortions nationwide said Elizabeth Nash state issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute a research group in Washington that supports abortion rights In Arkansas in 2011 4033 abortions were performed 815 of them or 20 percent were at 12 weeks or more after the last menstrual period according to state data How many of these later procedures involved medical emergencies or cases of rape or incest  exceptions allowed under the new law  is not known The state currently has only one clinic in Little Rock that performs surgical abortions a second run by Planned Parenthood offers medicinal abortions which are done only within the first eight weeks of pregnancy The final approval of the bill on Wednesday was a surprisingly unemotional event with the House consideration of the override taking only moments  less time than it took just before to recognize a college volleyball team With the outcome at 55 votes to 33 a foregone conclusion in a state that has turned steadily to the right in recent years two House Republican leaders spoke briefly in favor of the bill and not a single legislator spoke against it Representative Ann V Clemmer the bills House sponsor called it a statement consistent with what Arkansas voters want It will be tested she said Im OK with that Thats the job of the courts Abortion rights advocates however watched the legislation with chagrin It sets Arkansas back several decades in the eyes of the nation and the world said Rita Sklar director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Arkansas It shows an utter disregard for women and their ability to make important personal decisions about their own reproductive health

"A British Power Coupleâ€™s Long, Seamy Slide",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/world/europe/vicky-pryce-and-chris-huhnes-slide-from-the-top.html,LONDON  For years they were one of Londons most glittering couples he a fastrising politician with fashionably leftofcenter views on social issues and a background in high finance that had yielded a multimilliondollar fortune she a top government economist who once hinted to an interviewer that she had ambitions to be Britains first female chancellor of the Exchequer But in a reversal of fortune laced with Jeffrey Archerlike plotlines of ambition deceit and revenge their world collapsed about them Ultimately their story was one that doomed their marriage and their reputations  and left them after a trial that ended Thursday before a high court judge facing the probability that both will go to prison for several months and possibly longer  After two trials and more than 25 hours of jury deliberations Vicky Pryce a Greekborn economist who agreed in 2003 to falsely name herself as the driver in a speeding offense committed by her husband Chris Huhne was found guilty on a unanimous jury vote of perverting the course of justice  The BBC reported that Ms Pryce 60 met the verdict by gulping silently before leaving the court on bail until her sentencing without talking to the waiting reporters and television crews  The judge in the case Sir Nigel Sweeney warned Ms Pryce that she should have no illusions about the sentence likely to be imposed a phrase commonly used to warn of a prison term Justice Sweeney gave the same warning last month to Mr Huhne 58 when he averted a trial with a lastminute plea of guilty to the same charge after years of calling rumors about the speeding ticket switch nonsense and lies Switching identities in speeding cases involving roadside police cameras is something the police say many thousands of people in Britain do each year For Mr Huhne with three previous speeding convictions in the year before the 2003 episode the penalty points would have brought a driving ban By his estimation at the time according to court testimony it could also have cost him his bid to win a parliamentary seat in 2005 the key to switching his political career to London from Brussels where he had been a member of the European Parliament  Ultimately though the gamble could hardly have been more costly Had he pleaded guilty at the time he would have faced a 100 fine and been barred from driving for six months to a year by lying in the case he ultimately lost his cabinet post the first politician in British history to be forced from office by a criminal prosecution as well as his parliamentary seat and British pundits say any prospect of a future political career  The mighthavebeens in the case helped keep it in the headlines Had thousands of absentee ballots in his favor not been delayed in the mail Mr Huhne would probably have won the leadership of the Liberal Democrats in 2007 instead of losing narrowly to his chief rival Nick Clegg A leadership win would then have made him deputy prime minister to David Cameron a post now held by Mr Clegg when the Liberals joined Mr Camerons Conservatives in a coalition government in 2010  But it has been the venomous personal vendetta more than the politics of the case that has transfixed many in Britain Ms Pryce stuck with the deceit over the speeding ticket for more than seven years until Mr Huhne faced with the imminent exposure of an extramarital affair with one of his political aides by a London tabloid abruptly walked out of the 25year marriage  The court heard that Ms Pryce learned the news from her husband when he confronted her during a halftime break in a Saturdayafternoon telecast of a World Cup soccer match in 2010 announcing that he needed an immediate separation to save his cabinet post Ms Pryce testified in court that he had bullied her into accepting the speeding ticket and said she had had no choice but to sign a court summons after Mr Huhne without consulting her identified her as the driver in his response to the original summons Pleading marital coercion a rarely used defense in British courts her lawyer cast her as a deeply vulnerable woman keen to protect her marriage and her five children He said she was accustomed to yielding to the overbearing demands of Mr Huhne who she said demanded on two occasions that she have abortions so as not to disrupt his career with additional children That defense however which won broad support among female newspaper columnists and womens rights groups in Britain appeared to have made little impact on the jury in the trial a previous trial last month ended with a hung jury In finding Ms Pryce guilty the jurors seven men and five women appeared to have accepted the version put forward by the prosecution counsel Andrew Edis who described Ms Pryce in court as a strongwilled person who had been prepared to cheat the system with Mr Huhne until a desire for revenge over his deserting the marriage took over  Evidence at the trial showed that Ms Pryce had gone to two newspapers The Mail on Sunday and The Sunday Times with accounts of the ticket switch and avowals of her eagerness to end Mr Huhnes political career A Sunday Times article based on her account and on telephone conversations it recorded in which she tried to get Mr Huhne to confess to the ticket scam led to the police inquiry and the trials The truth Mr Edis said was that Ms Pryce was a woman who spent her life making important choices though she had contended in court that she was unable to choose whether to commit a crime or not because a man whether her husband or no was telling her what she had to do
Arkansasâ€™s Attack on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/08/opinion/arkansass-attack-on-abortion.html,Republicancontrolled legislatures have been working for many years to limit womens access to legal abortion care but the Republicanled Legislature in Arkansas took the campaign to a new extreme on Wednesday when it overrode the veto of Gov Mike Beebe a Democrat and ignored the Supreme Court to adopt the most restrictive abortion ban in the country Under current law established by Supreme Court decisions beginning with the 1973 Roe v Wade ruling full abortion bans are allowed only after fetal viability generally thought to be around 24 weeks into pregnancy The Arkansas statute bans abortion at 12 weeks of pregnancy when a fetal heartbeat can typically be detected by abdominal ultrasound  The original version of the bill would have banned abortions as early as six weeks into a pregnancy but it was changed to 12 weeks to avoid having to mandate use of a vaginal probe to detect the heartbeat Even with the extension the law stands little chance of surviving a court challenge but it is distressing in 2013 that a womans right to make her own childbearing decisions is under such aggressive attack by farrightÂ lawmakers In some quarters of the country Republicans seem unchastened by their partys lagging support among women It is also dismaying that Arkansas lawmakers cavalierly approved the 12week ban just a week after adopting  over another veto from the governor  a 20week ban that also violates the existing standard of fetal viability and 40 years of Supreme Court precedent Both are threatening to womens rights and health As a practical matter very few abortions take place after 20 weeks and those are typically for serious medical reasons A 12week ban which falls within the first trimester of pregnancy would affect an estimated 12 percent to 15 percent of abortions if applied nationwide  Unfortunately the Arkansas Legislature is hardly alone in its devotion to turning out new abortion restrictions Last year 19 states enacted 43 new provisions seeking to curb access to abortion services according to a report from the Guttmacher Institute In 2011 92 such measures were passed So far this year 278 such provisions have been introduced in state legislatures that would narrow abortion rights in a host of ways Another 18 measures would limit access to contraception  Not all of these will get enacted of course but undoubtedly some of them will At this point three states are down to just a single abortion provider including Mississippi where a medically unnecessary rule requiring that doctors have visiting privileges at local hospitals is threatening to close down the states last clinic

Focus on the Family Works to Change Its Message,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/us/focus-on-the-family-transforms-its-message.html,COLORADO SPRINGS  One Wednesday afternoon last month Jim Daly drove a couple of miles from his office at Focus on the Family to a classroom building on the University of Colorados local campus Short as the trip was it carried Mr Daly beyond his theological and political comfort zone Such disorientation was the whole point As the president and chief executive of Focus on the Family Mr Daly oversees a Christian ministry with an annual budget of 98 million a paid staff of 655 and a fervently conservative view of the Bible and American social issues Seated beside a philosophy professor at the university Mr Daly faced an audience of about 125 students and faculty members some carrying protest signs Focus Isnt My Family No H8 Lez Be Honest Who Am I Hurting by Loving a Girl For the next hour through alternating moments of contrition and contention Mr Daly continued what has been the signal initiative of his term at the evangelical group transforming an organization associated with the divisive strife of the culture wars into one that invites civil dialogue with its religious and ideological foes Mr Daly did not come to the campus here to retreat from Focuss opposition to samesex marriage which was largely the topic of the event but to turn down the rhetorical temperature on the debate Weve created an animosity he said in one emblematic moment of selfcriticism Weve said we hate the sin and love the sinner But when you peel it back sometimes we hated the sinner too And thats not the Gospel Regardless of whether his tone won over every listener and it surely did not Mr Daly has succeeded in differentiating himself from an earlier generation of Christian leaders like Jerry Falwell Pat Robertson Gary Bauer and Donald E Wildmon who made their fame and notoriety alike in the battles around abortion and homosexuality In quite a vivid way Mr Daly 51 has also departed from the example of his predecessor at Focus James C Dobson who retired in 2009 Just a few months ago referring to the mass shooting at an elementary school in Newtown Conn Dr Dobson said on his syndicated radio program I think we have turned our back on the Scripture and on God almighty and I think he has allowed judgment to fall upon us As he became president of Focus in 2005 and chief executive four years later Mr Daly put forward the message of humility and outreach in an autobiography Finding Home and an acutely titled spiritual manifesto ReFocus He has welcomed members of the same gay rights organization Soulforce whose activists had been arrested during protests at Focus during the Dobson years Focus has collaborated with the local alternative weekly The Colorado Springs Independent in a campaign to encourage families to take in foster children No hell has not frozen over the paper quipped about the partnership Most recently Focus hosted a questionandanswer session with Jonathan Rauch a journalist who has advocated gay marriage Such efforts have won Mr Daly praise from unexpected quarters The Southern Poverty Law Center for instance has classified the Family Research Council another conservative Christian organization as a hate group because of its position on homosexuality But the law centers senior fellow Mark Potok said Focus had tried to evolve with the times What were seeing is something that happens classically when public opinion changes dramatically he said Basically the publics stance has moved away from these groups You see that with the rapidly rising acceptance of gay marriage And when public opinion moves away they have two choices They can moderate and move toward the middle as Focus on the Family has done or they can grow more shrill and radical For his part Mr Daly quotes the management maxim Leadership is about knowing reality In his talk to students and faculty members he wondered whether many Christians had mistakenly turned homosexuality into a super sin somehow more heinous than all others He spoke less of trying to defeat gay marriage initiatives at the ballot box than of preserving the religious freedom of individuals  whether a portrait photographer or a municipal clerk  to refuse to participate in the marital process How do you he asked the audience in the name of tolerance and diversity accept that we as Christians have principles weve got to live by The change in Focuss style if not its substance reflects more than an astute reading of opinion polls on gay marriage It also arises from Mr Dalys personal experience Whereas Dr Dobson was descended from two generations of ministers Mr Daly is the product of a home repeatedly broken by his parents divorce his mothers death and his fathers alcoholism He spent part of his childhood in the foster care system and finished high school while living with his older brother Rather than being the prophet decrying wickedness he is the evangelist attesting to the divine love and grace that he firmly believes saved his life For all that nobody is going to confuse Focus on the Family with the American Civil Liberties Union anytime soon CitizenLink Focuss lobbying affiliate lists such action items as defunding Planned Parenthood and opposing the International Violence Against Women Act Focuss Web site defends the legitimacy of widely criticized therapy to rectify unwanted homosexual attractions and behavior Toward the end of Mr Dalys talk a student named Lauren Burgess rose with a question She preceded it by explaining that she is the child of gay parents a man and a woman who both came out during her childhood Wouldnt a home with a loving stable gay couple she asked be better for a foster child than no home at all In that moment Mr Daly almost palpably struggled for what to say He complimented Ms Burgess on how well she had done in her life He said that research showed the best setting for a child was with a married mother and father And he left Ms Burgess miffed and unconvinced Focuss charm offensive at least for the time being had reached its limit
"Pope Material or Not, a Charming, Cheerful Cardinal Gains Notice in Rome",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/09/nyregion/cardinal-dolan-pope-material-or-not-gains-notice-in-rome.html,VATICAN CITY  He keeps a set of vestments here at the American seminary so he does not have to lug the red robes back and forth to New York He is a practiced frequent flier last fall he flew a round trip in a day borrowing a billionaires jet so he could preside at a dinner in Manhattan without missing a meeting in Rome  And he keeps careful tabs on both cities  last weekend in Rome to bid farewell to one pope and help choose the next he ducked into a priests office to watch a streaming webcast of Yankees and Mets spring training  Cardinal Timothy M Dolan the archbishop of New York has become an object of fascination in Rome for the fluency of his juggling act he is simultaneously head of the United States most prominent Roman Catholic diocese and president of its national conference of bishops tapped by the Vatican for numerous prestigious assignments and by network television anchors for their most prized interview spots In the weeks since Pope Benedict XVI announced his intention to retire the possibility that Cardinal Dolan could succeed him has been largely dismissed on the theory that his biggest strengths  outsize personality Everyman affect relentless public cheer  mark him as distinctively American in a way that makes it unlikely he would be chosen by his colleagues  But in recent days his joyful and telegenic orthodoxy is getting new attention in Rome on Thursday a prominent Vatican reporter Sandro Magister highlighted his qualifications calling him the consummate candidate who represents the impulse in the direction of purification Cardinal Dolan has colorfully dismissed speculation that he could be pope saying that he expects and is eager to return to New York Nonetheless this papal interregnum has become an important period for him presenting an opportunity for him to use mass media to reach Catholics in his vast and diverse archdiocese and to elevate his stature as he faces battles with President Obama over health insurance regulations and with Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York over a proposed liberalization of the states abortion laws He shows an easy demeanor he is unfailingly positive even when asked difficult questions But even he is quick to say that he represents a new style not a new point of view for Catholic bishops In an interview here before the cardinals decided to stop speaking to reporters he described the churchs teachings as a gift to be treasured but said Lets perhaps work on a way to wrap it in a more attractive way Named a bishop by Pope John Paul II and a cardinal by Benedict XVI Cardinal Dolan warned against anticipating change in timeless truths of the faith from a new pontiff  When we use the word tradition its not only a song from Fiddler on the Roof it happens to be a very powerful teaching he said Cardinal Dolan 63 is one of the newest members of the College of Cardinals he was granted his red hat only 13 months ago so his seating at meetings and even his position in the procession to the conclave will reflect his short tenure  But he has repeatedly won votes of confidence from his peers The American bishops elected him their president in a surprise vote in 2010 in Rome global bishops elected him to continue their work on new evangelization after their synod last fall Most significantly early last year he was tapped by Benedict to deliver a keynote address to the full College of Cardinals  I was very impressed by him said one of those in attendance Cardinal Wilfrid F Napier of Durban South Africa  In the sense that hes only been in New York for a couple of years theres a little bit of untested quality about him said Edward N Peters a professor of canon law at Sacred Heart Major Seminary in Detroit But if you look back at the synod of bishops in October just about every time bishops were allowed to vote for one of their own not only was he elected but he was usually elected far and away A Missouri native Cardinal Dolan has spent more years in Rome than in New York  as a seminarian he studied at the Pontifical North American College and then he served as that institutions rector from 1994 until 2001 He speaks Italian although he described his fluency as primitive last year happily offers Roman restaurant recommendations and loves to walk the cobblestone streets  But he is less Romanized than many cardinals and even the cardinals biggest fans say his biggest strengths in the United States  his fondness for beer and barbecue his physicality and exuberance  define him as American in a way that is a liability in a church headquarters that at times views the New World with a combination of condescension and disdain  Italians dont understand him said one Vatican official speaking on the condition of anonymity because he was not authorized to talk to the news media He added They dont like people joking on serious occasions warming the crowd  But Cardinal Dolans fellow cardinals seem to marvel at the impact of what Cardinal Edward M Egan who preceded him as archbishop of New York described as his milliondollar personality His manner is particularly striking in an era when the church is often on the defensive in the public square Cardinal Sean P OMalley the archbishop of Boston said that when he served as bishop of Fall River Mass he decided to send as many seminarians as he could to the college in Rome because Father Dolan was the rector His great joy in being a priest is something I wanted my seminarians to experience Cardinal OMalley said Cardinal Dolan has some of the attributes of a gifted politician  he remembers names works crowds checks in During a visit to a New York synagogue he put his right arm on the left shoulder of each person he greeted some adults he hugged some babies he held During a walk through Kennedy International Airport he greeted each worker pausing as some kissed his ring posing for photos with others  The high and mighty are charmed too it was the billionaire real estate investor Mortimer B Zuckerman who lent him a plane to get back to Rome last fall  Bishop Terry R LaValley who heads the sprawling upstate New York diocese of Ogdensburg said Cardinal Dolan would call at random times just to check in  Sunday morning at the gas station the phone rings  its Cardinal Dolan New Years Eve How are you doingÂ  Bishop LaValley said He is masterful at small talk frequently turning to food I can taste the carbonara as we speak he exclaimed at Kennedy Airport and sports They didnt look too good yesterday he said of the Yankees  And he has a strikingly contemporary worship style  short homilies conversational tone informal language  which contrasts with the erudite and occasionally bombastic tone associated with earlier generations of prelates  Cardinal Donald W Wuerl the archbishop of Washington who taught the future New York archbishop when he was still a seminarian said Cardinal Dolans outgoing style and ability to project enthusiasm were huge assets to the church back home  Theres a sense in which hes ideal for New York because there is so much energy in New York you just associate that with New York everything the Great White Way people being up all the time and its selfidentification as the center of the world he said But Cardinal Wuerl cautioned against expectations of an American pope Theres an old Roman saying You never put limits on divine providenceÂ  he said So Lord knows what will happen But I think theres always the great caveat of can anyone right now from the United States ever effectively serve and be that voice because the temptation would be that an American would be identified with America first and the See of Peter and the chair of Peter second  And some Vaticanisti  the small band of commentators who closely watch highlevel church affairs  say that in the unlikely event an American does become pope it is more likely to be Cardinal OMalley whose humble mien facility with languages Capuchin habit and experience responding to sexual abuse have impressed insiders  Cardinal Dolan said he did not know nor was he particularly concerned about how other cardinals assessed him  In my mind what I care most about is what God thinks about me and whether Im doing his will he said I also have to say Im always wondering what the people of the Archdiocese of New York think about me and thats a source of consolation because I can feel their love and support
Lifeâ€™s Unequal Beginnings,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/10/opinion/sunday/lifes-unequal-beginnings.html,FOR the past six years I have been photographing birth looking at its universal as well as cultural aspects and the struggle to provide women with safe respectful care An estimated quarter of a million women die each year from pregnancyrelated causes like preeclampsia Though the number of women who die in pregnancy or childbirth is half what it was 20 years ago most of these deaths could have been prevented  My interest in the subject started when I was 18 and on a semesterabroad program in the Dominican Republic where I ended up with a Spanish immersion internship in the maternity ward of a public hospital I inserted catheters waited alone with women laboring on bare plastic mattresses  family members were not admitted  and tried not to pass out while drawing blood Id had only a few years of high school Spanish and Id had no training for the work Nine years later I thought about those experiences with disbelief and I was curious So I returned to the hospital and began to photograph The maternity ward which saw 600 deliveries per month lacked hot water and dependable electricity in a country whose maternal mortality rate was among the highest in the Caribbean Caesarean sections were very common The doctors and nurses were brusque and women who had induced abortions illegally and then come to the hospital for care were scolded until they cried before being sent to recover beside newborn babies  Despite all of this the female obstetrician I photographed was kind hardworking and underpaid doing what she felt was best  In the following years I photographed the birth process in many places  in Arizona in a Navajo Nationrun hospital with a remarkably low rate of Caesarean sections in a slum in Lagos Nigeria where midwives from Doctors Without Borders worked in Mexico where students from Mexicos only governmentaccredited midwifery school studied with Mayan midwives and in my hometown hospital in Greenfield Mass where all the patients see only midwives but have access to doctors in case of an emergency  Women giving birth need trained attendants sufficient medical supplies and respect I was lucky to have all of that Last June I gave birth to my first child a boy named William I pulled his slippery body onto my soft belly and squinted at him through eyes that were puffy from hours of pushing I held him fed him rested and ate I was exhausted and a little stunned but safe cared for and alive

Arkansasâ€™s Abortion Ban and One Manâ€™s Strong Will,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/us/arkansas-senator-jason-raperts-abortion-ban.html,CONWAY Ark  The adoption by Arkansas last week of the countrys strictest abortion ban  at 12 weeks of pregnancy when a fetal heartbeat is typically detected  gave a new jolt of energy to a loose band of abortion foes who are pushing similar measures in several states Fetal heartbeat laws are already under consideration by legislatures in Ohio Kansas and North Dakota and have a good chance of passage in the coming year their proponents believe even though legal experts say they have little chance of surviving in federal courts Similar proposals are less far along in Kentucky Mississippi and Wyoming What happened in Arkansas will definitely encourage others to take similar action said Janet Porter the president of Faith2Action a Christian group in Ohio and an early proponent of fetal heartbeat laws Bryan Fischer a spokesman at the American Family Association a conservative Christian group based in Mississippi called the Arkansas measure a milestone The Arkansas law was designed by State Senator Jason Rapert a Republican who says he has no time for those who say it will prove legally futile noting that the word abortion does not appear in the Constitution Arkansas has made a significant statement Mr Rapert 40 a bornagain Christian said in an interview adding that he had received scores of messages of support from activists and legislators around the country Hopefully we can awaken the nation The heartbeat strategy has percolated over the past few years among activists frustrated at the slow progress against abortion rights The bills under consideration in other states have not specified the 12week threshold that Arkansas has adopted Instead as in Ohio they mandate that doctors should detect heartbeats using standard medical practice which they hope might halt some abortions even earlier than 12 weeks But those activists are elated by Arkansass move Evangelical groups like the Family Research Council in Washington are among the enthusiastic promoters of fetalheartbeat limits But traditional leaders of the antiabortion movement like National Right to Life and the Roman Catholic Church think such laws will quickly be overturned in federal courts reinforcing the existing limit set by the Supreme Court that women have a constitutional right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb usually around 24 weeks into pregnancy As political experts in Arkansas see it the passage of the fetal heartbeat law became almost inevitable in November with the Republican takeover of the General Assembly for the first time since Reconstruction That is also when Mr Rapert won a seat in the State Senate to represent this city just north of Little Rock His victory was an especially resonant and personal one His opponent Linda S Tyler 64 a popular moderate Democrat was the person he blamed most for blocking a more restrictive antiabortion proposal the year before when he was a freshman legislator The public health committee that Ms Tyler then chaired in the House refused to advance his 2011 bill even after it had passed the State Senate In the November campaign he implied that Ms Tyler was personally responsible for allowing more deaths of unborn babies My opponent killed 10 prolife bills Mr Rapert said of Ms Tyler in an interview at the Capitol on Friday He characterized me as a farleft liberal Ms Tyler recalled last weekend at her home in Conway But I feel I represent the conservative values in my district Ms Tyler a former human resources executive and smallbusiness owner said that a majority of her committee members had declined to act on bills they regarded as unconstitutional She said that she has never called herself prochoice and that she had voted to ban lateterm abortions But in the end she said abortion should be a decision involving a woman her family her faith and her doctor The law will take effect 90 days after the legislative session ends in the coming weeks The American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights have promised a rapid legal challenge on the other side Liberty Counsel a Christian law firm linked with Liberty University in Virginia has offered to help Arkansas defend the law on a pro bono basis Interviews with Conway residents suggested that many were pleased to see Arkansas take the lead in curbing abortions It may be unconstitutional but its the right thing to do said Rodney Purdle 40 a computer programmer and a Republican Janet Rhodes 52 who works in oilfield services said Im prolife and I was glad it passed I dont think it takes anything away from women But Henry Thompson 90 a retired truck driver who was riding an electric cart to shop at WalMart said that he remained an oldschool Arkansas Democrat and that he opposed new abortion restrictions I think this decision should be between a woman and her doctor rather than be made by some flybynight politician he said Mr Rapert said he learned of the fetal heartbeat strategy through his readings and discussions with the Arkansas Family Council a Christian group In 2011 his first full year as a legislator but from a different district he won Senate approval for his heartbeat bill even though the Democrats still held a majority But it died in Ms Tylers committee Then Mr Rapert ran into a new roadblock As the Democrats redrew legislative districts in keeping with census data they tried to neutralize support for Mr Rapert whom some saw as too brash and extreme To run again Mr Rupert had to face Ms Tyler on her home turf in a largely new district He was targeted in the redistricting said Jay Barth a political scientist at Hendrix College in Conway But Mr Rapert was very much in tune with the states mounting antiWashington antiObama and antiabortion sentiment At a Tea Party rally in 2011 captured on video he told an enthusiastic crowd Were going to take this country back for conservatism And were not going to allow minorities to run roughshod over what you people believe in He later said that he had been talking about political not racial minorities Mr Rapert who runs an investment firm and a Christian missionary society preached at local churches before the election sometimes entertaining worshipers by playing Amazing Grace on his fiddle He supports the tax cuts and other fiscal goals of the Tea Party and has benefited from fliers and television ads paid for by national conservative groups like Americans for Prosperity financed by the Koch brothers the oil executives and Republican power brokers Ms Tyler charged that her opponent was backed by shadowy outofstate billionaires Even on Election Day I fully expected to win she said Mr Rapert prevailed with 54 percent of the vote The largest antiabortion groups prefer an incremental strategy that has resulted in hundreds of state laws to narrow abortion rights like requiring women to have sonograms beforehand and imposing longer waiting periods Those groups are also pushing against Supreme Court rulings though not as deeply as Arkansas has by promoting bans on abortion after 20 weeks limits that have passed in 10 states but are under challenge in federal courts Mr Rapert said last week that while he would ultimately like to see Arkansas outlaw abortions from conception he does not expect to reach for that any time soon I think weve done our duty for now he said But the day after the fetalheartbeat bill was enacted Mr Rapert cosponsored a bill designed to strip Planned Parenthood of all state and federal financing
Unholy Alliance,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/12/opinion/concerns-at-un-conference-on-violence-against-women.html,Some horrific events over the past few months including the shooting of a Pakistani schoolgirl and the rape and murder of a young Indian physiotherapy student should have been an alert for the world to unite in preventing violence against women But if a conference now under way at the United Nations is any guide that message has not resounded with the necessary urgency Halfway into their twoweek annual meeting delegates to the Commission on the Status of Women fear they will not be able to agree on a final communiqu just like last year  Who is to blame Delegates and activists are pointing fingers at the Vatican Iran and Russia for trying to eliminate language in a draft communiqu asserting that the familiar excuses  religion custom tradition  cannot be used by governments to duck their obligation to eliminate violence The United Nations Human Rights Council endorsed similar language just six months ago Conservative hardliners seem determined to fight it out again They have also objected to references to abortion rights as well as language suggesting that rape also includes forcible behavior by a womans husband or partner Poland Egypt other Muslim states and conservative American Christian groups have criticized one or more parts of the draft The efforts by the Vatican and Iran to control women are well known It is not clear what motivates Russia although there is a strong antifeminist strain in President Vladimir V Putins government He may also be trying to curry favor with Islamic states In any case the suggestion that traditional values justify the violation of basic human rights is spurious As Inga Marte Thorkildsen Norways gender equality minister has noted Violence against women must be seen as a human rights issue and that has nothing to do with culture or religion Genderbased violence is an epidemic A World Bank report estimated that more women between the ages of 15 and 44 were at risk from rape and domestic violence than from cancer car accidents war and malaria combined According to the United Nations and other sources more than 600 million women live in countries where domestic violence is not considered a crime and more than 3 million girls are facing female genital mutilation Women in all social economic ethnic and religious groups are affected The conference will be a failure if it cannot produce ambitious global standards that will deliver concrete results to protect women and girls
"Cardinals Pick Bergoglio, Who Will Be Pope Francis",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/cardinals-elect-new-pope.html,VATICAN CITY  With a puff of white smoke from the chimney of the Sistine Chapel and to the cheers of thousands of rainsoaked faithful a gathering of Catholic cardinals picked a new pope from among their midst on Wednesday  choosing the cardinal from Argentina the first South American to lead the church The new pope Jorge Mario Bergoglio pronounced BerGOALio will be called Francis the 266th pontiff of the Roman Catholic Church He is also the first nonEuropean pope in more than 1200 years and the first member of the Jesuit order to lead the church In choosing Francis 76 who had been the archbishop of Buenos Aires the cardinals sent a powerful message that the future of the church lies in the global south home to the bulk of the worlds Catholics I would like to thank you for your embrace the new pope dressed in white said from the white balcony on St Peters Basilica as thousands cheered joyously below My brother cardinals have chosen one who is from far away but here I am Speaking in Italian as he blessed the faithful Francis asked the audience to pray for me and well see each other soon Good night and have a good rest he concluded in a grandfatherly almost casual tone Habemus papam members of the crowd shouted in Latin waving umbrellas and flags We have a pope Others cried Viva il Papa It was like waiting for the birth of a baby only better said a Roman man Giuliano Uncini A child sitting atop his fathers shoulders waved a crucifix Francis is known as a humble man who spoke out for the poor and led an austere life in Buenos Aires He was born to Italian immigrant parents and was raised in the Argentine capital The new pope inherits a church wrestling with an array of challenges that intensified during his predecessor Benedict XVI including a shortage of priests growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere a sexual abuse crisis that has undermined the churchs moral authority in the West and difficulties governing the Vatican itself Benedict abruptly ended his troubled eightyear papacy last month announcing he was no longer up to the rigors of the job He became the first pontiff in 598 years to resign The 115 cardinals who are younger than 80 and eligible to vote chose their new leader after two days of voting Pope Francis spoke by telephone with Benedict on Wednesday evening said a Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi He called it an act of great significance and pastorality that Francis first act as pope was to offer a prayer for his predecessor The Rev Thomas Rosica of Canada another Vatican spokesman recalled meeting Cardinal Bergoglio a decade ago during preparations for World Youth Day in Canada and said the cardinal had told him that he lived very simply in an apartment Buenos Aires and sold the archdioceses mansion He cooks for himself and took great pride in telling us that and that he took the bus to work rather than riding in a car Father Rosica said President Obama was among the first world leaders to congratulate Francis in a message that emphasized the popes humble roots and New World background As a champion of the poor and the most vulnerable among us he carries forth the message of love and compassion that has inspired the world for more than 2000 years  that in each other we see the face of God Mr Obama said in a message released by the White House As the first pope from the Americas the president added his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day A doctrinal conservative Francis has opposed liberation theology abortion gay marriage and the ordination of women standing with his predecessor in holding largely traditional views As archbishop of Buenos Aires beginning in 1998 and a cardinal since 2001 he frequently tangled with Argentinas governments over social issues In 2010 for example he castigated a governmentsupported law to legalize marriage and adoption by samesex couples as a war against God He has been less energetic however in urging the Argentine church to examine its own behavior during the 1970s when the country was consumed by a conflict between right and left In what became known as the Dirty War as many as 30000 people were disappeared tortured or killed by a military dictatorship that seized power in March 1976 In a long interview with an Argentine newspaper in 2010 Cardinal Bergoglio defended his behavior during the dictatorship He said that he had helped hide people being sought for arrest or disappearance by the military because of their political views had helped others leave Argentina and had lobbied the countrys military rulers directly for the release and protection of others Before beginning the voting by secret ballot in the Sistine Chapel on Tuesday in a cloistered meeting known as a conclave the cardinals swore an oath of secrecy in Latin a rite designed to protect deliberations from outside scrutiny  and to protect cardinals from earthly influence as they seek divine guidance The conclave followed more than a week of intense broader discussions among the worlds cardinals about the problems facing the church and their criteria for its next leader We spoke among ourselves in an exceptional and free way with great truth about the lights but also about shadows in the current situation of the Catholic Church Cardinal Christoph Schnborn of Vienna a theologian known for his intellect and his pastoral touch told reporters this week The popes election is something substantially different from a political election Cardinal Schnborn said adding that the role was not the chief executive of a multinational company but the spiritual head of a community of believers Indeed Benedict was selected in 2005 as a caretaker after the momentous papacy of John Paul II but the shy theologian appeared to show little inclination toward management His papacy suffered from crises of communications  with Muslims Jews and Anglicans  that along with a sex abuse crisis that raged back to life in Europe in 2010 evolved into a crisis of governance Critics of Benedicts secretary of state Cardinal Tarcisio Bertone said he had difficulties in running the Vatican and appeared more interested in the Vaticans ties to Italy than to the rest of the world The Vatican is deeply concerned about the fate of Christians in the wartorn Middle East The new pope will also inherit power struggles over the management of the Vatican bank which must continue a process of meeting international transparency standards or risk being shut out of the mainstream international banking system In one of his final acts as pope Benedict appointed a German aristocrat Ernst von Freyberg as the banks new president Francis will have to help make the Vatican bureaucracy  often seen as a hornets nest of infighting Italians  work more efficiently for the good of the church After years in which Benedict and John Paul helped consolidate more power at the top many liberal Catholics also hope that the new pope will give local bishops conferences more decisionmaking power to help respond to the needs of the faithful The reform of the Roman Curia which runs the Vatican is not conceptually hard said Alberto Melloni the author of numerous books on the Vatican and the Second Vatican Council its hard on a political front but it will take five minutes for someone who has the strength You get rid of the spoil system and thats it The hard things are if you want a permanent consultation of bishops conferences he added For Mr Melloni foreign policy and the churchs vision of Asia would be crucial to the new pope If Roman Catholicism was capable of learning Greek while it was speaking Aramaic of learning Celtic while it was speaking Latin now it either has to learn Chinese or ciao he said using the Italian world for goodbye Ahead of the election cardinals said they were looking for a pope that understands the problems of the church at present and who is strong enough to tackle them said Cardinal Miloslav Vlk the archbishop emeritus of Prague who participated in the general congregations but was not eligible to vote in a conclave He said those problems included reforming the Roman Curia handling the sex abuse crisis and cleaning up the Vatican bank He needs to be capable of solving these issues Cardinal Vlk said as he walked near the Vatican this week adding that the next pope needs to be open to the world to the troubles of the world to society because evangelization is a primary task to bring the Gospel to people The sexual abuse crisis remains a troubling issue for the church especially in Englishspeaking countries where victims sued dioceses found to have moved around abusive priests On Wednesday news reports in California showed that one cardinal elector Cardinal Roger M Mahony the former archbishop of Los Angeles the archdiocese and a former priest had reached a settlement of almost 10 million in four child sex abuse cases according to the victims lawyers Becoming pope also has a human dimension In one of his final speeches as pope before he retired on Feb 18 Benedict said his successor would need to be prepared to lose some of his privacy
A Conservative With a Common Touch,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/new-pope-theologically-conservative-but-with-a-common-touch.html,BUENOS AIRES  Like most of those in Argentina he is a soccer fan his favorite team being the underdog San Lorenzo squad Known for his outreach to the countrys poor he gave up a palace for a small apartment rode public transportation instead of a chauffeurdriven car and cooked his own meals The new pope Jorge Mario Bergoglio pronounced berGOALio 76 will be called Francis Chosen Wednesday by a gathering of Roman Catholic cardinals he is in some ways a historymaking pontiff the first from the Jesuit order and the first pope from Latin America But Cardinal Bergoglio is also a conventional choice a theological conservative of Italian ancestry who vigorously backs Vatican positions on abortion gay marriage the ordination of women and other major issues  leading to heated clashes with Argentinas leftleaning president He was less energetic however when it came to standing up to Argentinas military dictatorship during the 1970s as the country was consumed by a conflict between right and left that became known as the Dirty War He has been accused of knowing about abuses and failing to do enough to stop them during a period when as many as 30000 people were abducted tortured or killed by the dictatorship Despite the criticism many here praise Cardinal Bergoglio  who likes the more humble title of Father Jorge  as a passionate defender of the poor and disenfranchised In 2001 he surprised the staff of Muiz Hospital in Buenos Aires asking for a jar of water which he used to wash the feet of 12 patients hospitalized with complications from the virus that causes AIDS He then kissed their feet telling reporters that society forgets the sick and the poor More recently in September 2012 he scolded priests in Buenos Aires who refused to baptize the children of unwed mothers No to hypocrisy he said of the priests at the time They are the ones who separate the people of God from salvation Though he is averse to liberation theology which he views as hopelessly tainted with Marxist ideology Cardinal Bergoglio has emphasized outreach to the impoverished and as cardinal of Buenos Aires he has overseen increased social services and evangelization in the slums I am encouraged by this choice viewing it as a pledge for a church of simplicity and of ecological ideals said Leonardo Boff a founder of liberation theology What is more Mr Boff said Cardinal Bergoglio comes from the developing world outside the walls of Rome Jorge Mario Bergoglio was born in Buenos Aires on Dec 17 1936 to Mario Bergoglio an immigrant from northern Italy and Regina Bergoglio a homemaker He came relatively late to the priesthood enrolling in a seminary only at the age of 21 after studying chemistry He has had health concerns since his youth having had a lung removed because of an infection By all accounts he was a brilliant student who relished the study not just of theology but also of secular subjects like psychology and literature He was ordained a priest a few days short of turning 33 and from that point on his ascent within the church was rapid by 1973 he had been named the Jesuit provincial for Argentina the church official in charge of supervising the orders activities in the country He remained in that post through 1979 and his performance during the Dirty War has been the subject of controversy In 2005 shortly before the Vatican conclave that elevated Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger to the papacy Cardinal Bergoglio was formally accused by an Argentine lawyer in a lawsuit of being complicit in the militarys kidnapping of two Jesuit priests whose antigovernment views he considered dangerously unorthodox The priests whom he had dismissed from the order a week before they disappeared were discovered months later on the outskirts of Buenos Aires drugged and partially undressed At the time the lawsuit was filed the cardinals spokesman dismissed the accusations as old slander The lawsuit was eventually dismissed but the debate has continued with Argentine journalists publishing articles and books that appear to contradict Cardinal Bergoglios account of his actions These accounts draw not only on documents from the period but also on statements by priests and lay workers who clashed with Cardinal Bergoglio After the church had denied for years any involvement with the dictatorship he testified in 2010 that he had met secretly with Gen Jorge Videla the former head of the military junta and Adm Emilio Massera the commander of the navy to ask for the release of the priests The following year prosecutors called him to the witness stand to testify on the military juntas systematic kidnapping of children a subject he was also accused of knowing about but failing to prevent In a long interview published by an Argentine newspaper in 2010 he defended his behavior during the dictatorship He said that he had helped hide people being sought for arrest or disappearance by the military because of their political views had helped others leave Argentina and had lobbied the countrys military rulers directly for the release and protection of others In November 2005 Cardinal Bergoglio was elected head of the Argentine Conference of Bishops for a threeyear term which was renewed in 2008 At the time he was chosen the Argentine church was dealing with a notorious political scandal that of the Rev Christian von Wernich a former chaplain of the Buenos Aires police who had been accused of aiding in the questioning torture and death of political prisoners The church authorities had spirited Father von Wernich out of the country and placed him in a parish in Chile under a false name but he was eventually brought back to Argentina and put on trial In 2007 he was found guilty on seven counts of complicity in homicide more than 40 counts of kidnapping and more than 30 of torture and was sentenced to life imprisonment Father von Wernich was allowed to continue to celebrate Mass in prison and in 2010 a church official said that at the appropriate time von Wernichs situation will have to be resolved in accordance with canonical law But Cardinal Bergoglio never issued a formal apology on behalf of the church or commented directly on the case and during his tenure the bishops conference was similarly silent Only in November 2012 a year after Cardinal Bergoglio had stepped down as head of the bishops conference did the group address the issue of its role during the dictatorship It came in response to remarks in which the former dictator General Videla had in the words of the statement the bishops issued attributed to those who then led the Conference complicity in criminal acts The bishops statement denied General Videlas accusation and claimed that church leaders of the time tried to do what was within their reach for the welfare of all Asked Wednesday about Cardinal Bergoglios role during the Dirty War the archbishop of Washington Cardinal Donald Wuerl said I havent seen anything other than conjecture In recent years Cardinal Bergoglio has clashed with the Argentine government particularly former President Nstor Kirchner and his successor and widow Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner about issues like gay marriage abortion and the adoption of children by gay couples In 2010 he described a governmentsupported law to legalize marriage and adoption by samesex couples as a war against God and a maneuver by the devil At the time Mrs Kirchner said Bergoglios position is medieval But on Wednesday after he was announced as the new pope she appeared willing to smooth over their differences congratulating him and telling him he had her consideration and respect Horacio Verbitsky an Argentine journalist who has investigated claims of ties between Cardinal Bergoglio and Argentinas military rulers said he expected the new pope to be extremely conservative in all doctrinaire questions yet open to the world and above all to the world of the poor
New Pope Shifts Churchâ€™s Center of Gravity Away From Europe,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/14/world/europe/Choice-of-Argentine-Cardinal-Shows-Latinos-Growing-Power-in-Church.html,ROME  The surprise selection on Wednesday of an Argentine Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio as the new pope shifted the gravity of the Roman Catholic Church from Europe to Latin America in one fell swoop and served as an emphatic salute to the growing power of Latinos across the Americas  The new pope took the name Francis and is the 266th pontiff of the church He is the first pope from Latin America and the first member of the Jesuit order to lead the church I would like to thank you for your embrace the new pope dressed in white said in Italian from the balcony on St Peters Basilica as thousands cheered joyously below My brother cardinals have chosen one who is from far away but here I am The selection electrified Latinos from Los Angeles to Buenos Aires and raised the hopes especially of those in Latin America where 4 of every 10 of the worlds Catholics now live But the choice also may provide a strategic boost to the church in the United States where its following would have lost ground in recent decades were it not for the influx of Latino immigrants who have increasingly asserted themselves as a cultural and political force and played a critical role in President Obamas reelection  The significance of the choice was not lost on church leaders Its been more than 500 years since the first evangelization and this is the first time that there is a pope from Latin America said Archbishop Jose Gomez of Los Angeles who is originally from Mexico  Its a huge role that we never had before he said The new pope known for his simple pastoral ways and his connection to the poor is in some ways a contrast to his predecessor Benedict XVI an aloof theologian who resigned the office  the first pope to do so in 598 years  saying he no longer felt up to the rigors of the job But Francis shares Benedicts core doctrinal positions and is not considered likely to push changes in positions like the churchs ban on the ordination of women as priests or its strict opposition to abortion and gay marriage The choice of Francis who is 76 also defied some predictions that the 115 cardinals would opt for a young pope who could energize the church at a time when it faces a shortage of priests growing competition from evangelical churches in the Southern Hemisphere a sexual abuse crisis that has undermined the churchs moral authority in the West and difficulties governing the Vatican itself Pope Francis spoke by telephone with Benedict now known as pope emeritus on Wednesday evening said a Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi He called it an act of great significance and pastorality that Francis first act as pope was to offer a prayer for his predecessor Cardinal Timothy Dolan of New York told reporters he had heard that Francis would visit Benedict soon although the Vatican did not include the visit on the new popes schedule for this week Italian news media reported that the visit would take place in the next few days and would be televised  Mr Obama was among the first world leaders to congratulate Francis in a message that emphasized the popes humble roots and New World origins As the first pope from the Americas the president said his selection also speaks to the strength and vitality of a region that is increasingly shaping our world and alongside millions of Hispanic Americans those of us in the United States share the joy of this historic day The cardinals could have chosen a pope from a country in Africa or Asia where Catholic converts are plentiful and the church is vibrant Instead they selected a cardinal from Argentina to the surprise of even those who had hoped for a nonEuropean An Argentine I cant believe it said Gaston Aquino a seminarian from Argentina standing in the packed crowd in St Peters Square in Rome as the name of the new pope was announced from the balcony above Bergoglio pope he marveled I think it will mean great joy for Argentina Catholics in the United States are holding steady at about a quarter of the population and about onethird of those are Latinos In Latin America the church is confronting many of the same cultural and political battles as it is in Europe and the United States a rise in acceptance of gay relationships abortion and birth control and a growing tide of people abandoning the church and professing no religion  The Rev Luis Calero a Jesuit priest and professor of anthropology at Santa Clara University in California who studies the church in Central and South America said A lot of Catholics are leaving the Catholic church in Latin America to go to evangelical and Pentecostal churches They no longer find a home in Catholic Christianity Going to a traditional parish is no longer fulfilling to them because the parish is impersonal he said It tends to not have a sense of community that is uplifting  Father Calero said the next pope might be able to turn the situation around if he could respond to what he said were the most pressing problems poverty pluralism and the shortage of priests because of the churchs requirement of clerical celibacy  The choice of Cardinal Bergoglio at least initially appeared to be celebrated across the continent There had been faint hope in Mexico that the next pope would be Cardinal Jos Francisco Robles Ortega the archbishop of Guadalajara who was mentioned in Italian newspapers in the past week as a candidate gaining steam But many Mexican were joyous nonetheless with newspapers playing up the historical turn of a Latin American assuming the throne of Peter  It fills us with joy because he is close to the Latin American people Msgr Eugenio Lira the secretary general of the Mexican Conference of Bishops told reporters He could be sensitive to economic conditions and the suffering joys and hope of people in these lands The choice also points to challenges faced by the church in some parts of Latin America like Portuguesespeaking Brazil the country with the worlds largest concentration of Catholics where evangelical churches have made big inroads in recent decades In Argentina itself a nation historically seen as more Europeanized than its neighbors the church is grappling with a declining number of Catholics who regularly attend mass  Cardinal Dolan said in an interview after the conclave that Catholic is part of their DNA in Argentina With Cardinal Bergoglio as pope he said think of the electricity that is going to send  But he said that country of origin was not the main factor for the cardinals who elected him  Most cardinals just want to choose the right man he said The pope should be a good pastor governor and communicator He fills those bills Where he comes from is gravy And weve got a lot of good gravy Enrique Krauze a Mexican historian and political analyst said there would be an expectation in Latin America for a pope from the region to promote democracy and human rights If the church plays a role in favor of democracy and human rights as it played in Chile during the Pinochet regime then the pope will be a factor in civic progress in these countries he said If the church takes up the banner of freedom it would be a great benefit in this continent that is the reservoir of Catholicism in the world Outside St Matthew Catholic School in West Phoenix where she had gone to pick up her children Deana Silva 27 said I didnt really connect with the other pope but Papa Francisco or Pope Francis is different He is more like us you know Latino Ms Silva said Her mother Donna Reyes 46 said she was very excited We had been watching and waiting said Ms Reyes whose parents were immigrants from Mexico There are a lot of us Latinos in the Catholic Church It was nice that the Church finally recognized it As the children lined up to leave school someone said a prayer and made an announcement about Lent over the loudspeakers then in Spanish greeted the new pope el primer Papa de las Americas the first pope from the Americas

God Is an Argentine,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/opinion/god-is-an-argentine.html,BUENOS AIRES WE Argentines are a credulous people Perhaps 9 out of 10 of us believe in some God most of us certainly believe that that God is Argentine True most of the evidence we have used to support this suspicion has come from soccer our most famous player Diego Armando Maradona once won a World Cup game thanks in part to an illegal handball that went down in history as the Hand of God goal And todays biggest soccer hero Lionel Messi is also an Argentine But now we have even better confirmation in the form of an announcement from the Vatican On Wednesday the Roman Catholic Church chose as pope a nonEuropean for the first time in the modern era the first from the Americas and an Argentine to boot Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio God may not play dice with the universe but he certainly laughs a lot A 76yearold Jesuit Cardinal Bergoglio became the archbishop of Buenos Aires in 1998 But early in his career in the 1970s he was the national boss of the Society of Jesus  a time that overlapped with the most violent years of military dictatorship in Argentina The hierarchy of Argentinas Catholic Church was complicit with the military genocide Some researchers like the journalist Horacio Verbitsky have linked Cardinal Bergoglio with the desaparicin  the disappearance in May 1976 of two Jesuit priests Francisco Jalics and Orlando Yorio who worked in the slums of Buenos Aires Both were kidnapped and tortured The cardinal has always denied involvement but many Argentines remain convinced that he withdrew protection from the priests allowing the military to prey on them  Leading up to the conclave the Catholic Church was busy worrying about the appalling issue of the sexual abuse of children by so many of its priests Cardinal Bergoglio did not awaken any such suspicion But one could perhaps compare his record with that of his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI who was a teenage member of the Hitler Youth It seems the church does not follow the precept of that Roman Julius Caesar who upon divorcing his wife said she not only had to be innocent but had to appear it too  The new pope who has taken the name Francis after Francis of Assisi has done much to leave those accusations behind him Everyone who knows him says he is serene kind modest austere and  apparently  devoid of personal ambition They point to his attitude during the previous conclave eight years ago when he reportedly rejected the possibility of being anointed It seems the Holy Spirit was more adamant this time  They highlight as well his words and deeds in service of the poor These social stances often led to clashes with Nstor Kirchner and his wife Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner the backtoback presidents of Argentina since 2003 Several times he publicly denounced their policies on poverty and inequality and accused them of enriching themselves while pretending to serve the needy  Another battle emerged in 2010 when after opposing it for many years Mrs Kirchner endorsed the gaymarriage law that made Argentina the first country in Latin America with marriage equality Cardinal Bergoglio called it a devils move and demanded a godly war Mrs Kirchner later accused him of attempting to reenact the Inquisition  So she was relieved when in 2011 his term as head of the Argentine Catholic Church expired She probably would never have guessed  did anyone  that he would be made the master of the kingdom Gods representative on earth It is a paradox that Mrs Kirchners administration so fond of nationalist exploits is now unable to showcase what could have been presented as a major national triumph the election of Our Pope the Argentine who made it abroad the final confirmation that yes God is Argentine This week Habemus papam  we have a pope  became an Argentine idiom His election underlines the assumption that the center of Catholicism is shifting to the worlds poorer regions of Africa Asia and Latin America And yet in his own country the poor are migrating en masse to Pentecostal and other Christian churches that are more charismatic and less institutionally compromised than the Old Lady from Rome Perhaps Pope Francis election will reverse that shift In fact I dread the effect that this unexpected divine favor will have on my country We are a society that turned to tennis once Guillermo Vilas won a Grand Slam in France grew obsessed with basketball when Manu Ginobili made his mark in the American NBA started raving about monarchy when an Argentineborn princess married the crown prince of the Netherlands and has persisted in doubting Jorge Luis Borgess value because he never won the international honor of a Nobel Prize The fact that one of us is now sitting on St Peters throne may have a huge effect on the weight of Catholicism on our lives  Catholicism has never excelled at letting nonbelievers live as they believe they should The right to legal abortion for one will be a ruthless field of that battle our pope will surely never allow his own country where legal abortion remains severely limited to set a bad example Here as everywhere the Vatican is a main lobbying force for conservative even reactionary issues An Argentine pope can bring this power to uncharted heights Or perhaps not I hope I am wrong it has often been my lot For infallibility please ask for el Papa Francisco
Cuomos Differ on New Pope,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/nyregion/cuomos-differ-on-pope-francis.html,Gov Andrew M Cuomo called Pope Francis praiseworthy on Thursday just hours after his father former Gov Mario M Cuomo was quoted suggesting the new pope was not the best possible choice The Cuomos both prominent Roman Catholic Democrats have each tangled on occasion with the Catholic Church  the elder Mr Cuomo over his support for abortion rights and the younger Mr Cuomo over his support for samesex marriage But they had different responses to the election of Pope Francis  Mario Cuomo told Crains New York Business that while he admired Pope Francis for living a simple life and working with the poor he felt the new popes background had not taught him how to deal with the high pressure of huge problems in the church  There are many parts of the church that need mending and everybody understands that the former governor added This pope has not had an opportunity to do that kind of work The whole question of women the question of marriage  not even the question of samesex marriage which is a recent development  but the whole idea of priests not being allowed to be married  thats led to a lot of unhappy relationships and ugly relationships by people who are basically sick Thats something this new pope will have to deal with  In the same article Andrew Cuomos younger sister Madeline was even blunter saying of the new pope I dont think hes what we need right now in the Catholic Church Were looking to move the church forward with gay marriage and women priests Later Thursday Andrew Cuomo was asked about the comments I have not heard their concerns he said But all Cuomos are entitled to their own opinions But he phrased his own reaction positively I think its exciting that hes from the Americas  that is a positive he said His life story is inspirational in many ways Obviously were just learning about him but what you hear about him the decisions hes made the way hes led his life the modesty of it the humbleness of it I think is quite praiseworthy The governor is the subject of heavy criticism from the states Catholic bishops because of his plan to introduce legislation that would strengthen the state abortionrights law Some of the bishops are planning to meet with him on Tuesday  the same day Pope Francis is inaugurated  to discuss their concerns
Muslim Brotherhoodâ€™s Statement on Women Stirs Liberalsâ€™ Fears,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/15/world/middleeast/muslim-brotherhoods-words-on-women-stir-liberal-fears.html,CAIRO  During its decades as an underground Islamist movement the Muslim Brotherhood has long preached that Islam required women to obey their husbands in all matters A woman needs to be confined within a framework that is controlled by the man of the house Osama Yehia Abu Salama a Brotherhood family expert said of the groups general approach speaking in a recent seminar for women training to become marriage counselors Even if a wife were beaten by her husband he advised Show her how she had a role in what happened to her If he is to blame Mr Abu Salama added she shares 30 percent or 40 percent of the fault Now with a leader of the Brotherhoods political arm in Egypts presidential palace and its members dominating Parliament some deeply patriarchal views the organization has long taught its members are spilling into public view The Brotherhoods strident statements are reinforcing fears among many Egyptian liberals about the potential consequences of the groups rise to power and creating new awkwardness for President Mohamed Morsi as he presents himself as a new kind of moderate Westernfriendly Islamist In a statement Wednesday on a proposed United Nations declaration to condemn violence against women the Brotherhood issued a list of objections which formally laid out its views on women for the first time since it came to power In its statement the Brotherhood said that wives should not have the right to file legal complaints against their husbands for rape and husbands should not be subject to the punishments meted out for the rape of a stranger A husband must have guardianship over his wife not an equal partnership with her the group declared Daughters should not have the same inheritance rights as sons Nor should the law cancel the need for a husbands consent in matters like travel work or use of contraception  a reform in traditional Islamic family law that was enacted under former President Hosni Mubarak and credited to his wife Suzanne The statement appeared in many ways to reflect the Brotherhoods longstanding doctrine still discussed in classes like Mr Abu Salamas and in the groups womens forums Feminists said its statement also may reflect the views of most women in Egypts conservative traditionalist culture In an interview on Thursday Pakinam ElSharkawy President Morsis political adviser and Egypts representative last week at the United Nations commission sought to distance the Morsi administration from the Brotherhoods statement The Brotherhood she emphasized does not speak for the president he has resigned from the Brotherhood but remains a member of its political party Does any statement issued by any political party or group represent the presidency she asked Its not the presidencys institution and its not an official entity The Egyptian government she said is working with all its powers and policies to stop all forms of violence against women The government objected to the United Nations declaration condemning violence against women she said only over issues like whether to describe restrictions on abortion as an act of violence against women That offended the cultural norms in many Arab and African countries she said Asked about the statements apparent attempt to shield marital rape from legal prosecution Ms Sharkawy brushed off the issue as an irrelevant foreign concern Marital rape Is this a big problem that we have she said suggesting that it might be a Western phenomenon while sexual harassment in the streets was a far greater concern in Egypt Should we import their concerns and problems and adopt them as ours she asked Were talking about things that arent widely agreed upon like abortion We cant give women the freedom to have abortions whenever they want Do not pick issues not pressing in Egypt she said and then tell me that Im in a conflict with the international community Some Egyptian feminists though called the statement a vindication of their warnings that the Brotherhood might lead Egypt in a more conservative and patriarchal direction They do not believe that when domestic violence is present the women should resort to the justice system or the legal process said Ghada Shahbandar of the Egyptian Organization for Human Rights It should be kept at home and under the protection of the family  that is their claim And there is no such thing as marital rape because a husband is entitled to have sex with his wife any time that he wants This is the first time we have heard it said publicly on the world stage she said but this has been in their rhetoric for ages In his seminar for prospective Islamist marriage counselors Mr Abu Salama justified the groups approach to marriage by explaining that Islam also required husbands to be compassionate just as it required women to be obedient Quoting Muhammads injunction that a man must not fall on his wife like an animal a textbook in Mr Abu Salamas class said Islam instructed men to engage in foreplay before sex and attend to their partners satisfaction As for inheritance Islamic scholars have argued that a son should have a greater share but also an obligation to look after the financial wellbeing of a sister But Mr Abu Salama also argued that husbands should keep their wives under tight control Its the nature of the weak to overstep the required framework if she is given the space and the freedom like children he said in the seminar Most of the women nodded in agreement Closing its statement on the proposed United Nations declaration the Brotherhood appeared to go even further The provisions discussed are destructive tools meant to undermine the family as an important institution the statement concluded and would drag society back to preIslamic ignorance

Bill in North Dakota Bans Abortion After Heartbeat Is Found,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/16/us/north-dakota-approves-bill-to-ban-abortions-after-heartbeat-is-found.html,Little more than a week after Arkansas adopted the countrys most stringent abortion limits banning the procedure at 12 weeks of pregnancy the North Dakota Legislature on Friday passed a more restrictive bill that would ban most abortions as early as 6 weeks into pregnancy The Legislature which is dominated by Republicans also passed a second measure that would ban abortions sought because of a genetic abnormality or to select the sex of the child Both bills must be signed by Gov Jack Dalrymple a Republican to become law As of Friday afternoon the governor had not said whether he would do so No other state has barred abortions because of evidence that a fetus has a genetic defect like Down syndrome which rises in incidence with maternal age leading many pregnant women to seek tests for the disorder Pennsylvania Oklahoma and Arizona have all banned abortions for the purpose of gender selection National abortion rights groups including the Center for Reproductive Rights Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union condemned the measures that passed the North Dakota Senate on Friday after previous approval by the House These groups warned that if adopted both measures would be declared unconstitutional by federal courts Under Supreme Court rulings women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb generally around 24 weeks into pregnancy We urge the governor to veto all of these bills to ensure that this personal and private decision can be made by a woman and her family not politicians sitting in the Capitol said Jennifer Dalven the director of the ACLUs Reproductive Freedom Project One of the newly passed North Dakota bills outlaws abortions when a fetal heartbeat is detectable using standard medical practice Heartbeats are often detectable at about 6 weeks using an intrusive transvaginal ultrasound or at about 10 to 12 weeks when using abdominal ultrasounds The bill does not specify a time threshold or whether doctors with a patient in the initial weeks of pregnancy must use the transvaginal probe A proposed law in Virginia last year that would have required use of the transvaginal ultrasound caused a national outcry and the bill was ultimately shelved Arkansas declared a 12week limit specifically to avoid that controversy But some experts said that doctors in North Dakota which has only one clinic performing abortions in Fargo could face prosecution if they did not use the vaginal ultrasound when necessary to detect a heartbeat Doctors who knowingly perform abortions in violation of the measure if it is adopted could be charged with a felony that carries a fiveyear prison sentence the patients would not face criminal charges The law makes exceptions for abortion to save the life of the mother or for other severe medical emergencies but not in cases of rape or incest In 2011 according to state data 1247 abortions were performed in North Dakota If the ban becomes law more than 75 percent of the procedures could be outlawed according to Elizabeth Nash a state issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute in Washington a research group that supports abortion rights The early abortion ban was sponsored by Representative Bette Grande a Republican from Fargo  A heartbeat is accepted by everyone as a sign of life she said in a blog posting on Tuesday as she argued that it was time for the Supreme Court to revisit the definition of viability
Cruelty to Women Overseas,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/18/opinion/abortion-and-women-overseas.html,Each year some 47000 women around the world die as a result of unsafe abortions Efforts to reduce that toll are severely hampered by the Helms amendment which was originally enacted in 1973 and restricts the use of United States foreign aid money to finance abortions overseas even in places where abortion is legal President Obama can significantly reduce the harm by directing the State Department and the United States Agency for International Development to reject a longstanding misinterpretation of the amendment under which aid cannot be used to help women whose lives are endangered or in cases of rape or incest According to the amendment foreign assistance money may not be used to pay for the performance of abortion as a method of family planning or to motivate or coerce any person to practice abortions That wording plainly excludes cases of life endangerment incest and rape  Providing abortions to women and girls subjected to rape as a weapon of armed conflict obviously has nothing to do with planning family Yet this has not stopped successive Republican and Democratic administrations from treating the amendment as an absolute abortion ban The misinterpretation has also prevented foreign aid recipients from offering abortion information even though a separate 1994 amendment makes clear that providing information does not amount to improper coercion There is a strong case to be made that the current reading of the amendment violates Article 3 of the Geneva Conventions which entitles all victims of armed conflict including rape victims to complete and nondiscriminatory medical treatment like access to abortions  Antiabortion zealots in Congress may oppose a change in the implementation of the Helms amendment but virtually every federal abortion policy includes exceptions for life endangerment incest and rape Mr Obama has room under the law to abide by the amendment in a way that is true to its wording more humane and consistent with his own ideals He should use it
"After Frosty Past, Pope Meets Argentine Leader",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/world/europe/francis-to-meet-argentine-leader-after-frosty-ties.html,VATICAN CITY  A day before his formal installation Pope Francis met privately on Monday with Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner the president of his native Argentina with whom he had clashed over social issues like Argentinas legalization of samesex marriage The two met for 15 minutes of private conversation before having lunch together the Vatican said It did not issue a statement but in a news conference later in Rome Mrs Kirchner said she had found the pope the former Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio of Buenos Aires calm confident and at peace tranquil I could also say that he is occupied and concerned about the immense task not only to govern Vatican City State but to change things that he knows need to change she added She also said she had asked Francis to intervene in the dispute over the Falkland Islands which Argentina claims as its own but whose residents just voted to remain part of Britain  For many years the relationship between Francis and Mrs Kirchner has been depicted as mutually hostile as it was between him and her husband and predecessor Nstor Kirchner who died in 2010 Underlying the strains have been accusations  dismissed by the Vatican  of complicity between the church in Argentina and the military dictatorship of the 1970s and early 1980s in the socalled Dirty War when as many as 30000 people are thought to have been killed or disappeared As the leader of Argentinas Jesuits for part of that time Cardinal Bergoglio repeatedly disputed claims that he allowed the kidnapping of two priests in his order in 1976 accusations that the Vatican is calling a defamation campaign But the tensions sharpened more recently over doctrinal issues that reflect Francis deep conservatism on the social issues that often divide Catholics Francis has been  and remains  a staunch supporter of the Vaticans positions on abortion the ordination of women samesex marriage adoption by gay couples and other major issues In 2010 he described a governmentsupported law in Argentina to legalize marriage and adoption by samesex couples as a war against God and a maneuver by the devil At the time Mrs Kirchner called his position medieval The Vatican said representatives of 132 countries and international organizations were expected to attend the installation Mass on Tuesday One who is raising eyebrows is Robert G Mugabe the autocratic president of Zimbabwe He is the subject of a travel ban by European countries because of Zimbabwes human rights record but exemptions allow him to travel to Vatican City which is encircled by Italian territory and to United Nations gatherings The Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi said the Vatican does not issue invitations Those who wish to come can he said No one is refused No one is invited We welcome those who want to come Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr who is Catholic will represent the United States at the Mass The delegation also includes Gov Susana Martinez of New Mexico Representative Nancy Pelosi of California the Democratic leader in the House and John J DeGioia the president of Georgetown University a Jesuit institution  Francis is the first Jesuit pope and the first pope from Latin America  At the installation Mass Francis is expected to receive the fishermans ring which recalls how St Peter fished for food and later for souls and the pallium a white woolen vestment that symbolizes the role of the pope as a good shepherd The ring was made from goldplated silver by an Italian jeweler Enrico Manfrini
Abortion Doctorâ€™s Murder Trial Opens,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/19/us/philadelphia-abortion-doctors-murder-trial-opens.html,PHILADELPHIA  In opening statements in court on Monday prosecutors charged that a doctor who operated a womens health clinic here killed seven viable fetuses by plunging scissors into their necks and snipping their spinal cords and was also responsible for the death of a pregnant woman in his care  The physician Dr Kermit Gosnell 72 is charged with seven counts of firstdegree murder as well as multiple counts of conspiracy criminal solicitation and violation of a state law that forbids abortions after the 24th week of pregnancy Dr Gosnell had operated the Womens Medical Society in West Philadelphia More than two years after he was arrested and the clinic was shut down and 14 months after a grand jury report described the charges against him Dr Gosnell appeared in Common Pleas Court on Monday to face a trial that could result in the death penalty if he is found guilty His lawyer Jack J McMahon described Dr Gosnell as dedicated to treating the poor and accused prosecutors of racism  a prosecutorial lynching of his client who is black Its an elitist racist prosecution Mr McMahon said This black man is being taken because of who he is and where he works One of the prosecutors Joanne Pescatore an assistant district attorney told the court that Dr Gosnell routinely performed illegal lateterm abortions killing the seven fetuses in operations that would have caused the infants pain If the baby is alive and you dont want it to be that doesnt mean you have the right to take a pair of scissors and plunge it into the babys neck Ms Pescatore told the jury during opening arguments of a trial that is expected to continue for four to six weeks She also accused Dr Gosnell of falsifying clinic records to show that no abortions had been performed beyond the legal limit of 245 weeks of pregnancy and of storing fetal remains throughout the clinic including 20 to 30 jars containing only their feet Disturbing thats an understatement Ms Pescatore said as Dr Gosnell wearing a dark suit and taking notes on a yellow legal pad listened from the defense table Was he keeping trophies for what he had done Prosecutors have also accused nine of Dr Gosnells staff members with violating abortion laws perjury and other charges All but one  including the doctors wife Pearl Gosnell  have pleaded guilty Ms Pescatore said that Dr Gosnell had performed many abortions in unsafe and unsanitary conditions including using unqualified assistants She said that as a result of financial motivations the clinic had taken in many women who were beyond the legal abortion limit in their pregnancy If they were far along that didnt matter Ms Pescatore said They made more money for him Among the patients was Karnamaya Mongar a 41yearold Bhutanese woman with three children who had gone to Dr Gosnell seeking an abortion in her 19th week of pregnancy four months after arriving in the United States from a refugee camp in Nepal Dr Gosnells staff gave Ms Mongar a painkilling drug during her labor Ms Pescatore said but the patient reacted badly and died after being taken to a nearby hospital The prosecutor blamed the doctor for the death Mr McMahon said the prosecution was trying to manipulate the jurys emotions by leveling charges that he said would not be supported by the facts during the trial The defense lawyer said that there was scientific evidence on the viability of only two of the seven fetuses Dr Gosnell is accused of killing and that claims that the other five were viable were based on verbal reports by clinic staff members that the fetuses had been moving after they were aborted In fact neither of the two fetuses was born alive Mr McMahon said He promised jurors that assertion would be confirmed by the mother of Baby A who is to testify during the trial As for Baby B he said postmortem tests on its lungs showed that they were never aerated indicating that the child was born dead Rebutting prosecution claims that Dr Gosnell was profiting from the desperation of poor women Mr McMahon said his client had passed up lucrative positions in obstetrics and gynecology so that he could provide an essential service in West Philadelphia where he performed more than 16000 abortions over 31 years
Philippine Court Delays Law on Free Contraceptives for Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/world/asia/philippine-court-delays-free-contraceptives-law.html,MANILA  The Philippine Supreme Court on Tuesday temporarily halted a landmark law that would provide free contraception to poor women In a 10to5 ruling the court froze for 120 days when the law could take effect It was passed in December after a ferocious national debate that pitted the Roman Catholic Church against the countrys president Benigno S Aquino III Supporters and opponents of the legislation will argue their cases before the Supreme Court on June 18 said a court spokesman Theodore Te He added that the ruling on Tuesday did not reflect on the merits of either side The decision indicates that the Supreme Court is seriously considering the more than half a dozen petitions filed against the law said Harry Roque a constitutional expert with the University of the Philippines That does not necessarily mean the measure is likely to be ruled unconstitutional he added The Supreme Court has previously delayed laws that it later validated The law will be carefully examined in court as it was when it was debated in Congress Mr Roque said Birth control is legal and widely available in the Philippines but it is out of the reach of many poor women and those living in provincial areas The reproductive health bill would provide free or subsidized contraceptives to poor women and would mandate sex education in schools Opponents principally Catholic organizations have argued that the bill promotes a culture of promiscuity that offends the countrys values and would lead to abortion which remains illegal in the Philippines The petitions filed in the Supreme Court argue that the measure violates a clause in the Philippine Constitution that states that no person shall be deprived of life without due process of law The presidential spokesman Edwin Lacierda said Tuesday that the government would defend the bill before the Supreme Court Feliciano Belmonte Jr the speaker of the House of Representatives and a proponent of the measure called the ruling a temporary setback I am hopeful the main issues will be deliberated on so that these can be resolved as soon as possible he said Representative Edcel C Lagman a sponsor of the reproductive health law popularly called the R H law said it did not mandate the use of contraceptives by families opposed to them for religious reasons  The accusation that the R H law is offensive to religious freedom is a patent aberration he said The act is replete with provisions upholding the freedom of religion and respecting religious convictions The bill was scheduled to take effect on March 31 Easter timing that raised more protests from the Catholic Church That was unintended Madeleine R Valera the assistant secretary of the Department of Health told The Philippine Daily Inquirer We really did not see that We were having a hearing when someone pointed it out and we were like OopsÂ  
"For the G.O.P., Itâ€™s Not Just the Message",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/opinion/for-the-gop-its-not-just-the-message.html,The battering that Republican candidates suffered in 2012  particularly among women and minorities  seems finally to have worked its way into the partys cerebral cortex For weeks party leaders like Eric Cantor have talked about broadening the partys appeal and on Monday Reince Priebus the chairman of the Republican National Committee unveiled a lengthy report that took the party to task for alienating large segments of the public The Washington wing of the Republican party is increasingly marginalizing itself the report says making it harder to win future presidential races As the party drives around in an ideological culdesac its public reputation has hit record lows We have become expert in how to provide ideological reinforcement to likeminded people the report says but devastatingly we have lost the ability to be persuasive with or welcoming to those who do not agree with us on every issue This is an encouragingly candid selfassessment on the part of Republican leaders and could be the beginning of the partys return to the mainstream Unfortunately the report seems overly focused on the mechanics of how Republicans should focus their message conveniently ignoring what that message should be And for years the partys message has been the opposite of inclusion driving away the very voters the report seeks to attract The report for example says that Republicans have a lot in common with AfricanAmericans and should hire more black communications directors and make more of an effort to draw black voters It doesnt mention however that Republican lawmakers across the country have avidly passed laws that make it harder for blacks and other minorities to vote as part of an effort to reduce the turnout of Democrats Repudiating these measures should be high on the list of any party that claims to be interested in outreach to minorities It talks about developing a forwardleaning vision for voting Republican that appeals to women without ever using the words abortion or birth control or even hinting that the partys policies on these issues have repelled women by the millions Most significant the report shows no recognition that the Republican goals of shrinking government and lowering taxes for the rich  which have turned particularly malicious during the Tea Party era  have proved brutally unpopular at a time when the recession left more people in need of government assistance than ever The partys job it says is to champion private growth so people will not turn to the government in the first place but the party has never been able to demonstrate how its trickledown agenda of cutting budgets and taxes embodied by the new Paul Ryan House budget would do that The report should be commended for urging more tolerant policies on immigration and gay issues though it is hardly specific But the party will have to move much farther from its extremist tendencies if it hopes to expand its appeal in the long term
Bishops Challenge Cuomo on Stronger Abortion Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/nyregion/bishops-challenge-cuomo-on-stronger-abortion-rights.html,ALBANY  As Roman Catholics worldwide celebrated the inauguration of Pope Francis New York bishops traveled to Albany on Tuesday to meet with Gov Andrew M Cuomo whose looming effort to strengthen abortion rights in the state has met with strong protests from Catholic and evangelical clergy The bishops converged on the Capitol to begin a twoday lobbying trip spearheaded by the New York State Catholic Conference but without their biggest star Cardinal Timothy M Dolan the archbishop of New York and president of the national bishops conference Cardinal Dolan was still in Rome where he had participated in the conclave which elected the new pontiff He did however offer words of encouragement on his blog writing that he was with his brother bishops in spirit as they argued for real choices for pregnant women and girls considering abortion The bishops clearly missed the charismatic presence of Cardinal Dolan whose popularity among the states estimated seven million Catholics makes him powerful in political circles It takes three of us said Bishop Howard J Hubbard of Albany to make up for the cardinal The Catholic delegation would like to convince Mr Cuomo a Democrat to abandon his efforts to rewrite state law to guarantee expansive abortion rights in New York even if Roe v Wade is overturned at the federal level The bishops speaking to reporters after their meeting with the governor said they found ample common ground with him otherwise  including on raising the minimum wage and providing affordable housing and care for the poor  but not on abortion I think we have different perspectives Bishop Hubbard said after emerging from a 45minute discussion in the governors office Hes looking at it from the perspective of the man who has to look at the law of the land and were looking at it from a moral perspective And whether these two can come together remains to be seen The governors proposal which he has said would be called the Reproductive Health Act has not been introduced yet But even without the details it is clear that the governors continued advocacy for abortion rights has put him squarely at odds with the church that he belongs to as has his ardent support for samesex marriage which he signed into law in 2011 That tense relationship sometimes extends beyond social issues the Catholic bishops for instance recently criticized the new gun control law championed by the governor for including funds for school safety only at the states public schools and not at its 550 Catholic schools The bishops hope that Catholic schools will be included in the next state budget which is still being negotiated Bishop Nicholas A DiMarzio of Brooklyn said the bishops supported the gun law more broadly however especially for its ban on the sale of assaultstyle weapons that he said dont belong in anyones hands except the Army Mr Cuomo the father of three daughters has made womens issues a priority in 2013 announcing in his State of the State address in January that it is not a mans world in New York  not anymore As for the meeting Tuesday Matthew Wing a spokesman for the governor said Mr Cuomo always enjoys meeting with the bishops though their agendas differ They agree on some issues  he said And disagree on others Mr Cuomo made news in religious circles last week as well when he praised Pope Francis whom he called inspirational in many ways even as his father Mario and sister Madeline offered criticisms of the new pontiff The bishops said that they agreed with most of the governors 10point Womens Equality Act just not with the implications of its final bullet point Protect a womans freedom of choice Bishop William Murphy of Rockville Centre said the bishops position on abortion is one that they will maintain in this session or any other session
How Viable Is Rand Paul for 2016?,https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/how-viable-is-rand-paul-for-2016/,"Perhaps no Republican has had a better 2013 than Rand Paul the Kentucky senator who drew attention and praise for his talking filibuster                                        against the CIA director nominee John Brennan then last week won the straw poll at the Conservative
                                        Political Action Conference in Washington Then on Tuesday as my colleague Ashley Parker reports
                                        Mr Paul gave a speech to the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce outlining his plan for immigration reform Mr Paul has been fairly explicit about his potential interest in running for the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 so it is
                                        safe to assume that at least some of his actions are colored by his interest in positioning himself for the primaries and caucuses But oddsmakers continue to list Mr Paul as something of a long shot
                                        giving him anywhere from 12to1 to 28to1 odds against winning the nomination Is Mr Paul in fact a viable 2016 contender Or like his father Ron Paul is he someone who might expect to win the enthusiastic support of libertarianleaning GOP voters but who might otherwise fall well short
                                        of winning a plurality or majority of the Republican electorate It might help to step back and consider the Republican primary electorate as a whole The historical norm has been that Republicans are more unified in picking a candidate while Democratic
                                        nominees must struggle to cobble together a winning plurality from among the partys diverse constituencies However it is less clear that this is true today Republicans might not have as much diversity
                                        along racial or demographic lines as Democrats do but there are several ideological constituencies within the party that could make it hard for any candidate to win the nomination by consensus The way that Ive come to think of these Republican voting groups is illustrated in the diagram below which resembles a series of interlocking Olympic rings
                                        The idea is that there are five major constituencies within the party which overlap to varying degrees One group consists of religious conservatives a set of voters that once had tremendous influence in picking the Republican nominee but which have been played a more marginal role in the last two election
                                        cycles In 2008 Mike Huckabee had trouble drawing support beyond this group as did Rick Santorum in 2012 It remains plausible that the GOP nominee in 2016 could rely on religious conservatives as a major
                                        base of support in the primaries while also appealing to other groups within the party  a model that worked successfully for George W Bush in 2000 But if Republicans seek to deemphasize social issues
                                        seeing them as a potential liability in the general election these voters could become more estranged from the rest of the party A Republican nominee could probably not afford for these religious voters to take
                                        an openly hostile attitude toward him but he might hope to appease them rather than expecting their enthusiastic support The next constituency consists of Tea Party conservatives  a group that is much talked about but hard to define There are some significant demographic and attitudinal overlaps                                        between the Tea Party and the religious right in fact one reason the religious right may have become less influential in the Republican Party is because some of those voters have been captured by the Tea Party
                                        movement instead At the same time the Tea Party has placed much more emphasis on economic policy than on social issues The Tea Party also has a complicated relationship with the Republican establishment On the one hand it may have developed in part as a response to the perceived failings of Republicans in Washington and it has produced
                                        frequent confrontations with the Republican establishment over nominations in races for Congress and for states governors Rand Paul who beat out the establishment candidate in his Republican senate primary
                                        in Kentucky with Tea Party backing has been a hero of the Tea Party movement and even delivered their response to President Obamas State of the Union address this year On the other hand some candidates
                                        like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida who once had the blessing of the Tea Party have now become members in good
                                        standing of the Republican establishment Candidates who might seek the nomination with support from the Tea Party wing of the GOP need to toe a fine line between invoking its populist spirit and avoiding being
                                        seen as threatening to other coalitions within the party or to its chances of winning a November election Next are libertarian conservatives  the group that Mr Paul may be most identified with It has become fashionable to apply the term libertarian to almost any group that takes
                                        a more conservative attitude toward fiscal policy than toward social policy and generally takes a noninterventionist view of foreign policy In practice there arent all that many voters and there are
                                        even fewer politicians who take truly liberal stances toward social policy while at the same time holding strongly conservative positions on economics Â and in fact Mr Paul holds quite conservative
                                        stances on some social issues like abortion But there are a substantial number of voters who take very conservative stances on economic policy while holding moderate ones on social policy these voters tend to identify as Republicans
                                        There are also voters who hold very liberal views on cultural issues but who have centrist positions on economic policy These voters may have once have identified as Rockefeller Republicans
                                        but are now more likely to align themselves with independents or Democrats and are unlikely to vote in large numbers in the Republican primaries  In contrast to the libertarian conservatives moderate or reformminded Republicans take some explicitly centrist positions on both economic and social policy This constituency has been diminishing                                        as the Republican party grows more conservative Still there are some moderate Republicans out there and they have not entirely been subsumed by the libertarian wing of the party in the 2012 Ohio Republican primary
                                        for example about 30 percent of voters identified as moderate or liberal but did not vote for Ron Paul while roughly 25 percent did so in Florida As is the case for candidates from the other constituencies those in the GOPs moderate wing must avoid alienating the rest of the party John McCain in 2008 and Mitt Romney in 2012 were able accomplish this
                                        Mr Romney by simply abandoning many of the moderate positions he had once held in Massachusetts and Mr McCain by branding himself as a patriotic maverick at a time of national emergency But other
                                        candidates like Rudolph W Giuliani in 2008 and Jon M Huntsman Jr in 2012 were unable to expand their support beyond the most leftleaning GOP voters and their campaigns ended quickly as a result I would
                                        argue that Chris Christie is on the GiulianiHuntsman trajectory while other candidates like Jeb Bush
                                        the onetime Florida governor might have more success in appealing to both moderate and conservative Republicans in 2016 Last but not least are the establishment Republicans The establishment label has become much maligned at a time when the GOP party brand is unpopular but this remains a highly desirable position
                                        for someone seeking the Republican nomination What defines an establishment Republican As with the other categories this gets tricky A literal definition might be someone who exerts power or authority as a member of the Republican team
                                         as opposed to an outside activist or agitator who is seeking to rebuild the party from its foundations A more pragmatic definition might be someone who is viewed as reliably conservative without being
                                        dangerous or extreme the sweet spot of the most conservative electable candidate Candidates from the establishment wing of the party are natural coalition builders seeking to satisfy or at least pacify the other Republican constituencies As such they have an advantage in the nomination process
                                        which is inherently a coalitionbuilding exercise In addition these candidates potentially have the resources of the party establishment at their disposal including access to cash staff talent and endorsements
                                        from key party officials The political science literature presents good evidence that these factors often precede and predict
                                        popular support They also equip a candidate to survive a prolonged nomination process that might drain the resources of other candidates What are the disadvantages to running as an establishment candidate This positioning does not absolve a candidate of requiring some political dexterity if he is too clumsy in balancing the partys various coalitions
                                        off against one another he may come to be seen as unprincipled Moreover because it is generally desirable to run as the establishment candidate the space is likely to be crowded and competitive a candidate
                                        can run the risk of being everyones second choice and failing to gather any momentum as a result a fate that befell Gov Tim Pawlenty of Minnesota                                        in 2011 As the nomination process evolves the candidates will hope to expand beyond their natural base of support into the neighboring constituencies As I mentioned for example Jeb Bush might seek to win the support of
                                        both establishment Republicans and the partys moderate wing  or Mr Rubio might hope to win the support of the establishment Republicans and the Tea Party Other coalitions  those that do
                                        not overlap on the diagram  are unlikely to make for natural pairings For instance it is hard to conceive of a candidate who would simultaneously be the ideal choice for both moderate Republicans and the
                                        religious right A candidate becomes a cinch to win the nomination if he wins the support of three of the five coalitions a majority However two of the five may also suffice if no other candidate can build support outside his group
                                        In 2012 for example Mr Romney often lacked the support of the religious right who preferred Mr Santorum libertarians who preferred Ron Paul and Tea Party Republicans who flirted with various alternatives
                                        But he cleared the field of moderate candidates and of other candidates who were acceptable to the GOP establishment and won the nomination as a result As for Rand Paul he begins with one significant advantage he is unlikely to be challenged for the loyalty of GOPs libertarian wing This is not to say that there is nothing a libertarian might find fault
                                        with in Mr Paul his position on samesex marriage for instance is
                                        unlikely to be deemed acceptable by leftleaning libertarians But the types of libertarians who vote in the Republican primary are a more conservative group and are unlikely to find any better alternatives particularly
                                        given that most politicians in both parties behave as though social issues economic issues and foreign affairs all exist within a single ideological dimension What we may be witnessing then is an effort for Mr Paul to expand his support into some of the other Republican constituencies His recent call for immigration reform for instance while compatible with his libertarian
                                        principles could also appeal to voters from the GOPs moderate wing In contrast it might be less helpful with the Tea Party voters whose support he will hope to win  Unlike some insurgent candidates of the past Mr Paul seems interested in participating in the invisible primary a process that is traditionally associated with establishment candidates
                                        He will be the headline speaker at Mays Lincoln Dinner hosted by the Republican Party of Iowa
                                        for example just the sort of thing that might help him to win some key endorsements there three years from now Mr Paul is also sure to get his share of pushback from establishment Republicans Mr McCain for example criticized his recent filibuster But Mr Paul at least seems to demonstrate the interest in expanding his support beyond libertarian conservatives something his father rarely did and he will have three years to experiment with how to find the right
                                        formula That doesnt make him as likely a nominee as a more traditional candidate like Mr Rubio Jeb Bush or Representative Paul D Ryan of Wisconsin But his odds look better than the 20to1 numbers that
                                        some bookmakers have placed against him"
Young Opponents of Gay Marriage Undaunted by Battle Ahead,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/21/us/politics/young-opponents-of-gay-marriage-remain-undaunted.html,WASHINGTON  They hear that their cause is lost that demographics and the march of history have doomed their campaign to keep marriage only between a man and a woman But the young conservatives who oppose samesex marriage  unlike most of their generation  remain undaunted They identify themselves as part of the promarriage movement and see themselves at the beginning of a long political struggle much like the battle over abortion If they can begin shifting the terms of the debate away from gay rights and toward the meaning of marriage they say they have a chance to survive shortterm defeats The primary challenge that our side faces right now is the intense social pressure said Joseph Backholm 34 the executive director of the Family Policy Institute of Washington To the extent that the other side is able to frame this as a vote for gay people to be happy it will be challenging for us To put it another way opponents of samesex marriage say they must argue in favor of traditional marriage not against gay people or gay rights Its really a broader defense of marriage and a stronger marriage culture said Will Haun 26 a lawyer and member of the Federalist Society In the highestprofile effort the National Organization for Marriage is gearing up for a march on the National Mall on Tuesday the day the Supreme Court is scheduled to hear arguments on Californias 2008 voterapproved ban on samesex marriage Last week the Heritage Foundation released a report by Ryan T Anderson 31 in defense of traditional marriage Marriage What It Is Why It Matters and the Consequences of Redefining It Mr Anderson a Heritage Foundation fellow has also held briefings for members of Congress their staff members and others to explain his arguments against samesex marriage and he and two coauthors released a book last year laying out their case in depth Still the fight is shaping up to be a difficult one with public opinion increasingly seeming to shift in favor of samesex marriage More than 100 highprofile Republicans recently filed a brief urging the Supreme Court to declare that gay couples have a constitutional right to marry On Friday Senator Rob Portman of Ohio became the only sitting Republican senator to publicly support samesex marriage citing his 21yearold gay son Will as the catalyst Beyond Washington polling has begun to show that a majority of Americans supports samesex marriage with even young Republicans moving in that direction  In a New York TimesCBS News poll conducted last month 45 percent of Republicans between 18 and 44 years old said they thought samesex couples should be able to marry  a contrast with Republicans 45 and older only 20 percent of whom agreed After repeated defeats at the ballot box in recent years samesex marriage went four for four in statewide votes in November with victories in Maine Maryland Minnesota and Washington Proponents of samesex marriage have done a fantastic job of telling the story of samesex marriage through music and television and film said Eric Teetsel 29 the executive director of the Manhattan Declaration which describes itself as a movement of Christians for life marriage and religious freedom I think its really a case where once they hear the other side of the issue and really think about it deeply were going to win a lot of those folks back And the other side of the issue  the case for what proponents call traditional marriage  is simple they say In redefining marriage to include samesex couples what youre doing is youre excluding the norm of sexual complementarity said Mr Anderson the Heritage Foundation fellow Once you exclude that norm the three other norms  which are monogamy sexual exclusivity and permanency  become optional as well The result proponents of traditional marriage say would be further rises in divorce rates and outofwedlock births When you delink marriage from childbearing you then have to increase the complexity of that relationship said Caitlin Seery 25 the director of programs for the Love and Fidelity Network which works with college groups to advocate traditional marriage Proponents of samesex marriage respond that no evidence links it to social ills and that in fact divorce rates are often lower in states more accepting of it Moreover they say samesex marriage fits with this countrys long history of extending equal rights to groups once denied them For opponents moving the debate away from those historical analogies is crucial Most young people think if you come out with traditional marriage views youre a bigot said Thomas Peters 27 the communications director for the National Organization for Marriage You cant have that many people in the shadows The issue proponents of traditional marriage say is one of presentation These Republicans who are jumping ship are doing so because we have no way of messaging said Ashley Pratte 23 the executive director of Cornerstone Policy Research and Cornerstone Action a New Hampshire group that focuses on social issues Do you want to tell your friends when youre out with them on a Friday night that they cant get married No you dont want to have that discussion but you want to have a healthy discussion Opponents of samesex marriage say they realize they may lose the current fight but they optimistically take the long view pointing to Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court case that legalized abortion At the time they say opponents of abortion were told their cause was lost but the fight continues 40 years later If you take the longer view of history  Im not talking just 15 years Im talking 40 years or even 100 years  I cant help but think that the uniqueness of manwoman marriage will be adjudicated over time said Andrew T Walker 27 a policy analyst at the Heritage Foundation Either way they are not planning on giving up any time soon Even if we are doomed and Im totally nave I think its important that I do this work anyway said Mr Teetsel of the Manhattan Declaration If what I believe is true is true then Ive got a responsibility to be on its side for as long as I can be
The Republican Autopsy Report,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/20/the-republican-autopsy-report/,"On Monday a Republican task force released a remarkably hardheaded diagnosis of the partys many liabilities its ideological rigidity its preference for the rich

                                        National Committee The GOP report is an extraordinary public acknowledgment of internal discord and vulnerability which has intensified the battle between the deeply committed conservative wing and the more
                                        pragmatic probusiness wing for control of the Republican Party With just a few exceptions it does not mince words
                                         At the federal level it says the party is marginalizing itself and in the absence of major change it will be increasingly difficult for Republicans

                                        is doing great harm Formerly loyal voters gathered in focus groups describe Republicans as  scary narrowminded and out of touch and that we were

                                        immigration reform In an equally radical challenge to Republican orthodoxy the Priebus report states We have to blow the whistle at corporate malfeasance and attack corporate welfare We should speak out when a company liquidates itself and its executives receive bonuses but rankandfile workers are left unemployed
                                            We should speak out when CEOs receive tens of millions of dollars in retirement packages but middleclass workers have not had a meaningful raise in years The report also warns that Republicans need to mute if not silence antigay rhetoric if they are to have any chance of regaining support among voters under the age of 30 For the GOP to appeal to younger voters we do not have to agree on every issue but we do need to make sure young people do not see the Party as totally intolerant of alternative points of view Already there
                                            is a generational difference within the conservative movement about issues involving the treatment and the rights of gays  and for many younger voters these issues are a gateway into whether the Party
                                            is a place they want to be If our Party is not welcoming and inclusive young people and increasingly other voters will continue to tune us out The Party should be proud of its conservative principles but
                                            just because someone disagrees with us on 20 percent of the issues that does not mean we cannot come together on the rest of the issues where we do agree
                                         This suggests that the issue of samesex marriage is on course to become a source of significant division within the Republican Party as social conservatives view the commitment to marriage as a sacrament between a

                                        Party risked alienating a large block of loyal voters if it moved to the left on samesex marriage Reed argues that opposing samesex marriage is not a liability and that voters are evenly split on the issue according
                                        to exit polls In fact in the 2012 exit polls and in Washington Post polling
                                        a plurality of voters 4946 respondedÂ affirmatively to the question Should samesex marriages be legal in your state The issue has shown steady growth in public support Priebus and the five authors of the report Â Henry Barbour nephew of former RNC chairman Haley Barbour of Mississippi Zori Fonalledas                                        of Puerto Rico and Glenn McCall of South Carolina all members of the RNC along with Sally Bradshaw
                                        an adviser to Jeb Bush and Ari Fleischer former press secretary to George W Bush  were far more blunt in their analysis than many expected There is at least one crucial problem that the authors all members of the establishment wing of the party address only peripherally and with kid gloves the extreme conservatism of the partys primary and caucus
                                        voters  the people who actually pick nominees For over three decades these voters have episodically shown an inclination to go off the deep end and nominate general election losers in House and Senate
                                        races  or in the case of very conservative states and districts general election winners who push the party in the House and Senate to become an instrument of obstruction The highly visible presence of the candidates these voters prefer  recall the partys Senate nominees in Missouri and Indiana Todd Akin and Richard Mourdock and their bizarreÂ views on rape and
                                        abortionÂ  suggests that the Republican Party has a severe if not toxic problem a septic electorate that in the words of the Mayo Clinic
                                        can trigger a cascade of changes that can damage multiple organ systems causing them to fail If that is the case then the task of the Priebus commission should not have been to diagnose the partys problems but to conduct an autopsy Leaving that question aside for a moment lets turn to a part of the report that is tough in its implications but less forcefully put than other sections of the document the difficulties created by super
                                        PACs and other independent expenditure third party groups that have become a major presence in House and Senate elections Without naming
                                        any super PACs the five authors take a hard line against the role of these independent expenditure groups active in Republican primaries No one has a monopoly on knowing who is the best candidate the
                                        electorate ultimately makes the decision The authors agree with the substance of Karl Roves goal in the new Conservative Victory ProjectÂ 
                                        that goal being to weed out marginal candidates in primaries who appeal to the base but alienate swing voters The authors disagree however with the way in which the CVP is going about this task running negative
                                        ads against those likely to carry the party banner down to defeat in November The Growth and Opportunity report is critical of all independent expenditure groups including the antitax Club for Growth that try
                                        to play kingmaker in the candidate selection process Outside groups now play an expanded role affecting federal races and in some ways overshadow state parties in primary and general elections As a result this environment has caused a splintered Congress with
                                            little party cohesion so that gridlock and polarization grow as the political parties lose their ability to rally their elected officeholders around a set of coherent governing policies Campaign finance laws and court rulings restrict megacontributions to the parties while permitting 1 millionplus donations to independent groups including the two other Rove political committees American Crossroads
                                        and Crossroads GPS which the report argues corrupt the political environment The current campaign finance environment has led to a handful of friends and allied groups dominating our sides efforts This is not healthy A lot of centralized authority in the hands of a few people at
                                            these outside organizations is dangerous for our Party In fairness to Rove  a phrase that does not come easily  his agenda does address the issue of a problematic Republican electorate he aims to prevent ideologically driven voters from committing political
                                        suicide dooming the partys chances of winning a Senate majority I called Jonathan Collegio spokesman for the three Rove groups American Crossroads Crossroads GPS and the Conservative Victory Project to see how
                                        Rove and his allies picture this dynamic playing out Collegio explained their thinking We looked at the last two election cycles and came to the conclusion that we lost from four to seven US Senate seats not because of the party message in those cases but because of the partys messenger While claiming that Roves new groupÂ does notÂ have anÂ antiTea Party agenda Collegio said that in the four to seven Senate races that Republicans lost in 2010 and 2012 primaries produced candidates
                                        who were suboptimal not necessarily Tea Party candidates but undisciplined lacking fundraising ability and substandard generally Along the same lines as the Priebus report Collegio cited the 2002 McCainFeingold law which prohibits political parties from accepting large soft
                                        money donations arguing that it undermines the role of the RNC and other official groups in mediating the political process The vacuum created by McCainFeingold served to empower renegade third party
                                        groups one of the many unintended consequences of campaign finance reform The campaign finance reforms of the last decade Collegio told me dramatically weakened political parties and artificially constrained the parties ability to raise large contributions That structural change has the effect of empowering outside groups We are in an era
                                            where power is not centralized in the parties because of campaign reforms of 10 years ago The weakening of the parties in turn makes it harder for party leaders to cut deals on big pieces of legislation because
                                            they dont control the electoral pocketbook the way they used to A rump group of conservatives disputes the RoveCollegio analysis of Republican Senate losses contending that centrist candidates backed by Roves American Crossroads fared far worse than those backed by the
                                        hard right Nineteen conservatives including David Bossie president of Citizens United Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council
                                        and Richard Viguerie chairman of Conservative HQ wrote in a letter                                        to American Crossroads donors who are publicly listed in campaign finance reports to the Federal Election Commission In 2012 the only Senate Republican winners were Jeff Flake Ariz Deb Fischer Neb and Ted Cruz Tex  all of whom enjoyed significant Tea Party and conservative support Meanwhile more moderate
                                            candidates like Tommy Thompson Wisc Heather Wilson N Mex Rick Berg N Dak and Denny Rehberg Mont went down to defeat despite significant support from Crossroads It was firmly expected that Republicans
                                            would capture the Senate in 2012 It is inexcusable that they failed and in fact lost two seats The facts speak for themselves It was not conservatives Not one moderate Republican challenger won According
                                            to the Sunlight Foundation not one Senate challenger supported by Crossroads won There was another equally important reason Republicans fared so poorly Groups like Crossroads squandered hundreds of millions
                                            of dollars in what were arguably the most inept campaign advertising efforts ever
                                         A Republican operative who is a close associate of Rove was more ironic in his criticism of the CVP If I was in a Republican primary and Karl Rove came out against me it would be the single best thing that
                                        could happen to my campaign Further fueling suspicions on the right of an anticonservative vendetta led by Rove and the RNC Rove and party leaders are working together                                        to develop a hightech digital platform designed to facilitate voter and donor contact and to replicate the major advances in digital campaigning                                        achieved by the Obama campaign More broadly the alliance between Rove and the RNC does substantiate the view that establishment forces are driving the reform movement within the Republican Party an establishment that includes much of corporate
                                        America including the Chamber of Commerce the Bush family and its allies and the more moderate traditionalist donor community Conservative analysts like Timothy P Carney of the Washington Examiner and Ramesh Ponnuru of the National Review quickly spotted the establishment tilt in the Priebus report Carney wrote Republican elites tend to favor mass immigration and be ambivalent or supportive of legal abortion and gay marriage So shouldnt we take it with a grain of salt when the Republican leadership puts out a
                                            document saying that the GOP should change only its rhetoric on economic issues but change its substance on social issues Similarly Ponnuru wrote that the recommendations come naturally to Republican elites who are
                                        more likely to favor samesex marriage and comprehensive immigration reform on principle The report reflects elite conventional wisdom perfectly just perfectly In January I pointed out that If the conservative movement continues on its downward trajectory the American business
                                        community which has the most to lose from Republican failure will be the key force arguing for moderation That moment has come The Priebus report and Roves Conservative Victory Project together mark a significant escalation in the battle between the center and the right over the soul of the Republican Party What
                                        has yet to be determined is whether they are fighting over a patient who can be quickly resuscitated or a patient with a chronic but not fatal illness  or a corpse The very bluntness of the Growth and Opportunity report reflects the seriousness of the moment the Republican Party facesÂ increasing difficulty holding on to its House majority weakening prospects of regaining
                                        control of the Senate and the threat of unending Democratic control of the White House"
A Politician From the Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/us/23iht-letter23.html,Cory A Booker is hoping to be the next US senator from New Jersey But the constituency he seems keenest to represent is the future itself Perhaps more than any prominent American politician Mr Booker  the 43yearold Democrat and mayor of the rustcoated luckstarved city of Newark  has cultivated his brand as a leader of by and for a new era He tweets with something approaching the frequency of his own heartbeat so much that his staff calls Twitter his girlfriend He meditates He balances oldschool talk of God with newage ideas of being open to what the universe brings me He champions Big Data and knows how many consumer impressions he got last week He gushes over what may be called the hipster economy using technology to rent out bedrooms borrow vacuum cleaners share cars and raise seed capital Educated at Stanford Oxford and Yale Mr Booker is a model of selfpropelled ascent in a postindustrial city where rises like his have grown ever rarer In conversation he might cite the writers James Baldwin and Langston Hughes Shiva the Hindu god of destruction the business book Built to Last ancient Roman history and an African proverb about going fast alone but far together Owing in part to the gap between his own sophistication and the travails of the city he has led since 2006 he has endured ceaseless speculation about whether Newark is merely a steppingstone Now as he turns his attention to a US Senate race in 2014 the more interesting question may be whether a selfstyled politician from the future can make it to the Washington of right now  and what a city of marble pearls and power ties might make of him Even as the Republican Party undergoes a time of soulsearching selfflagellation and contestation Mr Bookers emergence hints at schisms to come among Democrats He represents the GooglyFacebookish wing of the party  liberal as ever in its views on issues like samesex marriage and abortion rights but more libertarian than the old guard on economics more trusting of markets than unions to improve lives more reliant on the business jargon of synergy and scale than the language of activism and justice Mr Booker sounds like a new kind of Democrat for example when he says that running Newark has made him trust data more than his own liberal principles on the issue of reducing gun violence When the Supreme Court struck down Washingtons gun ban in 2008 Mr Bookers initial reaction was horror To allow handgun sales in an urban area was to tempt disaster Then he sought data from his staff and they challenged him We just did a quick look at all the shootings in my city and saw that nobody who legally went out and bought a handgun was involved in shootings Here I would have gotten emotionally politically charged up about a Supreme Court decision but the data didnt hold that he continued in a recent interview So Ive become much more loyal to big data This is a strain of pragmatism that is different from what President Barack Obama ran on in 2008 It is less about coming together despite our differences less about transcendence and more about thinking the way businesses do doing the right thing where the right thing is defined as what the spreadsheet shows The issue is not finding the answers Mr Booker says Its just growing them to scale On certain issues as when speaking of samesex marriage Mr Bookers language retains the timbre of activism The story of America is this country founded in perfect ideals he said but in a savagely imperfect time The American project in his estimation is to close the gap between ideals and lived reality But when Mr Booker discusses the overwhelmingly poor minority community he serves talk of justice recedes behind talk of creating opportunity He grew most excited in an hourlong conversation about socalled collaborative consumption the spreading practice of renting sharing and bartering things like a bike or a spare bedroom rather than owning them outright Many in government have been wary of services like Airbnb which in allowing people to earn money renting out rooms diverts funds from taxpaying unionized regulated hotels  as do similar services in transportation finance and other spheres But Mr Booker believes such services give the less fortunate the chance to make ends meet without waiting for the return of union jobs that may never come back Its actually helping all of us to enter a world of entrepreneurial interaction in a way that is so democratic he said The mayors enthusiasm is not only a challenge to the regulatory state that his party has long championed It also agitates against the conventional wisdom prevalent on the left that the poor need more protection from capitalism  and not as Mr Booker suggests more access to capitalism While many in his party advocate public works programs and the expansion of social insurance the mayor prefers to speak about technologys helping the poor help themselves People are now given the tools to control their economic destiny he says His own destiny depends on whether such ideas resonate with New Jersey in the here and now  or sound like mere futurology Join an online conversation at httpanandly and follow on Twittercomanandwrites   
Kate Atkinsonâ€™s â€˜Groundhog Dayâ€™ Fiction,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/magazine/kate-atkinsons-groundhog-day-fiction.html,Imagine having the gift or the curse of continually dying and being reborn so that you relive segments of your life again and again differently each time going down various paths and smoothing out rough areas until you get it right and can move on Imagine too that you are not conscious that this is happening but experience it as intermittent dj vu a sometimesinchoate dread an inexplicable compulsion at sudden moments to do one thing rather than another This is not an original artistic conceit obviously A century ago the book Strange Life of Ivan Osokin depicted a young man who is given a chance to relive his life and correct his mistakes in 1902 Moscow And in Groundhog Day Bill Murray is forced to repeat the same wretched day and listen to the same wretched Sonny and Cher song in Punxsutawney Pa until he becomes a better person and wins over Andie MacDowell But in Life After Life her eighth and latest novel the British writer Kate Atkinson has taken these notions  what if practice really did make perfect and what if we really could play out multiple alternate futures  and put them through the Magimix pumped them full of helium added some degrees of difficulty and produced an audacious ambitious book that challenges notions of time fate and free will not to mention narrative plausibility Atkinsons work suffers from a bit of brand confusion which partly explains why it hasnt caught on in the US as it has in Britain She does not write about vampires or werewolves or women exploring their inner goddesses with a little sadomasochistic sex Nor does she continually produce variations on a theme or even variations within a genre Her writing is funny and quirky and sharp and sad  calamity laced with humor  and full of quietly heroic characters who offer knowing Lorrie Mooreesque parenthetical asides I think in brackets I do my own asides to myself Atkinson said She writes critically admired family sagas that are not really family sagas crime novels that are not really crime novels and now in Life After Life to be published in the US next month a sciencefiction novel in the loosest possible sense that is nothing of the sort Atkinsons true genius is structure Her books wend forward and backward follow multiple stories from multiple points of view throw dozens of balls up in the air  but always conclude with loose ends tied up so that everything makes sense Her first novel Behind the Scenes at the Museum published in 1995 intersperses the linear narrative of the heroines life with a series of chapterlong explanatory footnotes that fill in the back stories of various glancingly mentioned relations and events painting an intense portrait of a big messy British family in the first threequarters of the 20th century The book seemingly came from nowhere to win a major literary prize in London instantly establishing Atkinson as a singular voice while generating grumbling among more established male writers The novel also displayed what have become staples of her work big complicated plots and joyful experimentation with form One of Atkinsons novels has three different beginnings Another set over three days has four main characters A protagonist in another spends a good portion of the book in a coma Atkinson cannot really articulate how she creates these elaborate structures Although she used a Moleskine storyboard to keep track of the acrobatic chronology in Life After Life she generally does not formally map out her plots Instead many of her books start as ideas or as challenges to herself  characters or thoughts that dare her to put them in stories Sometimes they begin with the title itself as in Started Early Took My Dog 2011 which came from an Emily Dickinson poem and which required only that she include a dog and make her hero a Dickinson fan With Life After Life Atkinson knew she wanted to write about the London Blitz but she also wanted to experiment with a protagonist who constantly dies and is reborn and she wanted to examine whether someone in that predicament could actually alter the course of history Could her heroine  brave tragic Ursula Todd born in 1910 to an ordinary family in an ordinary English county  somehow stop World War II In the process Life After Life takes the concept of alternate universes and lets it run riot Characters die in some sections survive in others In one chapter Ursula is raped becomes pregnant has an abortion and disgraced marries an abusive monster of a man in another she shoves the rapist into the bushes embarks on an important government job and has an affair with a senior government official In yet more versions she lives with her married lover or moves to Berlin marries and has a child with a German man or stays in London remains childless and helps dig bodies out of the Blitz rubble Each version is entirely and equally credible In this way Atkinson gets to indulge in what might be the ultimate novelists fantasy producing a neverending story in which any past any future even any present is possible By leaving things openended she offers herself the chance to erase and restore and rewrite and then try it all over again Its easy to see why Atkinson with her capacity to play out narratives as 3D chess games finds the prospect so alluring After all for her nothing is really as simple it seems Atkinson lives in Edinburgh well away from Londons bookparty circuit and sharpclawed literary scene She does not hang out with other novelists except Ali Smith her best friend who lives in Cambridge She is extremely private She had two husbands early on but is not married now and does not like to talk much about her living arrangements except to say that she spends a lot of time with her two adult daughters and her grandchildren She refused apologetically to discuss even where her house is We met at the Palm Court at the Balmoral a fancy hotel downtown where we ordered cups of coffee and split a cheese sandwich Atkinson 61 is small and girlish with a mobile quizzical face and a tendency to talk quickly and let her sentences drift off into laughter Her blondish hair is piled messily onto her head and kept back with a pair of glasses Her accent is difficult to parse  there are Scottish inflections but also traces of Yorkshire where she grew up And to this day she remains wary of the news media She rarely gives interviews to British reporters after what happened to her in 1996 when Behind the Scenes at the Museum unexpectedly won the Whitbread Book of the Year prize in London It was a great upset and such was the blow to the fragile egos of some male writers that they practically collapsed onto their fainting couches in shock Several expressed incredulity that a womans book like Behind the Scenes written by a 44yearold firsttime novelist could have beaten Salman Rushdies clearly superior Moors Last Sigh And since Atkinson had mentioned to her publisher that she worked as a chambermaid during college the London papers went for the unknown chambermaid wins prize angle Even those who praised her seemed to do it backhandedly I dont know if Kate Atkinson knows she was being very postmodern Richard Hoggart chairman of the judges declared I spent four years doing a doctorate in postmodern American literature Atkinson said as she sipped her coffee amused but still irritated even after all this time I can recognize it when I see it Atkinsons life has its own postmodern aspects which she looks at with a novelists eye She was born in York to parents who grew up poor but bettered themselves with a successful medicalsupplies shop One turning point in her own life came when Atkinson got a B instead of an A on her final highschool history paper which caused her to lose out on her firstchoice college the University of Aberdeen which meant she went instead to the University of Dundee which meant she met her two husbands there which meant she had her two daughters Another occurred when because of the antipathy between her adviser and her department head she said she failed the oral part of her doctoral thesis on the topic of postmodern American short stories which caused her to abandon academia and take up fiction It was some years after college that she began to write professionally A single mother with two young children she earned money various ways including as a tutor at Dundee and a home aide for elderly people most of them women the men were all dead basically She formed a housework cooperative with some friends and wrote short stories about love romance adoption for womens magazines It taught me to write she said You have to have everything  character plot resolution a beginning middle and end You have to have your own voice You learn how to turn a story around on a sixpence In 1993 a story that would eventually become a chapter in Behind the Scenes at the Museum was named first runnerup in a shortstory competition I went to the prize ceremony and took my friend Maureen with me and said We have to find an agent  Atkinson recalled This woman came up and said Do you have a novel in the drawer and I said Ive got a few chapters and I sent them to her The agent sent them to publishers an auction ensued and Atkinson ended up getting a twobook deal I thought Really Just like that She bought a new sofa and devoted herself to writing Atkinsons prose and experimental plots  featuring orphans parents harboring shameful secrets and people haunted by longago events no one will explain  are informed by books she admires Alice in Wonderland SlaughterhouseFive Tristram Shandy and the works of Donald Barthelme and Jane Austen but also by the mysteries in her family history Her paternal grandfather died in a colliery explosion in 1931 and her father was given up by his young parents and raised until he was 9 by his grandmother His many siblings did not even know he existed until she died falling off a table while changing flypaper and he showed up at the familys door announcing Im your brother Jack to the astonished multitudes When Atkinson applied for a passport at age 30 she inadvertently discovered that her parents were not married when she was born and that her mother had a previous husband something of a scandal in 1950s England She confronted her mother It was during the royal wedding of Charles and Diana and I was sitting with a baby on my knee she recalled I thought Ill just be casual and I said Oh you never told me you were married before I thought it was a good offhand conversational way to introduce that I was illegitimate Atkinsons mothers response could have come from one of her books She turned to me and said I was going to tell you but you left the room  And that was it They came from a generation where nobody talked about their past The awkward reality under the carefully arranged facade is a theme that Atkinson often returns to in her plots The title for Behind the Scenes at the Museum came to her after she dreamed about walking around the York Castle Museum looking at exhibits representing Britain at different points in its history I woke up and thought This is what this book is about she said behind the scenes at the museum Part of the pleasure and the difficulty of Life After Life is that you invest fully in each narrative and feel disoriented and sometimes bereft also sometimes relieved when time and again you are reminded that you have to start over It feels a bit like reading Italo Calvinos mindbending If on a Winters Night a Traveler which serves up story after tantalizing story but leaves out their endings It also feels like Ian McEwans Atonement and that sickening moment when it becomes clear  do not read the rest of this sentence if you still want to read that book  that the middle section was invented by the books main character a novelist herself and that it never happened I dont want to spoil the magic Atkinson said of her ability to create the characters in these multiple realities but its a very curious thing that honestly baffles me Its the nearest well ever get to playing God to suddenly produce these fully formed creatures It is a bit odd Other aspects you work out more  you rework sentences you rework imagery But not characters Theyre not deciding their own fates clearly but once you have them that unconscious process is at work Over sandwiches however Atkinson talked about her characters as means to an end as if they were pawns in a board game She writes about families she said not because she is preoccupied with domestic drama far from it but because it gives you a very handy cast of characters Anything can become a story she said Then she put down her coffee and looked out on the Balmorals tearoom and riffed about how she could set a novel here or across the street or anywhere as long as there was an excuse for her characters to be there Similarly she said that Jackson Brodie her recurring magnetfortrouble detective was also a very handy device Atkinson mentioned casually that she had moved on from Brodie anyway that his eventual fate was not so important to her Ive finished with him for a while she said Hes having a really good holiday somewhere I started to feel sad that Brodie  a character so vivid and deeply sympathetic  could be dismissed so easily But it must be annoying to have readers banging on about your characters as if they were real people especially when your imagination is always full of other characters and other situations beyond the ones youve already written Stephen King who declared Atkinsons Case Histories to be the best mystery of the decade likes to speak of the boys in the basement the unconscious forces at work even when he is not actually writing Atkinson has her own version I think of it like a pan at the back of a stove simmering away she said I always have books backing up I imagine airplanes queuing on the runway There are three at the moment One isnt working so well just ignore that she said The second which is to be called Death at the Sign of the Rook is a homage to Agatha Christie set at a countryhouse hotel hosting a murdermystery weekend where the guests are stranded by a snowstorm As of now at least its not going to be a crime novel with bodies littering the whole place she said but rather something amusing with characters who appear to be stock characters  the military man the vicar  but who really arent The third novel A God in Ruins the title comes from Emerson is a sequel or a companion to Life After Life It is to star Ursulas brother Teddy who dies in a bombing raid in one section of Life After Life but survives in the final one She is considering starting A God in Ruins at Teddys eventual deathbed late in the 20th century and then moving chronologically backward As we sat there Atkinson started essentially writing the next book  or what might be the next book  out loud right in front of me For one thing she said forget the notion that Teddy is safe Hes still a victim of history she said The next time Ursulas born Teddy might die Anything might happen She has also been thinking about his wife the lovely and sympathetic Nancy who dies a few times early on in Life After Life but is herself eventually saved by one of Ursulas intuitive interventions I think Nancys doomed she said suddenly Im thinking that quite early on in the marriage shes killed by the crazy guy who strangles her This is all quite arbitrary she admitted It might be more interesting for them to have to endure a marriage and see what happens But I dont know If she had her way she said all her books would have endless permutations with characters going down multiple paths You never finish with something really she said After Atkinson left the hotel and returned home wherever that is I found myself continuing to worry about her seemingly aloof attitude toward characters like Jackson Brodie Then I remembered something she mentioned in passing  that her plots are influenced by the fairy tales she grew up on stories that are logically preposterous but have very structured moral universes So I went back to my notes to find what she said and I felt relieved The legacy of the fairy story in my brain is that everything will work out Atkinson had said In fiction it would be very hard for me as a writer to give a bad ending to a good character or give a good ending to a bad character Thats probably not a very postmodern thing to say
Ready to Fight Gay Marriage at Court Door,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/us/politics/brian-brown-fights-same-sex-marriage-with-zeal-and-strategy.html,WASHINGTON  As gay couples fight for the right to wed a littleknown but determined force is working to stop them Brian S Brown a 39yearold father of eight who has raised millions of dollars from religious conservatives  especially his fellow Roman Catholics  to become the nations leading opponent of samesex marriage Mr Brown president of the nonprofit National Organization for Marriage here was instrumental in passing Proposition 8 Californias samesex marriage ban and is working in a host of states and recently in France to defeat gayfriendly candidates and outlaw what he calls the redefinition of marriage Now his views are facing the ultimate American test a hearing before the Supreme Court which is considering whether to overturn Proposition 8 and perhaps declare it unconstitutional When the justices hear oral arguments in the case on Tuesday Mr Brown  unfazed by polls showing that a majority of Americans disagree with him  will be on the courts marble steps leading a march that he hopes will draw thousands who believe as he does that gay unions hurt children and threaten religious freedom The notion that somehow we are on a oneway elevator to gay marriage and that no matter what anyone does that its going to happen is false he said in an interview in his sparsely decorated suite on K Street the capitals lobbying corridor That is the myth of inevitability A California native he grew up sneaking his surfboard into the pristine stretch of private coastline known as Hollister Ranch near Santa Barbara Mr Brown has an open face and an easy laugh that belie his status as a divisive figure in the culture wars Raised a Quaker he converted to Catholicism as an adult with a passion for traditional marriage that he says is rooted in his faith As he said in a debate with Dan Savage a gay columnist last summer The notion of the uniqueness of men and women is not some side thing in Scripture its a key part of our view of humanity that there are two halves of humanity male and female and that we complement each other and that complementarity bears fruit in children Frank Schubert the marriage organizations national political director said He has a converts zeal Mr Brown also has a keen sense of strategy and a polished speaking style traits that unnerve his opponents When gay rights advocates began calling samesex marriage a civil rights issue Mr Brown determined to keep the racial analogy from seeping into popular culture enlisted black pastors to his cause In public appearances and on television he rarely comes across as a renegade although his tone can grow strident when the audience is familiar When you knock over a core pillar of society like marriage and then try to redefine biblical views of marriage as bigotry there will be consequences Mr Brown warned last August in a fundraising letter Will one of the consequences be a serious push to normalize pedophilia Conservative Christian groups have thrown their weight behind Mr Browns work The Knights of Columbus a Catholic fraternal organization donated about 2 million to help get the National Organization for Marriage started Mormons contributed heavily to the Proposition 8 campaign and Bishop Salvatore J Cordileone now archbishop of San Francisco raised money to put the initiative on the ballot In an interview the archbishop said Mr Brown understands that civilization rises and falls on marriage But gay rights advocates see Mr Brown as the personification of evil a man who traffics in distortions and smears with a smile The Southern Poverty Law Center which fights intolerance says the National Organization for Marriage pushes the line of being labeled a hate group because it continues to spread lies about gays and uses its Web site to link to debunked research The Human Rights Campaign an advocacy group devotes a portion of its Web site headlined NOM Exposed to tracking Mr Brown and his group Even Governor Wallace in the end came around said Chad Griffin the Human Rights Campaign president referring to George Wallace the segregationist Alabama governor Mr Brown grew up in Whittier Calif a town with a Quaker background on the border of Los Angeles and Orange Counties the son of an accountant and a homemaker who split when he was 13 Maggie Gallagher his predecessor as the marriage organizations president and the author of a book about the dangers of divorce said that Mr Brown shares a lot of characteristics of children of divorce who as adults make a really firm commitment to do something different for their children Mr Brown played football ran the Republican Club and was president of the student body at Whittier College where he threw himself into the history of conservative political thought and read theorists like Edmund Burke and Friedrich Hayek He was somebody I expected great things from said Frederic Bergerson one of his political science professors In the summer of 1996 just after graduation Mr Brown arrived in the Michigan village of Mecosta for research on the conservative thinker Russell Kirk Over fireside talks in a scholarly center housed in Kirks ancestral home he immersed himself in Kirks notion that permanent things  family and church  form the foundation of a healthy society When a roommate introduced him to Catholic teachings Mr Brown plunged in and eventually converted He was looking for history roots understanding of what is true culture said Annette Kirk Russells widow Mr Brown obtained a second degree at Oxford returned to the United States to marry a woman he met through his childhood pastor and later went to the University of California Los Angeles to pursue a doctorate But he gave up academia for activism when offered a job at the Family Institute of Connecticut where he worked ultimately unsuccessfully to stop a 2005 Connecticut law that allowed samesex couples to enter into civil unions There Mr Browns work attracted the attention of Ms Gallagher who by then had begun to worry that social conservatives like herself would be outmatched by organized gay rights supporters She recalls meeting Mr Brown at a conference He said we needed a Club for Growth for marriage she said referring to the advocacy group that promotes economic freedom He got the strategic need With the help of Robert P George a conservative scholar at Princeton they founded the National Organization for Marriage in 2007 with Ms Gallagher as president and Mr Brown as executive director If samesex marriage becomes a cultural norm Mr Brown warns heterosexual couples will no longer have preference over gay men and lesbians in adoptions schoolchildren will be taught that samesex parenting is normal and those who oppose it will be labeled bigots Already he worries about his safety and that of his handful of employees which is why there is a security lock on his office door Children are taught in kindergarten first grade that its the same thing to grow up and marry a boy as to marry a girl he said in a recent interview on CSpan That is a profound consequence Aside from the big victory in California Mr Brown moved his family there for a year to help pass Proposition 8 his group helped unseat three Iowa Supreme Court justices who overturned a ban against samesex marriage there and helped lead last years successful effort to ban samesex marriage in North Carolina But since 2009 gay men and lesbians have won the right to marry in the District of Columbia and eight states Although his track record is now mixed Mr Brown is convinced that his big victory will come at the United States Supreme Court No way the court is going to launch another Roe v Wade he said referring to the 1973 decision that made abortion legal But whatever the outcome he said there will be more battles either in the courts or in legislatures and he will fight them If we were to lose would it be difficult he asked before quickly answering Of course it would be difficult But were never going away
North Dakota to Put End to Abortions on the Ballot,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/23/us/north-dakota-allows-vote-on-strict-abortion-limit.html,North Dakota lawmakers passed a resolution on Friday to allow the public to decide whether the State Constitution should assert that life begins at conception a move that would essentially ban all abortions in the state The measure which will appear on next years ballot comes a week after the Republicancontrolled Legislature adopted a law that made abortion illegal once a fetal heartbeat is detected which could be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy Although the House on Friday struck down a bill that would have directly affirmed that life begins at conception without a requirement of a public vote it did pass legislation to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and to require doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a local hospital Abortionrights advocates have criticized the bills and promised to challenge them saying the measures violated the Roe v Wade decision that allows abortions until the fetus is considered viable usually around 24 weeks into a pregnancy The thought that the politicians of North Dakota would put their own state through another ballot initiative that does absolutely nothing to advance the wellbeing of the people of that state is just unconscionable said Cecile Richards the president of Planned Parenthood Action Fund Senator Margaret Sitte a Republican who sponsored the personhood resolution that passed the Senate last month and the House on Friday said she hoped that it would lead to an end to abortion in the state Im hoping that it will be a direct challenge to Roe v Wade she said The resolution does not need Gov Jack Dalrymples approval but the other bills do Although he is a Republican who opposes abortion his deliberation is a bit complicated With the threat of lawsuits the state could be forced into a costly legal fight if he signs the bills into law Mr Dalrymple still has not acted on the fetal heartbeat measure His office said Friday that it had yet to receive the bill Once he receives it he has three days to make a decision The resolution regarding life at conception will be put up for a public vote whether to add an amendment to the State Constitution that says The inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and defended
Marriage and the Supremes,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/opinion/sunday/bruni-marriage-and-the-supremes.html,IM not sure Ive ever seen advocates of gay rights  of equal rights I should say  as revved up as they are right now with the Supreme Court poised on Tuesday and Wednesday to consider samesex marriage in two separate cases But while theyre watching this moment raptly and hopefully its not with a sense that the fate of the cause hangs in the balance Quite the opposite Theyre watching it with an entirely warranted confidence verging on certainty that no matter what the justices say during this coming weeks hearings and no matter how they rule months from now the final chapter of this story has in fact been written The question isnt whether there will be a happy ending The question is when Thats whats truly remarkable about this juncture the aura of inevitability that hovers over it In an astonishingly brief period of time this country has experienced a seismic shift in opinion  a profound social and political revolution  when it comes to gay and lesbian people And its worth pausing on the cusp of the court hearings to take note of this change and to mull whats behind it As for the change itself look at the last month alone Look merely at the Republican Party Although its 2012 platform called for a constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage scores of prominent Republicans including a few senior advisers to Mitt Romneys campaign broke ranks in late February and put their names to a Supreme Court amicus brief in favor of marriage equality That these dissidents cant be dismissed as pure anomalies was made clear at the annual gathering of the Conservative Political Action Conference last weekend CPAC mind you is no enclave of moderation and reason Its more like an aviary for the farright wacko birds whom John McCain recently called out  But as BuzzFeeds Chris Geidner who covered the conference noted Opponents of gay rights spoke to a nearly empty room while supporters had a standingroomonly crowd That observation came under a headline that said At CPAC the Marriage Fight Is Over The article went on to quote a bit of counsel that the Washington Post blogger Jennifer Rubin gave her fellow conservatives On the issue of samesex marriage she told them the country was headed in one and only one direction Republicans could either get with the program or get comfy with their image of being woefully out of touch The BuzzFeed article was posted last Sunday On Thursday in Politico came the sweeping declaration that March 2013 would perhaps go down as the month when the political balance on this issue shifted unmistakably from risky to safe That assessment reflected formal endorsements of samesex marriage in less than a weeks span by both Rob Portman and Hillary Clinton Clinton tellingly didnt just articulate her position in the course of a broader interview or speech She released a precisely scripted video dedicated to marriage equality and that spotlight and care spoke volumes about the way this issue has suddenly become central to Democratic politics something a serious national figure who wants party approval and donor dollars must support and must get right What a difference four years make In 2008 both Clinton and Barack Obama publicly opposed samesex marriage Just a year ago that was still Obamas formal stance But by the summer of 2012 marriage equality had made its way into the party platform Now its woven into the partys very fiber Theres no going back In an ABC NewsWashington Post survey released early last week respondents nationwide favored marriage equality by a 58to36 margin Thats an exact flip of a similar survey just seven years ago when the margin was 36to58 And among young Americans who will obviously make up more and more of the electorate as time goes by support was stronger still The ABCWashington Post survey showed that 81 percent of people in the 18to29 age group endorsed marriage equality The buildup to the Supreme Court hearings has demonstrated the breadth of diversity of support for it There have been amicus briefs signed or proclamations of solidarity issued by dozens of professional athletes and by the American Academy of Pediatrics by tech giants and accounting firms and retailers and airlines Somewhere along the way standing up for gay marriage went from nervy to trendy Its the Harlem Shake of political engagement And the unstoppable advances made by gays and lesbians were suggested by a quiet but revealing statement recently by the president of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation who signaled that the organization would put a new emphasis on transgender equality THESE advances happened in largest part because of the increased visibility of gay people who have had the courage and optimism to share their lives and truths with family friends colleagues Although many critics nitpicked Portman for changing his views only out of what was deemed a selfish concern for his own gay son thats precisely the way many people are illuminated and tugged along by emotion not abstraction by whats immediate and personal not whats foreign and theoretical Clinton has acknowledged as much by citing the influence of gays and lesbians she has known and respected And the decadeslong rallying cry of the gayrights movement  come out come out so that Americans understand the impact of discrimination on people they care about  was predicated on that wrinkle of human nature Additionally the quest for samesex marriage has forced many Americans to view gays and lesbians in a fresh light Were no longer so easily stereotyped and dismissed as rebels atop parade floats demanding permission to behave outside societys norms Were aspirants to tradition communicating shared values and asserting a fundamentally conservative desire at least among many of us for families stability commitment Whats so threatening about any of that And who really loses if we win Wheres the injured party The abortion debate grinds on in part because to those who believe that life begins at conception and warrants full protection from then on every prochoice victory claims victims The gun debate grinds on because new restrictions are just that  restrictions  and no matter how justifiable and necessary they may be opponents will rail that their freedom is being curtailed But the legalization of samesex marriage takes nothing from anyone other than the illusion which is all it is and ever was that healthy nurturing relationships are reserved for people of opposite sexes The Supreme Court cases and their resolutions indeed matter If the court doesnt dismantle the Defense of Marriage Act theres no telling how many more years will pass before this repugnant 1996 law tumbles in some other way and before gay and lesbian couples married in states that allow such weddings are treated equally under federal law And the court could in its ruling on the constitutionality of a California ban against samesex marriage hasten the spread of marriage equality beyond those nine states and the District of Columbia For now the count builds slowly through timeconsuming patiencefraying expensive legislative and referendum battles and a matter of basic fairness is beholden to local politics and pockets of enduring bigotry But fairness is where were heading at least in regard to marriage which has emerged as the terrain on which Americans are hashing out their feelings about gays and lesbians The trajectory is undeniable The trend line is clear And the choice before the justices is whether to be handmaidens to history or whether to sit it out
Critics of State Bill Say It Would Restrict Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/us/foes-of-texas-bill-say-it-would-restrict-legal-abortions.html,A bill advancing through the Texas Legislature could drastically decrease the number of legal abortion facilities in the state  Supporters of Senate Bill 537 which would increase regulations for abortion facilities say it will improve womens safety But abortion rights advocates say that the bill is a thinly veiled effort to close 37 of the states 42 abortion facilities and that it would reduce womens access to legal abortion I understand the suspicion but this really is about improving health care for women getting abortions said the bills author State Senator Bob Deuell a Republican from Greenville who is a primary care physician  The bill would require abortions including those induced by drugs to be performed in socalled ambulatory surgical centers The regulations for such facilities include specific sizes for rooms and doorways and additional infrastructure like pipelines for general anesthesia and large sterilization equipment  The Senate Committee on Health and Human Services approved the bill on Tuesday sending it to the full Senate for approval Theres no recent spike in risk or safety incidents that this regulation is responding to Its pure politics said Amy Hagstrom Miller the chief executive of Whole Womans Health which operates four abortion clinics throughout the state and an ambulatory surgical center that performs abortions The thing we need to worry about is when you take away womens access to safe abortion then whats going to happen  Thirtyseven abortion clinics in Texas would not be in compliance under the new regulations Of the 416 ambulatory surgical centers in Texas five perform abortions  Abortion rights advocates say Texas women will be forced to seek dangerous and illegal abortions because they will no longer have ready access to the procedure  Ambulatory surgical centers cost more to build and operate than abortion clinics which in turn raises the cost of abortions for patients Whole Womans Health for example says it spends 40000 more each month to operate its surgical center than it does for an abortion clinic Its patients pay 1277 for an abortion at the surgical center compared with 540 at a clinic More than 72000 abortions are performed annually in Texas No deaths from complications related to abortion have been reported to the state since 2001 While there are risks associated with the procedure there is less than one death per 100000 legal abortions in the United States according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Dr Mayra Thompson an obstetrician and gynecologist told senators during a committee hearing on Tuesday that serious complications could arise from surgical abortions  It shouldnt matter if youre prolife or prochoice Dr Thompson said The point here is the safety Texas passed a law in 2004 requiring women seeking an abortion after 16 weeks of pregnancy to undergo the procedure in a surgical center At the time no abortion facilities met the standards  A study by Ted Joyce an economics professor at Baruch College of the City University of New York on the effects of the 2004 law found that the number of abortions after 16 weeks dropped in Texas to 446 from 3642 in the first year and that more women sought abortions out of state Mr Joyce said last week that he expected Dr Deuells measure would have similar effects Although surgical centers would eventually be established to meet the demand for abortion services Mr Joyce said his research showed that in the short term existing surgical facilities would be flooded with patients and its going to force women either to go out of state or to carry to term 
Shadow of Roe v. Wade Looms Over Ruling on Gay Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/24/us/roes-shadow-as-supreme-court-hears-same-sex-marriage-cases.html,WASHINGTON  When the Supreme Court hears a pair of cases on samesex marriage on Tuesday and Wednesday the justices will be working in the shadow of a 40yearold decision on another subject entirely Roe v Wade the 1973 ruling that established a constitutional right to abortion  Judges lawyers and scholars have drawn varying lessons from that decision with some saying that it was needlessly rash and created a culture war Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg a liberal and a champion of womens rights has long harbored doubts about the ruling Its not that the judgment was wrong but it moved too far too fast she said last year at Columbia Law School  Briefs from opponents of samesex marriage including one from 17 states are studded with references to the aftermath of the abortion decision and to Justice Ginsburgs critiques of it They say the lesson from the Roe decision is that states should be allowed to work out delicate matters like abortion and samesex marriage for themselves They thought they were resolving a contentious issue by taking it out of the political process but ended up perpetuating it John C Eastman the chairman of the National Organization for Marriage and a law professor at Chapman University said of the justices who decided the abortion case The lesson they should draw is that when you are moving beyond the clear command of the Constitution you should be very hesitant about shutting down a political debate Justice Ginsburg has suggested that the Supreme Court in 1973 should have struck down only the restrictive Texas abortion law before it and left broader questions for another day The analogous approach four decades later would be to strike down Californias ban on samesex marriage but leave in place prohibitions in about 40 other states  But Theodore J Boutrous Jr a lawyer for the two couples challenging Californias ban said the Roe ruling was a different case on a different subject and arose in a different political and social context The decision was a bolt out of the blue he said and it had not been subject to exhaustive public discussion debate and support including by the president and other highranking government officials from both parties  Roe was written in a way that allowed its critics to argue that the court was creating out of whole cloth a brand new constitutional right Mr Boutrous said But recognition of the fundamental constitutional right to marry dates back over a century and the Supreme Court has already paved the way for marriage equality by deciding two landmark decisions protecting gay citizens from discrimination The author of the majority opinions in those two cases Justice Anthony M Kennedy seemed to address the new ones in wary terms in remarks this month in Sacramento A democracy should not be dependent for its major decisions on what nine unelected people from a narrow legal background have to say he said  In Justice Ginsburgs account set out in public remarks and law review articles the broad ruling in the abortion case froze activity in state legislatures created venomous polarization and damaged the authority of the court The legislatures all over the United States were moving on this question Justice Ginsburg said at Princeton in 2008 The law was in a state of flux The Supreme Courts decision was a perfect rallying point for people who disagreed with the notion that it should be a womans choice she added They could instead of fighting in the trenches legislature by legislature go after this decision by unelected judges That general view is widely accepted across the political spectrum and it might counsel caution at a moment when samesex marriage is allowed in nine states and the District of Columbia and seems likely judging from polls to make further gains around the nation  Intervening at this stage of a social reform movement would be somewhat analogous to Roe v Wade where the court essentially took the laws deregulating abortion in four states and turned them into a constitutional command for the other 46 Michael J Klarman a law professor at Harvard wrote in a recent book From the Closet to the Altar Courts Backlash and the Struggle for SameSex Marriage Mr Klarman was a law clerk to Justice Ginsburg when she served on the federal appeals court in Washington But an article that will appear in Discourse an online legal journal published by The UCLA Law Review proposes a different account The Roecentered backlash narrative it seems is the trump card in many discussions of the marriage cases wrote Linda Greenhouse a former New York Times reporter who covered the court and now teaches at Yale Law School and Reva B Siegel a law professor there Before Roe they wrote despite broad popular support liberalization of abortion law had all but come to a halt in the face of concerted opposition by a Catholicled minority It was in other words decidedly not the case that abortion reform was on an inevitable march forward if only the Supreme Court had stayed its hand After the decision they added political realignment better explains the timing and shape of political polarization around abortion than does a courtcentered story of backlash In an interview Professor Siegel said court decisions concerning samesex marriage had played a valuable role It is nearly two decades since courts in Hawaii Massachusetts and other states began a national conversation about marriage she said There has been over the course of this long period a dramatic revolutionary change in popular understanding of marriage equality Courts can inspire resistance but also can teach Professor Klarman said it was not clear that a decision requiring samesex marriage throughout the nation would give rise to the kind of sharp opposition that followed the abortion ruling For abortion opponents abortion is murder which means the intensity of their commitment to resisting Roe was considerable he said in an interview For the gay marriage opponent in say Mississippi how will their lives change if the openly gay couple living down the street can now obtain a marriage license There is a range of possible outcomes in the case on Californias ban on same sex marriage Hollingsworth v Perry No 12144 The court could uphold the ban reject it on grounds that apply only to California or only to eight states or establish a nationwide right to marriage equality Or the court could say it is powerless to render a decision on the merits  That last option would follow from the odd path the case took through the courts After a trial judge struck down the California ban from the voter initiative Proposition 8 and entered judgment against state officials the officials declined to appeal Supporters of Proposition 8 did appeal but it is not clear that they have suffered an injury direct enough to give them standing to appeal  The trial courts judgment came in 2010 from Judge Vaughn R Walker of the Federal District Court in San Francisco During closing arguments in the case Judge Walker made it clear that he too was working in the shadow of the abortion ruling He said the Roe case has plagued our politics for 30 years because the Supreme Court has ultimately constitutionalized something that touches upon highly sensitive social issues Isnt the danger Judge Walker asked Theodore B Olson a lawyer for the two couples challenging the ban not that you are going to lose this case either here or at the court of appeals or at the Supreme Court but that you might win it 
States Gone Wild,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/opinion/keller-states-gone-wild.html,NO sooner had Arkansas adopted the countrys most regressive abortion law earlier this month  a ban after about 12 weeks of pregnancy  than North Dakota lowered its limit to as early as six weeks Both measures are expected to be ruled unconstitutional but heres my question Is North Dakota that much more conservative than say South Dakota where abortions are permitted up to 24 weeks  Colorado has now decriminalized possession of small amounts of marijuana Is Colorado really more libertarian than neighboring Wyoming where possession can still get you a year in prison Pennsylvania allows samesex couples to adopt children Are Pennsylvanians so much more enlightened than the citizens of Ohio where gay parents have hardly any rights Maryland has just decided to repeal the death penalty Good for Maryland But why not Delaware next door where the 17 inmates on death row are still biding time until their lethal injections And dont get me started on gun laws South Dakota is currently leading the race to the bottom by arming teachers in their classrooms but just wait the pandering to the gun lobby is ferociously competitive There is nothing especially new about states going their own way We fought a civil war after all And we have become accustomed to categorizing states as red or blue based on their electoral choices But it feels as if every news cycle brings another seemingly random example of a state veering off the mainstream especially on these issues of personal liberty Whats up with that In recent years our disjointed political system has gotten considerable attention from journalists and academics seeking to explain why our supposedly indivisible nation seems so intractably divided At the level of Congress the diagnosis is pretty well understood gerrymandering of Congressional districts makes incumbents safe in general elections but vulnerable in party primaries where the most passionate voters decide the outcome So the incumbents these days especially the Republicans avoid any sign of reasonableness that could be used against them in a primary The same thing is happening to some extent at the state level but none of this fully explains the wild disparities Bill Bishops 2008 book The Big Sort attracted highprofile attention Bill Clinton touted it with its hypothesis that likeminded Americans were clustering in communities where they reinforced one anothers prejudices According to this theory Americans choose neighborhoods they find compatible pockets of likeminded citizens that have become so ideologically inbred that we dont know cant understand and can barely conceive of those people who live just a few miles away  Bishops book was provocative and was pummeled by some political scientists for relying too much on data from presidential elections Because they offer voters a stark eitheror choice presidential elections overstate the partisan divide When you look at voter registration or opinion polling the fastestgrowing political allegiance is not red or blue but independent And while there are anecdotal accounts of for example gay couples choosing homes in communities that respect their rights theres not much evidence that deliberate ideological selfsegregation is a widespread phenomenon Dante Chinni and James Gimpel in a 2010 book called Our Patchwork Nation subdivided America into a dozen categories with special emphasis on the urbanrural divide to explain why different places go in such different directions Gimpel who teaches at the University of Maryland told me that rural and smalltown residents feel belittled by what they perceive as the cultural imperialism of big cities They hunker around their Fox News which feeds their resentment He is surely right about rural alienation but as Gimpel acknowledges America is increasingly neither urban nor rural it is suburban or urbanish The Patchwork formula doesnt fully explain why Iowa one of our least urbanized states has accepted samesex marriage or why voters in the most urbanized state California voted to reject it I heard a more satisfying if somewhat depressing explanation for the seemingly random eruptions of political idiosyncrasy from Samuel Abrams who teaches politics at Sarah Lawrence and Stanford Abrams who has spent the last decade or so researching our political habits begins with the evidence that most Americans are simply not engaged in local politics except perhaps on pocketbook issues In the absence of public attention motivated wellfinanced and sometimes extreme elites have captured the lawmaking process in many state capitals Legislatures are vulnerable to and often populated by the most ardent believers in a cause the ones who care enough to take the time raise the money turn out on Election Day and lobby relentlessly  People who participate in state and local government tend not to be representative of the masses at all Abrams told me They tend to be highly engaged political elites  15 percent of the population who think theyre fighting this culture war Theyll see an opening Theyll see a judge theyll see a legislature that looks amenable to something and theyll try to push it through and build a groundswell around that This dynamic applies to both liberals and conservatives by the way although a variety of studies show Republicans have pulled much further to the right than Democrats have to the left To this mix of public indifference and activist opportunism people who study our odd political folkways add several other contributing factors Bill Bishop of Big Sort fame pointed out to me that there are fewer divided state legislatures  one house Republican one house Democratic  than at any time in decades State legislatures are increasingly partisan monocultures given to herdlike behavior Mixed company moderates he said Except when as in todays Washington it paralyzes Morris Fiorina of Stanford says that state legislatures change hands more often than they used to so lawmakers believe that they may have one shot to accomplish their policy goals before they lose power They go for it Michael Dimock of Pew Research adds that the drastic downsizing of statehouse news coverage means state lawmakers operate with less accountability So in Arkansas the amendment outlawing abortion at 12 weeks was not the product of a popular groundswell but largely the triumph of a single entrepreneurial Tea Party state senator who whisked the measure through a newly Republican mostly inexperienced Legislature with virtually no debate As Jay Barth a politics professor at Hendrix College in Arkansas notes thanks to strict term limits the Legislature in Little Rock doesnt develop strong leadership and discipline it is susceptible to populist charisma  from right and left but these days mostly right  Of course it helps if those with an agenda have money behind them In Colorado liberals like billionaire Peter Lewis sensed an opportunity outspent opponents 10 to 1 and got an amendment to legalize marijuana Sometimes as in the growing momentum for gay marriage states catch a changing national tide Sometimes as in Arizonas reactionary antiimmigrant laws states seem to be gasping the last gasp of a waning trend When we disapprove of the outcome  in my case those extremist antiabortion laws  we call it opportunism or specialinterest politics When legislatures bypass public opinion and do something we admire  in my case Gov Martin OMalleys successful push to abolish the death penalty in Maryland where 60 percent of voters favor executions  we call it leadership Does all of this make for a healthy democracy If 80 percent of the electorate is sitting on the sidelines thats a recipe for demagogy and cynicism But maybe what were seeing is states performing a useful role as laboratories of policy These experiments may produce smart ideas that deserve to be replicated at the national level the Massachusetts health care law for example which inspired Obamacare Or the state labs may cook up poisons  Arizonas antiimmigrant statutes or those new restrictive abortion laws  and you pray that Congress or the courts will find an antidote
Aid to Victims of Rape,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/opinion/aid-to-victims-of-rape.html,To the Editor Cruelty to Women Overseas editorial March 18 highlights a serious problem in United States policy It is indeed cruel for the United States not to assist women who have been raped during conflict and provide access to medical services including safe abortions that they require to regain control of their lives The surprising part is that such cruelty has not been remedied by the Obama administration a declared friend to women overseas In addition to the recommended reinterpretation of the Helms amendment it would be very simple to remove the policy directive imposed by President George W Bush that bars United States humanitarian assistance from being used for abortion even in cases of rape during conflict To its credit the United States recently helped marshal an agreement at the United Nations Commission on the Status of Women that pledges to address the health consequences of genderbased violence including through the provision of abortion services Yet the women whose lives have been ripped apart by rape should not have to wait any longer The United States can and should change its policy now SERRA SIPPEL President Center for Health and Gender Equity Washington March 18 2013
"At High-Priced Corner, a Building Forlorn",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/nyregion/former-village-dispensary-must-untangle-restrictions.html,The corner of Christopher Street and Waverly Place in the heart of Greenwich Village is one of the most sought after slices of Manhattan The stoops are tidy the restaurants are lavish and a town house down the block sold last year for 115 million Yet at that same intersection there is a brick building at 165 Waverly Place pinkish in color and triangular in shape that has stood empty for more than 20 years It appears to owe that lonely fate to the quirks of its owners and to an extraordinary set of deed restrictions on its use A provision dating to the early 19th century requires that the building called the Northern Dispensary be used to serve people who are poor and infirm according to its owners This might tangle the plan of any condominium developer The deed restrictions also rule out any obscene performances on the premises or any obscene or pornographic purposes And they prohibit abortions  Now after years of chipping paint and broken windows there is a bit of movement at this forlorn site The owners are patching up the roof cleaning up the inside and trying to figure out where to go from here Were aware of the deed restrictions said Martin McLaughlin a spokesman for William Gottlieb Real Estate which owns the property Were examining our options William Gottlieb for whom the company is named was known for buying properties including many rental buildings in the Village and then sitting on them Mr McLaughlin said his clients had no intention of putting the building up for sale either The Northern Dispensary  so called because at the time it was in the northern part of what was then New York City  was built in 1831 and provided medical services for much of its life eventually winding up as a dental clinic That clinic struggled financially however and in the 1980s after refusing to treat a man because he had AIDS it was sued fined tens of thousands of dollars and then closed The building was taken over by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York which sold it in 1998 for 760000 The man who bought it Mr Gottlieb was a challenging little mystery all by himself He started buying property in the 1950s and by the time he died in 1999 he owned about 100 buildings in the city an empire estimated at one point to be worth 1 billion But instead of indulging in expensive suits and chauffeured cars Mr Gottlieb  a sloppy dresser who frequently skipped his morning meeting with a razor  drove a beatup old station wagon and carried his papers around in a shopping bag If you saw him on the street you would say This man is a bumÂ  K Thomas Elghanayan chairman of TF Cornerstone a prominent real estate developer said But he was always very straightforward he stuck to his word and he was impossible ever to buy anything from No Mr Gottlieb was not a flipper Instead he tended to buy buildings  generally small parcels concentrated in the West Village the meatpacking district and Chelsea  and then let them languish Sometimes arguably that was a good thing because he kept a lot of old buildings from being destroyed said Andrew Berman executive director of the Greenwich Village Society for Historic Preservation Sometimes it was not because he might just sit there as buildings deteriorated They dont necessarily seem to follow a logical or easily explicable path Mr Berman added referring to Mr Gottliebs family a group that has continued his tradition of inscrutability And to be honest thats about as much insight as I can offer The Northern Dispensary was one of the last buildings Mr Gottlieb bought and today it falls to Neil Bender his nephew and principal of the real estate company to decipher the deed restrictions which lawyers and title experts describe as a complicated undertaking The language might be old and the intentions dusty but experimenting with their meaning they say can still result in a lawsuit Stuart Klein who was inspector general of the citys Buildings Department from 1978 to 1984 said The law of easements and restrictions  you could stand on it and change light bulbs in your house In the early 1990s Mr Klein represented a group of the Northern Dispensarys neighbors who were trying to come up with alternate uses for the building in the face of a proposal to house homeless people with AIDS on the site At that time Mr Klein recalled he found the deed restriction on serving the poor to be solid My recollection was that the deed restriction couldnt be removed he said That significantly devalued the property Deed restrictions have been in use in the United States since Colonial times said Stuart M Saft chairman of the real estate practice at Holland  Knight and were employed as an early form of zoning They might ban blacksmithing on a property in a residential area for example or perhaps the tanning of hides  two restrictions that survive on many New York City deeds today said Rafael Castellanos managing partner at Expert Title Insurance Agency even though those industries have long since vanished But deed restrictions were also frequently used as a method of segregation barring black or Jewish people from living in a particular building Those restrictions were declared unconstitutional in the late 1940s The durability of a deed restriction depends on a jumble of factors including how it was written whom it protects and whether the person who initiated it is still alive The restrictions may be cleared away in court but that is not always easy New restrictions meanwhile are still sometimes added to deeds by owners like the Archdiocese of New York Joseph Zwilling a spokesman for the archdiocese said in an email from Rome last week that he did not recall the specifics of the Northern Dispensary transactions but he was not surprised to learn of the deed conditions It is common if not universal for there to be language in the sale of church property that prohibits the property from being used for activities contrary to the teachings of the church Mr Zwilling wrote and that would include performing abortions or the sale of pornography Thats required in church law before property can be sold So at least for now the deed restrictions at the Northern Dispensary remain in place That dear little building used to be beautiful on the inside said Christabel Gough a preservationist who has lived nearby for 30 years and used to attend block association meetings in the Northern Dispensarys dignified paneled boardroom But that building seems to be jinxed she added I dont know what they will do
Scaliaâ€™s Gay Marriage Problem,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/03/25/scalias-gay-marriage-problem/,"With the Supreme Court set to hear oral arguments tomorrow and Wednesday in a pair of samesex marriage cases there are two questions preoccupying legal writers How will Justice Anthony Kennedy the courts
                                        wild card vote and how will Justice Antonin Scalia behave No one expects the conservative 78yearold jurist to have a sudden equalprotection epiphany He has made it abundantly plain that he has no use for samesex unions he thinks they are immoral In his Lawrence v Texas
                                        dissent for instance he said Americans have every right to enforce the moral opprobrium that has traditionally attached to homosexual conduct in order to protect themselves and their families
                                        from a lifestyle that they believe to be immoral and destructive Whats less obvious is whether Justice Scalia will vent his political and personal prejudices Can Justice Scalia hold his ego and intemperance in check for the two hour and 50 minute duration of the two marriage
                                        argumentsÂ  Will he even tryÂ  His recent track record is not encouraging
                                         He made partisan comments during last years health care argument he slammed President Obamas immigration policies in his 2012 dissenting opinion supporting Arizonas
                                        immigration crackdown and at last months argument in a case challenging the constitutionality of the Voting Right Act he dismissed that signature achievement of the nations civil rights struggle
                                        as a perpetuation of racial entitlement He also suggested that the court needs to save Congress from itself because lawmakers are afraid to side against equal access for voting  a strange
                                        posture for a selfstyled champion of judicial restraint The justice has never shied from courting controversy or from blurring the line between law and politics in his appearances and writings  on or off the bench In 2004 he went duck hunting with then Vice President
                                        Dick Cheney just three weeks after the court agreed to hear a case about the VPs refusal to disclose the records of his secretive energy task force It provided late night talk show hosts with laugh lines
                                        for weeks More pertinently at the American Enterprise Institute in October he said that the death penalty abortion and homosexual sodomy were easy constitutional issues
                                        Homosexual sodomy Come on For 200 years it was criminal in every state At Princeton in December when a freshman
                                        asked the justice to explain his legal writings comparing sodomy bans with laws prohibiting bestiality and murder he responded If we cannot have moral feeling against homosexuality can we have it against
                                        murder Can we have it against other things His increasingly cranky and intolerant pronouncements have become an embarrassment even to people who tend to agree with him Justice Scalia has not merely prejudged the issue of samesex marriage but has cemented
                                        the impression of an antigay bias He is something of a political cheerleader for antigay marriage forces and the belief that there is something wrong with gay relationships If Supreme Court justices were subject to the ethics code that applies to lower federal court judges Justice Scalia would probably have to recuse himself"
Deciding Not to Decide Gay Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/26/opinion/deciding-not-to-decide-gay-marriage.html,Washington THE Supreme Court will begin hearing two days of oral arguments today on the constitutionality of Proposition 8 the 2008 initiative that banned samesex marriage in California and on the Defense of Marriage Act the 1996 law that forbids federal recognition of samesex marriage DOMA poses easier legal issues The statute which President Obama believes is unconstitutional and which has been repudiated by Bill Clinton who signed it inserted the federal government into marriage law historically the domain of the states It was clearly driven by antigay animus and as lower courts have ruled there simply is no good reason for Congress to refuse to treat all staterecognized marriages equally The Prop 8 case Hollingsworth v Perry poses thornier questions about political equality and could have much broader consequences because it calls into question the rights of all states to limit marriages to unions between men and women I fully support marriage equality But strange as it may sound I believe that in the Prop 8 case the court should decide not to decide the gay marriage issue at all The proposition has already been struck down by federal judges at the trial and appellate levels the governor and attorney general of California have refused to defend the proposition and the parties seeking the Supreme Courts review lack the legal capacity or standing to pursue the case  If the court decides to resolve the merits it should rule that the Constitution commands recognition of samesex marriage on equal terms with oppositesex marriage A decision to the contrary would be a modernera Plessy v Ferguson the notorious 1896 decision affirming segregation as separate but equal Correspondingly a decision ruling Prop 8 unconstitutional would be the Roberts courts Brown v Board of Education the 1954 decision that struck down racial segregation in schools The legal and moral choice should be clear But the Brown analogy should give us pause Samesex marriage is legal in nine states and the District of Columbia but is the country ready for a decision requiring all 50 states to recognize such unions immediately Brown triggered a notorious backlash in both the South and the North and its impact was blunted by demographic changes and later court rulings leading to what the education scholar Gary A Orfield has called the resegregation of American schooling  Or consider Roe v Wade the 1973 decision that protected womens right to have abortions Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg an unabashed defender of abortion rights has criticized Roe for imprudently intervening in that debate at a time when the idea of abortion rights was already gaining ground at the state level The Roe decision galvanized the antiabortion movement with political impacts that still linger  In the long run national recognition of samesex marriage is inevitable Samesex marriage rights at first imposed by courts have now been recognized by state legislatures and prevailed in all four states where they were on the ballot in last years election Young people overwhelmingly support it and public opinion has shifted on this issue faster than on almost any other social issue in history It is only a matter of time before all state laws reflect that view Prudence counsels that marriage equality should be allowed to continue gaining support in the states and that a federal resolution should be left for another day What is more the courts doctrine dictates just this deferral California has not only chosen not to appeal but has actually filed a brief supporting its laws challengers A coalition of Californians who originally sponsored Prop 8 has stepped in to defend the law But they are not accountable to the state or its people are free to pursue their own ideological interests and have suffered no distinctive injury from the 2010 lower court decision that found that Prop 8 violated the 14th Amendments guarantees of due process and equal protection  The Supreme Court has long ruled that a mere ideological interest in seeing a law enforced is a generalized grievance that is not sufficiently personal or concrete to support a constitutional case or controversy the only kind the court has the authority to resolve  A limited Prop 8 ruling would respect important constitutional limits on judicial power limits the courts current conservative justices have long insisted upon It would leave intact the lowercourt ruling preserving the roughly 18000 samesex marriages that have already been conducted in California and allow additional samesex marriages in the nations most populous state to be performed And it would permit marriage equality to propagate organically state by state  Many people myself included would love to see Justice Anthony M Kennedy the presumptive swing vote on the court declare a constitutional right to marriage equality in language as majestic and authoritative as in his 2003 decision in Lawrence v Texas which struck down the remaining sodomy laws in America But the court is constitutionally limited to deciding cases or controversies and this case in which no injured party has appealed and those who have are unaccountable is inappropriate for resolution  Equally important history suggests it would be unwise for the Supreme Court to impose a uniform solution on the nation now Doing so could touch off huge civil resistance in the most conservative states Prudence and law dictate the same result cold feet at the altar

Oral Arguments Echo in Gatherings Across Nation,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/us/crowds-camp-out-for-supreme-court-reward.html,COLUMBIA SC  Most United States Supreme Court cases however significant pass largely unnoticed when they are argued But the opening of hearings over the legal definition of marriage was a cultural moment that brought America to its front porch From small prayer vigils in San Diego to rallies in Boston from Passover Seders to spiritual fasts the weight of the decision that the nine justices will make was felt in thousands of communities far from Washington  Here in a state where sodomy was a felony until 2003 and where 78 percent of voters approved a constitutional ban on samesex marriage three years later about 300 people gathered under a Confederate flag that flies at the State Capitol Like some others in rallies across the country they were united in a belief that the cases could lead to profound positive changes in the way gay men and lesbians are treated under the law Deanne Summer 54 was one of them She grew up here and said she wished more of her gay friends could have shown up for the rally They were too scared to come she said I didnt think Id live to see this she said But even if they legalize it doesnt mean people will accept it At the same time others gathered to pray and march in defense of an institution that they believe should be shared only between a man and a woman The views on marriage are not changing said Dran Reese the president of the Salt and Light Council a Christian group north of San Diego that opposes samesex marriage She was at a rally at the San Diego courthouse praying that the Supreme Court would uphold what has been the traditional definition of marriage  The other side they have a little more time and a lot more money she said Thats an unfortunate position for us as people of faith The sheer number of people who stepped forward this week to express their opinions spoke to the personal significance of the issue in a nation that has not been so publicly divided on a social matter since the court ruled on abortion 40 years ago or perhaps since the battle over racial civil rights before that Folks are coming out either in support or opposition because this is one of the great civil rights issues of our time said the Rev Angela Yarber pastor at Wake Forest Baptist Church in WinstonSalem NC  On Monday night she led a prayer service for a group of about 200 people who hope the Supreme Court rules in favor of samesex marriage The same night blessings were given in support of samesex marriage at a Passover Seder in Hamden Conn At a Chinese Baptist Church in Houston a special call was issued urging the court to uphold the Defense of Marriage Act and Californias Proposition 8 which limit marriage to a union between a man and a woman The topic dominated social media platforms from the moment people woke up Tuesday Good marriage equality morning a New York lawyer who uses amaeryllis as her Twitter name greeted her nearly 15000 followers  Please remember to pray today as SCOTUS deliberates these very important marriage cases read the first Twitter message of the day from the North Carolina Values Coalition Holy Covenant United Methodist Church in Chicago a small congregation where vegetarian dinners for the homeless are a weekly event organized a virtual vigil People were encouraged to take a moment at noon Tuesday to pray for a pivotal opportunity for farreaching lasting change for LGBTQ people and their partners Late Tuesday afternoon a knot of mellow demonstrators with signs and rainbow flags ruffling in the warm breeze gathered on the steps of the California state office complex in San Francisco As sea gulls called overhead they played a mix of songs with lyrics that included Dont tell me who to kiss  This is our time said Breana Hansen 27 a graduate student in international and multicultural education We want to show the Supreme Court all the people who are going to be affected if they uphold Propostion 8 Were being heard  Billy Ray Bradford who organized the demonstration said Our lives are in the hands of nine people in Washington They hold our relationships our families and future They get to make the call on whether our Constitution means what it says equal protection under the law  A number of those at the vigil said they were not happy about comments made in court Tuesday by Justice Antonin Scalia who asked When did it become unconstitutional to exclude homosexual couples from marriage Kirk LinnDeGrassi a dog walker answered The right for marriage equality became a civil right when we signed the Constitution Events had begun even before the court was seated Tuesday morning On Monday 75 opponents of samesex marriage gathered with candles on the steps of the Sandra Day OConnor Federal Courthouse in Phoenix The group said it believed that it prayers could influence the court That night several hundred people crowded together at Federal Plaza in downtown Chicago wearing parkas and rainbow mufflers to ward off 30degree temperatures and push for a right to samesex marriage  On Sunday night about 400 people gathered at Los Angeles City Hall for a candlelight vigil in support of samesex marriage The largest of the events were on the Supreme Court steps on Tuesday The crowd included a homeschooled family from Iowa a group of Catholic schoolchildren on a field trip and throngs of Pentecostal parishioners crossing paths with a newly engaged lesbian couple from Ohio a man with HIV and a drag queen  Its a political circus a wonderful political circus said Allen Ritter 45 who slept outside the court for days so he could get inside to hear the case argued  Thousands of samesex marriage opponents marched up the National Mall in a demonstration that resembled a church procession complete with flowing banners signs citing Scripture and members of the clergy leading the way On the other side of the debate were thousands of gay men and lesbians  some who had married and others who said they wished to someday  and their supporters who came to witness a moment they said they hoped would become their Brown v Board of Education Just down Capitol Hill demonstrators who oppose samesex marriage were making their way up to the Supreme Court as the arguments at the court began Among them were the Wackers of Garner Iowa who used the march along with trips to tour the Capitol and a few museums as a civics lesson for their homeschooled children It could be a Roe v Wade type of decision said Cindy Wacker 40 I wouldnt want to look back and say I wish I could have done something This is something I can do by being here and marching and praying

New Laws Ban Most Abortions in North Dakota,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/27/us/north-dakota-governor-signs-strict-abortion-limits.html,FARGO ND  Gov Jack Dalrymple of North Dakota approved the nations toughest abortion restrictions on Tuesday signing into law a measure that would ban nearly all abortions and inviting a legal showdown over just how much states can limit access to the procedure Mr Dalrymple a Republican signed three bills passed by the Republicancontrolled Legislature in Bismarck The most farreaching law forbids abortion once a fetal heartbeat is detectable which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy Fetal heartbeats are detectable at that stage of pregnancy using a transvaginal ultrasound Most legal scholars have said the law would violate the Supreme Courts finding in Roe v Wade that abortions were permitted until the fetus was viable outside the womb generally around 24 weeks Even some leaders of the antiabortion movement nationally have predicted that laws banning abortion so early in pregnancy are virtually certain to be declared unconstitutional by federal courts Although the likelihood of this measure surviving a court challenge remains in question this bill is nevertheless a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v Wade Mr Dalrymple said in a statement The Supreme Court he added has never considered this precise restriction in the heartbeat bill I think theres a lot of frustration in the prolife movement said Paul B Linton a constitutional lawyer in Illinois who was formerly general counsel of Americans United for Life Forty years after Roe v Wade was decided its still the law of the land The new laws place North Dakota for the moment at least at the center of sharp efforts in several Republicancontrolled states to curb abortion rights Three weeks ago Arkansas lawmakers adopted what at the time was the countrys most stringent abortion limit also tied to detection of a fetal heartbeat and banning the procedure at 12 weeks of pregnancy That is the point at which a heartbeat can be detected using an abdominal ultrasound The Arkansas and North Dakota laws have offered the first victories for an emerging faction of the antiabortion movement that is frustrated by the limited progress in curbing abortions and hopes that the Supreme Court might be ready for a radical rethinking But that approach has caused divisions within the movement with Mr Linton and others calling it wishful thinking The North Dakota fetal heartbeat law and others like it Mr Linton said have no chance in the courts Abortionrights advocates who had gathered here to urge the governor to veto the bills quickly condemned his decision as effectively banning abortion in the state and as an attack on women Without judicial intervention the three bills are scheduled to take effect Aug 1 In the past its been Were going to try and make it more difficult more hoops more obstacles for women to have to jump through or jump overÂ  said Tammi Kromenaker the director of Red River Womens Clinic in Fargo the states only abortion provider But this is specifically Lets ban abortion Lets do it Lets challenge Roe v Wade Lets end abortion in North DakotaÂ  The Center for Reproductive Rights in New York immediately condemned the new laws and said it would file a challenge to the fetal heartbeat ban Mr Dalrymple also affirmed a law to require doctors performing abortions to get admitting privileges at a local hospital which could force the closing of the Red River clinic A similar law adopted by Mississippi last year is under challenge in federal court He also signed a third law that would prevent abortion in cases of gender preference or  the first of its kind in the nation  genetic defects like Down syndrome The signings come on top of a resolution approved by the North Dakota Legislature last week to amend the State Constitution to assert that life begins at conception a move that would give a fetus the rights of a person and outlaw virtually all abortions The socalled personhood measure asserting that the inalienable right to life of every human being at any stage of development must be recognized and defended will go on the ballot next year Such measures have been voted down in Mississippi and Colorado  Mr Dalrymple acted on the measures less than 24 hours after they were advanced to his desk Similar measures to ban abortions when fetal heartbeats are detected are under consideration in several other states including Kansas and Ohio The larger established opponents of abortion including the National Right to Life Americans United for Life and the Roman Catholic Church have not supported fetal heartbeat proposals saying that until the courts composition changes they could be counterproductive These groups have instead pursued more incremental measures like waiting periods requiring sonograms and imposing stricter regulations on doctors and clinics and in 10 states so far bans on abortion at 20 weeks an approach that is nearer to the viability threshold but is under challenge in the courts There are two clashing forces in the antiabortion movement now said Caitlin Borgmann a law professor and abortionrights advocate at City University of New York The incrementalists are chipping away at Roe and the others are getting impatient With passage of heartbeat laws in Arkansas and North Dakota this extreme wing of the movement has definitely gained momentum Ms Borgmann said But it can only go so far because they cant win in the courts Abortionrights advocates here have felt particularly on the defensive this year because of the sheer number of bills introduced and their sweeping scope Previously approved abortion measures requiring the states lone provider to do things like post new signs fill out more paperwork distribute literature and offer ultrasounds were seen as burdensome but manageable Some say that North Dakota lawmakers and activists opposed to abortion aggressively pushed their cause this year because they were emboldened by the huge cash reserves from oil revenue that the state can use to fight legal challenges to its laws and by the successful passage of abortion restrictions elsewhere in the country In signing the measure the governor asked the Legislature to appropriate money to pay to defend a court challenge Nationwide theres receptiveness to this said Paul Maloney the executive director of North Dakota Right to Life People of North Dakota thought We have the kind of legislative body that would pass these kinds of pieces of legislationÂ  Fetal heartbeats are generally detectable six weeks into pregnancy using a transvaginal ultrasound and at 10 to 12 weeks with abdominal ultrasounds Doctors could face five years in prison if they knowingly violate this measure and Ms Kromenaker said physicians would feel compelled to perform transvaginal ultrasounds to stay in compliance State Representative Bette Grande a Republican who was the primary sponsor of the heartbeat bill praised the governors decision This is just a great day for babies in North Dakota she said expressing confidence that it would withstand the court challenges The state has a compelling duty to find what is the potential life of a fetus she said What is more compelling and proof of life than a heartbeat It meets the criteria of Roe v Wade The admitting privileges law will probably lead the Red River clinic to shut down Ms Kromenaker said because there are only two hospitals within the required radius and she was uncertain whether her doctors would be allowed privileges there One of the hospitals requires a doctor to admit at least 10 patients per year she said a standard that her doctors who fly in from out of state to perform the procedures would be unable to meet
New Ugliness in a Little Cabin of Horrors,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/31/movies/the-evil-dead-is-reimagined.html,Zack Carlson is a huge fan of the 1981 horror film The Evil Dead Thats why he wont be seeing the new Evil Dead when it opens on Friday I wouldnt watch it at gunpoint said Mr Carlson a writer for the horror movie Web site Bleeding Skull As High Noon is considered a fundamental western Evil Dead is a seminal horror film and for many fans one not to be messed with A story of possession set in a cabin in the woods The Evil Dead was part of a wave of lowbudget independent horror films in the late 70s and early 80s that used crude effects and guerrilla filmmaking techniques to tell a scary tale saturated in outrageous gore It was directed by Sam Raimi who went on to direct the Tobey Maguire SpiderMan films and Oz the Great and Powerful The original has two followups Evil Dead 2 1987 a dark horrorcomedy thats effectively a remake of the original and Army of Darkness 1992 a horroradventure sequel to Evil Dead 2 It was so unique considering the initiative those filmmakers took back then Mr Carlson said It was unmarketable and thats part of the value In 2011 when word of a biggerbudget remake first surfaced reactions from Evil Dead fans ranged from cautiously optimistic to apoplectic One online rant was titled Five Reasons Why the Upcoming RemakeRetread Is Bound to Be Awful Not even the Off Broadway run a few years ago of Evil Dead The Musical sparked controversy on horror sites as did the makeover of a lowfi classic But word of mouth has been positive since the film was greeted enthusiastically at its premiere at the South by Southwest film festival in Austin Tex earlier this month At a recent advance screening in New York the audience many of whom were fans of the original who waited hours to get a seat cheered the mayhem Afterward several people said they enjoyed the film on its own merits I was cringing in my seat the whole time said Eric Striffler 22 who lives in Manorville NY Its gruesome Its like I was watching people get cut in half It was awesome The influence of The Evil Dead comes from its being a prototype of the supernatural backwoods horror film a formula thats had considerable staying power as in last years Cabin in the Woods which was directed by Drew Goddard and written by Mr Goddard and Joss Whedon Unlike horror series that celebrate superhuman villains like Freddy Krueger and Jason Voorhees the character most cheered for in the original Evil Dead is Ash Bruce Campbell who kills everyone including his sister to survive In the new film there is no Ash Instead the lead is a woman played by Jane Levy who is taken by a group of friends to a remote cabin to get off drugs cold turkey As much as horror fans love gore they love their protagonists even more When it was announced that Ash wasnt a part of the new Evil Dead it was the kiss of death for some fans according to Kano Vuong who runs the Evil Dead fan site Deaditesnet  Hes an iconic pulp character that everyone loves Mr Vuong said People were skeptical As it turns out Mr Campbell is one of the producers of the new Evil Dead along with Mr Raimi and Robert Tapert an original Evil Dead producer Mr Campbell was thankful for fans zeal for the original but he urged them to have an open mind about seeing a film thats not the new Evil Dead just new These are the original producers making this movie not some fat slob producer looking for a cheap property to get their hands on Mr Campbell said I am far more concerned with this being a good movie than the fans are I spent the last few months working with the director and producers to make sure this movie meets or exceeds their expectations Ms Levy who stars on the ABC sitcom Suburgatory said I would say to the fans to give it a chance Its a different movie and I dont think we depend on the original There are homages but I think its a rebirth Its the same intention with a different story In the new film key elements of the original remain including a scene in which a female character appears to be raped by the branches of a tree The biggest difference between the two is the graphic violence which is ramped up considerably with several selfamputations and a chain saw to the mouth The bloodletting is a point of pride for the director Fede Alvarez who is making his feature debut The gore was done with only practical effects in which for example prosthetics are cut into and the squirts are authentic Mr Alvarez said no computergenerated methods were used Everything you see is real said Mr Alvarez a native of Uruguay whose slick science fiction short Panic Attack helped earn the producers attention Evil Dead is just one of a number of horror films to be resurrected lately Halloween Friday the 13th and A Nightmare on Elm Street have all been remade in the last six years There have been new 3D versions of My Bloody Valentine and Night of the Living Dead Soon to come are new takes on the 1980 slasher film Maniac starring Elijah Wood and the 1976 supernatural classic Carrie starring Chlo Grace Moretz Robert Fure an editor at Film School Rejects an entertainment Web site said Evil Dead fans feared that giving it a Hollywood makeover slights the spirit of the film Â Evil Dead started off with a small fan base he said People had to find that movie on VHS and you had to rent it or find a bootleg tape that was passed around With a smaller movie people get protective For some fans no remake is worth their attention Mr Carlson is adamant that he is aggressively and violently ignoring the new Evil Dead Gay marriage and abortion and Evil Dead are issues I feel strongly about Mr Carlson said Im completely in support of the first two and completely opposed to the Evil Dead remake Mr Campbells advice for skeptics Theres always yesterday Were not collecting the negatives from the original Evil Dead and burning them he said Were just expanding the Evil Dead universe

                                        I mean its his decision Its his decision Priebus told the press  Its not a matter of whether I support his decision I support him doing what he wants to do as an elected person and as an American If thats his opinion then I support him having that opinion Chris Cillizza an insightful Washington Post columnist argued that Portmans decision                                        was  the latest in a series of moves that make one thing crystal clear The political debate on gay marriage is effectively over Not everyone in the Republican Party was on board Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council counterattacked on March 20 Reince Priebus has decided that the way for his party to win over voters is to parrot the Lefts policies The grand strategy which calls for throwing the partys social conservatives overboard demands

                                        home and throw their hands up in utter frustration Actually for Republicans the upside of blunting volatile social issues is far greater than Limbaugh suggests The potential gains from a softening of the partys hardright stand on social and cultural issues could be huge a return to full competitiveness and a reversal of a widespread sharply negative view of the

                                            stand with the tea party on taxes and spending and with Christian conservatives on key social questions such as abortion rights and samesex marriage These staunch conservatives who emerged with great force
                                            in the Obama era represent 45 percent of the Republican base According to our 2011 survey they are demographically and politically distinct from the national electorate Ninetytwo percent are white They

                                        that intraparty Republican divisions go beyond social and cultural issues and that  the leftright divide politically reflects an underlying psychological dimension related to openness to experience vs threat sensitivity and preference for orderstability  In past times  of rising crime a cold war rising nuclear war fears and rising Islamic terrorism there was a lot to hold together the large conservative coalition Now with diminished external threats there is much less to galvanize people with a psychologically conservative disposition Instead Haidt argued the more intensely felt current threats are economic
                                        and it is not immediately clear why shrinking the government is the best way to meet those threats I dont think the Republicans have found an issue or argument or moral appeal that strongly activates conservative

                                            in the sequester as a needed part of budget cutting and holding the Democrats feet to the fire on that But conservatism may not weaken by much since it looks like it can and has regrouped on economic
                                            and social welfare spending taxes and the budget deficit Economic and antiregulation conservatism has hardly weakened  And on the culturalvalues issues abortion is as strong a rallying issue as ever public opinion has not shifted left on this even among younger cohorts in contrast to other issues and they are just more cautious
                                            regarding what they say about contraceptionÂ Conservatives would look as much as ever for opportunities on prayer in schools and support for religious group endeavors Conservatives have held together on

                                        attend private schools is rising steadily as the passage of state righttowork laws is gutting duespaying membership in public employee unions a financial mainstay of the Democratic Party Im reasonably confident that at the state level we are creating more people who want to be part of the leave us alone coalition  Norquist said He predicts that within the next
                                        decade Republicans will take control of the Senate and regain the White House Craig Shirley a conservative activist and the author of two books about the Reagan revolution is convinced that selfproclaimed conservatives have undermined their
                                        own cause by attempting to use the federal government to address social issues Former House Speaker Newt Gingrich he said should never have pushed for enactment of the Defense of Marriage Act it was wrong it was the federalization of social policy The Republican Party has begun to move to the left on social and cultural issues as well as on immigration Despite the warnings of mass defections of white evangelical and bornagain Christians these shifts will
                                        not be as costly as some people both inside and outside the party claim  The fact is that on pretty much every noncultural issue  government spending taxes the regulatory state and national defense  the Christian right holds orthodox Republican views virtually identical
                                        to those of mainstream Republicans Its members are unlikely to bolt the party Take a look at this Pew Center chart Figure 1 The constituency most convinced that government regulation of business usually does more harm than good a core tenet of the modern Republican Party is white evangelical Christians Or take Figure 2 The Christian right tops everyone in its conviction that the
                                        best way to ensure peace is through military strength Finally just about everyone see Figure 3 says they are patriotic but who tops the list In other words the Republican Party can afford to marginalize Tony Perkins and other Christian right leaders because evangelical social conservatives who make up more than a third                                        of the Republican electorate are not going to vote Democratic Nor are they going to join an exodus to a third party Rush Limbaugh to the contrary they wont stay home either Minimal losses among these voters could be made up for by slight gains among other constituencies like young voters minorities and single white women Withdrawing fullthroated support for the religious right for example by altering the antiabortion plank                                        of the 2012 Republican Party platform which called for a constitutional amendment banning abortion without exception for victims of rape or incest or to save the life of the mother may be a gamble  and
                                        may cost the party donors  but at the moment the Republican Party holds a losing hand"
Cooling on Warming,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/28/opinion/collins-cooling-on-warming.html,Is spring actually here We are definitely getting tired of snow stories Its time for some sun And then the drought stories At which point we will ask ourselves What ever happened to worrying about global warming You may remember what a big deal President Obama made about climate change in his Inaugural Address It definitely looked as if the ozone layer was making a comeback Later in the State of the Union speech Obama came back to his battle cry again and urged Congress to get together pursue a bipartisan marketbased solution to climate change like the one John McCain and Joe Lieberman worked on together a few years ago Urging the House and Senate to follow the lead of the two most notorious shape shifters in recent political history was perhaps not a favorable omen  Nor was the fact that earlier this month a deeply noncontroversial Senate resolution commemorating International Womens Day had to be taken back and edited because someone objected to a paragraph  which had been in an almost identical version passed in the last Congress  stating that women in developing countries are disproportionately affected by changes in climate because of their need to secure water food and fuel for their livelihood You may be wondering who the objecting senator was Normally these things are supposed to be kind of confidential but in this case the lawmaker in question is proud to let you know that he is  yes  Ted Cruz of Texas A provision expressing the Senates views on such a controversial topic as climate change has no place in a supposedly noncontroversial resolution requiring consent of all 100 US senators a Cruz spokesman said Do you think everything in the world is now about Senator Ted Cruz Sure seems like it Although I would discount the rumors that he is responsible for the helium shortage or the sinkhole epidemic  There was a time children when the Republican Party was a hotbed of environmental worrywarts The last big clean air act of the Bush I administration passed the House 401 to 21 But no more no more Youre not going to get any sympathy for controlling climate change from a group that doesnt believe the climate is actually changing As Tom DeLay the former House majority leader used to say Only nature can change the climate  a volcano for instance Its sort of ironic These are the same folks who constantly seed their antideficit speeches with references to our poor betrayed descendants This is a burden our children and grandchildren will have to bear Dont you think the children and grandchildren would appreciate being allowed to hang onto the Arctic ice cap  In his cheerleading State of the Union speech the president did mention that if Congress by any wild chance failed to take action the administration would do some things on its own The Obama White House accomplished quite a bit without legislative help during the first term imposing some big new regulations on automobile fuel efficiency encouraging the production of biofuels and creating new standards on home appliances Its a pretty impressive record given the fact that the mere implementation of a Bushera regulation on light bulb efficiency was enough to spark the Michele Bachmann Light Bulb Freedom of Choice Act and Senator Rand Pauls historic dualpurpose rant claiming that the administration favored a womans right to an abortion but you dont favor a womans or a mans right to choose what kind of light bulb The light bulb standards survived The world continues to turn But a carbon taxfee is the key to controlling climate change That or just letting the next generation worry about whether the Jersey Shore is going to wind up lapping Trenton Currently majority sentiment in Congress is to hope for the best and pass the baton to the grandchildren When it comes to risingsealevel denial the champion may be North Carolina where the Legislature has voted to base state coastal management policy on historic trends rather than anything the current experts have to say This means that even though North Carolina scientists predict 39 inches of sealevel rise within the century North Carolina by its own law is only allowed to prepare for 8 King Canute would be so proud said Senator Sheldon Whitehouse of Rhode Island in a recent speech Congressional stalwarts are working new carbontax legislation but dont hold your breath This month during a freeforall of amendments in the Senate budget debate Whitehouse actually did propose a nonbinding resolution establishing a fee on carbon pollution The amendment failed 41 to 58 We were pretty stoked at how well it did It was 42 counting Frank Lautenberg who wasnt there Whitehouse said in a phone interview  Thats the ticket When all else fails were going for major league optimism The grandchildren will at least appreciate the perseverance

The Attack of the Killer Surplus,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/opinion/collins-the-attack-of-the-killer-surplus.html,Its not often we stop to ask ourselves Whats going on with North Dakota But I believe this is the moment The State Legislature has been in a kind of antiabortion meltdown piling up bills with whattheheck abandon The House and Senate passed a fetal heartbeat bill that would prohibit abortions when a woman was about six weeks into pregnancy They also each passed a fetal pain bill that would prohibit abortions at around 20 weeks Plus a resolution giving fetuses the rights of personhood which would not only prohibit abortion altogether but would also outlaw some forms of infertility treatment and contraception There was also a bill banning abortions on the basis of sex preference or possible genetic defects none of which would be detectable by the time abortions were already prohibited under some of the other bills The governor pretty much signed everything they threw at him Folded like a tent in a blizzard said an editorial in Fargos daily paper Opponents pointed out that while the House was busy protecting fetuses it had killed a bill providing free milk or juice to impoverished schoolchildren who had actually been born The Senate rectified that embarrassment sort of Theyre taking the money we give to school districts for atrisk children and saying you have to use that money to provide juice and milk programs said Corey Mock an assistant minority leader in the House  Things are in flux in North Dakota Anything could happen with the milk money Or the amendment to one antiabortion bill that would end a federally funded sex education program for homeless teenagers The bills the governor signed will probably be challenged in court including a law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges with a local hospital which could doom the states lone abortion provider the Red River Womens Clinic  North Dakota has a strong libertarian streak that comes to a screeching halt when it reaches reproduction rights Still this seemed out of character North Dakotans tend to be emotionally conservative they dont approve of getting carried away Last year voters soundly defeated a proposal to abolish all property taxes and a religious freedom law giving employers the right to refuse to provide health coverage for contraception A lot of people who found the ideas attractive still feared they carried the dreaded seeds of immoderation Middle of the road thats what they call the North Dakota Way said Jack Zaleski the opinion editor of Fargos daily This is the state that gave us national figures like Senator Kent Conrad who was famous for speeches that involved his extensive use of very boring charts and Senator Byron Dorgan who liked to remind people that he had been personally honored by the USA Dry Pea and Lentil Council I always admired that about North Dakota What happened For one thing the more aggressive wing of the antiabortion movement is trying to use the state to stage a test case against Roe v Wade In the last election several of these groups targeted Curtis Olafson a conservative Republican state senator who had derailed some of their more spectacular bills under the theory that they would just lead to court fights that North Dakota would eventually lose I hated to see taxpayers money go down the drain for an exercise in futility said Olafson who is now an exsenator having lost his seat in a nasty primary So theres paranoia But maybe the state also has too much money  Until recently North Dakota had a dwindling population and trouble balancing a very small state budget Then came the oil boom and multibilliondollar surpluses We could bail out Cyprus probably said Mike Jacobs the publisher of The Grand Forks Herald  Now the employment problem is a shortage of workers One of many issues that was not getting resolved while the Legislature worked on its abortion agenda is a preschool crisis in oilrich parts of the state They cant afford to keep staff at the childcare centers when fastfood restaurants are paying 15 to 16 an hour said Kylie Oversen a representative from Grand Forks When signing the fetal heartbeat bill Gov Jack Dalrymple admitted it would be immediately challenged in court and he seemed to share Olafsons dim view of success But hey if legislators want to give it a shot what the heck Theyve got cash The Legislative Assembly before it adjourns should appropriate dollars for a litigation fund available to the attorney general the governor suggested A shortage of money tends to keep things focused When a legislature starts going off the rails cool heads can pull the conversation back into line by reminding everybody that theyre supposed to be focusing on jobs jobs jobs It gets a little tiresome after a while but it does provide a muchneeded sense of direction While our Congress is certainly unsatisfactory in many ways its shown a lack of enthusiasm for having major fights over social issues in recent years possibly because everybody wants to look jobsjobsjobs obsessive North Dakota led astray by lucre Finally we

The Campaign to Outlaw Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/03/30/opinion/the-campaign-to-outlaw-abortion.html,Antiabortion groups have been trying to reimpose restrictions on abortion rights for 40 years but the Legislature and governor of North Dakota have taken this attack on womens reproductive health and freedom to a shocking new low by passing a bill that they must know perfectly well is unconstitutional by any reading of the 1973 Roe v Wade decision and others since Under those rulings full abortion bans are allowable only after fetal viability which the medical community generally considers to be around 24 weeks into pregnancy But North Dakota joins a growing list of states trying to set that limit earlier including Arkansas and its unconstitutional ban after 12 weeks enacted just three weeks ago North Dakotas Republican governor Jack Dalrymple signed extreme laws that went even further centering on a brazenly unconstitutional ban on nearly all abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detectable That could be as early as six weeks into pregnancy when some women do not even know they are pregnant and requires testing with a transvaginal ultrasound The sixweeks ban stands little chance of surviving a court challenge But bad ideas spread fast in this realm and these kinds of actions show the rising influence of a formerly fringe element of the antiabortion movement that is dissatisfied with its sides considerable progress in incrementally curbing abortions It is anxious to speed a case to the conservativedominated Supreme Court The campaign goes beyond abortion to the continuing Republican drive in Texas and other states to close down Planned Parenthood clinics that provide critical services like birth control counseling and cancer screenings So far nine states have acted to defund Planned Parenthood threatening preventive care relied upon by hundreds of thousands of people A pending bill in Arkansas takes the ultraextreme approach of barring any company that contracts with a health center that provides abortions or gives women information about all their pregnancy options from receiving any state contracts or public funds  In addition to the outright sixweeks ban Mr Dalrymple also approved a copy of a 2012 Mississippi statute which is under federal court challenge that requires doctors performing abortions to get admitting privileges at a local hospital That medically unnecessary requirement could shut down North Dakotas sole abortion provider  A third approved measure bars abortions for gender preference and also has the first bar on abortions based on genetic defects  And this is on top of the North Dakota Legislatures decision to put on next years ballot a socalled personhood measure that would give a fertilized egg the full range of individual rights and could outlaw abortion and threaten access to fertility treatments as well as to widely used forms of birth control Voters have defeated similar measures in Mississippi and Colorado The clear message is the need for a steppedup effort to hold state officials electorally accountable for policies that harm women in states where rightwing Republicans control the machinery of government 
Fight Against Gay Marriage Is Outdated,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/us/01iht-letter01.html,WASHINGTON  The substantive case against gay marriage collapsed in the US Supreme Court last week Legally Supreme Court watchers say advocates of samesex marriage wont win the sweeping victory they once anticipated as they made arguments last week The court is likely to overturn a California law which precludes samesex marriage on technical grounds The 17yearold US Defense of Marriage Act defining marriage as between a man and woman and thus denying US government spousal benefits to gays and lesbians almost certainly will be thrown out on the grounds that such decisions should be left to the states The upshot Gay marriage will be legal in 10 states including California and the District of Columbia The battle will continue to be waged by referendum and in state legislatures in the other 40 states with endless legal challenges These struggles will be framed by the two days of arguments before the court last week Whatever the legal outcome opponents came across as fighting battles of yesterday against a reality recognized by more and more American voters The central criticism of samesex marriage revolved around procreation that the purpose of marriage is to produce offspring These critics faltered when asked about infertile couples or senior citizens who get married If this were a serious basis for policy the best enforcement mechanism would be fertility tests before granting marriage licenses Justice Samuel A Alito Jr worried that the question was just too new that mobile phones and the Internet have been around longer Samesex marriages have only been legal anywhere in the United States for less than a decade though gay and lesbian couples have been living together some with adopted children for ages The woman who brought the case against the US law had been with her nowdeceased female spouse since 1967 Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr said proponents were showing inconsistency with their dual claims that children of samesex marriages fare as well as others and that legal recognition is necessary for the welfare of these kids Actually much research and many experts concur with both points Last month the American Academy of Pediatrics after an extensive review declared that allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry is in the best interests of children When critics worry this will lead to more adoptions by gay couples they ignore that the alternative often is for these children to suffer in orphanages or in a flawed fostercare system The chief justice offered a legitimate critique of President Barack Obama  the two arent fond of each other  wondering why he had continued to enforce the US statute if he considered it unconstitutional He also said politicians were falling all over each other to embrace samesex marriage There has been a pronounced shift in public and political opinion Only last year the Republican platform and presidential candidates were adamantly opposed to samesex marriage It may be that the political potency of gay marriagebashing in years past  ballot referendums in states like Ohio it is often declared were helpful to President George W Bushs 2004 reelection  was exaggerated We analyzed the returns and there was no difference in the turnout among social conservatives and evangelicals in states that had gay marriage on the ballot and those that didnt says Matthew Dowd who conducted Mr Bushs 2004 polling Its an urban myth  By 2012 the issue had become a political asset for Mr Obama said his campaign manager Jim Messina Its part of why we got a bigger youth turnout The best analogy for the arguments last week isnt the oftcited Roe v Wade abortion case or the Brown v Board of Education civilrights decision its Loving v Virginia the 1967 court decision that ruled unconstitutional a state prohibition on interracial marriage Mr Obama the son of an African man and a white American woman was then 5 years old and living in Hawaii Much as the court is likely to defer any definitive ruling on gay marriage this year back then it had ducked the antimiscegenation laws for more than a decade The more important similarity is the issue of harm or injury In the abortion controversy both sides legitimately claim severe harm results from an adverse ruling No one is legitimately hurt by interracial or gay marriage Thats why public opinion has changed The more transparent and open these relationships can be the more the irrational fears are allayed The threats to the institution of marriage are divorce and children born to single parents not gay and lesbian couples Theres one more analogy to Loving history is on the side of proponents of samesex marriage The conventional wisdom is that the court will vote 5to4 in these cases with Justice Anthony M Kennedy in the role of swing vote Dont be surprised if Chief Justice Roberts who is 58 and expects to remain chief justice for a long time doesnt fight history 
On Chinaâ€™s State-Sponsored Amnesia,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/opinion/on-chinas-state-sponsored-amnesia.html,Beijing  IN March 2012 I met Torbjorn Loden the Swedish professor of Chinese language and culture in Hong Kong He told me that while briefly teaching at Hong Kongs City University he asked the 40 students from China in his class what they knew about the June 4 Incident the prodemocracy movement that ended in bloodshed in 1989 and if they were familiar with the names Liu Binyan and Fang Lizhi two prominent democracy advocates of that era All the students from China looked around at one another mute and puzzled That reminded me of something another teacher told me She had asked her students from China if they had heard about the death by starvation of 30 to 40 million people during the socalled three years of natural disasters in the early 1960s Her students responded with stunned silence as if she a teacher in Hong Kong was brazenly fabricating history to attack their mother country After we exchanged these stories Professor Loden and I sat sullenly in a quiet Vietnamese caf speechless Ever since thoughts about the loss of memory in China on a national scale a phenomenon that people have long been discussing but only in private remain lodged in my heart like thorns From time to time guilt  along with painful memories of the past and thoughts about losing the memories  torment me and refuse to leave me alone Have todays 20 and 30yearolds become the amnesic generation Who has made them forget By what means were they made to forget Are we members of the older generation who still remember the past responsible for the younger generations amnesia The amnesia Im talking about is the act of deleting memories rather than merely a natural process of forgetting Forgetting can result from the passage of time The act of deleting memories however is about actively winnowing out peoples memories of the present and the past In China memory deletion is turning the younger generation into selectivememory automatons Memories of history and the present yesterday and today are all going through this uniform process of deletion and are being lost without trace I used to assume history and memory would always triumph over temporary aberrations and return to their rightful place It now appears the opposite is true In todays China amnesia trumps memory Lies are surpassing the truth Fabrications have become the logical link to fill historical gaps Even memories of events that have only just taken place are being discarded at a dazzling pace with barely intelligible fragments all that remain for people to hold on to Revolution completely engulfed China after 1949 The revolution created the regime created history and it created our present reality Peoples memories and administered memories peoples forgetfulness and administered forgetfulness are all determined by the state transformed by a revolutionary tactic that has been systematically implemented Historical details are selectively excised from the records and from textbooks Details of events that still reside in the living memory of older Chinese  the Warlord era of the late 1910s and 1920s names of soldiers and civilians who shed their blood on the front lines during the war of resisting Japans invasion that began in the 1930s  all these things have been carefully winnowed After the civil war ended in 1949 one mans passion drove an entire nation to a frenzied pace of construction with one political movement after another maintaining the fanatical atmosphere of a permanent war footing But the tragic experiences associated with these movements have been deleted from peoples collective memory put aside and permanently concealed The Great Leap Forward the obligatory nationwide construction of backyard steel furnaces and the consequent death by starvation of 30 to 40 million people in the famine that was later blamed on three years of natural disasters and the catastrophic 10 years of the Cultural Revolution  these momentous events are too absurd too cruel and too unpleasant for people to recount Therefore many people are reluctant to pass their painful memories on to the younger generation Not a word is written about how many Chinese or Vietnamese died in the pointless war with Vietnam in the late 1970s Few questions are asked about the crackdown on criminals in 1983 in which people were thrown in jail in the name of curtailing public indecency simply for kissing in public or executed for povertyrelated petty theft While the whole world still vividly remembers the tragic end of the June 4 student movement in 1989 the painful memory is lost in the country where the bloodshed took place in the midst of cheers for Chinas economic growth and increased influence What else is lost to memory Everything that has happened in recent times the AIDS epidemic caused by unhygienic blood selling the innumerable explosions in illegal coal mines the modern day slavery that takes place in illegal brick kilns the rampant production of toxic milk powder toxic eggs toxic seafood gutter oil carcinogenic vegetables and fruit forced abortions violent demolitions mistreatment of petitioners  the list goes on and on Anything negative about the country or the regime will be rapidly erased from the collective memory This memory deletion is being carried out by censoring newspapers magazines television news the Internet and anything that preserves memories This amnesia with Chinese characteristics doesnt just affect individuals it also affects China as a nation Some people say Let bygones by bygones we must look forward Consolation perhaps for an individuals suffering but it is no consolation for an entire peoples loss of memory Others say If we dont look forward we wont have a bright future This might be a good piece of advice for people who hide in the past but it is hardly constructive for people who surrender themselves to memory deletion This stateadministered amnesia is similar to territorial defense in the animal kingdom Its about survival The best way to achieve this type of amnesia is to develop tactics utilizing state power to shackle peoples minds and block all memory channels by altering historical records manipulating textbook content and controlling literature art and performances in all forms The oppression of words and ideas is not unique It has been exercised by all authoritarian regimes around the world at various times Under oppression intellectuals  the people who are supposed to have good memories  are the first to become silent after being administered amnesia by the state Next comes the general public The state prefers the intelligence of its people to remain at the level of children in a kindergarten It hopes people will follow instructions just as children follow their teachers instructions  they eat when they are told to eat they sleep when they are told to sleep When they are asked to perform these innocent children enthusiastically recite the script prepared by adults To achieve this the brains of people who have memories must be reformatted voices of people who are good with words must be silenced so that the memory of younger generations wont be contaminated Then these spotlessly clean young brains are like blank pages at the disposal of the states paintbrush Only then can a new version of history and a new image of reality be painted on these pages according to the taste of the state Naturally the innocent children who have been deprived of the chance of knowing what really happened in the past accept the artificial version of history and grow up malnourished in their understanding of the past As time goes by the states absolute power becomes a matter of fact and this marks the triumph of state administered amnesia Our tolerance to this type of amnesia originates from the states carrotandstick strategies that are designed to achieve the nations memory loss Thirty years ago the instruments used against people who resisted statesponsored amnesia were ropes and chains Now as Chinas economy grows and the state has an enormous amount of money at its disposal it skillfully uses financial incentives to entice people into giving up their memories and to compromise with the state In this country money now has an almighty power that can seal peoples lips and dry writers pens It can also force literary imagination to fly in the opposite direction of truth and conscience It doesnt matter whether you are a writer a historian or social scientist You will be awarded power fame and money as long as you are willing to see what is allowed to be seen and look away from what is not allowed to be looked at as long as you are willing to sing the praises of what needs to be praised and ignore what needs to be blanked out In other words our amnesia is a statesponsored sport Lets look at literature and art Almost all awards in China in the fields of literature art news and culture are administered within stateapproved boundaries They encourage people to exercise their creativity within the stateapproved boundaries The ones who achieve success within these boundaries are rewarded Naturally we thus replace the forgotten past with fiction and build splendid lies over reality And we do this without feeling any sense of moral guilt  its all in the noble name of artistic creativity Consequently truth is buried conscience is castrated and our language is raped by money and power Lies meaningless words and pretentioussounding blather become the official language used by the government taught by our teachers and adopted by the world of art and literature This kind of language is also creeping into the lives of ordinary people There are currently two conflicting language systems in China One belongs to the state the other to ordinary people Why Why are ordinary people repeatedly calling for government officials to speak human language and do human things These requests reflect peoples resistance to the official version of memories that has been administered to them The state is not the only player to be blamed for the nations amnesia in todays China We must also look at Chinese intellectuals as we appear to be content with this forced amnesia This is the starkest difference between Chinese intellectuals and our peers in other countries in different times Take writers in the former Soviet Union as examples Despite the extreme totalitarian terror and the rigid censorship writers such as Mikhail Bulgakov Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn and Boris Pasternak still managed to leave us with a long list of masterpieces such as The Master and Margarita the Gulag Archipelago and Doctor Zhivago These works did not rebel against state power they are more about preserving and restoring a nations memories Todays China is no longer a hermetically sealed nation as it was just a few decades ago The economic window in China is wide open to the world now The other window however the political window is still tightly shuttered because the state is determined to cling to its power to control And the secret of stateadministered amnesia with Chinese characteristics lies in the different condition of the two windows The mind of the state is keeping a watchful eye on the windows and what people are writing but no one is allowed to keep a watchful eye on the mind of the state Our acceptance of stateadministered amnesia can be seen as a tacit understanding among men of letters who appease the states power It is a wise mans compromise  after all one of the windows is open Light is allowed in Our world is brighter than before In this part of the world laws dont mean much when it comes to preserving our memory and preventing amnesia They dont protect our freedom of speech freedom of information or freedom of publication nor do they protect peoples rights to remember what happened in the past Everything depends on our leaders morals and how openminded these leaders are The one opened window we have now is more a small mercy bestowed by the powerful at a permissive moment than a victory won by intellectuals because of our persistent quest for openness Someone who has spent years in a dark cell is bound to be grateful if a window in his cell is unshuttered and some light is allowed in Would he dare to ask for the prison gate to be opened for him At least today we are allowed to breathe some air so whats the point of sacrificing ourselves for a breeze that might come tomorrow  thats the reasoning behind the silence of Chinese writers and intellectuals in the face of stateadministered amnesia Gradually we become accustomed to amnesia and we question people who ask questions Gradually we lose our memories of what happened to our nation in the past then we lose the sense of whats happening in our nation at present and finally we run the risk of losing memories about ourselves about our childhood our love our happiness and pain Yet just as in any kindergarten there are always a few naughty children who dont like to be told what to do There are always some people who refuse to be administered amnesia They are always trying to speak in their own words always spreading their creative wings to fly beyond the boundaries of official memory Following their conscience they are willing to fly anywhere into the past the present or the future in order to produce works that can pass our memories onto younger generations Of course whether or not a piece of art or a literary work can carry our memories is not the only thing that needs to be considered when we judge the quality of a work However whether preserving memory is allowed is the most valuable parameter to measure the greatness maturity and degree of tolerance of a nation It has been over 30 years since China opened its economic window China now is more prosperous and is stronger than it was 30 years ago I believe China should also be mature enough to reflect on and remember its past The late Chinese writer Ba Jin had a dream for preserving memory  to build a museum in China devoted to the Cultural Revolution the revolution that took place in the 1960s and 1970s and turned the nation into a madhouse Carrying on Ba Jins dream I also have a nave hope I hope one day a memorial to amnesia engraved with all our nations painful memories of the last century can be erected on Tiananmen Square I believe a truly great people are people who have the courage to remember their own past and a truly great nation is a nation that has the courage to record its own history  Yan Lianke is a Chinese writer based in Beijing His translated works include Serve the People Dream of Ding Village about the bloodselling scandal in his home province of Henan and Lenins Kisses This article was adapted from a longer essay and translated from the Chinese by Jane Weizhen Pan and Martin Merz A German

Outlawing Abortion Wonâ€™t Help Children with Down Syndrome,https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/01/outlawing-abortion-wont-help-children-with-down-syndrome/,"My daughter like all kids is a delight and a lot of work Now 4 she talks nonstop although her speech isnt always comprehensible She reads She performs class conversations for me What does a cow
                                        say Moo Great work Maybelle This evening she sang me Im Just a Girl Who Cant Say No from Oklahoma a song that in my daughters case is clearly
                                        untrue because she excels at saying no Maybelle has Down syndrome a condition I knew almost nothing about before she was born During the four years she has been alive I have been repeatedly surprised by her curiosity her individual sense of humor and
                                        how much she has accomplished She doesnt fit the stereotypes at all For this reason it is troubling to me that rates of termination for pregnancies where Down syndrome is identified are extremely high
                                        The most recent research suggests that for every child born with Down syndrome another is terminated
                                        With the increasing availability of noninvasive prenatal tests that can take place within the first few weeks of pregnancy many in the Down syndrome and disability rights communities fear that abortion rates will
                                        skyrocket that a process often identified as eugenic will escalate and that Down syndrome will essentially be eliminated  at least among those with the resources for prenatal testing and the desire to
                                        terminate
                                     That is why some parents of children with Down syndrome are celebrating the news that North Dakota has become the first state to outlaw abortion for fetal conditions like Down syndrome One parent wrote that it
                                        felt like a small victory seeing that abortions based on Down syndrome were banned  like saying see individuals with Down syndrome are valued and protected But outlawing abortion is not a reasonable response to this situation A woman who does not want to be pregnant wont stay pregnant if there are any mechanisms in place for her to have an abortion  As part of my research for a book on prenatal testing and reproductive decisionmaking I have talked with women who terminated their pregnancies when they learned that the fetus had Down syndrome For most of these
                                        women abortion was an incredibly painful decision These were wanted pregnancies in which the fetus was already identified as a child and often even named Repeatedly women told me that they ended the pregnancy not because they wanted a perfect child as one woman said I dont know what perfect child even means but
                                        because they recognized that the world is a difficult place for people with intellectual disabilities One woman told me The thing is I could not in good conscience from the getgo know that my child has these setbacks in life Another identified adulthood as the challenge There is no part
                                        of caring for an infant or schoolaged child with Down syndrome that we didnt think we could handle We chose to terminate mostly on the basis of our understanding of the challenges and quality of life he
                                        and our family would face ifwhen he lived to be over age 21 his middle age and end of life  Another woman talked quite a bit about rape She was assaulted as a child she knew that the statistics for sexual abuse were high for people with intellectual disabilities and she was determined that her daughter
                                        would not experience that so that was one of the reasons she terminated her pregnancy She referred to her abortion several times as the protective choice  All these women grieved but did not regret their abortions A state law banning abortion would not have stopped them from terminating their pregnancies it would just have made an incredibly difficult process even
                                        more difficult for them Indeed more than one mother I spoke with traveled out of state for her abortion because the pregnancy was too advanced for her to have an abortion in her home state If North Dakota really does want it to be a great day for babies in North Dakota and
                                        wants to prove that a civil society does not discriminate against people  for their sex or for disability                                        it should make the state a welcoming place for people with disabilities The state could take the cash reserves it has put aside for legal challenges to its laws and use those funds to train public schools to be
                                        meaningfully inclusive as all the best research shows is the way to go It could provide easily accessible medical care and early intervention The state could develop independent  but supported 
                                        housing for adults with intellectual disabilities so that there are not waiting lists years long It could improve criminal justice responses to rape  indeed North Dakota could become a state that works
                                        to prevent rape by training men not to be rapists Let women have abortions for whatever reason they choose but make it a world they would like to bring a child into  even a child with an intellectual disability"

"In Washington, Abortion Debate Counters Trend",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/02/us/washington-state-abortion-debate-counters-the-trend.html,OLYMPIA Wash  The legality or availability of abortion is under challenge from North Dakota to Arkansas this spring as conservative state legislatures throw down roadblocks But here in this corner of the Far West winds may blow the other way  Washington already was the only state ever to have legalized abortion through a popular vote  in 1970 three years before the United States Supreme Court defined the national legal terrain on the issue in Roe v Wade  and is now debating a law that would require health insurers to pay for an elective abortion  It is a lonely conversation national advocates for abortion choice said  Conservative hostility to the changes looming under the federal health care overhaul formally the Affordable Care Act and a widespread belief that a majority on the Supreme Court might be ready to overturn the Roe v Wade precedent the advocates said have combined to rekindle a brush fire that mostly blazes in one direction In addition an influx of Republicans swept into many statehouses starting with midterm elections in 2010 States are overwhelmingly ruled by antichoice politicians said Donna Crane policy director for the National Abortion Rights Action League which is based in Washington DC The Affordable Care Act has probably added some extra octane to the efforts from our opponents The result she said is an uptick in bills The bill here HB 1044 also known as the Reproductive Parity Act passed in the Democratcontrolled State House in February by a 53to43 vote A backer of the bill in the Senate said Monday at a packed public hearing before the Senate Health Care Committee that 25 senators out of 49 have signed on to vote yes if the measure reaches the floor But people on both sides of the question said the crux of the bill came down to choice  a word intertwined with the language of abortion for many years now loaded with new shades of meaning about fineprint insurance coverage mandates and fairness Opponents said the bill would require a provision of health insurance coverage  paying for abortions  that many people do not want and do not want to be part of even by doing business with a company that provides it Supporters said that since the federal health care law allowed insurance carriers to opt out of covering abortion many might well do so when the law kicks in next January unless the state steps in now with new rules  The bill was amended in the House to provide for a religious conscience exemption for an employer or insurance carrier that opposes abortion but opponents said the language was vague and contradictory and would provide no protection or could lead to expensive lawsuits against those who decide to opt out for religious reasons This is also a bullying bill that forces people who oppose abortion to be part of a system that permits abortions said Angela Connelly president of the Washington Womens Network which she described as an advocacy group working on issues including human trafficking and elder abuse We cannot insist on one agenda oppressing another The chief executive officer of Planned Parenthood Votes Northwest Elaine Rose said the question was about maintaining access to abortion that Washingtonians have said repeatedly since 1970 that they want and expect She said the federal health care law though passed mostly by Democrats in Congress could complicate abortion access in socially liberal Washington State through its rules Since the enactment of the Affordable Care Act in March 2010 at least 17 states have enacted legislation to restrict coverage for abortion in their insurance exchanges according to the National Conference of State Legislatures Today every carrier and nearly every plan in Washington already covers abortion Ms Rose told the panel of senators The Reproductive Parity Act will keep it that way Politics in Olympia and especially in the State Senate are anything but simple this year making predictions difficult Although the Democrats have 26 seats to 23 for the Republicans the Republican minority was joined in December by two Democrats creating a bipartisan ruling group The coalitions majority leader Senator Rodney Tom a Democrat supports abortion rights but many of the members of the coalition he leads go the other way That means that if the bill reaches the floor passage would require a flip side of the leadership coalition  Democrats leading the yes votes presumably with Senator Tom back among his old caucus  Gov Jay Inslee a Democrat elected in November is a strong supporter of the Reproductive Parity Act and has urged the Senate to move forward on it In North Dakota by contrast the momentum mostly has gone the other way Gov Jack Dalrymple a Republican signed a bill into law last month prohibiting most abortions after a detectable heartbeat is present  essentially banning almost any abortion since a heartbeat can be found even before many women even know they are pregnant Arkansass legislature passed a law over the veto of Gov Mike Beebe a Democrat banning any abortion after 12 weeks Mondays hearing which was restricted to two hours left dozens of people unable to speak and some were cut off if they veered from a focus on the bill or

Justice Ginsburgâ€™s Misdirection,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/opinion/justice-ginsburgs-misdirection-ahead-of-the-gay-marriage-rulings.html,With two samesex marriage cases before the Supreme Court numerous commentators have latched on to remarks by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg critical of the courts 1973 Roe v Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide It is not the judgment that was wrong but it moved too far too fast she said at Columbia Law School last year a view she has expressed in various speeches and law review articles As one of the courts moderate liberals and a champion of womens rights she is now being routinely cited to argue for a timid resolution on the issue of samesex marriage that would strike down Californias ban on such marriages but would leave prohibitions standing in about 40 other states  How Justice Ginsburg will vote on samesex marriage is unknown But her comments misread the legal and political landscape at the time of the Roe decision and have been used to bolster the inaccurate notion that the courts ruling on abortion rights somehow shortcircuited a political process that was moving in the states to end criminalization of abortion Some now argue that a toxic multidecade backlash against abortion rights could have been avoided if the court had given states more time to act  supposedly a cautionary lesson for marriage equality  The real story as explained by Linda Greenhouse a former New York Times reporter who now teaches at Yale Law School and Reva Siegel a professor there is that political conflict over abortion was escalating before the Roe decision and that state progress on decriminalization had reached a standstill in the face of opposition from the Roman Catholic Church  In 1970 a measure legalizing abortion in New York cleared the State Assembly by just a single vote Only a veto by the states Republican governor Nelson Rockefeller blocked its partial repeal two years later Had the Supreme Court waited for the states to move women in a large portion of the country would still be denied the fundamental right to make their own childbearing decisions The claim that the court invited a backlash by getting too far ahead of public opinion does not hold At the time of the ruling a Gallup poll showed a substantial majority of Americans favored letting the abortion decision be made solely by a woman and her physician with more Republicans than Democrats in favor In fact at the confirmation hearing for Justice John Paul Stevens in 1975 not a single question about Roe v Wade was posed  There is bound to be conflict and opposition when minorities pursue their rights whether legislatively in the voting booth or in the courts But fear of an angry reaction from some groups cannot be the reason to deny people basic rights As for Roe v Wade Ms Greenhouse and Ms Siegel persuasively conclude that the political polarization around abortion owes more to political realignment and the vehemence and perseverance of abortion opponents than general public anger at the courts ruling which was grounded in a constitutional right to privacy that flowed naturally from a line of previous decisions  Even before the Roe decision the Republican effort to use abortion as a political wedge issue was evident In 1972 Republican strategists seized upon the abortion issue to help President Richard Nixon win reelection by dividing the Democrats and winning support from Catholics and social conservatives The socalled backlash was a political creation that was cultivated and nourished This may seem like ancient history But there is a danger now that overblown fears of a backlash based on a false reading of politics before and after Roe v Wade could lead the Supreme Court to shy from doing as it should  enforcing equal protection by declaring samesex marriage a constitutionally protected right in every state
Playing It Safe,https://latitude.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/03/free-condom-campaign-is-a-pragmatic-shift-in-vietnams-approach-to-safer-sex/,"HO CHI MINH CITY  There had been some safesex campaigns in Vietnam before university students walking around campus dressed up as condoms a video game by USAID                                        teaching men to use protection with prostitutes and even a stylish condom dress designed for World AIDS day Now government
                                        officials have started doing their part too by calling on all hotels in the city to distribute free condoms Some hotels already carry free contraceptives courtesy of a limited districtlevel effort from last year At one love hotel in a workingclass neighborhood far from the city center a large yellowandblue sign announces
                                        rooms for 240 per hour Inside the owner shows me a basket of condoms given to her by local officials they told her to call them when she runs out Before guests would ask for condoms but we didnt
                                        have any she says This is more convenient and comfortable for them  Last month apparently realizing that earlier campaigns to discourage extramarital sex have failed local authorities decreed that condoms should be made available for free They wont be supplying or paying
                                        for them but the announcement itself clears up uncertainties for hotel owners who had been worried that by providing condoms they might be breaking antiprostitution laws The Ho Chi Minh government hopes the initiative will help limit unwanted pregnancies and the spread of sexually transmitted diseases Onequarter million Vietnamese have HIV according to USAID                                        And a representative of the UN Population Fund in Hanoi told me that in Vietnam more than 22 fetuses are aborted for every 100 babies born Other estimates are much higher The authorities are targeting hotels because thats where most extramarital sex happens Vietnamese customarily live with their parents until they start their own families and sometimes even after that Those
                                        who move out early tend to share cramped quarters with friends Privacy is in short supply For their nighttime trysts some young people resort to parks riverbanks or the back of motorbikes Many choose guest houses I think if you want to have sex its better to go to a hotel says

                                        to distribute free condoms in hotels partly because Vietnamese teenagers are very shy about contraception That reticence might explain why according to one study just 42 percent of 15 to 24yearolds here understand the risks of HIV                                        and why according to another survey 16 percent of young people think condoms are only for prostitutes
                                        It also might explain why Vietnam has one of the highest abortion rates in the world
                                     Many Vietnamese parents would still prefer that their children save sex until after marriage its a good thing the countrys Communist leaders are more realistic about what actually happens That goes
                                        not only for sex among teenagers but also for prostitution  One study by USAID found that 40 percent of Vietnamese men have had sex with prostitutes and according to the Labor Ministry 20 percent of prostitutes in Hanoi and 16 percent in Ho Chi Minh City have HIV                                        For a time the authorities approach to the problem was repression and stigmatization Prostitutes would be sent to rehabilitation centers
                                        But after the United Nations and Human Rights Watch called the policy counterproductive the Vietnamese
                                        government has changed its approach Instead of focusing on preventing prostitution it is trying to prevent the spread of associated health problems Distributing free condoms in hotels  and so putting them in the hands of prostitutes clients  should help Sex workers rarely provide such protection                                        themselves for fear that the police will treat it as evidence of their illegal activities The city authorities unmoralizing condomdistribution campaign marks a welcome shift away from the punitive toward the practical Whats more in adopting such a pragmatic approach to sex especially
                                        among young people and prostitutes they arent just taking the lead in addressing the risks of unprotected sex They are also getting ahead of this stilltraditional society"
Alabama Legislature Passes New Limits on Abortion Clinics,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/04/us/alabama-legislature-approves-abortion-clinic-limits.html,The Alabama Legislature late Tuesday adopted stringent new regulations for abortion clinics that supporters called a step to protect women but that others called medically unnecessary and a disguised effort to force the closing of the states five abortion clinics The bill like measures passed last year in Mississippi and Tennessee and last month in North Dakota would require that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at local hospitals Several of Alabamas clinics rely on doctors who fly in from out of state and given the hostile political climate it appears unlikely that nearby hospitals would grant them such privileges said Nikema Williams vice president for public policy of Planned Parenthood Southeast which runs two of the clinics A similar admissions requirement passed last year in Mississippi would shut down that states only abortion clinic but enforcement is stayed while a federal court decides whether the law amounts to an unjustified infringement on access to abortion Another clause in the Alabama bill would require clinics to meet the building equipment and staffing standards of ambulatory surgery centers which would require some clinics to spend millions of dollars altering buildings and buying beds and monitoring equipment for what they say is no relevant medical purpose The bill will be sent to Gov Robert Bentley a Republican who previously said he planned to sign it The American Civil Liberties Union said that if the bill becomes law it is likely to sue to block it The Alabama measure is part of a spreading effort by antiabortion groups to tighten the regulation of abortion clinics Such laws seldom receive the attention of more sweeping bans on early abortions like those recently adopted in Arkansas and North Dakota to protect the fetus once a heartbeat is detected but are increasingly disruptive said Carole Joffe a sociologist at the University of California San Francisco who studies abortion laws and support abortion rights Those other laws may sound more drastic she said of the bans on early abortions but one assumes the Supreme Court will not uphold them Its the more reasonablesounding things like hallway width or requiring a doctor to have local admitting privileges that some courts will possibly approve Dr Joffe said These have the capacity to be much more devastating to the ability to provide abortion care Dan McConchie vice president for legislative affairs of Americans United for Life said stricter regulations of doctors and facilities represented a genuine effort to ensure that if clinics are going to operate they operate to high standards that protect womens health and safety His organization with headquarters in Washington has offered sample regulatory laws to state legislators including those in Alabama If youre genuinely concerned about womens health then you want the doctor to have the ability to care for complications he said of the proposed rules Abortion rights supporters said that the endangered clinics in Mississippi and elsewhere had arrangements with local doctors and hospitals to handle emergencies and that requiring the visiting doctor to have admitting privileges offered no extra safety Mr McConchie replied These are the doctors performing the procedure they are the ones with greatest knowledge of what happened in an emergency Admittingprivilege requirements have been adopted so far in Arizona Kansas Mississippi Tennessee Utah and North Dakota according to Elizabeth Nash state issues manager with the Guttmacher Institute a research group in Washington that supports abortion rights The rule in Tennessee forced the closing last year of one of Knoxvilles two clinics Mr Bentley as he praised the proposed clinic and physician regulations on March 5 spoke of more than medical safety saying We need to remember we are dealing with human life and this is what God expects us to do according to The Associated Press Ms Williams of Planned Parenthood said in an interview on Wednesday If the politicians really cared about the health and welfare of women theyd be working with us to address the poor health outcomes for women in Alabama
Our Lady of the Fragile Humanity,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/theater/colm-toibin-on-the-genesis-of-his-testament-of-mary.html,Every night from as early as I can remember the family knelt in the evening and said the rosary Each mystery as they were called had 10 Hail Marys the first part of each Hail Mary was recited by a single voice and then the second part  Holy Mary Mother of God pray for us sinners now and at the hour of our death Amen  by the rest of the family in unison At the end my mother would recite some extra prayers including the Memorare which began Remember O most gracious Virgin Mary that never was it known that anyone who sought thy aid or implored thy intercession was left unaided  The spirit of the language of some of those prayers have made their way into the tone and texture of my new play The Testament of Mary I was trained as an altar boy in my town in the southeast of Ireland where I learned how to assist with the rituals of the Mass I learned to kneel genuflect serve the priest ring the bells The Roman Catholic Church and its rituals were so much part of life that although my parents would often question a small matter of dogma and none of us seemed more religious than anyone else no one ever questioned the rituals or the basic tenets of belief  Our Lady in all her glory was as much Queen of Ireland as she was Queen of Heaven The partition of Ireland had created a Roman Catholic state in the south and most people seemed content with that The dutiful Mother of God inspired the dutiful mother who stayed at home and was meant to remain meek One clause of Article 412 of the Irish Constitution of 1937 which is still in place to this day reads The State recognizes that by her life within the home woman gives to the state a support without which the common good cannot be achieved  In my 20s as I began to travel in Europe I found comfort in religious paintings Even though my own belief in Catholic dogma had been shaken and weakened I found that the beauty and the richness of the art still held me  One day in a secular space close to the Frari in Venice I found Tintorettos painting of the Crucifixion It was filled with untidy life Tintoretto made the scene chaotic rather than redemptive or noble It made me wonder what it might have been like to have been there on Calvary that day and to have witnessed the death of Jesus on the cross it made me wonder how different it might have actually been from the account in the Gospels In those years as I came into my 30s I needed as much Catholic art as I could get to keep the anger at bay about what was happening in Ireland and indeed in Catholicism Divorce was still banned under the Irish Constitution Efforts to make contraception easily available were proving immensely difficult  As the AIDS crisis became apparent access to condoms was restricted Even though abortion was illegal in 1983 a clause was inserted into the Constitution copperfastening the ban The old Victorian laws against homosexuality were still on the statute books until the early 1990s As a gay man living in Ireland I and people like me found it easy to feel less than citizens  The church I was brought up in seemed not a place of comfort as much as an institution frozen in its own rules and rituals Its position was not helped by the revelations about priests sexually abusing children some of which happened in the very school I attended  As a writer I had an easy time ignoring this and finding other stories to tell If I needed to attack the church I could write an article or a pamphlet I had in any case my own private demons and I was busy finding forms in fiction for them I left other people to try to reform Ireland  But nothing is ever as simple as that The line between the private and the public under uneasy pressures can become blurred In Ireland novels and plays still have a strange force The writing of fiction and the creation of theatrical images can affect life there more powerfully and stealthily than speeches or even legislation Imagined worlds can lodge deeply in the private sphere dislodging much else especially when the public sphere is fragile  Toward the end of 2008 there appeared almost a vacuum of faith in Ireland Revelations about the sexual abuse of children put pressure on the Catholic church and the gradual waning of religious practice especially among younger people took hold I thought of writing a play in which the Virgin Mary the silent woman we prayed to would speak But the impulse to write the play was not political was not to intervene in a debate about the church but rather to work with a voice that had mattered to me personally a voice that was iconic as well as human  I realized that I was playing with fire Some neighbors and indeed some friends despite their views on the Catholic church itself still had a deep devotion to Mary as the grieving mother of God all the more to be worshiped with intensity and prayed to in time of need  Slowly as I began to work it was clear to me how much persistent power those views of Mary have Even in my pages Mary indeed remained an icon I wished to give her a voice let her speak but I had no interest in reducing her or bringing her down to size  I wanted to create a mortal woman someone who has lived in the world Her suffering would have to be real her memory exact her tone urgent But she would also have to live at some distance from the rest of us  She would inhabit a real house but it could not be the house next door She would have to have grandeur in her tone as well as a deep fragility There could be nothing however in between I realized how hard and challenging this would be for a director and an actress  I worked in short sharp bursts as though there would not be much time The best images came at night The sources for Marys life  the four Gospels  were often no help I needed to create her version of the story I needed to find her voice and follow it respect it but also wield and shape it  Having seen great performances in the Irish theater by actresses like Siobhan McKenna Fiona Shaw and Marie Mullen made an enormous difference to me as I worked In their performances the act of utterance itself took on a sort of soaring nervous power I wrote the play and had a workshop of the text with Ms Mullen and the director Garry Hynes for a production at the Dublin Theater Festival I will never forget the silence in the theater there as it became clear to the audience that Ms Mullen the figure on the stage was Mary in all her humanity Afterward I rewrote the text extended it and published it as a novel And then for the Broadway production I rewrote the original play with the images starker the voice even more urgent and filled with human pain  I was aware as I worked on this production with  Ms Shaw and the director Deborah Warner of the work they had done before I was aware of the fierce level of commitment they had offered to every single word or nuance in those plays in which women turned vulnerability into a kind of strength by the use of voice plays in which a womans anger her power her politics her wit could be made flesh I had seen Ms Shaw play Hedda Gabler Medea and Winnie in Becketts Happy Days in Dublin I had been part of the awed and transformed audiences there  I knew however that The Testament of Mary was going to take even more work it carried greater risks because there is no one but Mary on the stage Thus there is no casual conversation Every word had to pay its way stand alone hit its mark I sat with director and actress as they parsed and studied and tested every single word They were looking for a real figure within the icon so that every image would be a display of single suffering woman without losing sight of the spiritual and the iconic As I worked on the text I had had in mind something that could not be taken lightly by an audience  Now as I watched Ms Shaw preparing to do the part I realized that she was an interpreter whose commitment to theater at its most pure and risky and dangerous and public was even more developed than mine and even more exacting But in the end I realized that we were both working out of the self at its most secret and dark and private  Both of us had Irish Catholic childhoods We knew the same prayers We had arrived too at a time in our lives when we could forget about anger and allow something else to emerge from all that beauty and all that faith We could imagine what it might have been like in a time of turmoil for a woman to go through immense suffering a woman who was human and mortal before she became the exalted figure to whom we prayed 
The Sane Women Behind the Unraveling Men,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/arts/television/mad-men-season-6-focuses-more-on-women.html,The 60s came to an end and so after the seventh and final season will Mad Men And that makes Season 6 which begins on Sunday night on AMC feel a little like an office retirement party  Life isnt over by any means  new paths can form  but character and destiny are set Death meanwhile is creeping up  Don Draper Jon Hamm hasnt changed his ways The last sight viewers had of him at the end of Season 5 was much like the very first one the ad man was drinking alone in a smoky bar He was divorced from the first wife and married to a new one but his modus operandi was intact When a pretty woman sidled up to ask if he was unaccompanied the episode closed on Dons silent wolfish stare  As he put it himself on a different occasion What is happiness Its a moment before you need more happiness  On Sundays twohour premiere audiences can see Don surrender to just such a moment and then once again shake it off and move on And his bad behavior is the constant in a world that keeps rushing to embrace the next new thing Its now the late 60s at the advertising agency Sterling Cooper Draper Pryce Secretaries dress like Judy Carne on LaughIn the men in creative are growing mustaches and the stiffs in accounts have longer sideburns  The pleasure of Mad Men is not in discovery anymore its in the affirmation that there is still some invention left in a series that took audiences by surprise and then kept them hooked even when the novelty wore off Most dramas that last more than a few years have difficulty keeping up with the times Mad Men is defined by its period and each tremor in that convulsive decade  the Kennedy assassination civil rights Vietnam drugs  has shaped a season and helped drive the narrative  So its a tribute to the writers and the shows creator Matthew Weiner that most characters are so well imagined and enigmatic that they never seem like mere caricatures of the period  even when gray flannel suits and skinny ties give way to paisley ties vests and gogo boots  Theres been an amazing amount of soap opera in Mad Men  affairs abortions divorces suicide heroin addiction even a Hare Krishna conversion  but the series has not yet become laughable mostly because it has never lost its dark sense of humor But the women of the show more than the men are the ones who defy expectations and break ground The show about socalled mad men was always a paean to the sane women who serve them As the series prepares to shut down the men seem spent and preoccupied by death its the women who keep us wanting just a little bit more Time is on their side and so are the writers Peggy Elisabeth Moss and Joan Christina Hendricks began as secretaries and fought their way out of the steno pool and into careers of their own a step ahead of the mainstream womens movement And here at least there is no backlash  On Mad Men its been the stayathome mothers who seem distracted and neglectful while the working mothers like Joan handing off her baby to her mother to race out the door and back to the office seem nurturing Peggy who put her unwanted infant up for adoption in the first season isnt very maternal with her subordinates but she does seem happily married to her work  Its Betty January Jones raising her three children with a loving new husband who appears childless  barren in feeling if not in fact When Megan Jessica Par filled in as a baby sitter she was more loving to Bettys children than Betty though she lost a little of her Sound of Music sweetness once she became their stepmother  Megans mother Marie Julia Ormond so glamorous and well mannered has turned out to be as cool and exacting as a casting director When Megan took to her bed defeated and depressed Marie was not surprised This is what happens when you have the artistic temperament but you are not an artist she told Don Trudy Alison Brie is a devoted mother who also babies her husband Pete Vincent Kartheiser a man so bored by his wife that he was driven to an affair  and the edge of despair Speaking for all men it seems Pete described his family life last season as a temporary bandage on a permanent wound  None of these imperfect mothers are as repellent as Pauline Pamela Dunlap Bettys motherinlaw In the premiere Pauline has a chance to display her special incongruous blend of neurotic neediness and deadpan cruelty  Particularly when measured against all these unusual undefinable women the men of Mad Men conform to type  and the biases of the era Brits are polite and unknowable WASPs are snobs and heavy drinkers Jews are smart brash and pushy and blacks barely visible Don has fewer ethnic tells than most because his whole persona is an invention In the season premiere a young man in a bar cant peg this stranger who is handsome and dapper but square not hip He asks Don You some kind of astronaut  Identity isnt just a theme of Mad Men its one of the seriess recurring jokes We know who Don is by now and where he is most likely headed Its the women in his life who keep us guessing

Judge Strikes Down Age Limits on Morning-After Pill,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/06/health/judge-orders-fda-to-make-morning-after-pill-available-over-the-counter-for-all-ages.html,A federal judge on Friday ordered that the most common morningafter pill be made available over the counter for all ages instead of requiring a prescription for girls 16 and younger But his acidly worded decision raises a broader question about whether a cabinet secretary can decide on a drugs availability for reasons other than its safety and effectiveness In his ruling Judge Edward R Korman of the Eastern District of New York accused the Obama administration of putting politics ahead of science He concluded that the administration had not made its decisions based on scientific guidelines and that its refusal to lift restrictions on access to the pill Plan B OneStep was arbitrary capricious and unreasonable He said that when the Health and Human Services secretary Kathleen Sebelius countermanded a move by the Food and Drug Administration in 2011 to make the pill which helps prevent pregnancy after sexual intercourse universally available the secretarys action was politically motivated scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent Ms Sebelius said at the time that she was basing her decision on science because she said the manufacturer had failed to study whether the drug was safe for girls as young as 11 about 10 percent of whom are physically able to bear children But her decision was widely interpreted as political because emergency contraception had become an issue in the abortion debate and allowing freer access for adolescents would prompt critics to accuse the president of supporting sexual activity for girls of that age At the time Mr Obama was campaigning for reelection and some Democrats said he was conscious of avoiding divisive issues that might alienate voters He said then that he was not involved in the decision but supported it I think it is important for us to make sure that we apply some common sense to various rules when it comes to overthecounter medicine he said And he reiterated that position on Friday through the White House press secretaryJay Carney who said He believed it was a commonsense approach when it comes to Plan B and its availability Mr Carney declined to comment on whether the administration would appeal the decision A Justice Department spokeswoman Allison Price said the department was reviewing the 59page order and the appellate options and expects to act promptly Judge Korman gave the FDA 30 days to lift any age and sale restrictions on Plan B OneStep and its generic versions Many groups that are part of Mr Obamas political base praised the decision to make the emergency contraceptive pill more easily available saying the change would also make it easier for all women to obtain the pill because stores often keep it behind the counter or in pharmacy sections that may close at night Removing the restrictions is in some ways is more consistent with the administrations position on other womens reproductive health issues including the free provision of contraceptives through Mr Obamas health care overhaul Scientists including those at the Food and Drug Administration have recommended unrestricted access for years as have the American Medical Association the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the American Academy of Pediatrics They contend that the restrictions effectively keep many adolescents and younger teenagers from being able to use a safe drug in a timely way to prevent pregnancy which carries greater safety risks than the morningafter pill Conservative and antiabortion groups assailed the judges decision suggesting that it may allow the pill to be given to young girls without their consent They also say that girls who can skip the requirement to visit a doctor for a prescription may have sexually transmitted infections that go undiagnosed and untreated This ruling places the health of young girls at risk said Anna Higgins director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council The judges decision a rare case in which a court has weighed in to order that a drug be made available over the counter could test the question of who gets the final say in such matters Technically the secretary under the law has the right to make the decision said Daniel Carpenter a professor of government at Harvard But there is other longestablished law that says the decision is supposed to be based on the safety and efficacy of the drug Some legal experts said the decision sent a strong signal to the White House If theyre going to interfere with decisions of expert regulatory agencies they must find credible scientific justification otherwise judges will be inclined to step in and stop them said Lewis A Grossman a law professor at American University In his ruling Judge Korman accused the federal government of bad faith in dealing with the requests over more than a decade to make the pill universally available The FDA has engaged in intolerable delays in processing the petition the judge wrote Indeed it could accurately be described as an administrative agency filibuster He added The plaintiffs should not be forced to endure nor should the agencys misconduct be rewarded by an exercise that permits the FDA to engage in further delay and obstruction The drugs manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals declined to comment on the decision on Friday In a separate order the judge denied a motion filed by the company to preserve market exclusivity Plan B was approved in 1999 as a prescriptiononly product and in 2001 the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a citizens petition for it to be made available over the counter or without a prescription Scientists including an expert advisory panel to the FDA gave early support to that request But top agency officials rejected the application because some said later they worried they would be fired if they approved it PresidentGeorge W Bushs administration in 2006 allowed overthecounter sales to women 18 and older but required a prescription for those 17 and younger In 2009 Judge Korman directed that the pill be made available over the counter for those 17 and older A former Health and Human Services official during Mr Obamas first term said that when Ms Sebelius overruled the FDA in 2011 she was concerned about the lack of research about how the drug would affect very young girls But the official who declined to be named in order to discuss internal deliberations said the secretary was also being pragmatic by not taking a stand that would have immediately drawn intense criticism from abortion opponents We would have been fighting the contraception fight over whether we let a 7yearold girl walk into Walgreens and get the morningafter pill the official said Lets have it on terms we can win it on rather than something thats easy to mock The official said Ms Sebelius would probably feel the same way today Several supporters of the judges decision on Friday including representatives of womens reproductive health groups and the American Academy of Pediatrics said they believed that since the election was over the Obama administration would have less of a political reason to oppose expanded access to the pill Susannah Baruch interim president of the Reproductive Health Technologies Project said advocates met with officials at the FDA and the Health and Human Services Department soon after the election around the question of whether they would do what the court is now ordering them to do But she said it had been hard to read the tea leaves to determine if those efforts had been making headway

                                            the chattering classes had a significant impact on the people who are actually abandoning marriage My last post tried to deal a bit with the question of whether the debate about procreation is really esoteric but I want
                                        to use Drums take the long view point to discuss the more determinist arguments for current trends in marriage culture which Ive been reading lately from a lot of writers I respect Drum is basically making the liberal version which tends to focus on the deep power of post1960s socioeconomic trends you can find another take in this post by the Atlantics Derek Thompson
                                        which emphasizes the changing economic incentives including to his credit the incentives created by legal abortion facing working class couples since the 1970s Up to a point theirs is an argument that I agree
                                        with in the sense that I think everything from wage stagnation to mass incarceration to the impact of the Great Recession is important to understanding whats been happening to the social fabric in middle
                                        America and important to designing any kind of policy response But I also thinkÂ culture and economics ideas and incentives are all entangled at a deep level working in cycles and feedback loops rather than in simple causal arrows Â and thus its aÂ mistake
                                        to treat changes in what people believe and particularly the sweeping generational changes in how Americans conceptualize the links between sex and marriage and procreation just as epiphenomena of economic pressure
                                        And itsÂ a particularly convenient mistake for social liberals because it enables them to downplay the fact that these changes are also their own ideological victories  victories thatÂ have
                                        been accompanied by well many of the negative consequences that social conservatives warned against in the first place In large ways and small and now at a suddenlyaccelerating pace today gay marriage tomorrow
                                        marijuana legalization etc were getting the culture that social liberalism wantsÂ  less traditionally religious and more socially permissive with fewer normative ideas                                        about how sex and love and childbearing fit together And if conservatives would profit from acknowledging the economic forces shaping these realities liberals would profit from acknowledging that maybe just maybe
                                        a cultural transformation that theyve long favored is coming at a cost Then theres a stilldeeper form of determinism on these questions which acknowledges the significance of culture and the power of ideology and ideas but then argues that todays trend away from the
                                        institutionalprocreative view of marriage is simply too deeply rooted in the logic of modern liberal society to be shifted from its courseÂ Heres Damon Linker                                        taking us back to the cultural revolution wrought by the birth control pill to explain why the contemporary landscape was inevitable heres Noah Millman                                        taking us back to womens suffrage heres Dan McCarthy taking us back to Thomas Hobbes And up to a point I agree with their arguments as well I was pretty much convinced that gay marriage was inevitable ten years ago maybe because I read this remarkably prescient Ramesh Ponnuru piece
                                        and most everything Ive written on the subject in the last few years has been informed by that assumption If a serious look at culture vindicates social conservatives in certain ways it also helps explains
                                        why theyve lost and lost and lost But to the cultural inevitabilists Id just say this As much as liberalism and modernity and the sexual revolution have reshaped human relations they have not  or notÂ yet pending the Singularity
                                        Â alchemized human nature into something entirely different A glance at post1960s trends will demonstrate that the birth control pill did not actually sever sex from pregnancy and childbearing
                                        An hour in a nursery will remind you that the decline of the twoparent family hasnt eliminated the basic desire of children to know their parents A fairminded look at the fabric of American life will
                                        reveal significant advantages to being connected to the kind of communities that are still shaped by the older marital ideal AndÂ both politics and writing in different ways exist in part to assert human
                                        agency in the face of trends that seem inexorable and impersonal  to hold up ideals even when fewer people are living up to them to try to shape and redirect trends rather than taking them as a given
                                        to mitigate the excesses of revolutions and try to preserve the best of the old even when the new comes rushing in I understand the unfolding historical logic of the retreat from marriageÂ as well as anyone and Im
                                        under no illusions that the present move to formally redefine the institution represents any kind of uniquely transformative moment in that process But its the moment were in now and so it affords
                                        an opportunity to talk about the process as a whole to raise questions about whether our current historical momentum is identical with progress to note the merits of alternative models that were not only
                                        drifting away from but as of now deliberately leaving behind That doesnt mean pretending that theres some political strategy the Republican Party should embrace to turn public opinion on a dime There isnt and thats been obvious for a while But
                                        even when youre in the process of surrendering on a particular point it makes a difference how surrender happens and what Â if anything Â you can persuade your victorious opponents
                                        to concede Because even when change seems inevitable the pace of that change is not because history is littered with trends that seemed unstoppable and then stopped because ideas can hibernate as well as die
                                        And because nobody knows the future Nobody knows the future"
Why Sanford vs. Colbert Busch Could Be Competitive,https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/05/why-sanford-vs-colbert-busch-could-be-competitive/,"Former Gov Mark Sanford won a runoff election this week securing the Republican nomination for South Carolinas
                                        First Congressional District He will face the Democratic nominee Elizabeth Colbert Busch in a May 7 general election  The First District which runs from Hilton Head Island in the south to north of Charleston is solidly Republican and typically a Congressional race in the conservative Lowcountry would provide little suspense
                                        Republicans have held the seat since 1981 But this election is not typical Mr Sanford enters the general election with significant personal baggage having spent six
                                        days in 2009 in Argentina with a woman who was not his wife while telling his aides he was hiking the Appalachian Trail He and the woman are now engaged Ms Colbert Busch meanwhile is an accomplished
                                        businesswoman with deep ties to the districts business community She is also the sister of the comedian Stephen Colbert The odd matchup in turn takes place in an offyear special election Special elections
                                        usually mean low turnout and low turnout often means a Republicanleaning electorate But special elections can also provide surprising results A number of wellinformed observers                                        think the election could be competitive There have not yet been any nonpartisan polls of the race but a survey by
                                        Lake Research Partners for the Colbert Busch campaign showed the Democrat ahead of Mr Sanford 47 percent to 44 percent Partisan polls have historically overestimated                                        their candidates standing by about six percentage points Another poll
                                        by the leftleaning Public Policy Polling showed similar numbers with Ms Colbert Busch leading Mr Sanford 47 percent to 45 percent Both those polls however were conducted before Mr Sanford officially secured the Republican nomination His chances of winning a seat in Congress may depend largely on his ability to consolidate the conservative
                                        vote
                                         He received 57 percent in Tuesdays twoway runoff election and will need to win over voters who just cast ballots against him How likely are the First Districts Republicans to stay in the partys camp South Carolina is known as a deepred state but the First District boasts a more moderate brand of conservatism The districts
                                        lines were redrawn after the 2010 census and Georgetown and Horry Counties were moved elsewhere The result                                        is an electorate roughly the same in terms of Democrat versus Republican but less defined by cultural conservatism and focused more on fiscal restraint  Voters in downtown Charleston the tip of the peninsula Mount Pleasant and Isle of Palms in the districts north are generally affluent and less strident on social issues This is the economic conservative
                                        heart of the district said David Wasserman the House editor for the Cook Political Report Hilton Head Island in the south is also characterized by a more moderate Republicanism partly thanks to the many transplants from the Northeast who have moved to the region While on its own the First Districts fiscal conservatism may not help Ms Colbert Busch  Mr Sanford represented the district in the late 1990s and is known as a fiscal hawk  the fact that the
                                        district is less socially conservative means fewer voters may disqualify Ms Colbert Busch for her support of samesex marriage and abortion

                                     Moreover the First District is solidly Republican but not overwhelmingly so It has a Cook Partisan Voting Index score of R11
                                        It is rare but Democrats have won congressional districts with similar scores North Carolinas Seventh District which also has a score of R11
                                        is home to Representative Mike McIntyre a Democrat The Fourth
                                        Congressional District in Utah has a score of R14 and is also represented by a Democrat Jim Matheson The Republican Party has held the seat for more than 30 years but there have been close calls In 2008 the First Districts Republican Representative Henry E Brown Jr just barely won reelection                                        against the Democrat Linda Ketner 52 percent to 48 percent Its worth noting however that Mr Brown was dogged by a controversy over a fine he received for allowing a fire on his property that spread
                                        to Francis Marion National Forest and he ran what was generally regarded as a lackluster campaign The key to this race according to Robert Oldendick a professor of political science at the University of South Carolina may be whether Sanfords
                                        ethicalmoral issues will hurt him among female voters or whether his limited governmentlower taxes mantra will be the more important issue So far the taint of scandal seems to have remained with Mr Sanford The survey by Public Policy Polling found his favorability ratings underwater
                                        with 34 percent of voters saying they had a favorable impression of him and 58 percent saying they had an unfavorable one The poll from Public Policy Polling also found that women were slightly more likely than
                                        men to have an unfavorable view of Mr Sanford but there was not much of a gender difference Ms Colbert Busch is viewed favorably by 45 percent of voters according to the same poll 31 percent view her unfavorably her unfavorable rating may go up as the campaign heats up and she faces Republican ads Ms Colbert Busch  with a famous brother and a nonpolitical background  is an unusual candidate and this is certainly a promising moment for a different kind of candidate to step forward
                                        said Mark Tompkins an associate professor of political science at the University of South Carolina  But the First District is still heavily Republican The close race in 2008 took place in a presidential election year and amid a national Democratic wave  Ms Colbert Busch has a chance but she still has to run an almost flawless campaign Mr Oldendick said"
How Skeptics and Believers Can Connect,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/opinion/sunday/how-skeptics-and-believers-can-connect.html,STANFORD Calif I DO not call myself a Christian So maybe I should not have been surprised when I went on my first Christian radio show a year ago and the host set out to save me  live on a nationally syndicated program for 30 minutes In the few seconds before I was connected when I could hear him on the air but he could not hear me he explained Listen shes not one of us But I wont fight with her It was a pledge he did not keep Did I think God was present My response that I was speaking as a social scientist interested him not at all  I was on the show to discuss my recent book which explains the way evangelicals learn to experience themselves in conversation with God It argues that learning to hear God speak involves skill that the skill changes the way people use and experience their minds and that those who use this skill do so for the most part with sophistication I have spent a lot of time thinking about the complexity of faith and have tried to take theologically conservative faith seriously As I did so over a decade of research I found myself more open to the idea of God and more aware of the fragile human grasp on the real So it was a shock to have my host grill me about the state of my soul It reminded me that one of the things that makes mutual respect between believers and nonbelievers difficult is that there is a kind of line in the sand and youre either on one side of it or on the other Skeptics do this too of course I remember a dinner party where I was explaining my work among evangelicals to a colleague and her face grew longer and longer until she said You talk to them  The inyourface confrontation makes it that much harder to connect The more my interviewer pressed me the more my faith  such as it is  grew strained I had come to live theologically speaking in a messy inbetween My interviewer wanted clarity The more he put me on the spot the more I wanted to say that I shared nothing with him and that his beliefs were flimsy dreams And the more I resisted the more he just got mad He was determined I was exhausted  Anthropologists have a term for this rachetingup of opposition schismogenesis Gregory Bateson developed the word to describe mirroring interactions where every move by each side makes the other respond more negatively like those horrible arguments with your spouse where everything you say makes the other person dig in their heels more fiercely  These days we Americans live not only with political schismogenesis but also religious schismogenesis The political scientists Robert D Putnam and David E Campbell in their book American Grace found that recent years have seen the sharpest points of disagreement between religious believers  of nearly all stripes  and those who denounce religious belief of all types The last few election cycles have made it clear that many evangelicals think that those without religion are dangerously wrong on many issues A crop of equally committed atheists and agnostics have reciprocated with vigor Professors Putnam and Campbell find that it is the people at the extremes who are most engaged in the battle but all of us see the battle lines clearly drawn I think that schismogenesis is responsible for the striking increase in the number of people who say that they are not affiliated with any religion Since the early 1990s that number has more than doubled to 20 percent from less than 10 percent and is close to a third for people under 30 We know that most of these people still believe in God or a higher power whatever they mean by that Its just that they are no longer willing to describe themselves as associated with a religion Theyve seen that line in the sand and theyre not willing to step over it Yet believers and nonbelievers are not so different from one another news that is sometimes a surprise to both When I arrived at one church I had come to study I thought that I would stick out like a sore thumb I did not Instead I saw my own doubts anxieties and yearnings reflected in those around me People were willing to utter sentences  like I believe in God  that I was not but many of those I met spoke openly and comfortably about times of uncertainty even doubt Many of my skeptical friends think of themselves as secular sometimes profoundly so Yet these secular friends often hover on the edge of faith They meditate They keep journals They go on retreats They just dont know what to do with their spiritual yearnings  Perhaps there is hope Good marriages work because couples learn to repair rather than escalate their conflicts Samesex marriage and abortion should not be approached by drawing a line in the sand and demonizing everyone on the other side We need to recognize something of what we share and to carry on a conversation  and if we can keep the conversation going we will however slowly move forward If we cant were in real trouble 
"Edith Schaeffer, Definer of Christian Family Values, Dies at 98",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/07/world/europe/edith-schaeffer-98-dies-defined-christian-values.html,Edith Schaeffer founder with her husband Francis Schaeffer of a Swiss commune considered the theological birthplace of the American religious right and author of many popular books that helped define conservative Christian family values for a worldwide evangelical audience mainly female died on March 30 in Gryon Switzerland She was 98 Her death was confirmed by her son Frank Mrs Schaeffer and her husband both Americans were prolific and wellknown Christian authors Mr Schaeffer who died in 1984 was an early prophet of church engagement in public affairs Jerry Falwell cited his writings as major influences in his decision to found the Moral Majority Mrs Schaeffer wrote more than two dozen books including Hidden Art 1971 and What Is a Family 1975 describing her vision of womens domestic role in the battle with secular humanism and declining morality as fundamentalist Christians defined the prevailing threats to humanity in the postwar world That role she said was to make ones home a work of art she wrote in What Is a Family There needs to be a homemaker exercising some measure of skill imagination creativity desire to fulfill needs and give pleasure to others in the family Her husbands writing which was more theoretical and polemical had greater influence But the community Mrs Schaeffer and her husband founded LAbri Fellowship  part seminary and part spiritual think tank  which served as the laboratory for the ideas in the books they both wrote was by all accounts an equal partnership The Schaeffers had worked for a decade throughout postwar Europe as missionaries for the Presbyterian Church of the United States when they broke with leaders of their mission in 1955 and established LAbri French for shelter It was conceived as an open Christian community where visitors Christian and nonChristian could stay as long as they wished attend lectures given by Mr Schaeffer and other Christian thinkers and discuss lifes ultimate questions with fellow seekers Guests who numbered more than 100 at a time by the late 1960s paid a small fee to stay in the Schaeffers sprawling chalet and helped with the household chores Operating costs were underwritten by donors in the United States and Europe In the 60s when LAbris guests included backpackers hippies and even celebrities like Timothy Leary and Eric Clapton Mrs Schaeffer was known for maintaining a seamless fivestarhotel level of comfort for guests occupying LAbris simple rooms while Mr Schaeffer delivered many of the lectures that became the basis of his most influential books including Escape From Reason 1968 and How Should We Then Live 1976 In a 2008 biography Francis Schaeffer and the Shaping of Evangelical America Barry Hankins a professor of history and religion at Baylor University wrote Without LAbri Schaeffer would never have drawn the audience that made his many books possible And without Mrs Schaeffer he added there would have been no LAbri The Schaeffers son Frank a novelist illuminated Mrs Schaeffers contributions further in a 2011 memoir Sex Mom  God portraying his mother as the skilled and uncowed handler of her moody husband whose tirades and sometimes violent temper tantrums she endured and kept hidden from LAbris shelterseeking guests The domestic perfection she described in her books was to some degree Edith Schaeffer fantasies he wrote Our actual family was a model of dysfunction However Mom was no hypocrite he wrote She was just forgiving Edith Rachel Seville was born in Wenzhou China on Nov 2 1914 to Christian missionaries George and Jessie Seville who returned to the United States with her and her two older sisters when Edith was about 5 After a peripatetic childhood as her parents moved around the country doing missionary work she met Francis Schaeffer a seminarian at a church meeting in Philadelphia They were married when she was 17 and he was 19 After postings in the United States they were sent to Switzerland by the Presbyterian Church in 1947 When they began LAbri most Christian leaders saw keeping a safe distance as the best strategy for dealing with secular public affairs they considered immoral and corrupting Mr Schaeffers writings advocating direct engagement in the public realm and even civil disobedience in service of moral causes made him a leading theorist of the Christian right particularly the antiabortion movement until his death in 1984 Besides her son Mrs Schaeffer is survived by three daughters Prista Sandri Susan Macauley and Deborah Middelmann as well as 15 grandchildren 35 greatgrandchildren and 2 greatgreatgrandchildren In an interview Professor Hankins described Mrs Schaeffer as a bit of a paradox On one hand he said she held a very traditional biblical view about womens subservient role On the other she was assertive even competitive with her husband She embodied marriage equality he said She would never use the term of course but in some ways she was the model of a sort of evangelical feminism

Open the Slaughterhouses,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/opinion/open-the-slaughterhouses.html,WASHINGTON IN 1999 as a writer for The American Prospect I went into a slaughterhouse undercover with the help of some rebellious employees The floor was slick with the residue of blood and suet and the air smelled like iron A part of my brain spent the whole time trying to remember which of Dantes circles this scene most resembled Today under legislation being pushed by business interests that bit of journalistic adventure could earn me a criminal conviction and land me on a registry of animal and ecological terrorists Socalled aggag laws proposed or enacted in about a dozen states make or would make criminals of animalrights activists who take covert pictures and videos of conditions on industrial farms and slaughterhouses Some would even classify the activists as terrorists The agriculture industry says the images are unfair They seem to show cruelty and brutality but the eye can be deceiving The most humane way of slaughtering an animal or dealing with a sick one may look pretty horrible But so does openheart surgery The problem with making moral arguments by appealing to revulsion is that some beneficial and indispensable acts can also be revolting With gruesome shots of cadavers a skilled amateur could make a strong emotional case against using them to teach anatomy in medical school Moreover the industry says the activists are trespassers or when theyre employees working undercover for an animalrights group or news organization theyre going beyond the terms of their employment Slaughterhouses and confinedfeeding operations can be dangerous places Although the industry surely exaggerates the risk guerrilla actions are not the safest or best way to spur reflection on how we treat animals Fairness and safety are real issues So is transparency and that is why we should require confinedfeeding operations and slaughterhouses to install webcams at key stages of their operations List the URLs to the video on the packaging There would be no need for human intrusion into dangerous sites No tricky angles or scary edits by activists Just the visual facts If the operators felt their work misrepresented they could add cameras to give an even fuller picture There are models for this kind of sunlight requirement For a couple of decades federal law has required chemical plants to release details of their toxic emissions to the public Most scholars agree that embarrassment and public pressure have pushed down pollution as a result without further regulation  At first transparency would mainly inform consumer choice The pictures might persuade some people to stop eating meat or to buy it from a more humane source Of course changes in personal attitudes often translate into expanded public debate People who start out by changing how they eat might end up supporting laws for more humane treatment of farm animals Openslaughterhouse laws would not have to go through state legislatures where agricultural lobbies are strong Successful ballot initiatives in a few states could change the information environment for everyone If say California put slaughterhouse webcams in place the public discourse everywhere might change Slaughterhouse cameras might seem unfair to the operators The images might still appeal to emotion and prompt visceral revulsion Fair enough But we are not going to decide how we should treat animals through cold reason alone and certainly not if their treatment is invisible Emotional response is part of moral reasoning and in this case we need more information not less The images need to be supplemented by brain studies and other efforts to understand what animal suffering is like  for instance whether mammals experience trauma when confined and exposed to slaughter But the images would motivate us to ask the right questions Opponents might compare this proposal to bills that require women to view images of their fetuses before having an abortion The resemblance is misleading Those laws intrude on intimate difficult decisions involving a constitutional right  In contrast openslaughterhouse laws would not force anyone to look at anything They would just increase our resources for thinking and arguing A teenager debating her parents at the dinner table or a parishioner discussing the ethics of eating meat with fellow church members would be able to pull out a cellphone or laptop to support his or her arguments Ten years before sneaking into that slaughterhouse I was helping to slaughter cattle on the small West Virginia farm where I grew up I still dont feel that I know what it means morally when an animals life ends in exchange for our sustenance or simply because we love grassfed hamburger Supporters of aggag laws are right that our treatment of animals is a hard problem that is divisive  and often leaves us internally divided  and too often oversimplified But if advocates of these laws are sincere about those concerns they should agree to make slaughterhouse operations transparent

                                        primary on April 30 Mr Lynch who was an ironworker before he entered politics seems to have cornered the market on the hardluck biography in this special election and he mentions it constantly When you look at the United States Senate it is populated today by a very narrow group of somewhat elite and privileged individuals for the most part Mr Lynch said This is the time to elect someone who grew up in public housing who put on a pair of work boots and worked for a living he added referring to himself Not all senators must have such a background
                                        he said but at least one should Not to be outdone Mr Markey told the story of his father who grew up on the first floor of a tripledecker in South Lawrence Mass in the shadow of the mills Mr Markey returned to that house a
                                        few years ago to see who lived there now he said and it turned out to be a Dominican family
                                         Their accents were different but the aspirations were clearly the same Mr Markey said They want for their children what the Markeys were able to receive
                                        His responsibility in going to the Senate he said would be to make sure that future generations are more educated and more healthy than those who have come before and that life is more fair The two differed sharply on a few issues  Mr Markey voted for President Obamas health care bill while Mr Lynch opposed it Mr Markey voted against the bill that cut federal spending automatically
                                        across the board while Mr Lynch voted for it and Mr Markey has long supported abortion rights while Mr Lynch calls himself prolife but says he would not support a reversal of Roe v Wade Mr Lynch offered an explanation for his support for a ban on abortions in military hospitals He said that if a woman in the military were pregnant the fatherÂ  was probably a fellow service member and she should
                                        be able to make a decision about her future away from the base not being ruled over by a male superior officer who may have other interests But the candidates agreed on many other issues that were raised at the debate and found it difficult  as primary contestants often do  to draw a sharp contrast with each other And so their biographies
                                        are becoming a defining issue At one point Mr Lynch was asked about the campaign being waged against him by Tom Steyer a California billionaire who has demanded that Mr Lynch repudiate his support for the Keystone XL oil pipeline Mr Steyers
                                        tactics included flying a banner denouncing Mr Lynch behind a plane that flew over Fenway Park during the Red Sox home opener on Monday At the debate Mr Lynch said Mr Steyer had threatened him by saying I will crush you if you dont change your position by high noon last Friday As Mr Lynch explained his response to Mr Steyer he grew increasingly feisty Just because he has a billion dollars doesnt mean he gets to push people around Mr Lynch said Ive
                                        faced bullies my whole life and I wont put up with that At another point Mr Markey was asked if he was insulted by being referred to as the congressman from Chevy Chase Md His critics use the phrase to suggest that during his 36 years in Congress he
                                        has gone Washington putting down roots in the nations capital and losing touch with the folks back home in his district Mr Markey said that his constituents know the job is to go to Washington adding that Mr Lynch as well as Senator Elizabeth Warren Mr Kerry and the late Senator Edward M Kennedy had all doneÂ 
                                        so
                                     Ive tried to fight the fights that ordinary families would have if they could go to Washington he said mentioning his efforts to take assault weapons off the streets and push for renewable
                                        energy He added that he was animated by the values of Malden Mass where I grew up and where I live today and they know that Im one of them So far the race has been fairly tame and civil with polls showing that Mr Markey has the edge but that most voters are undecided Political analysts say that voters are not paying attention and that turnout will
                                        be very low The general election is scheduled for June 25 when the winner of the primary will face the winner of the Republican primary in which the candidates are Michael Sullivan a former United States attorney Gabriel Gomez

"McCandlish Phillips, Who Exposed a Jewish Klansman, Is Dead at 85",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/10/business/media/mccandlish-phillips-times-reporter-dies-at-85.html,McCandlish Phillips a former reporter for The New York Times who wrote one of the most famous articles in the newspapers history  exposing the Orthodox Jewish background of a senior Ku Klux Klan official  before forsaking journalism to spread the Gospel died on Tuesday in Manhattan He was 85 The cause was complications of pneumonia said Jaan Vaino a friend Even in a newsroom that employed Gay Talese David Halberstam Richard Reeves and Ada Louise Huxtable Mr Phillips who was with The Times from 1952 to 1973 stood out He stood out as a tenacious reporter and a lyrical stylist  an alltoorare marriage on newspapers then  and in his hands even a routine news article seldom failed to delight Consider Mr Phillipss 1961 account of New Yorks St Patricks Day parade an annual millstone for the citys generalassignment reporters The sun was high to their backs and the wind was fast in their faces and 100000 sons and daughters of Ireland and those who would hold with them matched strides with their shadows for 52 blocks It seemed they marched from Midtown to exhaustion In his 2003 memoir City Room Arthur Gelb a former managing editor of The Times called Mr Phillips the most original stylist Id ever edited Mr Phillips stood out in other ways About 6 feet 5 inches tall and not much more than 160 pounds he was often described as a latterday Ichabod Crane  the man of the awkward gait and the graceful phrase his editors called him An evangelical Christian he kept a Bible on his desk and led prayer meetings for likeminded colleagues there were none when he joined the paper he noted ruefully in a conference room off the newsroom He refrained from smoking drinking cursing and gambling each of which had been refined to a high exuberant art in the Times newsroom  the last of these to such a degree that at midcentury the newspaper employed two bookmakersinresidence nominally on the payroll as news clerks Mr Phillipss most renowned article appeared on Page 1 on Sunday Oct 31 1965 under the headline State Klan Leader Hides Secret of Jewish Origin It was a rigorously reported profile of Daniel Burros a 28yearold Queens man who was the Grand Dragon of the New York State Ku Klux Klan a chief organizer of the national Klan and a former national secretary of the American Nazi Party Mr Burros the article went on to document was also a Jew  a former Hebrew school student who had been bar mitzvahed at 13  The article remains a case study in a reporters perseverance in the face of intimidation It is also a case study in the severe unintended consequences that the airing of fiercely guarded truths can have for the guardian despite threatening to kill Mr Phillips if the article went to press Mr Burros in the end killed only himself John McCandlish Phillips Jr was born in Glen Cove NY on Long Island on Dec 4 1927 His father was a traveling salesman and young Johnny as he was known would attend 13 grammar schools across New York Ohio and Massachusetts  After graduating from Brookline High School near Boston he forwent college for reporting and editing jobs on small New England papers From 1950 to 1952 Mr Phillips served with the Army at Fort Holabird in Baltimore and it was there he said that he attended the church service at which he was born again Mr Phillips joined The Times as a copy boy in November 1952 later working as a clerk on the city desk and in the Washington bureau In 1955 he was made a cub reporter and consigned to prove his mettle in the papers Brooklyn office then a dank decrepit outfit near Police Department headquarters in the boroughs nether regions His account of life there written for Times Talk the newspapers house organ It is impossible to tell a plainclothes detective from a mugger here You just have to wait to see what they do so delighted the newspapers management that his sentence was commuted to service in the main newsroom  In October 1965 The Times received a tip about Mr Burross Jewish upbringing Assigned to pursue it Mr Phillips aided by newsroom colleagues spent days reconstructing his life scouring school military employment and police records amassing photographs and interviewing neighbors and associates The one thing they lacked was an interview with Mr Burros efforts to reach him had been unsuccessful Finally on a return visit to South Ozone Park the Queens neighborhood in which Mr Burros lived Mr Phillips glimpsed him on the street  a round short sallow young man who looked a little like a small heap of misery he would later write in Times Talk  He approached Mr Burros and they went into a luncheonette The conversation which ranged over Mr Burross brilliant scholastic record  he had an IQ of 154  and his rise to power in the Klan was cordial Then nearly 20 minutes into the interview Mr Phillips raised the subject of Mr Burross Jewishness If you publish that Ill come and get you and Ill kill you Mr Burros said I dont care what happens to me Ill be ruined This is all Ive got to live for By the time the two men parted Mr Phillips later wrote Mr Burros had threatened his life half a dozen times Mr Phillips returned to the newsroom and The Times arranged for roundtheclock bodyguards He wrote his article detailing Mr Burross religious upbringing his early fascination with farright ideologies and his advocacy of genocide for Jews and blacks On the day the article was published Mr Burros committed suicide The article cemented Mr Phillipss reputation as one of the citys most esteemed reporters He spent his remaining years at The Times primarily in the papers Metropolitan section where his portfolio included the About New York column Mr Phillips became known in particular for his coverage of the citys vaunted vanishing institutions as in this 1969 article about the closing of the original Lindys delicatessen which began What kind of a day is today Its the kind of a day that if you wanted a slice of cheesecake at Lindys you couldnt get it Near the end of the article he wrote with plainspoken impeccable logic The locusts stripped the place of menus and ashtrays and other mementos There were conflicting claimants to possession of the last bagel As a souvenir a bagel is not much good It is perishable and it also lacks proof Anyone can hold up a bagel and say This is the last bagel from LindysÂ  Mr Phillips resigned from The Times in late 1973 for a life in religion  In 1962 he had helped found the New Testament Missionary Fellowship a Pentecostal congregation in Manhattan Its tenets as Ken Auletta wrote in a 1997 New Yorker profile of Mr Phillips include the belief that pornography drugs abortion and any form of fornication including premarital sex and homosexuality are sins In the early 1970s the New Testament Missionary Fellowship made headlines after the kidnapping or attempted kidnapping of several of its congregants by their families The families maintained that the group had trained the congregants to repudiate them After leaving The Times Mr Phillips lived in Mr Aulettas account a contented if threadbare existence preaching the Gospel on the Columbia University campus near his home and managing the fellowships affairs The fellowship which has long since ceased to incur unfavorable notice is still extant based in Upper Manhattan Mr Phillips who never married is survived by a sister Janet DeClemente He published several books including City Notebook 1974 a collection of his articles from The Times and What Every Christian Should Know About the Supernatural 1988 Over the years Mr Phillips was asked whether he felt responsible for Mr Burross suicide He felt a vague sense of sadness he said but no guilt His stance  the view from the prospect where his faith and his journalism converged  was encapsulated in a remark he made to Mr Gelb On the afternoon of Oct 31 1965 Mr Gelb phoned Mr Phillips to tell him very gently that Mr Burros had shot himself What I think weve seen here Arthur Mr Phillips replied is the God of Israel acting in judgment
"With Popularity Fading at Home, Is Jindal the New Romney?",https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/with-popularity-fading-at-home-is-jindal-the-new-romney/,"Mondays article on the nations least popular governors did not include Gov Bobby Jindal of Louisiana because he is not up for reelection in 2014
                                        Louisianas next gubernatorial election will be in 2015 and Mr Jindal will not be eligible having served two consecutive terms
                                        But recent surveys suggest that Mr Jindal has become very unpopular in his home state amid a series of battles on fiscal policy
                                        A March poll from Southern Media  Opinion Research put Mr Jindals approval rating at just
                                        38 percent against 60 percent disapproval His numbers had been similarly poor in a February survey by Public Policy Polling Some national political commentators are treating the news as being selfevidently injurious to Mr Jindals chances                                        of capturing the Republican presidential nomination in 2016 Obviously Mr Jindal has plenty of time to turn around his image in Louisiana But if he doesnt would Republicans really consider nominating
                                        someone who is so deeply unpopular among his own constituents Actually you dont have to go back very far to find a precedent for when Republicans did exactly that Their nominee last year Mitt Romney was very unpopular among Massachusetts voters by the time he finished
                                        his single term as governor in 2006 The chart below tracks Mr Romneys approval and favorability ratings during his term based on data from PollingReportcom Mr Romney was
                                        reasonably popular throughout most of his tenure as Mr Jindal has been But Mr Romney numbers declined once he began to reposition himself as a candidate for national office for instance in gradually shifting his stance                                        on abortion and contraception toward the right By late 2005 Mr Romney badly trailed Massachusettss attorney general Thomas F Reilly then considered the leading Democratic nominee for the 2006 gubernatorial election in headtohead polling Mr Romneys
                                        polling did not improve any after he declined to run for a second term Instead the last poll conducted during his term by The Boston Globe in October 2006 put his favorability rating at just 34 percent against
                                        a 54 percent unfavorable rating  similar to Mr Jindals numbers now There are differences of course between Mr Romneys standing and Mr Jindals  notably that it is much more difficult for a Republican to be popular in Massachusetts than in Louisiana Nevertheless
                                        this ought to demonstrate that having strong approval ratings in ones home state is not a prerequisite for gaining the presidential nomination This is not to suggest that Mr Jindals approval ratings in Louisiana wont matter It could constrain the way that he talks about his executive record It could affect the way that local political reporters
                                        cover his candidacy although how much that might spill over into national coverage is unclear Poor approval ratings at home might be more problematic for a candidate from an earlyvoting state like Iowa New
                                        Hampshire or South Carolina because reporters from those states can figure prominently in national coverage It might also be problematic for a candidate from New York New Jersey Virginia or Maryland because
                                        those states are in the national news medias figurative and literal backyards What matters more is how prominent Republicans react to Mr Jindals homestate problems The nomination process especially at this early stage is largely an insiders game
                                        Will Republican thoughtleaders and prominent conservative news and opinion outlets spin the news by praising Mr Jindal as a principled champion of conservative fiscal policies Will they compare Mr Jindal to
                                        Gov Scott Walker of Wisconsin who became unpopular after curtailing publicsector unions but whose image recovered enough for him to win a recall election Or will even conservative news outlets begin to treat Mr Jindal as a candidate with electability issues The Republican presidential field is liable to be more competitive in 2016 than in 2012 If Mr
                                        Jindals executive record is no longer seen as uniformly successful it could reduce his comparative advantage against candidates like Representative Paul D Ryan of Wisconsin who have some similar strengths
                                        to Mr Jindal but who lack his executive experience And what about the precedent established by Mr Romney It is a favorable example for Mr Jindal in the sense of demonstrating that a candidate can be nominated despite poor homestate approval ratings But Republicans
                                        may not see it that way if they regard Mr Romney as having been a poor nominee Instead they may seek out a candidate whom they perceive as nimble and skilled enough to push the policy window toward the right
                                        without sacrificing his popularity  perhaps someone like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida None of this is to address the question of whether homestate popularity is in fact a leading indicator of how a candidate will come to be seen by voters elsewhere in the country My personal view is that you could
                                        do a lot worse for reference points  local voters have a lot more information on a candidate But I havent seen much research on the topic and it is easy to think of some contrary examples for
                                        instance Sarah Palin was very popular in Alaska in 2008 but played poorly on the national stage Mr Jindals homestate troubles are a reminder however that it can be difficult for a candidate to serve in an executive role and to position himself for national office at the same time There was a series
                                        of active governors nominated by the parties between 1988 and 2000 Michael S Dukakis Bill Clinton and George W Bush But there have been none since Mr Romney was a former governor but was almost six years
                                        removed from office at the time of his nomination and talked little about his executive record in either the primaries or the general election  As the parties have become more nationalized demanding greater ideological fealty from their candidates sitting governors may face an unpleasant choice between working to preserve their standing among their constituents
                                        while alienating national party leaders  or pursuing a national agenda at the price of their homestate popularity"
Religious Remark Confirmed in Irish Abortion Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/11/world/europe/religious-remark-confirmed-in-irish-abortion-case.html,DUBLIN  A woman who died after being refused a potentially lifesaving abortion even while she was having a miscarriage was told that her repeated pleas could not be granted because Ireland is a Catholic country an inquest has confirmed In a case that has reignited tensions over Irelands strict abortion laws Ann Maria Burke the midwife who attended to the pregnant woman said at the inquest in Galway on Wednesday that the remark had come out the wrong way and that she had not meant it to be hurtful The pregnant woman Savita Halappanavar a dentist born in India had mentioned the Hindu faith and that in India a termination would be possible Ms Burke said I was trying to be as broad and explanatory as I could It was nothing to do with medical care at all The state coroner Dr Ciaran McLoughlin testified that public hospitals in Ireland were not bound by any religious dogma Dr Halappanavars husband Praveen has said the couple were told that the countrys Catholicism was the reason for the refusal to terminate the pregnancy even though his wife was in severe pain and they had been informed that the fetus had no chance of survival In Ireland abortion is legal when there is a fetal heartbeat only if there is real and substantial risk to the life of the woman Dr Halappanavar 31 was 17 weeks pregnant when she sought treatment at University Hospital Galway on Oct 21 complaining of severe back pain Dr Katherine Astbury a senior obstetrician who had attended to Dr Halappanavar said at the inquest that although the fetuss prognosis was poor she had refused to conduct a termination until the fetuss heartbeat had ceased I recall informing Ms Halappanavar that the legal position did not permit me to terminate the pregnancy in her case at that time Dr Astbury said referring to a conversation they had on Oct 23 She also recalled telling Dr Halappanavar who she said was physically well at that point but emotionally distressed that her only option was to sit and wait for as long as the heartbeat persisted When Dr Halappanavars condition began to deteriorate rapidly soon after Dr Astbury considered performing an abortion regardless of the presence of a fetal heartbeat she said On Oct 24 the heartbeat ceased and the remains of the fetus were surgically removed But by that time Dr Halappanavar had contracted a bacterial blood disease septicemia She was admitted to intensive care but never recovered dying on Oct 28 The inquest has also heard testimony that several hospital protocols were not followed amounting to system failures that contributed to Dr Halappanavars death Dr Astbury said she might have intervened sooner had she been made aware of the results of earlier blood tests Instead she relied on clinical signs none of which pointed to sepsis Although limited abortion has been legal since a 1992 Supreme Court judgment successive Irish governments have failed to introduce legislation giving the ruling full effect Under pressure from the Council of Europe in Strasbourg France but in the face of stiff opposition from the antiabortion lobby the current government has promised to introduce such legislation by the end of the summer The inquest which began Monday is expected to last at least another week
Virginia Abortion Clinic Rules Get Final Approval,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/us/virginia-abortion-clinic-rules-get-final-approval.html,The Virginia Board of Health on Friday gave final approval to new regulations for abortion clinics that will force them to spend large sums on renovations that abortion rights advocates say are medically unnecessary Hotly debated for two years and now a point of contention in the campaign for governor the new rules which impose architectural requirements and mandate state inspections of clinics were described by abortion foes as vital to womens welfare We are extremely pleased that the Board of Health saw fit to ensure safety standards for the women of Virginia who enter these clinics said Victoria Cobb president of the Family Foundation of Virginia But abortion rights groups called the building requirements a thinly disguised attempt to cripple or bankrupt the states 20 private abortion clinics and said that some clinics may be forced to close Were being targeted because there is a political difference of opinion about what a woman deserves for her health care said Rosemary Codding director of patient services and coowner of the Falls Church Healthcare Center which performs about 1200 abortions a year along with gynecological services The regulations are intended to carry out a law passed by the state legislature in 2011 which said that the facilities of abortion providers should meet the latest standards set for newly constructed hospitals The requirements include for example fivefootwide public hallways large janitors closets and at least four parking spaces for each surgical room Several other states  including Indiana Kansas Michigan and Pennsylvania  have imposed costly facilities regulations on centers performing abortions but the Virginia rules appear to be the most demanding yet said Katherine Greenier a project director with the American Civil Liberties Union of Virginia The health centers here will need to pay anywhere from tens of thousands of dollars to a million dollars to meet architectural standards that are medically unnecessary Ms Greenier said Last year the Health Board initially decided to grandfather in existing clinics exempting them from many of the construction requirements which were originally written for newly built hospitals But the conservative attorney general Ken Cuccinelli ruled that such exemptions were illegal under the 2011 law and warned board members that they might be personally responsible for legal costs if they were sued over the matter The board reversed itself leading the state health commissioner at the time Dr Karen Remley to resign in protest over what she described as political meddling Dr Remley in an interview Friday said that she and many other legal and medical experts believe that Mr Cuccinelli was wrong in his interpretation of the law that its wording allows a more flexible application of the construction requirements As of now all 20 clinics that provide firsttrimester abortions will have to comply with the new requirements by late 2014 with the exact date depending on when they were licensed last year By law in Virginia later abortions are performed in hospitals Mr Cuccinelli is the presumed Republican nominee for governor Terry McAuliffe the Democratic nominee has attacked him for crusading against abortion and promoting the new clinic regulations Fridays Health Board decision Mr McAuliffe said in an email was an unnecessary move that was the result of Ken Cuccinelli forcing his divisive ideological agenda on Virginian women But it is Mr Cuccinellis job to interpret a law passed by the legislature and signed by the governor said Anna Nix a spokeswoman for Mr Cuccinellis campaign In his attack on the clinic regulations she said Mr McAuliffe shows a total disregard for Virginias elected legislators suggesting that he will just ignore the laws he doesnt like
"For Evangelicals, a Shift in Views on Immigration",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/us/evangelical-christians-increasingly-favor-pathway-to-legal-status-for-immigrants.html,ORLANDO Fla  In the pews of the First Baptist Church of Orlando where thousands of evangelical Christians gather on Sundays to worship and sing a change of heart is happening on the once toxic issue of immigration Two years ago national evangelical leaders began to speak out in favor of legislation to give legal status to immigrants in the United States illegally Now as Congress is about to start a debate on overhauling the immigration system conservative Christians once inclined to take a hard line on immigrants they viewed as lawbreakers are consulting their Bibles and coming around to the pastors view I feel I would be representative of a typical longtime Baptist one who grew up in the Baptist Church who was raised in an evangelical family and I would identify myself as a conservative Republican said Jay Crenshaw 36 a lawyer in Orlando who attended a service at the megachurch last Sunday And I can tell you how much my views have changed For Mr Crenshaw as for many evangelicals the rethinking came as a result of personal encounters with immigrants in church who were trying to navigate the maze of the nations immigration laws  in his case a Colombian friend who turned out to be here illegally It seems somethings broken about the system Mr Crenshaw said The shift among evangelical Christians could have a powerful effect on the fight in Washington as Republican lawmakers including many who have opposed any amnesty for illegal immigrants look to see how much they can support measures to bring those immigrants into the legal system without alienating conservative voters Evangelical leaders seeing the opportunity to expand their influence on a social issue beyond abortion and samesex marriage have broadly united this year behind a path to citizenship for immigrants in the country illegally They are conducting an ambitious push to sway Congress including ad campaigns on Christian radio stations in five states meetings with lawmakers and a challenge to churchgoers to pray every day for 40 days using Bible passages that speak of welcoming the stranger On Wednesday evangelical pastors will converge on Washington for a day of prayer and lobbying on Capitol Hill Guiding the campaign is a coalition called the Evangelical Immigration Table which includes the top pastors of more than two dozen evangelical denominations and at least 20 heads of Christian colleges and seminaries It is very remarkable the degree to which there is consensus said Galen Carey the vice president of government relations for the National Association of Evangelicals an umbrella group for the churches No prominent pastor has spoken out against the immigration effort although some pastors of the largest churches have remained silent Accord has been less broad among the faithful In a poll released in March by the Public Religion Research Institute and the Brookings Institution white evangelical Protestants were the least likely of the religious groups surveyed to support a path to citizenship for immigrants here illegally with 56 percent of them favoring that approach Among Hispanic Catholics the group expressing the most support 74 percent said they would allow those immigrants to become citizens Only 41 percent of white evangelicals who identify with the Tea Party supported a path to citizenship according to the survey But many pastors in largely white churches have been spurred to action on immigration by preachers in Hispanic and immigrant churches who have seen rapid growth in their congregations and have ministered to many followers who spoke of living in fear because they lacked legal papers For the Rev David Uth the head pastor of First Baptist Orlando there was no mistaking the evolution of his traditionally white congregation as he discovered in recent years that immigrants speaking at least 32 different languages had flocked to his doors Mr Uth is one of the pastors going to Washington this week His church offers ministry in seven foreign languages with simultaneous translation of Sunday services in Spanish and Portuguese and a separate Brazilian service on Sunday evenings The stories out there in the pews are stories of people from all over the world who have made friends and who have become close with people here Mr Uth said after his service last Sunday I think thats why theres movement in this church theres momentum theres an openness to try to do something to address their needs Mr Crenshaw said his views started to shift when his Colombian friend a whitecollar professional who had been living in Florida for years asked for help after being arrested for driving without a license Mr Crenshaw said he realized that his friend an active church member who was supporting his mother and a brother could be deported The tension is compassion on one hand and rule of law on the other said Mr Crenshaw who went with his friend to court where the matter was resolved without drawing the attention of any immigration authorities  Once youve walked with someone and put a face and family behind the immigration issue it very much personalizes it he said You do find yourself with a lot of compassion Stewart Hall 70 a member of First Baptist Orlando for more than three decades said his views changed gradually as he moved to sit in pews near the rear of the church where immigrants new to the congregation chose to

said that more than 700 churches nationwide had asked for some of the 75000 bookmarks the coalition is distributing which serve as guides to Bible passages to study during the 40day challenge The

opposed any amnesty for illegal immigrants agreed to have lunch last week with a delegation from evangelical churches in his city Travis Trice one of those attending said Mr Crenshaw an Episcopalian who is unrelated to Jay Crenshaw had agreed to pray on the issue Representative Crenshaw said afterward only that he was meeting with many groups to hear their views With an estimated 11 million

Courage in Kansas,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/opinion/sunday/courage-on-abortion-in-wichita-kansas.html,Nearly four years after an antiabortion extremist opened fire and killed a Wichita abortion provider Dr George Tiller as he stood in the foyer of his church a new medical clinic offering comprehensive reproductive health services  including abortions through the first trimester of pregnancy  opened on April 3 It is in the building that once housed Dr Tillers clinic  Wichita a city of about 400000 people has been without any abortion services since Dr Tillers murder Women needing abortions have had to travel long distances stealing time away from jobs and family to exercise their constitutionally protected right to one of the nations most common medical procedures  The new clinic called the South Wind Womens Center will not be performing lateterm abortions as Dr Tiller did But the fact that it has opened at all is remarkable and is a tribute to the perseverance and courage of those involved in the project especially Julie Burkhart a former colleague of Dr Tiller who directs the Trust Women Foundation which owns the clinic Her struggle to open the facility after the murder and now to keep it open in the face of continuing threats and acts of intimidation and amid escalating efforts in Kansas and other Republicanled states to stigmatize and restrict abortion in defiance of Roe v Wade and subsequent Supreme Court rulings is both inspiring and instructive For months after Dr Tillers death Ms Burkhart says she thought hard about whether she wanted to join with others to try to open a new clinic knowing it would be the challenge of our lives His old building was chosen as the site not because of the symbolism but for its layout she says which works better for patients and doctors than other buildings in the area  Antiabortion groups responded by trying unsuccessfully to get the local planning commission to rezone the site to keep out medical services and by filing bogus complaints with building inspectors and fire marshals in an effort to shut down renovations The harassers even filed a complaint with the Kansas State Board of Healing Arts the state body that regulates medical providers alleging the illegal practice of medicine when the clinic was not even open  Ms Burkharts own home has been picketed twice in the last few months The second time she saw a sign pointed at her house that said Wheres your church  a reference which she found incredibly frightening to Dr Tillers murder at his church She has obtained a temporary protection order against the fanatic who led the picketing and she is seeking a permanent one There is now tighter security at her home and the clinic she says  The South Wind clinic is to be staffed by three doctors whose names have been withheld to help protect their safety Only one of them lives in Kansas The other two will be flying in from out of state emulating the practice in several other states like Mississippi North Dakota and South Dakota where doctors fears about personal safety and being ostracized in their communities combined with a shortage of physicians with training in abortion care make it necessary to import doctors Special precautions are planned for transporting the doctors to and from the airport Recently one of the doctors who will be commuting from another state to work at South Wind received a harassing phone call from Troy Newman head of the extremist antiabortion group Operation Rescue Mr Newman got through by posing as a reporter and then posted his surreptitious recording of the conversation on the organizations Web site along with the physicians name I was terrified for a while says the doctor who remains committed to the Wichita job  Two weeks ago David Leach from another radical group Army of God posted on YouTube a chilling recording of his recent jailhouse conversation with Scott Roeder the convicted murderer of Dr Tiller in which both men seemed to suggest that some likeminded antiabortion terrorist might kill Julie Darkheart Mr Roeders insulting name for Ms Burkhart By opening the clinic in Dr Tillers building Ms Burkhart has made herself a target both men said on the tape which was first reported by RH Reality Check I dont know if anyone will pick up the gauntlet Mr Leach says ominously adding that he hadnt known Mr Roeder would act until he did  Local law enforcement needs to be on alert as does the FBI and Attorney General Eric Holder Jr who should assess the situation and determine whether federal marshals need to be deployed to protect Ms Burkhart clinic personnel and the facility itself  Dangerous and unconstitutional legislative restrictions unceasing harassment threats of violence and fearful doctors having to hide their identities for selfprotection this is what it means to be on the front line of trying to deliver legal and necessary reproductive health care to women in Wichita and other parts of the country where zealous rightwing politicians and activists on the political fringe currently hold sway  So why does Ms Burkhart persist in this battle The frustrations and dangers are real and sometimes its scary she says But just because we happen to be in a more conservative area in the Midwest doesnt mean women dont need good safe medical care We have work to do here and patients to see in this clinic
Balance and Bias,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/opinion/sunday/douthat-media-balance-and-bias.html,THE traditional American mass media  the crumbling Internetbesieged edifice of newspapers and news shows magazines and roundtables and journalism schools  evolved to believe with equal vigor in two not entirely compatible ideals  One is an ideal of balance nonpartisanship and nearperfect neutrality  distilled to its essence perhaps by the former Washington Post editor Leonard Downie Jrs longstanding refusal to cast a vote so that I never make up my mind which party candidate or ideology should be in power The other is a much more ideological ideal which treats journalism as a kind of vanguard profession  fighting for the powerless against the powerful and leading America toward enlightenment  Both of these visions have inspired great journalists and impressive publications But many of the establishment medias worst habits arise from the doomed attempt to pursue both of them at once Consider for instance the Washington presss tendency toward what critics have dubbed bipartisanthink  in which journalists fetishize centrism and deal making and assume that the best of all possible legislation regardless of its actual content is the kind that has both parties fingerprints on it By conflating the march of progress with the march of legislation through Congress bipartisanthink allows journalists to take sides and root for particular outcomes without having to explicitly choose sides  Usually this happens on fiscal issues where the mainstream presss attitude for the last few years has often been We need a grand bargain and we dont care what is in it And usually bipartisanthink irritates liberals more than conservatives because liberals sense  accurately enough  that many of the media personalities talking up say the SimpsonBowles deficit plan would actually be perfectly happy with President Obamas deficit plan but feel a professional obligation not to admit it Conservatives meanwhile tend to be more frustrated by bipartisanthinks cousin leading the conversation This is how the mainstream media tend to cover social issues and it involves acting as a crusading vanguard while denying often selfrighteously that anything of the sort is happening Im borrowing the term from The Daily Beasts Howard Kurtz who used it to describe how the press while also being fair to all sides should handle the aftermath of the Newtown shootings The trouble is that when you set out to lead a conversation you often end up deciding where it goes which side wins the arguments and even who gets to participate This was clear enough in Kurtzs own piece which assumed that stricter gun control was the only rational policy response to Newtown And its been clear enough in all of the culturally charged debates  over guns and gay marriage immigration and abortion  that have attracted media attention of late On these issues an official journalistic commitment to neutrality coexists with the obvious ideological thrust of a thousand specific editorial choices what kinds of questions are asked of which politicians which stories get walltowall coverage and which ones end up buried which side is portrayed as aggressors and which side as the aggrieved party and on and on and on Leading the conversation is how you end up with the major Sunday shows somehow neglecting to invite a single antiamnesty politician on a weekend dominated by the immigration debate Its how you end up with officially nonideological anchors and journalists lecturing social conservatives for being out of step with modern values And its how you end up with a press corps that went allin for the supposed war on women having to be shamed and harassed  by two writers in particular Kirsten Powers in USA Today and Mollie Ziegler Hemingway of GetReligion  into paying attention to the grisly case of a Philadelphia doctor whose methods of lateterm abortion included snipping the spines of neonates after they were delivered As the last example suggests the problem here isnt that American journalists are too quick to go on crusades Rather its that the presss ideological blinders limit the kinds of crusades mainstream outlets are willing to entertain and the formal commitment to neutrality encourages selfdeception about what counts as crusading The core weakness of the mainstream media in this sense is less liberalism than parochialism The same habits of mind that make bipartisanthink seem like the height of wisdom also make it easy to condescend to causes and groups that seem disreputable and to underplay stories that might vindicate them The best response to this problem probably doesnt involve doubling down on a quest for an illusory neutrality Wed be better off instead if our batteredbutstillpowerful media establishment did more to lean into the Internet era which for all its challenges offers opportunities as well  the chance to multiply perspectives to promote a diverse and yes sometimes competing array of causes and to pursue a wider variety of journalistic ideals
Obamaâ€™s Budget Revives Benefits as Divisive Issue,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/14/us/politics/president-obamas-budget-revives-benefits-as-divisive-issue.html,WASHINGTON  Whether or not Republicans ever agree to a budget deal with President Obama one thing seems certain now that he has officially put Social Security and Medicare benefits on the negotiating table opponents on his partys left will make that an issue for Democrats in the midterm elections next year  and perhaps in the 2016 presidential contest In the midterm races already taking shape Democrats who back Mr Obamas budget proposals to trim future benefits as part of a longterm deficitreduction compromise could be attacked from the left and the right  Liberal groups and some union activists are threatening to recruit candidates to challenge these Democrats in their primaries At the same time the head of the House Republicans campaign committee gleefully signaled last week that he would use Mr Obamas shocking attack on seniors against Democrats in generalelection races  though Republican Congressional leaders demanded the concessions from Mr Obama And while party leaders rebuked the campaign committee chief Representative Greg Walden of Oregon individual Republican candidates and super PACs would be free to wage their own attacks For now at least the political warnings to Democrats are coming mostly from the left of their own party  You cannot be a good Democrat and cut Social Security said Arshad Hasan the executive director of Democracy for America a liberal grassroots group which staged a small protest outside the White House last week even before Mr Obama released his annual budget on Wednesday People would be looking to punish them said Robert Borosage a cofounder of the Campaign for Americas Future another liberal group and they would be looking for primary challengers Even if Democratic incumbents do not draw a primary challenger liberal activists say they might face a shortage of volunteers motivated enough to do the hard work of campaigning  just as Democrats did in the 2010 midterms which resulted in big Republican gains  Looking further ahead to 2016 some on the left have already begun talking about encouraging a liberal Democrat  the freshman Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts is the name most bandied  to take up the dont touch Social Security or Medicare banner as part of a liberal bid for the partys nomination to succeed Mr Obama even against Hillary Rodham Clinton or Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr  Such talk was stoked when Ms Warren within hours of the release of the presidents budget on Wednesday sent supporters an email sounding an alarm Our Social Security system is critical to protecting middleclass families and we cannot allow it to be dismantled inch by inch  She was not available for an interview aides said on Friday  If the major candidates running for the Democratic nomination hedge on important issues like Social Security they will leave open a tremendous amount of space for an insurgent said Adam Green a cofounder of the Progressive Change Campaign Committee a group often critical of Mr Obama But Mr Green acknowledged I wouldnt say anybodys laying the groundwork yet At a minimum Mr Borosage said all Democratic candidates in 2014 or 2016 will be forced to take a stand That prospect could complicate the campaign strategies of establishment favorites Mr Biden is inevitably tied to Mr Obamas policies And Mrs Clinton as a senator was a fiscal moderate who extolled her husbands budgetbalancing record of compromise President Bill Clinton negotiated Medicare savings with Congressional Republicans and their 1997 deal nearly included the same proposal trimming Social Security costofliving increases that Mr Obama has put in his budget to entice Republicans to compromise in turn  Ideological litmus tests have lately been more divisive for Republicans than for Democrats over taxes and social issues like abortion samesex marriage and immigration But the agitation on the left to defend Social Security and Medicare the two programs that Democrats consider perhaps their partys greatest legacy did not begin last week with Mr Obamas new budget It had been building since mid2011 when the president in private negotiations with Speaker John A Boehner tentatively agreed to the new formula for calculating costofliving adjustments in Social Security economists recommend the formula as more accurate but it would mean smaller increases for Social Security beneficiaries Even so Democrats in Congress and the White House agree that the party would have supported Mr Obama back then if a compromise deal had come to a vote But the 2011 talks just like a second round of negotiations in December collapsed after Mr Boehner declined to agree to Mr Obamas counterdemands new taxes on the wealthy and on some corporations and jobcreating investments in infrastructure projects research and education  As his second term began Mr Obama used his annual budget proposal to make his most public overture toward compromise yet The budget incorporating the final December offer to Mr Boehner also proposed other cuts in spending for domestic programs and the military and 400 billion in savings over 10 years from Medicare Those savings would come mostly from reducing payments to hospitals and pharmaceutical manufacturers but also from trimming benefits and raising outofpocket costs for higherincome beneficiaries  Liberals found much to praise like Mr Obamas proposed new spending for road construction nationwide prekindergarten education and advanced manufacturing research a higher federal minimum wage and reduced tax breaks for the wealthy But they were shocked that he proposed the new costofliving formula With that as the kindling their opposition movement intensified More than two years away from Democrats presidentialnominating contest however it is hard to see who could or would become the lefts standardbearer Besides Ms Warren other party leaders mentioned include Gov Andrew M Cuomo of New York Gov Martin OMalley of Maryland Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota  Certainly an unexpected candidate could emerge as Mr Obama did in the 2008 race Three years ahead of that years nominating convention few Democrats saw him as a likely candidate much less one who could vanquish Mrs Clinton  Now Mrs Clinton is again seen as the nearly invincible frontrunner should she choose to run Many potential aspirants including Ms Warren are widely considered unlikely to challenge her as Mr Obama did in 2008  Back then the issue that he seized was opposition to the Iraq war In 2004 Democrats disgust with that war had powered Howard Deans liberal challenge to Senator John Kerry who ultimately defeated Mr Dean for the nomination Geoff Garin a Democratic pollster said that while the issue of protecting Social Security and Medicare could be potent in coming Congressional and presidential campaigns it will not be galvanizing in 2016 quite the way that voting for the Iraq war was  Certainly today and presumably still at the time of the next election President Obama has enormous credibility with Democratic voters particularly liberal Democrats Mr Garin said That credibility extends he added to the presidents case for making changes that bolster the finances of the socialinsurance programs for future generations While I have no doubt that there would be some Democratic voters who rally around a candidate who runs on a dont touch Social Security or Medicare platform Mr Garin added there would not be enough to sustain a candidacy unless that candidate has a lot of other things going for him or her

Kermit Gosnell and Reproductive Care,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/15/kermit-gosnell-and-reproductive-care/,"What does the trial of a Philadelphia doctor who is accused of performing illegal lateterm abortions by inducing labor and then killing viable fetuses have to do with the debate over legal abortion Rep Marsha Blackburn of Tennessee said today that the Kermit Gosnell trial proves that federal
                                        funds should not be used for abortions  an especially odd conclusion to draw given that riders attached to appropriation bills already prohibit the use of federal funds for abortions except in cases
                                        of rape or incest Writing in The Washington Post Jordan Sekulow and Matthew Clark of the

                                         Now for the record If Kermit Gosnell is found guilty of the appalling crimes with which he is charged
                                        he should go to jail for the rest of his life But the effort to use this case to prove that abortion is wrong is wrongheaded If anything the case highlights the need for safe affordable and available womens reproductive health care Dr Gosnell preyed on poor women who  due to the abovementioned riders  could not use Medicaid money to pay for abortions and did not have easy access to better care The abortions he is charged with
                                        performing were illegal in Pennsylvania  after the 24week point at which a fetus is considered to have a chance to survive outside the womb And he is charged with performing abortions in unsafe and unsanitary

                                        about the nightmarish clinic that Dr Gosnell ran Lately the rightwing has used the Gosnell trial not only to attack abortion rights generally but to attack the media They claim that journalists have ignored the trial and that the media blackout
                                        is proof of persistent bias Over the weekend we were attacked on Twitter for running an editorial about the reopening of a womens health clinic in Wichita  four years after the clinic doctor George Tiller was murdered by an
                                        antiabortion extremist  but not one about the Philadelphia case Again for the record The Times has run six articles on the Gosnell case including a long one in 2011 which of course is well before this weekends silliness about coverage The most recent article on March
                                        19 reported on the opening of the trial and the charges against Dr Gosnell But last I checked theres no rule that a newspaper or that papers editorial page has to run one piece about a bad clinic for every piece celebrating a good one Dr Tiller was performing safe and legal abortions when he was gunned down in the foyer of his own church The reopening of his clinic which will not perform lateterm abortions is an act of courage on the part of

accounts of lateterm abortions reporters from major newspapers and television networks descended Monday on the Court of Common Pleas It was the latest example of the power of social media to drive a wide debate similar to the attention paid to a rape trial last month in Steubenville Ohio that resulted in the conviction of two teenage football players  Reporters heard testimony from the Philadelphia medical examiner about unsanitary even filthy conditions at Dr Gosnells clinic from which the remains of 47 fetuses were removed some in a water jug a juice carton and a petfood container  In earlier testimony according to several news reports an unlicensed doctor said that Dr Gosnell 72 showed him how to cut the necks of babies born alive to make sure they died and a young woman who worked at the clinic as a teenager said she assisted in abortions in which she saw at least five babies moving and breathing  Dr Gosnells lawyer Jack McMahon maintains that there were no live births and that the patient who died who had an abortion in her 19th week of pregnancy had unforeseen complications  Eight workers at Dr Gosnells West Philadelphia clinic have pleaded guilty in the case including three to thirddegree murder If convicted Dr Gosnell could face the death penalty  In recent days the case has become a political cause clbre kicked off by a commentator for Fox News Kirsten Powers who wrote in USA Today that when Rush Limbaugh attacked Sandra Fluke a procontraception activist there was nonstop media hysteria but in the case of Dr Gosnell there was only a deafening silence that was disgraceful  Ms Powerss complaint was picked up by others including some who suggested the mainstream media had ignored the story because as Jeffrey Goldberg put it in Bloomberg View it upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion and that reality isnt something some prochoice absolutists want to discuss On Twitter conservatives began a campaign to prod more coverage Mollie Hemingway a columnist for Christianity Today asked individual health journalists directly why they were ignoring the story  Politicians also weighed in Jeb Bush the former Florida governor and 2016 presidential hopeful wrote on Twitter Medias forgotten what belongs on page 1  But others noted there had been scant coverage in conservative news outlets Kevin Drum a political blogger for Mother Jones pointed out that one conservative paper The Washington Times had published one wireservice article about the trial and seven stories complaining that other media outlets arent covering the trial Kelly McBride an expert on media ethics at the Poynter Institute said she saw no evidence of any coverup simply confusion by news editors over whether the story merited national attention One of the ways the news media knows how to cover a story these days is because of the attention in social media Ms McBride said Thats how people judge whether theres an appetite for a story Martin Baron the executive editor of The Washington Post told a reporter from his paper writing about the controversy that he simply had not known of the story until readers emailed him last week I wish I could be conscious of all stories everywhere but I cant be he said We never decide what to cover for ideological reasons no matter what critics might claim The New York Times which covered the news of Dr Gosnells indictment in 2011 was one of the few national outlets to report on the opening of the trial March 18  In any event the coverage has arrived CBS News reported on the trial Monday morning as did the MSNBC show Morning Joe The Fox News host Kimberly Guilfoyle was in the courtroom on Monday for the first time when Dr Sam P Gulino chief medical examiner of Philadelphia described examining 47 fetal remains that were taken from Dr Gosnells office Some were in jars that contained severed feet  Dr Gulino estimated that two of the fetuses were older than 24 weeks the limit for legal abortions in Pennsylvania One estimated to be 28 weeks old he said had a defect in the back of its neck which in a photograph appeared to be an incision Dr Gulino said four sets of remains that he examined had similar defects Under crossexamination by Mr McMahon Dr Gulino conceded he had no evidence that any remains he examined had been born alive He said some had been frozen at the clinic the defunct Womens Medical Society and so evidence of whether they had been viable at delivery was harder to determine  The trial is expected to last another month 
Judge Prevents Closing of Mississippiâ€™s Sole Abortion Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/16/us/ruling-prevents-closing-of-mississippis-only-abortion-clinic.html,NEW ORLEANS  A federal judge in Mississippi on Monday blocked part of a state law that would have forced the closing of the states only abortion clinic  The ruling is not final but it did keep the law from going into effect while a decision on its constitutionality is made keeping Mississippi at least temporarily from becoming the first state in the country without an abortion clinic The law passed in the spring of 2012 requires doctors at abortion clinics to have admitting privileges at local hospitals Lawmakers said at the time that the requirement was intended to protect the health of women though the governor and several legislators did not disguise their hopes that it would lead to the closing of the states lone clinic the Jackson Womens Health Organization  A similar law was recently passed in Alabama Neither of the two physicians who perform the most abortions at the Jackson clinic has local admitting privileges The clinic sued arguing in federal court last summer that the law was a thinly veiled attempt to rid the state of abortion and thus was unconstitutional  But Judge Daniel P Jordan III ruled in United States District Court shortly after the law went into effect in July that the bureaucratic process should be allowed play out as long as the clinic remained open while it did As expected the physicians at the clinic were not able to meet the laws requirements and the State Department of Health had scheduled a hearing for later this week at which the clinics license most likely would have been revoked Closing its doors would  as the state seems to concede in this argument  force Mississippi women to leave Mississippi to obtain a legal abortion Judge Jordan wrote in his opinion on Monday adding that the states position in this case would result in a patchwork system where constitutional rights are available in some states but not others
Suit Seeks to Block Arkansas Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/us/suit-seeks-to-block-arkansas-abortion-law.html,Supporters of abortion rights on Tuesday filed a challenge to the new Arkansas law banning most abortions at the 12th week of pregnancy calling it a violation of over 40 years of settled United States Supreme Court precedent and a threat to the rights liberty and wellbeing of Arkansas women and their families When it was adopted last month with the legislature overriding a veto by Gov Mike Beebe a Democrat who called it blatantly unconstitutional the law was the countrys most stringent limit on abortion Later in March North Dakota pushed the limit back further to six weeks of pregnancy In Roe v Wade and subsequent decisions the Supreme Court has said that women have a right to an abortion up to the point that the fetus is viable outside the womb normally at around 24 weeks of pregnancy The main sponsor of the Arkansas law State Senator Jason Rapert a Republican said he believed that the Supreme Court was ready to redefine the meaning of viability linking it to the detection of a fetal heartbeat But most legal experts including some prominent lawyers in the antiabortion movement predicted that federal courts would quickly declare the laws in Arkansas and North Dakota unconstitutional The suit was filed in United States District Court for the Eastern District of Arkansas in Little Rock by the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of two doctors who perform abortions at a clinic in Little Rock and their patients The law is set to take effect on July 18 but the suit asks the court to impose a permanent injunction before then
The False Alarm Over U.S. Fertility,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/opinion/the-false-alarm-over-us-fertility.html,MANHATTAN Kan AS a bipartisan group of senators prepares to release its plan for comprehensive immigration reform a curious argument is emerging from across the political spectrum the United States needs immigration to make up for its declining birthrate Over the next three decades annual population growth for the workingage population will be less than a third of what it was over the last 60 years President Obamas economic adviser Alan B Krueger told the United States Hispanic Chamber of Commerce in March Given current trends nearly all of the growth of the nations workingage population in the next 40 years will be accounted for by immigrants and their children Conservatives including the antitax activist Grover G Norquist have embraced the argument Last week the American Action Forum led by the Republican budget expert Douglas HoltzEakin found that immigration legislation could raise the annual rate of economic growth by nearly 1 percentage point partly because it would help with low US birthrates In a new book on United StatesMexico relations Shannon K ONeil of the Council on Foreign Relations writes Desperate to close the gaps in Americas work force in the next decade we may be urging Mexicans to come to the United States In another new book What to Expect When No Ones Expecting Americas Coming Demographic Disaster Jonathan V Last of The Weekly Standard warns of a population implosion that will doom the economy to Japanstyle stagnation These fears are hogwash Unlike many wealthy nations that will see their populations stabilize or decrease in coming decades the United States the worlds third most populous country is expected to grow  to to 4203 million by 2060 from 3157 million people today Our fertility rate 19 births per woman slightly below the replacement rate of 21 has dipped since the Great Recession but is still among the highest of rich countries and ties or exceeds fertility rates in middleincome countries like Brazil Iran Thailand and Vietnam It was conservatives who largely invented the aging crisis during their 1970s ascendancy Postwar prosperity had lifted life expectancy and birthrates had fallen from their record highs during the baby boom but conservatives exaggerated these trends to call for welfare state retrenchment reductions in Social Security and Medicare benefits Meanwhile corporations backed the last successful immigration overhaul in 1986 for the reasons they do now their desire for a large supply of lowwage labor The proposed solution to the fabricated fertility crisis  more babies  helped bury the movement for zero population growth that environmental activists advocated in the late 1960s and early 1970s After Roe v Wade 1973 support for a smaller or at least constant American and global population withered Conservatives feared losing credibility on their staunch opposition to abortion while liberals feared being branded antiimmigrant particularly as Hispanics and AsianAmericans began voting heavily for Democratic candidates Conservatives and liberals alike generally assume that population growth drives economic growth But until the triumph of the new laissezfaire economics in the 1970s and 1980s most economists agreed that what mattered was not the size of a population but its human capital and its savings investment and consumption practices Indeed many mainstream economists argued that a smaller but more productive population would enhance growth and lead to a more just society It is strange that we talk on one hand about an innovation and knowledgebased economy while still thinking about economic growth in terms of sheer body count Moderate levels of immigration can help us maintain a highly skilled work force but so too can investing more in educating our young Environmentalists need the courage to discuss national population growth They would be harkening back to a bipartisan tradition one that cites not only air and water pollution but also quality of life recreational access to open space and our duty to protect wilderness Some 70 percent of Americans recognize that global warming is a serious problem and nearly half agree that humans are the main cause But debate has focused on the 11 million undocumented immigrants not the environmental implications of sustained largescale legal immigration to one of the worlds most energyhogging nations The Salt Lake City area where I live part time occasionally records air pollution worse than Beijings thanks to a fastgrowing population and mountains that can trap stagnant air in the Salt Lake Valley Residents are increasingly demanding better policies to reduce driving and cut emissions but few mention our ever expanding national population There is a population crisis  not in America but on a planet that is rapidly losing its ecological integrity and facing a new age of humancaused extinction Neither the elderly nor the worlds rising middle class who rationally choose to have fewer children as their economies become less laborintensive and as women gain more control over their bodies and reproductive choices are to blame Politics and policy not only demography will ultimately shape the future of American society Shoring up the welfare state on the backs of immigrants including guest workers is neither rational nor just There are many reasons to reexamine Americas immigration policies But cynical calls for expanding our population at any cost should play no role in the debate
Silent About Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/opinion/silent-about-abortion.html,To the Editor Courage in Kansas editorial April 14 presents a compelling picture of reproductive rights in this country It is to be hoped that law enforcement officials will take the threats against Julie Burkhart and her clinic seriously and provide any necessary protection That those who provide a legal medical service may require federal protection speaks volumes about how stigmatized abortion is in our society One in three women will terminate a pregnancy by 45 and many of these women express gratitude for their ability to obtain safe abortion care Yet too often they remain silent about the importance of ensuring that others have the same access A different but no less potent form of silence is found in many abortion rights organizations which continually allow the opposition to dictate the terms of the debate and discussion As long as such silence persists abortion will remain stigmatized and politicized Julie Burkhart and those committed to protecting reproductive choice deserve better Its time to break the silence SARAH ERDREICH Washington April 14 2013   The writer is the author of Generation Roe Inside the Future of the ProChoice Movement 
Why So Little Terrorism?,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/why-so-little-terrorism/,"With ricinlaced letters suddenly showing up in Washington DC I worry a little that Im tempting
                                        fate by writing about the rarity of organized terrorism in early 21st century America But hopefully one more post wont
                                        hurt So picking up where my last one left off here are three theories about why our culture seems to be producing relatively few people with the combination of ideological commitment organizational competence
                                        and zeal that has sparked and sustained terrorist campaigns in other times and places 1Â Weve just gotten luckyÂ Thats the caseÂ Will Saletan made for Slate yesterday
                                        after running through the FBIs list of cases involving explosives going back to the beginning of 2012 He found plenty of intercepted plots against soft targets malls synagogues
                                        restaurants etc several cases where only a lastminute break prevented the plot from going forward and plenty of plotters canny enough to cobble together their devices out of ordinary household materialsÂ When
                                        you look at the 20 cases Saletan writes you realize that Boston is just the tip of the iceberg Whats surprising isnt that the marathon bombing succeeded but that so many other
                                        plots failed And given the combination of an expanded target list and the ongoing innovations of bombmakers he suggests we should expect more of them to succeed in the future 2Â We dont have any nationalist movements inside our bordersÂ Call this the Robert Pape theory after the University of Chicago professor famous for arguing that suicide bombing is best understoodÂ 
                                        as a rational strategy for nationalists seeking political liberationÂ rather than a lunatic strategy for religious
                                        fanatics seeking martyrdom The Pape thesis fits well enough with the suicide attacks that AmericaÂ 
                                        hasÂ faced Weve endured sustained suicide campaigns inside countries that weve occupied Iraq Afghanistan and the only major suicide attack within our borders was carried out mostly
                                        by citizens of a country Saudi Arabia where we have a controversial military presence And from both a psychological and logistical perspective it makes sense that suicide attacks against US interests abroad
                                        would be more common than domestic attacks Youre more likely to want to strike a blow against an occupier whether real or perceived if you actually live under their occupation and its vastly
                                        easier to strike the occupier in your own country and to sustain networks capable of repeated strikes than to cross an ocean for the same purpose If Iraq were just across the Rio Grande or Saudi Arabia across
                                        the Saint Lawrence or if we were rerunning Reconstruction somewhere in the 50 states then you might expect more domestic suicide attacks But not enough people inside our borders or in our immediate vicinity
                                        feel like victims of US occupation so suicide terror remains mostly far away 3Â Its the End of HistoryÂ This is an argument Ive made myself Namely that with the collapse
                                        of grand ideological alternatives to liberal democracy one would expect terrorism to become mostly the province of madmen and nihilists and eccentric loners rather than more purposeful movements and organizations
                                        Call it the Christopher Nolan thesis if you dont care for Francis Fukuyama In a world where the major ideological debates have either been resolved or set aside terrorism becomes the province of people
                                        who Jokerstyle just want to watch the world burn which means that we have lots of oneoff horrors and senselessseeming massacres but fewer agendadriven terror campaigns I find all of these ideas persuasive but they still feel a little bit incomplete Like Saletan I fear that well see more Bostonstyle atrocities in the near future but even his examples of failed and foiled
                                        plots dont add up to anything like the kind of sustained campaign that everyone feared wed face understandably after 911 The Pape thesis explains why America would face more suicide attacks
                                        overseas than domestically but in a nation with so many immigrant communities its easy to imagine the logic of suicide terrorism taking hold among groups with ties to Iraq or Saudi Arabia or Palestine in
                                        ways that happily havent actually happened And yes the collapse of Communism as both a reality and an ideal has removed one of the most powerful drivers of revolutionary violence But there are still plenty of issues that inspire deep nearirreconcilable disagreements
                                        in ways that are directly linked to matters of life and death The debates over American wars and foreign policy abortion and at least from the vantage of some greens environmentalism all fall into this category
                                        and these issues have all inspired some sort of violent fringe either today or in the relatively recent past Yet on all of them the center has mostly held of late There was no Iraqera equivalent of the Weathermen
                                        the number of abortionrelated murders spiked in the 1990s and then fell and ecoterrorism remains a fairly minor phenomenon despite the recent political setbacks for mainstream environmentalism Similarly the
                                        Great Recession led to spasms of populism and protest  but no real organized violence whether on the left or on the right This is all a blessing obviously Given human nature and human history though I still think its a bit of a surprise"
Of Judges and Judging,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/17/of-judges-and-judging/,"If you read only one judicial opinion this year you might consider skipping the Supreme Court entirely and going right to a decision                                        issued early this month by Judge Edward R Korman of Federal District Court in Brooklyn The ruling ordered the Obama administration to lift age restrictions on the overthecounter availability of emergency contraception It received plenty of attention                                        as the latest chapter in a highly charged policy debate over access to the morning after pill Judge Korman overturned the 2011 decision of Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of Health and Human Services
                                        to keep the drug known as Plan B on a prescriptiononly basis for girls younger than 17 In reaching her preelection year decision the secretary had rejected the conclusion of scientists at the Food and Drug
                                        Administration that overthecounter access to Plan B would be safe and appropriate for all girls of reproductive age  If the administration accepts this decision rather than appeal it  and thus display judgment and courage that it has conspicuously lacked on this issue until now  then Judge Kormans opinion will
                                        be with any luck not only the latest chapter but the last The regulatory debate the judge pointed out has already lasted 12 years As I said this opinion Tummino v Hamburg was hardly ignored when it was issued on April 4 But its worth reading in full by anyone who wants to observe the judicial process at its finest Speaking
                                        truth to power is a hackneyed phrase and no doubt its what the district judges who struck down the Affordable Care Act thought they were doing But Judge Korman a 70yearold senior judge who took
                                        his seat in 1985 after a distinguished career in private practice and government service shows how its done
                                        with meticulous attention to facts and context If I were teaching a law school course on administrative law  the law of the juncture between citizens and the federal executive branch  I would assign
                                        this opinion as homework for the first class and then spend the rest of the semester unpacking it Judge Korman begins where discussions of emergency contraception should begin but almost never do by defining the drug and how it works Those challenging the requirement for employerprovided health insurance to cover
                                        birth control almost invariably train their attack on emergency contraception by calling it an abortion pill or abortifacient and asserting a religious
                                        objection to abortion  But Judge Korman citing a Government Accountability Office report that collected scientific articles on the mechanism of levonorgestrel the synthetic hormone that is the drugs active ingredient demonstrates
                                        that Plan B is not about abortion It immobilizes sperm and prevents or delays ovulation In other words when taken shortly after unprotected intercourse Plan B works as birth control by preventing rather than
                                        terminating a pregnancy The FDAapproved label for Plan B raises the possibility that the drug might also work by preventing a fertilized egg from implanting in the uterus to begin a pregnancy but the National
                                        Institutes of Health has removed language raising this prospect from its Web site and the NIH biochemist in charge of research on contraception has said the language should also be taken off the label Judge
                                        Korman called the prospect that Plan B might permit fertilization but prevent implantation scientifically unsupported speculation  The debate over the contraceptioncoverage mandate wasnt part of Judge Kormans case that issue will be argued                                        next month before the federal appeals court in Denver in a case brought by the owners of the Hobby Lobby retail store chain I hope the judges who hear the Hobby Lobby case and the other such cases that are cropping
                                        up around the country are as precise as Judge Korman in defining whats at issue evidencebased judging to go along with evidencebased medicine If the challengers real objection is to birth control
                                        they shouldnt be able to hide behind the abortifacient label The controversy over making Plan B available to teens without a prescription began during the Bush administration when the Food and Drug Administration denied a petition to permit overthecounter availability to all
                                        women without age restriction Litigation ensured The case reached Judge Korman who ruled in March 2009                                        that the agencys lengthy delays and rejection of the evidence provided by its own scientists showed a lack of good faith and reasoned agency decisionmaking He ordered the FDA to make
                                        Plan B available at least to 17 year olds and to come up with an evidencebased answer to the question of overthecounter availability for younger girls By then of course President Obama had taken office and had appointed a highly respected public health physician Dr Margaret Hamburg as FDA commissioner This change in leadership suggested that the FDA
                                        could be trusted to conduct a fair assessment of the scientific evidence Judge Korman observed in the recent opinion While he was to be disappointed  the agency didnt act for nearly three
                                        years  it did eventually support approval for all females of childbearing potential in a statement Dr Hamburg issued in December 2011 But Secretary Sebelius exercising her authority
                                        over the agency refused to accept the recommendation President Obama supported his cabinet member  The motivation for the secretarys action was obviously political Judge Korman wrote He said Secretary Sebelius failed to offer a coherent justification for rejecting the recommendation
                                        of her departments top scientists He noted that Plan B would be probably among the safest drugs approved for overthecounter sale for the pediatric population much safer than the diet
                                        drugs and cough syrups that teenagers are known to abuse but that remain available without prescription Under the Administrative Procedure Act the statute that governs challenges to the actions of federal agencies a court can overturn an agencys action only by finding it arbitrary capricious an abuse
                                        of discretion or otherwise not in accordance with law That standard affords agencies a wide berth of judicial deference and not surprisingly most challenges fail But its a standard nonetheless
                                        and Judge Korman took most of 59 pages to explain why it fit what happened here The Secretarys action was politically motivated scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent
                                        he concluded And so concluded a lesson in how to be a judge And speaking of judges  how to respond to the bill proposed by Senator Charles E Grassley to lop three seats off the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit Four of the 11 authorized
                                        seats are now vacant and the Iowa Republican senators plan would limit President Obama to filling one of them  thus achieving a bare fourtofour balance of Republican and Democraticappointed
                                        judges on the countrys most important circuit court The Senate Republican minority conducted an outrageous filibuster that killed the nomination of Caitlin Halligan President Obamas first nominee
                                        to the court The Senate is now considering the nomination of Deputy Solicitor General Sri Srinivasan for whom the administration is doing conspicuously more heavy lifting than it did for the superbly qualified
                                        Ms Halligan Well I think the best response to Senator Grassleys proposal which of course has no chance of becoming law is an indulgent smile at its charmingly if perhaps inadvertently retro nature A little historical
                                        perspective may be in order Its been awhile  144 years to be exact  since the number of seats on the Supreme Court has been anything other than nine Most people know about President Franklin D Roosevelts failed
                                        effort to expand the courts membership in order to get a sufficient number of New Dealfriendly justices But shrinking the court in a congressional power play against an incumbent president has even older
                                        roots

Vindication,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/books/review/margaret-fuller-by-megan-marshall.html,Margaret Fuller died on July 19 1850 in a shipwreck off Fire Island In her intellectual prime and at the height of her influence as a social reformer she was returning home from Europe with her Italian husband and their child A major advocate for the rights of women Fuller had left the United States in 1846 just a year after the publication of her influential book Woman in the Nineteenth Century which both Susan B Anthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton cited as an inspiration Having accomplished her mission as Megan Marshall puts it in this new biography to meet the writers and radicals whose work shed admired from afar and test their minds in conversation Fuller was coming home to the United States having flagrantly acted out the freedoms she demanded as every womans right Margaret Fuller A New American Life returns Marshall to the Boston Brahmin salons of her earlier and deservedly praised biography The Peabody Sisters whose three subjects Elizabeth Mary and Sophia campaigned with Fuller against the sexist double standards that starved womens intellects and denied them agency in any but the domestic sphere It was at Elizabeth Peabodys West Street bookstore that Fuller conducted many of her celebrated conversations unorthodox gatherings of female intellectuals who looked toward a changed world with women as powerful as men Most of those who conversed about womens rights ended by sacrificing their noble ideals to the comforts of marriage Not Fuller who walked her talk endorsing scandalous living arrangements over what she termed a corrupt social contract that Marshall adds cheated wife far worse than husband From the time he perceived his daughters genius Fullers father Timothy a congressman from Massachusetts determined to push his firstborn as near perfection as possible He lavished an education as fine as any boys on Margaret who was reciting in Latin by the age of 6 and who under a torrent of criticism mastered her fathers greatest lesson Mediocrity is obscurity As Marshall observes Fullers success in wooing her fathers attention away from her much prettier mother by gratifying his need for an intellectual consort inspired her later headlong rushes into one feverish cerebral consummation after another A template for love based on a brilliant outspoken female sparring with a man of less acute intelligence was likely to yield an anguished romantic career In the mid19th century even a highminded man who supported womens rights usually opted for a domesticated wife preferably one prettier than Fuller Ralph Waldo Emerson one of the preeminent thinkers with whom she would spend her life in discourse both on and off the page judged her emotionally voracious looking for an absolute allconfiding intimacy between her and another A surefooted biographer Marshall admits to devoting disproportionate attention to a subject that was catalytic to Fullers emotional as well as intellectual development the circle of young lovers who were drawn to the flame of her intelligence and were invariably left blistered eager for gentler company No one likes a conceited genius and Marshall seems to know that she cant hold her readers for long without countering the arrogance Fullers accomplishments inspired How better to summon sympathy than to highlight the romantic disappointments that attended the bluestockings homeliness and lack of social grace Fuller may have been sharing the opinion of others when she observed that there was no intellect comparable to her own  not in the United States anyway  but even friends who railed against the highhanded superiority of Queen Margaret relented in the face of her often abject loneliness Fuller was 25 and looking forward to the freedoms of unfettered adulthood when her father died proving as great an influence in absentia as hed been when drilling her on the classics Transferred along with her immediate family to the custody of Timothy Fullers younger brother Abraham she balked at being herded from one mans control to anothers Instead she took it upon herself to support her mother and younger siblings She taught school wrote and then sold what she wrote working to the point of exhaustion and sometimes collapse Fullers friendships with Emerson Thoreau Alcott and other outspoken dissidents may have amounted to what Marshall terms a public alliance with the members of the Transcendental Club but by the time she was asked to be the editor of The Dial Emerson having claimed to be too busy for the job her essays and criticism had been widely discussed and praised and she felt secure enough in her authority to steer the magazine away from its original mission to popularize Transcendentalism For her aesthetic culture was to be seen as a means toward personal transformation and with that agenda she wrote and published an essay that would become what Marshall calls the magazines most enduring contribution to American thought The Great Lawsuit was a critique of personal relations among men and women inspired by Fullers forays into a world far from the comfortable drawing rooms of wellheeled Yankees Her investigations into the lives of the local poor including a visit to the deathbed of a young woman who had botched her own abortion had inspired a dark epiphany about the nightmarish destiny of most married women who lived lives of grueling thankless servitude The publication of The Great Lawsuit lifted Fuller to a new notoriety Even an intimate like Sophia Peabody thought she had gone too far in pontificating on something she had not experienced herself marriage But others paid attention to Fullers indictment of an institution she termed a miserable mistake Horace Greeley the editor of The New York Tribune not only hired her but suggested expanding The Great Lawsuit into what would become a groundbreaking work of American feminism Woman in the Nineteenth Century With Greeleys blessing his new literary editor  more partner than employee  undertook the task of exposing the criminal abuses rife in asylums and prisons supported suffrage for blacks as well as women and wrote biting editorials in hopes of transforming New York into a model society When she sailed for Europe the journey was partly funded by Greeleys advance for her future dispatches from the Old World Alas the manuscript in her travel desk drowned with her only 300 yards from land Fuller could navigate the turbulence of public opinion but she didnt know how to swim The waves would not have been as difficult to brave as the prejudices she would have encountered had she arrived home safely one mourner noted of Fullers necessarily controversial and divisive return In what Marshall identifies as the most radical act of her life so far this towering genius hadnt chosen an intellectual consort but an apparent sybarite dismissed by her friends as half an idiot a person who had most likely never read a book all the way through Shed left America alone a spinster and was bringing home a penniless partner who gave her pleasure saw to her comfort and knew better than to interrupt her at her desk in other words a wife who happened to be a man The rest of the world might take its time arriving at equal rights but Margaret Fuller had evened things up for herself
Is It Time for Off-the-Shelf Birth-Control Pills?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/21/sunday-review/is-it-time-for-off-the-shelf-birth-control-pills.html,WHEN a federal judge recently ordered the Food and Drug Administration to make the morningafter pill available to women of all ages without a prescription the ruling was a political embarrassment for the Obama administration and unleashed protests from abortion foes and abstinence advocates But that controversy may look like a tempest in a teapot compared with a broader and no less heated discussion that is roiling the medical community should birthcontrol pills of any type require a doctors prescription Or should they be available like Tylenol on pharmacy shelves  Last December the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists released an official position paper concluding that the time had come for birthcontrol pills to be sold over the counter It was the first time the group had endorsed such sales concluding that scientific evidence suggested that the practice was safe and calling it a potential way to improve contraceptive access and use and possibly decrease the unintended pregnancy rate After all oral contraceptives have been available in the United States for more than half a century and few medicines have been so thoroughly vetted Despite some catchy new brand names the pills I took 25 years ago are essentially the same as those my daughter takes today If anything pills have become safer because they contain lower doses of estrogen  While oral contraceptives bring with them some tiny risks especially if used improperly they arguably pose fewer dangers than many other medicines bought freely at the pharmacy experts say including nonsteroidal pain pills like Motrin which can cause stomach bleeding and decongestants like Sudafed which may raise blood pressure With a simple packaging insert about proper use and precautions women would be fully capable of using them safely the gynecologists group maintained  Nonsteroidal medicines kill far more people than birthcontrol pills said Dr Eve Espey a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of New Mexico who was involved in writing the position paper For most women the absolute risk of taking the pill is far less than the risks incurred in pregnancy  The goal of the proposal of course is to make birthcontrol pills more readily available The biggest barrier to adherence is the logistics of a prescription  you run out on a Saturday night you lose your pills you go on vacation you cant get a doctors appointment said Daniel Grossman a gynecologist who is a vice president at Ibis Reproductive Health a nonprofit research organization  In his groups studies about onethird of the women who were using no birth control or a less effective method said they would use the pill if it were available without a prescription This is what women want Dr Grossman added But pregnancy prescriptions and religious politics form a combustible mix in the United States and LoOvral is not likely to be next to the Tylenol anytime soon  While womens health advocates gleefully called the American Colleges endorsement a game changer in the quest for overthecounter sales of birthcontrol pills members of the Catholic Medical Association lambasted the idea Gynecologists themselves seem divided on the issue A recent poll found that a majority of gynecologists and family doctors in training opposed the practice worried mainly about safety The researchers at the University of Missouri who conducted the survey concluded that the fear was irrational revealing a knowledge deficit about the safety of oral contraceptives  But Dr Donna Harrison executive director of the American Association of ProLife Obstetricians and Gynecologists said her group believed that it was foolish to make these medicines available over the counter because of the potential for misuse and also because the practice served to abandon and isolate younger women who needed a doctors counsel She cited studies showing that women who had ready access to overthecounter emergency contraception had higher rates of sexually transmitted diseases The political response has been even more topsyturvy Gov Bobby Jindal of Louisiana a Republican who opposes abortion endorsed the American Colleges proposal saying that contraception was a personal issue Meanwhile the FDA will not comment on the idea because of the ongoing legal issues concerning the judicial ruling on the morningafter pill Plan B said Stephanie Yao a spokeswoman The morningafter pill also known as emergency contraception contains the same hormones as some birthcontrol pills though delivered in a short blast and higher dose That legal dispute has highlighted the Obama administrations hair splitting over the sensitive issue of contraceptive policy Even though FDA doctors said in 2011 that studies showed that it was safe to sell Plan B the most common emergency contraceptive to adolescents over the counter the administration refused to approve the practice It was already available to older women That set the stage for the ruling earlier this month by Judge Edward R Korman of the Eastern District of New York who called the administrations action politically motivated and scientifically unjustified  essentially an attempt to appease religious conservatives  Politics aside there are procedural hurdles to clear before packs of birthcontrol pills can be sold without prescription First of all a drug maker would most likely have to apply to the FDA to make the switch At the very least that would involve serious investment in studies to show that patients could understand labels and use the pills as directed And overthecounter sales could upend drug company profits After all some oral prescription contraceptives sell for close to 100 a month with insurers paying the bulk of the costs while generic pills cost under 10 Dr Espey said gynecologists might resist for financial reasons as well since young women often visit the gynecologist annually solely for the purpose of getting a contraceptive prescription Pap smears which used to be recommended once a year are now advised only once every three They worry that if patients can go to the pharmacy and get their pills they will have fewer visits she said As for safety the most common birthcontrol pill  which combines progestin with a low dose of estrogen  poses a very slightly elevated risk of blood clots and a few other conditions But that is mostly for certain groups of women including those with high blood pressure or those who are over 35 and smoke for example these women are advised not use them But warnings could be conveyed in package labeling just as patients with a history of ulcers are advised not to take certain pain medications And a few alternative birthcontrol pills that contain only progestin are generally safe for all So far the debate has been argued in black and white But there is in fact a middle ground many countries that allow pharmacies to sell birthcontrol pills require that a pharmacist screen women for contraindications with a few simple questions  My daughter spends hundreds of dollars a year for a gynecologists visit to obtain a prescription for the same pill I got a quartercentury earlier She goes through elaborate machinations to get them if she runs out while away on a summer job The Affordable Care Act of 2010 seeks to improve access to the pills by eventually eliminating patient copays when prescriptions are filled But many doctors think it would be even smarter to just eliminate the prescription 
Boston Begins to Say Goodbye to Victims of the Bombings,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/22/us/boston-begins-to-say-goodbye-to-bombing-victims.html,MEDFORD Mass  Boston began to say goodbye on Sunday to those it lost last week Its leaders  religious as well as political  fanned out in front of naves and cameras to do what they could to reassure grieving parishioners and constituents that the danger had passed Or that for those who are gone life as Cardinal Sean P OMalley put it is not ended merely changed Memories were not the only thing etched for some mourners As Melanie Fitzemeyer who babysat for Krystle Campbell two decades ago walked to Ms Campbells wake along with hundreds of others at a brickandframe funeral home on Main Street here she took off her jacket and rolled up her sleeve Incised on her arm was a twoline tattoo she had gotten the night before at a parlor owned by one of Ms Campbells cousins Boston Strong the top line read in black letters scored into the length of her forearm the surrounding skin still pink and tender 1983 Krystle 2013 read the bottom Ms Campbell a 29yearold restaurant manager died after last Mondays bombing at the Boston Marathon from wounds sustained near the finish line of a race she tried to see every year Ms Fitzemeyer 39 knew her longer than most and remembered her as an exuberant child She liked to paint and color and make things she said Ms Campbell will be buried on Monday and the wake here on Sunday was the first time anyone was able to say goodbye so intimately to any of the victims Dozens came from Harvard  where her mother and brother work as she once did  while 50 leatheranddenim clad members of motorcycle clubs stood across the street Some told photographers to move down the street Were just trying to keep the nonsense away one biker explained after he and two friends blocked a cameraman Other bikers waited quietly they said in case a rumored picket by the Westboro Baptist Church materialized Were just here to create a respectful barrier for the family said Tony Rossetti a Middlesex County sheriffs deputy who is the president of the Boston chapter of the Enforcers Motorcycle Club where he is known as Preacher Reassurance seemed to be the message from top city and state officials on the Sunday news shows Mayor Thomas M Menino said that what he knew suggested that the two brothers suspected of carrying out the attack had operated by themselves All of the information that I have they acted alone he said on This Week on ABC The danger has passed Gov Deval Patrick said on Face the Nation on CBS The immediate threat I think all of law enforcement feels is over based on the information we have he said And that is a good thing and you can feel the relief at home here Yet the investigation continued with officials struggling to learn whether the brothers had help or were operating in league with anyone Tamerlan Tsarnaev 26 died after a shootout with the police in Watertown Mass early Friday morning and Dzhokhar Tsarnaev 19 was captured that night in Watertown and now lies grievously wounded in a Boston hospital bed At the Cathedral of the Holy Cross in Boston Cardinal OMalley said some of the more than 170 wounded in the bombings had prayed there one week ago He named the four who lost their lives  three who died at the finish line and a police officer who was killed three nights later in a fatal encounter with the Tsarnaev brothers officials say  and said they would live in eternity We must be a people of reconciliation not revenge the cardinal said The crimes of the two young men must not be the justification for prejudice against Muslims and against immigrants The Gospel is the antidote to the eye for an eye and tooth for a tooth mentality Cardinal OMalley who has criticized the Democratic Party for its support for abortion rights said that more than one million abortions annually is one indication of how human life has been devalued But he also criticized lawmakers in Congress  by implication most of them Republicans  by saying that a failure to enact laws that control access to automatic weapons is emblematic of the pathology of our violent culture I hope that the events of this past week have taught us how high the stakes are the cardinal said at the end of his homily We must build a civilization of love or there will be no civilization at all His words resonated with Maureen Quaranto a nurse practitioner She was working as a volunteer in a medical tent at the marathon when the bombs went off On Sunday she drove from her home in Plymouth Mass and then lingered after the service tears in her eyes It just gives you time to reflect she said Jesus said to forgive him Mayor Menino and Governor Patrick called on everyone in the state to come together for a moment of silence at 250 pm Monday  precisely one week after the bombings That will be followed by the ringing of bells across Boston and the commonwealth On Monday night at Boston University students and faculty and staff members will gather on campus in honor of Lu Lingzi 23 the Chinese graduate student who was killed in the bombing We will remember her and everything good that a bright ambitious and engaging student represents in our community and hopefully speak about the values that make our community strong even under such terrible circumstances Robert A Brown the president of the university wrote in an email announcing the gathering Another memorial is expected this week at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology to honor Sean A Collier 27 the campus police officer who was killed I am profoundly grateful for the service and supreme sacrifice of Officer Collier who was an extraordinary young man an excellent police officer and a truly beloved member of our community Eric Grimson the chancellor of MIT wrote in an email on Sunday The fourth victim Martin Richard 8 was mourned on Sunday in Dorchester at the church attended by his family There were signs that the Boston area was returning to normal Late Sunday afternoon Mayor Menino briefed reporters about a fivephase plan to reopen the area where the attack occurred It will involve decontamination structural building assessments and debris removal Newbury Street the busy retail thoroughfare that runs parallel to Boylston Street where the blasts took place was bustling on Sunday with visitors clutching shopping bags and relaxing in restaurants But they were also drawn by the hundreds to gaze over the metal barriers cordoning off the six blocks around the marathons finish line Its been really eerie said Calla Gillies a 24yearold real estate agent who lives inside the area which she can gain access to with proof of residence Were just still as scared because its empty It feels like the marathon was yesterday
Free Speech and an Anti-Prostitution Pledge,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/23/opinion/free-speech-and-an-anti-prostitution-pledge-at-the-supreme-court.html,A 2003 federal statute called the United States Leadership Against HIVAIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria Act finances a wide range of public health initiatives to treat and prevent disease around the world  That law prohibits the use of any government money to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution But it also goes beyond that reasonable provision to require almost all recipients of funds to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution  to make an antiprostitution pledge  and to refrain from any speech the government deems inconsistent with the policy  On Monday in Agency for International Development v Alliance for Open Society International the Supreme Court heard oral arguments on whether this provision violates the recipients First Amendment right to freedom of expression It clearly does by requiring them to speak and advocate the governments position without the option of staying silent This provision could also hurt outreach programs by undermining trust with sex workers who may avoid seeking help from organizations with a declared antiprostitution agenda The government contends that placing a condition on federal dollars is a legitimate way to promote its policies and those who do not want to make an explicit pledge can avoid it by not taking government money  While the Supreme Court has said organizations receiving federal money can be restricted from different forms of expression like talking about abortion as a medical option the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit said correctly in 2011 that the antiprostitution speech provision pushes considerably further and mandates that recipients affirmatively say something by declaring their opposition to prostitution  Compelling that speech is unconstitutional as are other forms of compulsion by government like requiring schoolchildren to salute the flag as a condition of going to public school which the Supreme Court rejected in a landmark case as official control over personal beliefs  Justice Samuel Alito Jr said at Mondays oral argument Im not aware of any case in which this court has held that it is permissible for Congress to condition federal funding on the recipients expression of agreement with ideas with which the recipient disagrees He called that a dangerous proposition  The Justice Department initially said the condition cannot be constitutionally applied to US organizations and it was not enforced Then the department saying that view had been tentative changed its mind The Supreme Court should affirm the appeals court and rule that the First Amendment prohibits this form of official control

Philadelphia Abortion Doctor Is Cleared on Some Counts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/us/judge-throws-out-some-charges-against-dr-kermit-gosnell.html,PHILADELPHIA  A Pennsylvania judge on Tuesday threw out three of seven murder charges against a Philadelphia doctor charged with killing viable fetuses while performing abortions The judge Jeffrey P Minehart of Common Pleas Court here granted motions for acquittal on the charges against the physician Dr Kermit Gosnell who ran the Womens Medical Center a West Philadelphia abortion clinic Judge Minehart also granted a motion for acquittal in five charges of abuse of corpse against Dr Gosnell who according to prosecutors killed fetuses that were alive after they were aborted by plunging scissors into their necks Dr Gosnell 72 was also acquitted on one charge of infanticide The judge gave no reason for his decision which came on the fifth week of the trial and preceded the start of defense arguments which had been scheduled to begin on Tuesday afternoon but are now expected to start Wednesday The trial has become a cause clbre for some antiabortion activists a few of whom were seated in the courtroom on Tuesday Before the judge announced his decision an officer of the court instructed those present to remain silent Bryan Kemper youth outreach director for Priests for Life an antiabortion group said he was obviously frustrated with the judges decision Mr Kemper who traveled from Ohio to attend the trial said he was convinced that Dr Gosnell had deliberately killed live fetuses It makes no sense to me that he could snip the back of the neck of a baby that was not alive Mr Kemper said during a break in the hearing Dr Gosnell still faces four charges of firstdegree murder and one of thirddegree murder in connection with the death of a patient at the Womens Medical Center If found guilty on the remaining charges he could face the death penalty Eight workers at Dr Gosnells clinic have pleaded guilty in the case including three to thirddegree murder Dr Gosnells lawyer Jack J McMahon argued that none of the seven fetuses his client is accused of killing were alive when they were removed from their mothers because they had been given a drug that killed them in utero Therefore there was no validity to the charges of murder infanticide or abuse of corpse he said There is not one piece of real scientific evidence that any one was born alive Mr McMahon told the judge who heard the acquittal motions without a jury present Mr McMahon dismissed prosecutors arguments that an arm movement by one of the fetuses known as Baby C indicated that it was alive He said that the movement was one spasm but that the fetus was not breathing Baby C had been one of the three fetuses for which the judge dismissed the murder charge But on Wednesday morning the judge said the dismissal of the charge related to Baby C was done mistakenly as a result of a clerical error That charge was reinstated and the charge related to Baby F was dismissed In addition the judge acquitted Dr Gosnell of killing Baby B which Mr McMahon said was not breathing when it was removed from its mother and of the death of Baby G whose age and viability were both unknown according to the lawyer But Edward Cameron an assistant district attorney said that Baby C responded and pulled back when touched by medical staff Thats voluntary movement and thats all the law requires Mr Cameron said That baby was alive Mr Cameron also opposed the motion to acquit Dr Gosnell on the abuse of corpse count which stemmed from the jars of the severed feet of fetuses that were discovered in the clinic when it was raided by law enforcement officers in February 2011 Aborted fetuses should be treated as human beings Mr Cameron argued When you have got jars of feet that this man was keeping on the shelves of his office that would offend anybody he said When the fetuses leave the mother they are due the respect of any human being Mr Cameron also highlighted the case of Baby D which he said was 10 to 15 inches long and had a head as big as a pancake It was moving when it was delivered into a toilet Mr Cameron said
"Howard J. Phillips, Stalwart Conservative, Dies at 72",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/24/us/politics/howard-j-phillips-dies-72-stalwart-conservative.html,Howard J Phillips a pillar of conservative activism who ran for president three times on the ticket of a political party he helped found died on Saturday at his home in Vienna Va He was 72 The cause was temporal frontal lobe dementia his sister Susan Phillips Bari said Along with Richard Viguerie Paul Weyrich Terry Dolan and others Mr Phillips was a leader of the New Right a movement that gave more clout to the right wing of the Republican Party in the 1970s and 80s much as the Tea Party has in recent years Even among stalwart conservatives Mr Phillips was known for being especially devoted to the ideological principles of the right including limited government traditional family values strong national defense and opposition to abortion He was our true north Mr Viguerie famed for pioneering the political use of direct mail said in an interview on Monday You could compromise on strategy but on principle Howie was unswerving Mr Phillipss integrity as a conservative was on display in President Richard M Nixons administration In early 1973 the president signaled his intention to withhold financing from the Office of Economic Opportunity an antipoverty agency with roots in President Lyndon B Johnsons war on poverty The president named Mr Phillips acting director and charged him with dismantling it I believe Richard Nixon epitomizes the American dream and represents all that is great in America Mr Phillips said at the time Nixon was unable to carry out his plans however after Democrats successfully sued to prevent him from starving an agency that Congress had authorized And when Nixon yielded and continued to finance Johnsons Great Society programs Mr Phillips considered the president to have broken his word and resigned The thing that changed him was that while he was working for OEO before he became acting director he went around the country looking at all the grantees Ms Bari his sister said and concluded that much of the money was supporting liberal advocacy groups Not to what the taxpayers thought they were supporting Ms Bari said Thats what radicalized him In 1974 Mr Phillips founded the Conservative Caucus an advocacy group based in Warrenton Va He stepped down as its chairman in 2011 Mr Phillips could be a thorn in the side of presidents even fellow Republicans He lobbied against President Ronald Reagans nomination of Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court and against the first President George Bushs nomination of David Souter to the court arguing that they would favor abortion rights Whether he won or lost he always said that what is right is what he was going to do Charles Orndorff the administrative vice president of the Conservative Caucus said in an interview on Monday His honor as a conservative leader meant the most to him In 1990 believing that neither major party would enact the policies he favored Mr Phillips led the formation of the US Taxpayers Party later renamed the Constitution Party which declares that its policies are based on the founding documents of the nation and the original intent of the founding fathers He was its candidate for president in 1992 1996 and 2000 His best showing was in 1996 when he received onefifth of 1 percent of the vote Howard Jay Phillips was born in Boston on Feb 3 1941 and grew up in the Brighton neighborhood His father Frederick ran an insurance agency his mother the former Gertrude Goldberg was a homemaker Though he was raised Jewish he became a Christian in the 1970s He was present at the 1960 conference at the home of William F Buckley Jr in Sharon Conn that created the conservative organization Young

"Teaching the Lessons Learned in War, to Thwart Attackers at Home",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/26/us/florida-school-teaches-lessons-of-war-to-thwart-attackers-at-home.html,VALPARAISO Fla  The bombdisposal technicians huddled with the fire chief and the Transportation Security Administration supervisor on the tarmac of Northwest Florida Regional Airport The chief and the supervisor told the technicians that luggage screeners thought they had spotted two bombs in suitcases belonging to passengers on a departing plane Operators of a CTX machine or luggage scanner spotted the first in a rollaway bag on a conveyor belt The bag had been matched to a passenger A review of surveillance video from the terminal showed its owner talking in a familiar way to another man That mans bag also thought to hold a bomb was out there  the TSA supervisor gestured toward luggage trailers on the asphalt near a gate So began an exercise in the Advanced Improvised Explosive Device Disposal course a quietly busy American military school intended to help thwart a weapon indelibly linked to terrorism and war the makeshift bomb the type of weapon that had been used days before in the Boston Marathon attack This exercise held on the Florida Panhandle the night before the police closed in on the marathon suspects in Massachusetts had been scheduled since January But its timing was not lost on its participants Tracy Stage the airports deputy director watched the drill and said the value of the training had been brought home by what happened in Boston A weapon of unconventional war had shown itself once again to be a domestic killer The students and instructors mostly military veterans of combat tours in Afghanistan or Iraq had seen the bloody effects of bombing campaigns abroad They had years of experience disabling improvised devices examining blast sites and searching for evidence among burned wreckage and human remains The events in Boston seemed to surprise none of them Several said they expected to see more makeshift bombs in the United States where in certain circumstances particularly in rural areas military ordnance disposal technicians could be called to work beside civilian law enforcement agencies Its not a matter of if said Capt Joseph Polanin the commanding officer of Naval School Explosive Ordnance Disposal which offers this advanced course to seasoned technicians Its a matter of when The school Captain Polanin commands trains ordnance disposal technicians in all four American military services as well as foreign military students The course which lasts three weeks and trains about 375 students a year is open only to experienced military technicians and students from federal agencies it does not admit foreign students however because much of its instruction is classified The curriculum sharpens skills that might be used overseas or in the United States The latest drill began when Juanita Wright an operations supervisor at the airport called the school to report the discovery of the bombs and request help Two teams of students were soon en route to the terminal On the tarmac the teams set up a pair of remotecontrolled robots which soon were rolling on treads toward the suspicious luggage That the last night of the courses exercises was held at a public airport served by prominent commercial airlines including Delta United and US Airways was by design The makeshift bomb disposal technicians know is not merely a weapon of trench lines or remote trails or used solely against military convoys and patrols It has become the weapon of choice in terrorist attacks across a spectrum of civilian settings in markets and places of worship in parking lots and stadiums in schools or as in Boston on crowded urban streets The course also conducts its exercises on recognizable public sites  like a bank a police station a rail yard a goatandpoultry farm a day care center a motel an abortion clinic and more But such sites are actually fullscale replicas scattered throughout the pine forest of Eglin Air Force Base where the school is Each daily exercise presents a three or fourperson team with different tactical and technical problems Several training situations involve hostages some with simulated bombs strapped to them The courses devices as the staff calls them are often trickier to disable than bombs commonly encountered in actual conflicts or terrorism attacks As a condition of being allowed access to the instruction The New York Times agreed not to disclose certain technical details of the simulated bombs or certain tactics and techniques used to disable them But in general these devices are often made by the staff in the schools electronics shop and are complicated and laden with traps Several of the ones used last week were not mockups of explosive weapons but devices intended to disperse radiological or biological powders or chemical agents Some had timers radiooperated detonators or features that tripped when a bomb was handled or moved Others were activated by switches connected to infrared sensors by microphones that detect noise above a certain decibel level or by the interruption of a laser beam These might explode if approached in the wrong manner Many had multiple switches  combinations of the above The objective of this panoply of devices the instructors said was to tax the students skills in diagnosing either by Xray or visual inspection how bombs had been built Part of this course is intended to stump the techs said Lt Michael S Dalrymple of the Navy who supervises the course And that drives the learning points home He added One of the lessons is There are so many devious ways to get me The difficult devices are also necessary instructors said because many students have disposed of countless bombs in Afghanistan and Iraq and are familiar with common designs We have a generation of techs who grew up outside the United States and arrive here with a very experienced skill set said Sgt First Class Timothy D Haar an Army instructor Moreover in domestic settings Sergeant Haar said technicians familiar with certain disposal techniques overseas are urged to use a lighter touch than they might use in a combat zone where the possibility of property damage can be less of a worry and devices are often immediately blown up where they are found without extended diagnostics On the tarmac the exercise continued presenting the team with exactly that situation a desire not to explode a bomb beside an airport terminal where the damage would be expensive and newsworthy and bring attention to the bombers After examining the bag on the cart by robot the team decided to take an Xray to study its contents Sgt Daniel Salazar a Marine from the Ninth Engineer Support Battalion stationed in Okinawa Japan stepped into a bomb suit with a blastresistant face shield and approached the luggage with large sheets of film After he took several shots and backed away the team scanned the film and reviewed the images on a computer screen They saw a tangle of wires mixed with consumer electronics  what appeared to be a deliberately confused jumble of the ordinary and the nefarious The team members spotted what they thought were its crucial components and devised a plan to breach the bag with small power tools so they could disable the bomb by hand A short while later they succeeded The bomb had been disassembled its components gathered for evidence and disposal
The Weight Those Heels Carry,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/28/movies/the-weight-those-heels-carry.html,LOS ANGELES  Kerry Washington starts with the shoes To portray Olivia Pope the tough crisis manager at the center of the hit ABC series Scandal Ms Washington is always in gravitydefying heels How else to make that sexedup power stalk down the White House corridors  I never completely understand a character until I know what kind of shoes they wear Ms Washington said For an interview at Milk Studios here she was in a pair of intimidating white high heels But Ms Washington is often in sneakers or flipflops a clue for anyone trying to understand her It says Im not really attracted to walking in the world in any one way she explained I like to walk in the world a lot of different ways  Those ways have ranged from the role of the slave Broomhilda in Quentin Tarantinos recent Django Unchained to the pampered Grace Peeples in the modern romantic comedy Peeples out on May 10 But it has been through the intimacy and reach of television that Ms Washington 36 has arrived in the center of a major cultural discussion Thanks to Scandal she is only the second black woman in almost 40 years to lead a network television drama and the first one to make it a bona fide hit Ratings for the political thriller which began last April have been building all season it now beats its rival at 10 pm on Thursday  Elementary on CBS  many weeks among viewers 18 to 49 the demographic advertisers covet most Critics hail its often outrageous fastpaced plot twists The designerdressed Pope who has her own crisismanagement firm and her team of young gladiators in suits repair reputations and fix scandals from kidnappings to murder Pope is also the former mistress of President Fitzgerald Grant or Fitz a white married Republican played by Tony Goldwyn their sex scenes sizzled  Â Scandal has flair and even sophistication the critic Alessandra Stanley wrote in The Times In no small part that is because of Ms Washingtons ability to convey class and sensuality at the same time in the words of Reginald Hudlin a producer of Django Unchained For many devotees the shows depiction of a complex black woman at the top of her game  her racial identity never a big deal  is the cherry on top Paradoxically attention to the breakout role has meant Ms Washington must carry the racial aspirations and fantasies of more than a few fans as well as the expectation that her success could open doors in the notoriously raceaverse world of network television  Its clear that Scandal has touched a nerve Twitter regularly blows up with Scandalrelated tweets when the show is on and the flood of cyberspace chatter has included debates about the interracial sex the politics and the clothes Ms Washingtons remark this year that she would have turned down the role had the president been black out of concern that such a character might reflect an insiders view of Mr Obama whose administration she volunteers for drew attention too  Were putting a lot of our hopes on Kerrys shoulders said Yaba Blay an assistant professor of Africana Studies at Drexel University who livetweets about the show with a group of female academics The conversations about her go beyond the role to the idea of representing us well as middleclass and upper middleclass educated women mostly because of the scarcity of such images of black women  We are the same women the media has said are not attractive are not marriageable she added If that sounds like pressure Ms Washington who comes across as thoughtful brainy and down to earth in an interview said she had never felt undue responsibility for presenting a certain brand of black womanhood In her view she said its more a matter of Hollywood executives catching up with a changing world  A Phi Beta Kappa graduate of George Washington University where she designed an interdisciplinary major that covered theater anthropology and sociology Ms Washington clearly knows the stakes I wanted Scandal to be a success because I wanted networks and studios to believe that people of color and that women can be the driving force  both separately and when you happen to have both I feel proud that we live in a world where Scandal can succeed It wasnt up to me The variable was the audience Was the audience going to be ready With Ms Washington in Scandal and a black man in the real Oval Office it seems a long time ago that Teresa Graves was the first black woman to star in a network drama She played an undercover cop in Get Christie Love on ABC in 197475 which was canceled after one season It drew attention as a barrierbreaker but never achieved high ratings Ms Graves eventually abandoned acting and died in 2002  Diahann Carroll who worked with Ms Washington in Peeples appearing briefly as Graces grandmother recalled the pains and joys of being a pathbreaker she played the title role in the 196871 comedy series Julia about a widowed nurse raising her son But she suggested that Ms Washington had no real burden to bear This is work Ms Carroll said Its not fair to ask us to do anything else  When Julia was broadcast there were far fewer black actresses she continued adding Kerry is the chance weve had to put the two things together the talent and the understanding that this is a business  At the time Julia was criticized in some quarters for lacking black cultural markers with few overt references to race Scandal has drawn similar complaints But references do exist In one scene Popes white associate is assumed to be the boss And in an exchange about their affair that exploded on the blogosphere Pope tells President Grant Im feeling a little I dont know Sally HemingsThomas Jefferson about all this Ms Washington credited Shonda Rhimes the creator of Scandal for having the vision and  thanks to her previous hits Greys Anatomy and Private Practice  the standing to break actors of color out of stereotype  For her part Ms Rhimes who is AfricanAmerican noted an evolution in popular culture Weve been trained on television to watch characters of color discuss their race incessantly she said Weve hit a moment on TV in which she doesnt have to be perfect soulful or sassy Those are the boxes that usually get checked But Warrington Hudlin the cofounder and president of the Black Filmmaker Foundation considers unrealistic the suggestion that black actors can evade the burden of representation I dont think anybody can ever escape that he said We come to cinema and TV to play out our anxieties to play out our demons When you become an actor you sign up for that youre in the debate about what it all means Thats the opportunity and the obstacle of being an artist in this racially antagonistic world Ms Washington he added represents the intersection of talent and opportunity  She does not read reviews but does go to church and declares I dont talk about my personal life in a nononsense tone Her closest friends are from her years growing up an only child in the Castle Hill and Soundview neighborhoods of the Bronx She attended the same Boys and Girls Club of America as Jennifer Lopez Ms Washington said that her father a real estate agent and her mother an educator gave her the values to stay grounded and enrolled her in all kinds of enrichment activities Acting stuck she said because it offered such variety Her parents initially tried to talk her out of acting as a career In her neighborhood We were wealthy because we had two cars and we had a dishwasher and a microwave she said When I went to Spence I was suddenly aware of a different kind of wealth Arriving at that elite predominantly white allgirls school on Manhattans Upper East Side in seventh grade Ms Washington said she developed an actors keen awareness of how choices in clothes music and even how one walks contribute to identity It really opened up my world intellectually culturally she said of Spence Her first big break came in the urban drama Save the Last Dance in 2001 There were other important movies She played the wife of Ray Charles in Ray and of Idi Amin in The Last King of Scotland and had roles in I Think I Love My Wife and Lakeview Terrace In 2009 she made her Broadway debut in David Mamets Race as part of a legal team defending a white man against charges of raping a young black woman  The role of Olivia Pope went to Ms Washington because at her audition she just felt natural and clear Ms Rhimes said Shes really smart and really playful She can get everyones energy revved up Ms Washington points with pride to her choices I see how all this is important and yet I have never shied away from taking on controversial issues or controversial roles  Django Unchained featuring a hero who kills scores of white people was certainly not a safe choice she said Neither was her Democratic National Convention speech last year which touched on a laundry list of rights among them voting abortion equal pay I have always stepped up politically she said Ms Washington is part of a smooth publicity machine for Scandal but she showed glimmers of intensity when she spoke of going deep into her roles She was devastated she said after learning that her character was involved in rigging her lovers presidential election she said I cried the whole way to work when I read that script she said  For Django she insisted on being whipped instead of using a stuntdouble If I want you to go in I have to go in she said of her approach to acting I dont like to fake my way through stuff  Playing Broomhilda and imagining a world without rights for AfricanAmericans was emotionally psychologically the hardest thing I have ever done she said tearing up and pausing to compose herself She met with a therapist twice a week to cope on sleepless nights she exchanged supportive text messages with Jamie Foxx who played Django  She needed a comedy like Peeples afterward saying she jumped at the opportunity in part because having inherited her fathers sense of humor she wanted to show off her goofy side  Ms Washington insisted laughing that she has not plotted out her career She seems happy just to be an actor fulfilling an old dream At Spence she recalled after finishing Ophelias mad scene during a student production of Hamlet catching a glimpse of her nononsense mother weeping in the audience I thought WowÂ  Ms Washington said This woman who held me in her womb for nine months  and knows exactly who I am  for a moment something about this world allowed her to suspend her disbelief and believe I was some other person in some other time I thought this is powerfulÂ 
Pushing the G.O.P. to Support Gay Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/27/us/politics/pushing-the-gop-to-support-gay-rights.html,When the Rhode Island State Senate tallied up the votes against a samesex marriage bill passed there on Wednesday something was missing Republicans  All five of the chambers Republican lawmakers had voted for the bill stunning opponents and sending the measure to the governors desk and almostcertain victory next week  The vote reflected not only the rapidly shifting tides of public opinion on samesex marriage but also the influence of a new Republican advocacy group called the American Unity Fund which spent weeks helping the states gay rights organization cultivate Republican senators Now the group is preparing a major push in Washington and in state capitals intended to reshape the Republican Party by building support for samesex marriage and bolstering its acceptance among candidates and party activists around the country  Founded and financed by some of the countrys leading Republican fundraisers and strategists the fund expects to raise up to 7 million this year officials said The funds organizers include Paul E Singer and Clifford S Asness libertarianleaning New York investors David Herro a prominent Chicago money manager and Seth Klarman a billionaire Boston philanthropist and hedge fund manager The concept of gay unions fits very well within our framework of individual liberty and our belief that strong families make for a stronger society Mr Singer said in an email The institution of marriage is in very bad shape in this country yet gay and lesbian couples want very much to be a part of it to live as committed husbands and wives with their children in traditional family units This should be what we want as conservatives for people to cherish and respect this model and to want it for themselves The fund is one of several advocacy organizations backed by wealthy Republicans and business leaders to shift their partys stance in recent months on issues like immigration and samesex marriage And the new effort traces a rift between Republican elites and grassroots voters over a handful of hotbutton social issues that one group views as handcuffing the party and the other sees as essential to its identity We were fighting for years on the life issue with the same group of people said Tony Perkins president of the Family Research Council referring to abortion rights Mr Perkins attended the Republican National Convention last year as a delegate and wrote the partys marriage plank which states that the union of one man and one woman must be upheld as the national standard Mr Perkins added They have money but theyre small in number Its still a tension between those who care about social issues and those who would rather not deal with them Those involved with the American Unity Fund said its initial efforts would be focused on more socially liberal states like Illinois and Delaware where a handful of Republican votes could enable advocates to win passage of samesex marriage legislation in the coming months The group has already set up shop in Minnesota where the Legislature may vote as early as next week on a samesex marriage bill that advocates do not yet have enough votes to pass But the group is also beginning a longterm push in more conservative states like West Virginia and Utah seeking to build conservative support for nondiscrimination laws that could help pave the way for samesex marriage in coming years A critical part of the effort fund strategists said is building lists of Republican supporters of samesex marriage around the country that could be used to pressure lawmakers in Washington and elsewhere  That could prove critical at the state level where Republicans now control majorities or supermajorities in more than half the state capitols We want to change the complexion of which people are calling their lawmakers from these legislative districts said Jeff CookMcCormac a senior adviser to the American Unity Fund Its usually gay people calling and saying We want this What we want is for legislators to hear from their straight friends and neighbors people who will say Im a Republican and I want this for my neighbors and my friendsÂ   In Rhode Island the unity fund helped Republican senators create their message in a way that would help them navigate opposition from more conservative constituents  They were a resource of experienced political professionals operating on the Republican side of the aisle said State Senator Dawson Hodgson a Republican who cosponsored the marriage bill It was important to be able to draw on some national level experience in making sure that our Republican perspective in supporting samesex marriage was at the forefront of our dialogue with constituents Mr Singer the funds founder helped bankroll the successful samesex marriage push in New York two years ago persuading Republicans in Albany that some of the partys top donors would be there to help defend them against primary challenges and attacks from samesex marriage opponents Despite such successes  including passage of measures in four states last fall either legalizing samesex marriage or overturning existing bans  same sexunions remain illegal in most of the country  As a taxexempt social welfare group the American Unity Fund is not required to disclose its donors or finances The group is affiliated with a super PAC the American Unity PAC that spent 22 million during the 2012 election defending a handful of Republican candidates deemed sympathetic to gay rights Much of the super PACs money came from firms owned by Mr Singer and Mr Klarman  Support for samesex marriage remains relatively rare among Republican elected officials despite some highprofile changes of heart Just two Republicans in the United States Senate  Rob Portman of Ohio and Mark Steven Kirk of Illinois  say they support it A November 2012 Gallup poll found that fewer than a third of selfidentified Republicans support laws that permit samesex unions And some Republican officials have faced backlash when they do support samesex marriage Three of the four Republican state senators in New York who voted for a samesex marriage bill there in 2011 did not return to Albany this year Tension over the issue broke into the open at the Republican National Committee meeting in Los Angeles this month after a task force charged with assessing the partys failures in the 2012 election recommended that officials rethink their language and approach to young voters particularly on samesex marriage  A coalition of religious and social conservatives leaders sent a letter to Reince Priebus the Republican chairman accusing the party of seeking to marginalize social conservatives who were urging conservative donors to withhold contributions Party officials ultimately passed a resolution affirming the Republican commitment to heterosexual marriage Mr Perkins was among those who called Mr Priebus during the debate What I expressed to him is that these are folks who will vote for Republicans when the Republicans express their values but if they depart from those issues they lose the support Mr Perkins said You want to see where the money will get you Look to 2012 That was the money part of the party having their candidate and access to the resources And it wasnt enough

Group Shows Covert Video of a Bronx Abortion Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/nyregion/video-scrutinizes-late-term-abortion-practices-at-bronx-clinic.html,An antiabortion group that previously released several videotapes of undercover visits to abortion clinics released another video on Sunday of a staff member at a Bronx clinic describing lateterm abortion procedures The group likened the practices to those at the clinic of Dr Kermit Gosnell the Philadelphia doctor charged with killing viable fetuses Lila Rose president of Live Action said the group would release more videos as part of its campaign against lateterm abortions Sundays video was shot at the Dr Emily Womens Health Center on Southern Boulevard in the Bronx The release comes as Gov Andrew M Cuomo a Democrat has thrown his support behind legislation that will guarantee a womans right to an abortion after 24 weeks of pregnancy if her health is in danger or if the fetus is not viable The current law permits abortion after 24 weeks only if a womans life is in danger although it is not enforced because federal court rulings have allowed less restrictive lateterm abortions The gruesome and inhuman practices exposed in Gosnells House of Horrors are business as usual for the abortion industry in America Ms Rose said in a statement calling on the New York State Health Department to investigate Dr Emily and other clinics performing lateterm abortions Both the Health Department and Dr Emily center did not respond to requests for comment Live Action based in Arlington Va has previously made covert videos at several Planned Parenthood clinics in New York and other states in an effort to cut off the organizations government financing On Sunday the group posted two versions of its latest video one condensed and one a few hours long When a pregnant woman posing as a patient asked what happens if the fetus accidentally comes out at home before the final procedure a staff member replied If it comes out it comes out Flush it The woman also asked what happens if the removed fetus is still twitching or breathing The staff member said all aborted fetuses are placed in jars of solution and sent to a laboratory for weighing if the fetus is still moving the solution will make it stop The longer video shows that the staff member has been assigned to record the womans medical history but is not an abortion counselor In the same video an abortion counselor gives the woman somewhat different explanations When the woman asks the counselor what will happen if the fetus emerges from the abortion breathing the counselor explains that it is unlikely but that the doctor will send it to a hospital or resuscitate it Once that pregnancy comes out alive he will do everything he can to save it The counselor also explains that the woman will not be dilated enough to accidentally deliver at home
Next Steps on Military Sexual Assaults,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/opinion/next-steps-on-military-sexual-assaults.html,In the last big health survey of activeduty American military personnel conducted in 2011 and released last week one in five female service members said they had been subjected to unwanted sexual contact since joining the military That shocking statistic squares with other alarming indicators of the militarys pervasive culture of sexual misconduct It also underscores the urgent need to change that culture  Despite promises of zero tolerance the Pentagon has nothing less than a sexual assault crisis on its hands The Defense Department estimated last year that as many as 19000 service members are sexually assaulted annually Only a small fraction of the incidents 3192 in 2011 are reported and a mere 10 percent of those cases proceed to trial  hardly enough to create meaningful deterrence to criminal behavior and establish accountability And sexual assaults at the three elite military academies are at record numbers according to Pentagon data Studies have shown sexual trauma to be the leading cause of posttraumatic stress disorder among servicewomen  Senator Kirsten Gillibrand Democrat of New York is offering two promising bills aimed generally at improving conditions for women in the military and reforming the way the military handles sexual assault cases The first measure introduced last week would allow women to use their own money to pay for abortions in military medical facilities Under current law military doctors may perform abortions only in cases of rape incest or when the womans life is endangered an appalling restriction on a womans right to make her own childbearing decisions The rule also has the effect of denying abortion care to military rape victims who are unwilling to risk their careers and privacy by coming forward  The second bill to be introduced next month seeks to give women confidence that they can eventually receive justice by repairing a key structural flaw in the militarys handling of assault cases As things stand senior officers with no legal training but ample conflicts of interest can decide whether courtmartial charges can be brought against subordinates and whether to throw out a verdict once it is rendered In one recent case Lt Gen Craig Franklin an Air Force commander dismissed without explanation the aggravated sexual assault conviction of an Air Force fighter pilot Lt Col James Wilkerson permitting Colonel Wilkersons reinstatement  Ms Gillibrand would leave decisions in serious military cases including sexual assaults to an independent prosecutor and end the power of senior commanders to quash a verdict A similar measure that would create a system for handling sexual trauma cases outside the chain of command has been introduced in the House by Jackie Speier a California Democrat To his credit Defense Secretary Chuck Hagel supports eliminating the discretion of senior officers to overturn jury findings in serious cases still leaving defendants robust rights of appeal But he has stopped short of endorsing the changes necessary to give impartial military prosecutors the power to investigate and prosecute offenses  Opponents of reform seem in denial about the severity of the problem while raising overblown fears that handling felonylevel cases outside the chain of command would ruin military discipline What that argument misses is that military discipline is already badly broken when the many victims of sexual assaults have almost zero faith that justice will be served and their careers protected if they report them 
Massachusetts Voters Reminded Senate Primaries Are at Hand,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/29/us/politics/massachusetts-senate-candidates-call-attention-to-primaries.html,BOSTON  Getting voters attention for a special election at an unexpected time of year is hard enough It is even harder when the airwaves have been taken over by walltowall coverage of a major disaster of the sort that struck the Boston Marathon two weeks ago The campaigns for the Senate seat vacated this year by John Kerry who is now secretary of state screeched to a halt after the marathon bombings on April 15 They have sprung to life in recent days in a scramble to make up for lost time before voters go to the polls on Tuesday for the party primaries but state officials still expect a turnout of just 15 percent of the electorate On the Democratic side Representative Edward J Markey who was first elected to the House in 1976 is leading in the polls against Representative Stephen F Lynch a former ironworker who has promoted his workingclass roots Mr Markey was endorsed early by the Democratic establishment he has raised far more money than any candidate on either side and his liberal philosophy hews closely to that of the partys advocates who are likely to turn out Tuesday In deepblue Massachusetts he is also perceived as the most likely winner of the general election in June  But Mr Lynch said his internal polling showed that he was closing the gap He will do better he said if he can turn out independent voters who tend to forgo primaries but can take part in either one The Republican primary is a threeway competition with relatively littleknown candidates in a race that analysts said was difficult to poll because so few Republicans were likely to vote The Republicans are Gabriel Gomez a private equity investor and former member of the Navy SEALs who had never run for office before although he did unsuccessfully ask Gov Deval Patrick a Democrat to appoint him to Mr Kerrys Senate seat until voters chose a replacement State Representative Daniel B Winslow who is known for gestures that are intended to attract attention but that have not brought him much in this campaign and Michael J Sullivan a former United States attorney and onetime acting director of the federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco Firearms and Explosives who has done little in this race to turn any expertise in fighting terrorism to his advantage In the shadow of the bombings the campaigns have focused in the last week on matters of national security Mr Lynch has been airing a television commercial in which he does not mention his candidacy but speaks directly to the camera saying My heart goes out to the victims of this unthinkable terrorist attack At a Democratic debate last week Mr Lynch sought to cast Mr Markey as soft on terrorism He came down hard on Mr Markey for what he said was a vote against forming the joint terrorism task force that helped track down the bombing suspects But it turned out that the task force that pursued the marathon bombers had been created by the FBI not by a vote in Congress In another debate last week Mr Lynch called Mr Markey a liar Jeffrey Berry a political scientist at Tufts University said Its been difficult for Lynch to attract attention which explains his aggressiveness in the debates He added But Lynchs problem is that his political profile doesnt fit that of the Massachusetts Democratic primary electorate The small number of people who will vote will be upperincome highereducated suburban liberals who are much more comfortable with Markey Nonetheless Mr Markeys campaign which had been running television commercials aimed at women and highlighting his support for abortion rights and equal pay for equal work also began focusing more on security  It is airing a spot that features a flight attendant lauding Mr Markey for forcing the airlines to screen cargo And at a getoutthevote rally Saturday in Somerville speakers including Sheriff Peter J Koutoujian of Middlesex County where one of the bombing suspects was killed and the other was captured praised Mr Markey for steps that he had taken to bolster law enforcement In his own remarks Mr Markey generally stuck to his political stances stating for example that his vote for President Obamas health care plan was the proudest of his career  and noting that Mr Lynch had voted against it Mr Lynch who campaigned Saturday in East Boston at the finale of an annual motorcycle ride for wounded veterans said it was hard to assess the effect of the bombings on the primary We had momentum going forward and when this happened it certainly interrupted that he said Im not sure whether weve regained that or whether we can but we certainly feel the election is much closer than it started out and weve got a chance to win Mr Markey raised 48 million in the first three months of the year compared with Mr Lynchs 23 million which included a transfer of 744000 from his House political account Mr Markey had spent 14 million on television ads through Saturday leaving him a substantial sum for the general election while Mr Lynch had spent 11 million on television according to Kantar MediaCMAG which tracks spending on political ads Among the Republicans Mr Gomez had raised 12 million Mr Winslow 395000 and Mr Sullivan 174000 Mr Gomez who ran the Boston Marathon this year is the only Republican who has advertised on television As he worked his way through motorcyclists at the start of the ride for veterans in Everett he said his campaign was now in full gear  Weve been respectful and slow getting back in but you cant let the terrorists win he said noting that he was making 58 stops in 29 towns in the four days before Tuesday He said his message of being an outsider  one with military experience who understood the dangers facing the country  resonated after the bombings But there are few predictions of who might win the Republican primary  We dont know whats going on on the Republican side because there are too few Republicans in the samples said Mr Berry the political scientist But he said that Mr Winslow appeared to be struggling and that Mr Sullivan had been hurt by his lack of money Still Mr Berry said Sullivan is the true conservative and if conservatives turn out he stands a chance of winning because Winslow and Gomez would split the moderate vote The general election is set for June 25 By that time the bombings may no longer dominate the headlines But the criminal trial of James Whitey Bulger the mobster whose exploits have obsessed Bostonians for decades is expected to be under way by then and could prove a distraction from the general election
Both Sides Rest in Trial of a Philadelphia Abortion Doctor Charged With Murder,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/us/trial-abortion-doctor-kermit-gosnell.html,PHILADELPHIA  They are known as Baby Boy A Baby C Baby D and Baby E all of whom prosecutors call murdered children and the defense calls aborted fetuses  the very difference in language encapsulating why antiabortion advocates are so passionate about drawing attention to the trial of Dr Kermit Gosnell which wrapped up here on Monday with summations by both sides  In five weeks of testimony jurors were told that Dr Gosnell 72 had performed lateterm abortions by injecting a drug to stop the heart of the fetus but that when one jerked an arm cried or drew breath outside the womb its spinal cord was cut with surgical scissors To antiabortion leaders the accounts have the power to break through decades of hardened positions in the abortion wars not just because of the graphic details but because they raise the philosophical issue of why an abortion procedure performed in utero is legal but a similar act a few minutes later outside the womb is considered homicide The distinction is maybe a 15minute or halfhour time frame and 10 inches of physical space said Michael Geer the president of the Pennsylvania Family Institute an antiabortion group I think its going to resurrect a debate about the humanity of the unborn child Abortion rights groups have a very different view They say that Dr Gosnell was a rogue practitioner and that if abortion is further restricted more women will be driven to clinics like his which prosecutors called a house of horrors  Jay Sekulow the chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice a conservative legal organization in Washington said This case in the end is going to be viewed as monumental no matter what the verdict is Last week Judge Jeffrey P Minehart of the Court of Common Pleas threw out three of seven firstdegree murder charges against Dr Gosnell The doctors defense lawyer Jack J McMahon argued Monday that none of the remaining four cases had resulted in live births  Because the women were given injections of the drug digoxin which causes fetal demise Mr McMahon argued any postdelivery movements were involuntary spasms Every single piece of scientific evidence in this case has shown stillbirth he said But Edward Cameron an assistant district attorney countered that testimony showed Dr Gosnell did not always use digoxin and that it did not always work as intended He quoted a former clinic worker with medical school training but no doctors license who testified that the drug wasnt giving the desired effect the heart was always beating The prosecutor cited Pennsylvania law stating that if a baby delivered during an abortion shows any sign of life its considered alive  a heartbeat breathing a cry movement The jury will now make that determination in the cases including that of Baby Boy A whom clinic workers testified Dr Gosnell joked was big enough to walk me home  Baby D a clinic worker testified was delivered into a toilet by a woman waiting for Dr Gosnell and it appeared to make swimming motions before one of the doctors assistants pulled it out and cut its neck  Two workers said they heard Baby E crying before Dr Gosnell cut its spine with scissors The prosecutor quoted a worker It made noises a whine like my baby Mr McMahon also cited the trial testimony in which the clinic worker acknowledged she did not know for sure if Baby E was born alive Eight workers from the clinic the Womens Medical Society in West Philadelphia have pleaded guilty to lesser charges in the case including Dr Gosnells wife Pearl a cosmetologist who helped perform abortions If convicted Dr Gosnell could face the death penalty The case became a cause clbre when antiabortion activists complained that the mainstream news media were ignoring it for ideological reasons It has since been widely covered and every seat in the courtroom was taken on Monday Antiabortion campaigners have seized on the trial because it highlights lateterm abortions performed after fetal viability The same public opinion polls that for decades have shown that a majority of Americans support abortion also show that most of them want it banned in certain cases Abortion opponents have leveraged these mixed feelings in recent years to lobby at the state level to restrict the procedure Nine states have banned most abortions beyond 20 weeks of pregnancy Last month two states went further Arkansas banned abortion after 12 weeks and North Dakota beyond about 6 weeks when a fetal heartbeat is detectable Abortion rights groups said both limits would be found unconstitutional in federal court Though lateterm abortions are central to the Gosnell case they are extremely rare According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention 92 percent of abortions are performed before 14 weeks with 13 percent beyond 20 weeks No woman carries their child to six seven eight months and then one day decides they dont want to become a parent said Ilyse Hogue the president of Naral ProChoice America These are terrible tragic situations where families have to make difficult choices with their doctors I think most Americans believe thats where they belong To abortion rights groups if abortion is further restricted desperate women will be forced to seek providers like Dr Gosnell who is also accused of performing 24 abortions beyond 24 weeks of pregnancy the limit in Pennsylvania Restrictions really work to hinder access to safe abortion said Dayle Steinberg the president of Planned Parenthood Southeastern Pennsylvania It only increases the number of economically disadvantaged women who find themselves in extreme circumstances and they turn to unsafe options for care Dr Gosnell is also accused of thirddegree murder in the death of a 41yearold patient from Virginia who visited his clinic after being turned away by three clinics closer to her home according to testimony by a daughter of the woman Mr McMahon said Dr Gosnells staff members who pleaded guilty did so out of fear of the district attorneys office which he accused of creating a tsunami of hype in a grand jury report and in the news media about Dr Gosnells practices To counter that he showed slides of a waiting room hallway and procedure rooms at the defunct clinic that looked scrubbed and clean  The prosecution for its turn rolled in a filthy procedure table and broken equipment removed from the clinic Mr Cameron the assistant district attorney brandished a stained ultrasound probe with unconcealed disgust  The jury was expected to begin deliberations on Tuesday
Wealth Inequality and Political Inequality,https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/04/30/wealth-inequality-and-political-inequality/,"Bruce Bartlett held senior policy roles in the Reagan and George HW Bush administrations and served on the staffs of Representatives Jack Kemp and Ron Paul He is the author of The Benefit and the Burden Tax Reform  Why We Need It and What It Will Take A crucial question in the debate over income and wealth inequality is whether its growth necessarily leads to a growth in the inequality of political power If it does then this is a powerful reason for the federal
                                        government to take active measures to reduce income and wealth inequality  even if it comes at an economic cost to the nation  That is income and wealth would have to be redistributed  taken via taxation from the wealthy and given to the poor The higher taxes will reduce the incentive to work save and invest among the wealthy conservatives
                                        and libertarians believe which will reduce economic growth and lead to the expatriation of the wealthy from the United States while fostering a culture of dependency among the poor that will reduce their incentive
                                        to better themselves and escape poverty  Insofar as the political dynamics are concerned conservatives and libertarians are generally fearful of democracy That is because in principle there is essentially no constraint on the ability of the majority to
                                        take from the minority and reward themselves in a pure democracy The founding fathers very much shared this concern and intentionally enacted numerous restraints on the majority to protect the rights of the minority
                                        to their wealth Among these are the federal system with relatively strong states and a weak national legislature as compared to parliamentary systems and a Senate where small sparsely populated states per
                                        capita have more influence than large populous states a written constitution with strong protection for property rights and an Electoral College instead of election of the president by pure popular vote One reason that conservatives and libertarians obsess over the large percentage of the population that pays no federal income taxes often put at 47 percent
                                        is the political concern that the nation is very close to a tipping point where the havenots can take from the haves almost at will The simple solution to this problem to the extent there is one would be to extend the tax net to some of those now living free of federal income taxation But this is practically impossible because Republicans who
                                        mainly complain about the large numbers of nontaxpayers enacted most of the tax policies that removed them from the tax rolls These include the earned income tax credit and the refundable child credit Secondly almost all Republican legislators have signed a tax pledge promising never to raise taxes for any reason Most Republicans are also ideologically opposed to a valueadded tax which would be the simplest way
                                        of getting everyone to pay some federal taxes to cover the governments general operations The payroll tax which is more broadly based than the income tax is earmarked to pay Social Security and Medicare
                                        benefits only Because the simple and obvious solution to their problem is off the table conservatives and libertarians have concentrated on cutting benefits for the poor They believe that programs such as unemployment compensation
                                        and food stamps subsidize laziness and undermine the work ethic If such programs were cut then those now benefiting would be forced into the labor force where they would become taxpayers and cease being tempted
                                        by politicians promising them something for nothing The liberal view by contrast is that the poor are relatively powerless They vote in lower percentages than the welltodo and
                                        often suffer from policies to reduce their political influence such as onerous voter registration requirements demands for government identification at the polls and long waiting times                                        to vote on Election Day There is also evidence of growing pressure by employers to force their
                                        employees to vote against their own interest and for the employers Liberals believe our political system is generally more responsive to the interests of the wealthy The poor after all are not major sources of campaign contributions  But that is only part of the story The welltodo are far more likely to be engaged in the political process and to bring their concerns to bear on their elected representatives through direct contact Thus we have seen that while the recent budget sequestration has brought hardship to both the poor and the wealthy Congress has taken no action to relieve the burden on the poor but acted with amazing speed to relieve
                                        a key concern of the wealthy  furloughs for Federal Aviation Administration personnel that created airline delays A new study by the political scientists Benjamin I Page Larry M Bartels and Jason Seawright presents strong evidence that the wealthy
                                        are more aggressive and more successful than the poor at influencing the political system in their favor This study is based on interviews with 83 wealthy people in Chicago The authors contrast the views of those in their survey with those of the general public based on national public opinion polls They find that the wealthy are much more concerned than the general public about budget
                                        deficits much more in favor of cutting social welfare programs much less in favor of government jobs programs and much more opposed to government regulation among other things Professors Page Bartels and Seawright were unwilling to draw firm conclusions about whether the wealthy have disproportionate influence in American politics owing to the small size of their survey sample But it is
                                        at least obvious that the economic policy preferences of the wealthy strongly overlap with those of the Republican Party On the other hand research by the political scientist Martin Gilens in his book Affluence and Influence Economic Inequality and Political Power in America
                                        shows that the wealthy tend to be more liberal than the Republican Party on social issues By and large the wealthy are not religious favor abortion rights and support gay rights The best hope for liberals in the future may be to emphasize social issues which split the Republican Party between the interests of the wealthy and those of religious and social conservatives who dominate primary

Senior Congressman and Newcomer Win Senate Nods in Massachusetts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/us/massachusetts-kerry-senate-replacement.html,BOSTON  Representative Edward J Markey who has spent almost four decades in the House has cleared the first hurdle in his drive to become a United States senator easily defeating a fellow congressman Stephen F Lynch in Massachusettss Democratic primary on Tuesday On the Republican side Gabriel E Gomez a former member of the Navy SEALs and a newcomer to politics won a threeway primary He and Mr Markey will face off in a special general election on June 25 to fill the Senate seat left vacant by John Kerry a Democrat who resigned this year to become President Obamas secretary of state Given the Democrats strength in Massachusetts Mr Markey would have to be considered the early favorite The Senate race offers voters a choice between Mr Markeys decades of experience in Washington  he was first elected to Congress in 1976  and Mr Gomezs compelling life story The son of Colombian immigrants he became a Navy pilot and a member of the SEALs attended Harvard Business School and is now a private equity investor Mr Markey 66 who has one of the most liberal voting records in Congress has promised to continue his fight for gun control a clean environment abortion rights and Mr Obamas health care law Mr Gomez 47 ran more on an outsider platform of institutional reform He promised he would reboot Congress by imposing a pay freeze term limits and a lifetime ban on lobbying Democrats wasted no time in revealing how they would go after Mr Gomez saying they would cast him as an extremist whose views are antithetical to Massachusetts Republicans were looking for the second coming of Scott Brown the Markey campaign said in a statement referring to the moderate Republican who won the last special Senate election in Massachusetts in 2010 Instead they got Gabriel Gomez a prolife Republican who was the spokesman for a super PAC that attacked President Obama over the killing of Osama bin Laden Democrats also noted that Mr Gomez opposes a ban on assault weapons even after the massacre of children in Newtown Conn and supports cutting Social Security But Mr Gomez was equally swift in signaling how he intended to beat Mr Markey by portraying him as a career politician who is part of the old order In his victory speech Mr Gomez noting the year Mr Markey was first elected to the House ran through a litany of hallmarks from 1976 including the Gerald Ford presidency and eighttrack tapes It was a lifetime ago he said Einstein famously said that the definition of insanity is doing the same thing over and over and expecting a different result Congress has enough politicians If we keep sending politicians to Washington we will keep getting the same results Mr Gomez opened and closed his speech delivered at an inn in Cohasset his elegant hometown on the South Shore with phrases in Spanish In between he reminded his supporters This election is about the future and not about the past Mr Markey warned in his victory speech that Republican money would be soon be flooding the state Karl Rove the Koch brothers and the Republicans see this election as their first shot at stopping President Obamas agenda and regaining control of the Senate Mr Markey told hundreds of supporters at a Boston hotel Mark my words These outside special interests are going to march right into Massachusetts beginning tomorrow morning He called on Mr Gomez to sign the peoples pledge that Senate candidates signed last year to keep special interests from funneling unlimited undisclosed money into the state but Mr Gomez has already said he believes such money should be allowed as a demonstration of free speech Both Mr Markey and Mr Gomez dispatched their opponents with relative ease Mr Markey beat Mr Lynch who was first elected to the House in 2000 and is the most conservative member of the states Congressional delegation 58 percent to 42 percent Democratic primary voters in Massachusetts tend to be liberal and Mr Markey more clearly represented their views Stephen Lynch is too conservative for me on womens issues said Alexis Veith 31 a stayathome mother in Quincy as she voted for Mr Markey She added of Mr Lynch He seems more like a prounion Republican than a true Democrat Jim Johnson 65 an author said he supported Mr Markey because he liked his stands on gun control and abortion This is Lynchs district he noted outside his polling place in downtown Boston but hes on the wrong side of the issues Mr Gomez won 51 percent of the vote in his primary race against Michael J Sullivan a former United States attorney who won 36 percent and State Representative Daniel B Winsow who trailed with 13 percent Voters who supported Mr Gomez said they liked his service to the country and his fresh approach Bill and Martha Roach both 48 and chemists in Quincy were among them Former Navy SEAL sounded good to me Mr Roach said His wife added Hes actually done something for our country Even before the outcome was clear the state Democratic Party planned a unity breakfast for Wednesday to bring the Markey and Lynch camps together  John Walsh chairman of the state party said it was important to come together immediately to coordinate for the general election and avoid a repeat of 2010 when Democrats were caught sleeping at the wheel 
Drug Agency Lowers Age for Next-Day Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/health/fda-lowers-age-for-morning-after-pill.html,The Food and Drug Administration said Tuesday that it would make the most widely known morningafter pill available without a prescription to girls and women ages 15 and older and also make the pill available on drugstore shelves instead of keeping it locked up behind pharmacy counters Until this decision the pill Plan B OneStep which is used after sexual intercourse to help prevent pregnancy was available without a prescription only for ages 17 and older The decision did not address a federal judges ruling in early April that gave the drug agency 30 days to make the pill available for all ages without a prescription In a scathing opinion handed down three weeks ago Judge Edward R Korman in the Eastern District of New York said the Obama administration had put politics before science in restricting access to the drug  The FDA and the White House said Tuesday that the Department of Justice was still deciding whether to appeal the ruling something it can do independently of the drug agencys decision on Tuesday That decision which takes effect immediately represents a compromise on the politically charged issue of access to emergency contraception which has pitted conservative and antiabortion groups against advocates for womens health and reproductive rights  The Justice Department is most likely weighing not only the substance of the judges ruling but also the precedent the ruling would set in countermanding an order by a White House cabinet member Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services In 2011 she decided the pill would be available without prescription only to those 17 and older despite the FDAs finding that it was safe and effective and should be available without any age restrictions She said the pill had not been studied for safety in girls as young as 11 It was the first time the FDA had been publicly overruled by a cabinet secretary After her order the pills manufacturer submitted an amended application seeking access for 15yearolds On Tuesday a Health and Human Services Department official said that Ms Sebelius was comfortable with the FDAs decision to approve that application Besides lowering the age restriction the new rule addresses concerns of women who were unable to get the pill if their drugstores pharmacy counter happened to be closed Now Plan B OneStep will be available in drugstore aisles where family planning or womens health products are displayed  The packaging will include a product code that when scanned by a cashier will indicate that the customers proof of age is required To try to prevent theft the manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals has arranged for each box to have a security tag the drug agency said  Margaret A Hamburg the FDA commissioner said in a statement that data proved that 15yearolds were able to understand how Plan B OneStep works how to use it properly and that it does not prevent the transmission of a sexually transmitted disease  The agencys decision applies only to Plan B OneStep which is a onepill dose not to the twopill generic versions because there is not enough data to show the twodose versions can be used responsibly by younger teenagers without the intervention of a health provider said an FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson  Marty Berndt a vice president and general manager for Teva called the agencys decision a significant milestone for women But it did not completely satisfy either side of the emergency contraception debate Anna Higgins the director of the Center for Human Dignity at the Family Research Council accused the administration of trying to placate both sides adding that allowing this to young teens will be something that we will remain very concerned about Cecile Richards president of Planned Parenthood called the decision an important step forward because it will eliminate some of the biggest barriers and hurdles that women face in getting emergency contraception  But Nancy Northup president of the Center for Reproductive Rights which filed the lawsuit that Judge Korman ruled on said the decision on Tuesday was unsatisfactory  We will continue our battle in court to remove these arbitrary restrictions on emergency contraception for all women she said

"No Vote Needed on Abortion Bill, G.O.P. Leader Says",https://cityroom.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/no-vote-needed-on-abortion-bill-g-o-p-leader-says/,"ALBANY  Gov Andrew M Cuomo is still hoping to pass the whole of his 10point Womens Equality Act during the closing weeks of the 2013 legislative session which ends in late June But on Wednesday
                                        the State Senate Republican leader suggested that his conference would not support any effort to bring a key part of the act  a state safeguard of federally recognized abortion rights  to a vote
                                     Senator Dean G Skelos the Long Island Republican who shares leadership of the Senate in a coalition with Senator Jeffrey D Klein a Bronx Democrat who leads the Independent Democratic Conference told reporters that
                                        his members would not consider any abortionrelated bill  Unnecessary Mr Skelos said in a singleword description of his opinion of the governors proposal And you know what What people are talking about are jobs taxes spending Thats
                                        what they are concerned about And very few people at all ever believe that  whether youre prolife or prochoice  the abortion laws in New York would ever be changed  But Mr Cuomo has made it clear that he is concerned about abortion rights and restated on Wednesday that he wanted to codify such rights guaranteed by the 1973 Supreme Court decision Roe v Wade in state law  I believe it should come up for a vote Mr Cuomo said adding that he knew all too well of Mr Skeloss opposition to the bill Hes been opposed to the choice vote for many many
                                        many years Mr Skeloss comments seem to dim the chances for the abortion plank in Mr Cuomos womens agenda which also includes less controversial elements like strengthening humantrafficking laws and
                                        support for victims of domestic violence issues on which the governor and Mr Skelos agree  Under the coalitions arrangement it appears that the firm opposition of either Mr Skelos or Mr Klein can effectively prevent a bill coming to the floor though the full nature of their powersharing agreement
                                        is not entirely clear Eric Soufer a spokesman for Mr Klein said that the Independent Democratic Conference wholeheartedly supports a womans right to choose but that there arent

Irish Proposal Would Allow Abortions in Emergencies,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/world/europe/irish-government-proposes-allowing-abortion-in-certain-cases.html,DUBLIN  The Irish government proposed legislation late Tuesday night that if approved as expected would allow abortions in cases where a threat existed to a womans life including from suicide Although the proposal has set off a heated debate the prime minister Enda Kenny has argued that it would not alter Irelands restrictive abortion laws This bill restates the general prohibition on abortion in Ireland Mr Kenny said at a news conference on Wednesday before the Protection of Life During Pregnancy bill was introduced The law on abortion in Ireland is not being changed His assurances did little to persuade the countrys powerful antiabortion movement The conservative Youth Defense group branded Mr Kenny The Abortion Taoiseach  the Irish word for prime minister or leader  and vowed to step up its campaign to pressure members of his centerright Fine Gael party to oppose the bill Enda Kennys claim that this legislation is restrictive is seriously undermined by the experience of other countries such as Britain where mental health clauses were roundly abused said a spokeswoman for Youth Defense Claire Molloy While a substantial number of Fine Gael members have misgivings about the suicide clause Mr Kenny has ruled out a free vote on the bill which Parliament is expected to enact before the summer recess The proposed legislation would allow for the termination of a pregnancy in cases where there is a real and substantive threat to the life of the woman including from suicide The government says the bill gives legal effect to rights that already exist as a result of a landmark Supreme Court judgment in 1992 known as the X Case Under the new proposals a single doctor would be able to approve an abortion in an emergency situation When a pregnant womans life is at risk but the threat is not imminent two medical practitioners  including one obstetrician or gynecologist  would have to sign off before the procedure could take place A woman citing the possibility of suicide as a reason for seeking an abortion would have to obtain approval from two psychiatrists and an obstetrician The government was prodded to action by the Council of Europe which has pressured a succession of Irish governments to enact legislation to ensure that womens limited rights to abortion were actually carried out in practice Equally important the uproar following the death of an Indianborn woman Savita Halappanavar in a Galway hospital in October reignited the entire abortion debate Dr Halappanavar 31 a dentist who lived near Galway was informed by her doctors that they were legally constrained from carrying out her repeated requests for a lifesaving termination of her nonviable fetus because the heart was still beating Irish commentators point out that the government may also have been emboldened by the waning influence of the Roman Catholic Church which has been battered by a succession of sexual abuse cases against members of the clergy In a parliamentary debate after the release of the draft legislation Clare Daly a Socialist said that the bill did not go far enough and that it would ensure that Irish women  4500 a year by most estimates  would continue to travel every year to Britain for abortions Other commentators expressed disappointment that the proposals did not extend an automatic right to abortion under other categories like rape or when a fetus has no chance of survival At present women who know their child will not survive outside the womb are forced to carry it to full term However Mr Kenny said any such proposals would be beyond the scope of the X Case and would require a referendum to change the Constitution
U.S. to Defend Age Limits on Morning-After Pill Sales,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/02/health/us-will-appeal-order-on-morning-after-pill.html,The Obama administration moved Wednesday to keep girls under 15 from having overthecounter access to morningafter pills as the Justice Department filed a notice to appeal a judges order that would make the drug available without a prescription for girls and women of all ages The appeal reaffirms an electionyear decision by Mr Obamas administration to block the drugs maker from selling it without a prescription or consideration of age and puts the White House back into the politically charged issue of access to emergency contraception The Justice Departments decision to appeal is in line with the views of dozens of conservative antiabortion groups who do not want contraceptives made available to young girls But the decision was criticized by advocates for womens reproductive health and abortion rights who cite years of scientific research saying the drug is safe and effective for all ages  Age barriers to emergency contraception are not supported by science and they should be eliminated Cecile Richards the president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America said in a statement on Wednesday In December 2011 the secretary of health and human services Kathleen Sebelius blocked the sale of the drug to young girls without a prescription saying there was not enough data to prove it would be safe In doing so Ms Sebelius took the unprecedented step of overruling the Food and Drug Administration which had moved based on scientific research to lift all age restrictions Last month Judge Edward R Korman of United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York criticized that decision as overtly political and ordered the administration to make the contraceptive widely available The Justice Departments appeal will not say at what age girls should have access to overthecounter morningafter pill Instead it will contend that Judge Korman did not have the authority to order the FDA to take a specific action and should have sent the issue back to the agency for further action And it will say the judge did not have the right to extend his order to versions of the pill not included in the lawsuit The decision to appeal is striking in part because before Ms Sebelius overruled it in 2011 the FDA  the Justice Departments client in this case  had moved to do exactly what Judge Korman ordered last month We arent focused in this appeal on the merits of the secretarys decision said a Justice Department official who spoke on condition of anonymity What were focused on is that the remedies that the judge ordered were beyond his authority  For Mr Obamas administration the decision to appeal the judges ruling provides an opportunity to reaffirm a moderate position in the broader abortion debate that had drawn praise from conservative groups that are normally highly critical of the president The appeal also reinforces Ms Sebeliuss original 2011 decision which proved to be very good politics for Mr Obama at the time Facing a difficult reelection battle the Democratic president enthusiastically supported Ms Sebelius saying that as a father of two young daughters he thought it was the right call to have made And I think most parents would probably feel the same way he added Wednesdays announcement came a day after the FDA said one wellknown morningafter pill Plan B OneStep would be made available without a prescription for girls as young as 15  instead of only to girls ages 17 and over as has been the case That decision also will make the drugs more accessible by putting them on the shelves with other overthecounter medications The Justice Departments action will not affect that FDA decision Instead the department is seeking to overturn a much broader order by the judge that removed restrictions for all ages and for generic versions of the pill not just Plan B OneStep The order issued on April 5 by Judge Korman gave the FDA 30 days to comply  On Wednesday the Justice Department also asked Judge Korman to stay his order pending the results of the appeal In his ruling Judge Korman said the Obama administration had put politics before science in restricting access to the drug At the time Ms Sebelius said the pill had not been studied for safety in girls as young as 11 But advocates on both sides of the highly divisive issue of emergency contraception interpreted her decision in a political context particularly since it fell during a presidential campaign cycle  In 2011 a decision to allow distribution of emergency contraceptives to very young girls might have sparked a firestorm of criticism from antiabortion groups And it might have made it more difficult for the president politically when it came to other battles over contraception including an effort to require some religious institutions to provide contraception free of charge By appealing the judges ruling Mr Obamas Justice Department is essentially renewing the objections that Ms Sebelius  backed by the president  had more than a year ago In recent weeks conservative groups had urged the Justice Department to appeal the judges ruling so that the contraception would not be available to very young girls On Wednesday a Justice Department official said the appeal would concentrate on the two areas where the department believes the judge overstepped his legal authority The official also said the White House had not been involved in the decision of whether to appeal Judge Kormans ruling  This is a decision that the Justice Department is making in representing our client FDA the official said This is not a political decision Its not had White House intervention or involvement This in our judgment is the right legal step to take in this case Officials at the White House declined to comment on Wednesday referring all calls to the Justice Department A spokesman for Ms Sebelius also referred questions to Justice saying it was an ongoing legal matter The Justice Department official said the lawsuit before Judge Korman referred only to Plan B the earliest morningafter pill which is a twopill dose of a drug called levonorgestrel There are also two generic versions of Plan B And there is a newer singlepill version called Plan B OneStep which is the product that the FDA this week made available over the counter to girls as young as 15 While scientists say the one and twopill versions are essentially identical the Justice Department official said its appeal was not just a semantic matter It is a deeply held belief on the part of FDA when two different drugs are at issue that FDA has to keep those two different drugs separate the official said
Whoâ€™s Sorry Now,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/01/whos-sorry-now/,"Back when Sandra Day OConnor was still on the Supreme Court busy saving affirmative action and the right to abortion
                                        liberals who wanted a reason to forgive her vote in Bush v Gore often asked me  begged me  to assure them that Justice OConnor
                                        was sorry No shes not I would reply anticipating the heartbroken expressions my words always evoked It seemed to me that this was a woman who looked forward not back and who never wasted energy on regret So now it turns out that the retired justice just past her 83rd birthday does have second thoughts about Bush v Gore and more to the point is willing to express them She told the editorial board of The Chicago
                                        Tribune last week that she thinks the court made a mistake by intervening in the disputed Florida election in the first place Maybe the court should have said Were not going to take it
                                        goodbye  she said as quoted by The Tribune While Floridas election officials
                                        had kind of messed it up she said probably the Supreme Court added to the problem at the end of the day Its so unusual for a Supreme Court justice to express afterthefact doubts  let alone Sandra Day OConnor let alone one of the highestprofile decisions of recent years  that its
                                        worth thinking about what she said and putting her words in context People who obviously know Sandra OConnor better than I do say that her comments reflect a view she came to some time ago This
                                        is more of a piece than not was the reaction of Joan Biskupic whose insightful book Sandra Day OConnor How the First Woman on the Supreme Court Became Its Most Influential Justice
                                        appeared shortly after the justices retirement in 2005 Justice OConnor has long been subtly distancing herself from Bush v Gore her biographer told me adding She plainly
                                        does not want Bush v Gore to define her legacy Certainly its her legacy that Justice OConnor cares about and that she sees imperiled by a Supreme Court that the Bush administration pushed rightward by naming Samuel A Alito Jr to succeed her Justice
                                        Alito has given Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr the reliable fifth vote that Justice OConnor would have withheld on some of the Roberts courts most notable early rulings When she observed in 2009
                                        that she felt a little bit disappointed to see some of her rulings being dismantled
                                        she declined to be more specific There were not in fact very many actual dismantlings by that point but the writing on the wall was plain to see To offer the most obvious example the court now stands on the
                                        brink of overruling Justice OConnors majority opinion in the 2003 Michigan affirmative action case with the majoritys explicit expectation that raceconscious admission policies in highereducation
                                        admissions would out of necessity endure as law and policy for another 25 years Her comments last week on Bush v Gore stopped short of actually repudiating the vote she cast once the court had agreed to hear the case She seemed most sorry that she had to choose sides at all In that respect
                                        she was not Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who three years after his retirement flatly disavowed his decisive vote in Bowers v Hardwick the 1986 decision
                                        that dismissed as at best facetious a claim to constitutional protection for gay sex between consenting adults Justice Powell who during his struggle with that case had told a startled and closeted
                                        law clerk that I dont believe I have ever met a homosexual told an audience of New York University law students in 1990 that he had concluded that the dissent had the better of the
                                        arguments in the 5to4 decision  a decision that endured for 17 years until the court overruled it in Lawrence v Texas Supreme Court justices hate to contradict themselves Of the five who voted to overturn Bowers v Hardwick four had not been on the court in 1986 and the fifth Justice John Paul Stevens was a dissenter in Bowers
                                        Justice OConnor by contrast had voted with the Bowers majority She joined the judgment in Lawrence that the Texas sodomy law was unconstitutional but declined to join Justice Anthony M Kennedys
                                        broad dueprocess ruling or to agree that Bowers should be overruled She offered instead a narrower and strained rationale for striking down the Texas law based on the Equal Protection Clause unlike the Georgia
                                        law at issue in Bowers which made sodomy a crime for everyone the Texas law made sodomy a crime only for people of the same sex The law thus had the effect of branding one class of persons as criminal
                                        solely based on the states moral disapproval of that class Justice OConnor explained in her separate opinion I dont mean to be unfair to Justice OConnor It mattered that she provided a sixth vote to overturn the Texas statute in Lawrence and her regrets about Bush v Gore however nuanced matter too Its
                                        possible to see her as a kind of Everywoman whose fitful ideological journey during more than three decades in the national spotlight mirrors the countrys journey during that period as well  at
                                        least the journey of those oncecomfortably centrist Republicans who have watched with dismay as their party abandoned them Justice David H Souter was another one or those personally sheltered from having to
                                        give much thought to sexual identity or crisis pregnancy or race but who after grappling with those issues have found themselves arriving at unexpected destinations  Justice OConnor once actually did declare that she had voted the wrong way The case was Republican Party of Minnesota v White a 2002 decision granting
                                        to candidates in judicial elections a First Amendment right to take positions on questions of public policy Many state codes of judicial ethics barred such behavior under what were known as announce
                                        clauses Justice OConnor provided a fifth vote to strike down Minnesotas announce clause Shortly after her retirement she said she had been wrong                                        and that the decision had contributed to the politicization of judicial elections  Similarly Justice John Paul Stevens has expressed regret since his retirement about his vote with the majority in a 5to4 reapportionment decision
                                        in 1989 That case Karcher v Daggett interpreted the oneperson onevote rule as requiring districts to be drawn with precise numerical equality
                                        a requirement Justice Stevens now regards as having opened the door to political mischief in redistricting In both the judicial speech case and the redistricting case the justices based their second thoughts on their perception of adverse developments that the decisions had enabled Those are the kind of second thoughts
                                        that many people hope to hear from any of the five incumbent justices who made up the majority three years ago in the Citizens United                                        case In my opinion those hopes will remain unfulfilled Perhaps the most famous instance of incumbent justices changing their mind on a highprofile issue occurred in the 1940s The question was whether school children with religious objections to pledging allegiance to
                                        the flag could be required to do so on pain of expulsion from school Jehovahs Witnesses for whom saluting the flag is unacceptable challenged the requirement as a violation of the First Amendment right
                                        to free exercise of religion In 1940 the court ruled in Minersville School District v Gobitis that the First Amendment did not prevent public
                                        school districts from expelling the Jehovahs Witness children The vote was 8 to 1 with only Chief Justice Harlan F Stone dissenting  The reaction by a country caught up in wartime patriotic fervor appalled the justices Taking the Supreme Courts decision as proof that Jehovahs Witnesses were not good citizens mobs attacked and burned
                                        the Witnesses places of worship Members of the faith were fired from their jobs and some 2000 Jehovahs Witness children were expelled from school When another case reached the court after only
                                        three years three justices who had been in the earlier majority changed their votes With the addition of two new justices to the court the vote to affirm the religious rights of the Jehovahs Witnesses
                                        was 6 to 3 The decision West Virginia State Board of Education v Barnette with a majority opinion by the recently appointed Robert H Jackson
                                        remains a star in the First Amendment firmament Two of the three justices who changed their minds Hugo L Black and William O Douglas explained themselves in a concurring opinion Neither our domestic tranquility in peace nor our martial effort in war
                                        depend on compelling little children to participate in a ceremony which ends in nothing for them but a fear of spiritual condemnation the two wrote The third justice to change his mind was Frank Murphy
                                        It was in freedom and the example of persuasion Justice Murphy wrote not in force and compulsion that the real unity of America lies This episode 70 years ago next month provided a dramatic denouement to an unfortunate chapter in the courts history But the parallel between that longago change of heart and the more recent ones is hardly

Irish Catholic Church Condemns Abortion Legislation,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/04/world/europe/irish-catholic-church-condemns-abortion-legislation.html,DUBLIN  The Catholic Church in Ireland on Friday condemned the governments abortion legislation which would permit abortions in cases where a threat existed to a womans life including from suicide The church called the legislation a dramatically and morally unacceptable change to Irish law The statement from the Irish bishops disputed the governments position that the proposed legislation introduced by the government this week merely codifies existing constitutional rights flowing from a 1992 Supreme Court ruling and does not confer new ones The Heads of the Protection of Life during Pregnancy Bill 2013 published by the Government on Wednesday would if approved make the direct and intentional killing of unborn children lawful in Ireland the bishops statement said The statement referred in particular to the inclusion of suicide as a possible ground for abortion It is a tragic moment for Irish society when we regard the deliberate destruction of a completely innocent person as an acceptable response to the threat of the preventable death of another person it said After the statement was issued Cardinal Sean Brady told RTE the national broadcaster that the bishops believed that the legislation was a denial of religious freedom Its not just hospitals its schools he said This is very potentially menacing for institutions and for the expression of religious thought in this country Cardinal Brady said the bishops had not discussed if Communion should be refused to politicians who supported the bill In February Cardinal Raymond L Burke the former archbishop of St Louis and the head of the Vatican court urged priests to withdraw communion from politicians who supported abortion legislation in Ireland He told the newspaper The Catholic Voice that the legalization of abortion in Ireland would create a culture of death Cardinal Brady said that though the bishops were calling on parliamentary representatives to oppose the bill there would be a great reluctance to politicize the Eucharist Politicians he said have an obligation to oppose the laws that are attacking something so fundamental as the right to life and they would have to follow their own conscience In response Deputy Prime Minister Eamon Gilmore said the bishops were entitled to express their opinion but that the legislation was intended to bring clarity to existing Irish law The laws of this country are made by those of us who are elected by the people and are charged with that responsibility and for 21 years legislators have failed to legislate for a Supreme Court decision he said The proposed legislation would allow for the termination of a pregnancy in the limited number of cases where there is a real and substantive threat to the life of the woman including from suicide It is intended to clarify in what circumstances doctors can carry out abortions What we have to do collectively as a society and legislators is make laws that make it clear what is the position for a pregnant woman whose life is at risk what treatment is available to her Mr Gilmore said
Scenic Views of the Constitution,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/arts/television/scenic-views-of-the-constitution.html,To entice viewers who might be daunted by four hours of television devoted to the Constitution PBS chose a host known for his comic touch with current events Producers even put him on a specially decorated HarleyDavidson for jaunts around the country Yet even before the show Constitution USA begins on Tuesday controversy has intruded In a lateApril interview with Politico that host Peter Sagal  known for National Public Radios weekly news quiz Wait Wait  Dont Tell Me  equated the Constitution with Tinker Bell Many conservative bloggers Web commenters and Twitter users lashed out some using profanity at what one called a Liberal Progressive Socialists interpretation of the Constitution Mr Sagal had told Politico that while he did not want to get into the liberalversusconservative debate over whether the Constitution was a living or dead document he believed the Constitution is only as alive as we collectively have decided it is today adding Ive been calling it the Tinker Bell of national charters because Tinker Bell only lives if you clap right Or if you say I do believe in fairies I do Its like this I do believe in civics I do And everybody believes in it and we move on And its an amazing phenomenon By email Mr Sagal dismissed the dispute saying There seems to be a lot of anger in the world with nothing real to hang itself on Constitution USA which will be broadcast on PBS stations for the next four Tuesdays includes perspective from scholars across the political spectrum Its director Stephen Ives said in an interview at his Union Square office that he believed the series as a whole is balanced politically although not every issue includes multiple viewpoints To illustrate how the Constitution affects us daily the show takes as its starting point the players involved in contemporary issues  a marijuana grower who does so legally the lesbian couple at the heart of the Supreme Court case about Californias Prop 8 a man who lost his fathers garden to eminent domain  and works backward to examine their Constitutional underpinnings Mr Ives said he went through a Rubiks Cube of possible combinations in deciding how to tackle the Constitution and ended up with theme episodes on states rights and federalism separation of powers individual liberty as seen through the First and the Fourth Amendments and equality as dealt with in the 14th Amendment Two contentious subjects gun control and abortion are largely avoided Those issues had been pretty much all people had been talking about constitutionally for a long time and endlessly debated Mr Ives said It was hard to imagine wading into those subjects without getting into a pointcounterpoint kind of argument that felt uninteresting The show is not as glib as History channels 2010 America The Story of Us which mashed up costumed actors whizbang computergenerated time lapses and commentary from the likes of Donald Trump Nor is it as reductive as the 1970s Saturdaymorning Schoolhouse Rock ditties on ABC one of which set the Constitutions preamble to a folky banjo tune In Constitution USA scholars like Akhil Reed Amar of Yale Law School are often interviewed at landmarks Historical flashbacks use mixedmedia techniques We knew exactly what we didnt want to do Mr Sagal said in a telephone interview We didnt want to have panning shots of historical landscapes in the morning light or pictures of portraits focusing in closer and closer or Garrison Keillor reading letters he said adding quickly Not that theres anything wrong with that Mr Ives has produced his share of such historical dramas including the 1996 PBS hit The West And not that theres anything wrong with Schoolhouse Rock First of all Im 48 said Mr Sagal who as a child was a fan of the series and its mini civics lessons Nobody disses Schoolhouse Rock when Im around Besides that television experiment still resonates When Mr Sagal asked people at an Illinois parade what they knew about the Constitution he said many quoted the words life liberty and the pursuit of happiness  which is from the Declaration of Independence not the Constitution  and a lot of people had nothing to say And he added The only people who were able to quote the Constitution to us were able to because they were able to sing the preamble from Schoolhouse RockÂ  Mr Sagal considers himself a relatively informed guy but far from a constitutional expert Mr Ives said Mr Sagal was having epiphanies along the way Despite light touches like the 18000 motorcycle  which the producers not PBS using federal funds bought and which will be sold Mr Ives said  the show gives Mr Sagal the chance to display a more thoughtful side Every now and then he said I want to be serious to talk about something in more depth and not be obligated to make a joke every 30 seconds By contrast he likened his job as host of Wait Wait  Dont Tell Me to being a bar mitzvah or wedding singer On that onehour radio show which is taped before a live audience three comedic panelists listeners and celebrity guests compete to answer questions tied to the weeks news Choosing Mr Sagal for Constitution USA Mr Ives said was a huge roll of the dice because he had never anchored a major television program Mr Sagal however is about to get even more video exposure from Wait Wait which is based in Chicago but travels to other cities often The Thursday episode of Wait Wait was to be beamed live to 600 theaters so fans in smaller towns could see it That strategy may be repeated Mr Sagal said if that episode is wellreceived He is also writing a book on running which will include an account of his experience at the recent Boston Marathon as a guide for a legally blind runner They finished four minutes ahead of the devastating bombs This year 2013 has already turned into a very interesting year in my life Mr Sagal said noting that he is in the process of a divorce I started it as a married radio host and Ill end it as a single PBS documentary host who survived a terror attack and were only in April
Texas Legislators Set to Restore Womenâ€™s-Health Budgets,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/05/us/texas-lawmakers-set-to-restore-womens-health-financing.html,The political fireworks and highoctane drama that accompanied lawmakers 2011 fight over womens health care and abortion have been absent this legislative session They have been replaced with some semblance of concession as legislators on both sides of the aisle work quietly to restore financing for womens health services  They have done it with little more than a handshake agreement Democrats will not die on the sword of bringing Planned Parenthood back into the fold and Republicans will not put up additional barriers to womens access to care  The major difference is were not fighting about it Were just doing whats right for women and the state State Representative Sarah Davis Republican of West University Place said last month at a Texas Tribune symposium on health care  There has not been a drawnout public debate on abortion or womens health in either chamber this legislative session None of the 24 abortionrelated bills filed have reached the House or Senate floor And Ms Davis the only Republican member of the House Womens Health Caucus brokered a bipartisan grand bargain as lawmakers refer to it to prevent amendments to the House budget bill that could have jeopardized an agreement to restore womens health dollars  For some Republicans this bargain hinged on the ballot box Ms Davis said several of her colleagues had faced blistering attacks after last sessions familyplanning cuts  an effort in part to drive Planned Parenthood out of business  closed clinics in their districts that were not affiliated with abortion providers Ms Davis a breast cancer survivor who opposes abortion but will not support legislation she believes interferes with the doctorpatient relationship said the best way she had found to help lowincome women was to remove emotion from the debate The arguments about abortion and Planned Parenthood in 2011 did not advance the ball she said In fact it just threw family planning into a tailspin Bolstered by the Tea Partys gains in the states 2010 elections last sessions ultraconservative Legislature approved a law requiring women seeking an abortion to have a sonogram and hear a description of the fetus at least 24 hours before the procedure In a targeted effort to exclude Planned Parenthood and other clinics affiliated with abortion providers from taxpayerfinanced programs lawmakers also cut the states familyplanning budget by twothirds As a direct result 117 Texas familyplanning clinics stopped receiving state financing and 56 of those clinics closed according to researchers at the University of Texas at Austin who are conducting a threeyear study to evaluate the Legislatures policy changes  The researchers estimate that 144000 fewer women received health services and 30000 fewer unintended pregnancies were averted in 2012 than in 2010 The states savings from the programs dropped by an estimated 163 million  A lot of people really felt they got snookered by some of the people in the prolife movement about that familyplanning issue said State Senator Bob Deuell Republican of Greenville who has been a strong advocate for restoring familyplanning financing for lowincome women by way of primary care  Dr Deuell a primary care physician is an ardent opponent of state money going to Planned Parenthood clinics But he said the vitriol of some abortion opponents last session had prevented the state from pursuing good policy decisions He recalled being compared to Margaret Sanger the founder of Planned Parenthood when he argued that cutting familyplanning services would lead to more unwanted pregnancies and therefore more abortions and more children living in poverty In the tentative 201415 state budget which is being worked out in conference committee lawmakers have devoted more financing to womens health services than before the 2011 budget cuts The House version of the budget doubled financing for familyplanning services to 75 million while the Senate version increases financing to 43 million Both chambers have added 100 million to a staterun primary care program to serve women of all ages and set aside 71 million to support the Texas Womens Health Program formerly the Medicaid Womens Health Program which lost a 9to1 federal match over state leaders decision to eject Planned Parenthood clinics from it Legislative budget writers earmarked the money under strict rules that none of it could go to health providers that were affiliated with abortion clinics Abortion providers are already excluded from state health programs but abortion opponents argue that state dollars that went to affiliates of abortion providers  like Planned Parenthood clinics that provide only family planning services  indirectly support abortion  Once thats taken off the table oh its wonderful it makes it so much easier State Representative Bryan Hughes Republican of Mineola said at The Tribunes health care symposium Because we agree we want to make sure these services are provided and women get the health care that they need The federal government has responded in part to the states efforts to exclude certain providers by granting the Womens Health and Family Planning Association of Texas  not the usual recipient the Texas Department of State Health Services  6 million in socalled Title X familyplanning dollars to distribute in the second half of fiscal year 2013 Fran Hagerty the associations chief executive said the financing gave providers a range of benefits like the ability to offer confidential services for teenagers and to provide patients discounts on contraception Only two Planned Parenthood clinics have asked for and received a portion of the Title X financing she said  These funding sources are meant to work together to support these providers Ms Hagerty said adding that she hoped to work with the state to rebuild the states network of familyplanning providers There are already plans to reopen some clinics she said like a familyplanning provider in Bell County that closed because of the states cuts after 42 years of operation With the familyplanning financing nearly settled Â depending on negotiations in conference committee Â the last lingering battlefield is abortion  Gov Rick Perry has thrown his political weight behind a bill that would prohibit abortions after 20 weeks Current law bans abortions in the third trimester except in cases of medical emergency Abortion opponents believe fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks of gestation because they reflexively respond to stimuli but there is no scientific consensusÂ A 2005 study published in The Journal of the American Medical Association found it was unlikely that fetuses felt pain before the third trimester A House committee approved the bill on Friday Dr Deuell has written a bill to tighten restrictions on facilities that provide abortions saying lawmakers can do things to improve the quality and safety of abortions Only 5 of the states 42 existing abortion facilities would meet the bills standards  Abortionrights advocates counter that existing regulations are sufficient and that the added precautions would ultimately endanger women by limiting legal access to the procedure The bill is currently stalled in the Senate  For her part Ms Davis thinks delving into such abortion fights is unnecessary We should not be playing political football with womens health she said because it doesnt do either side any good
"Giulio Andreotti, Premier of Italy 7 Times, Dies at 94",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/world/europe/giulio-andreotti-premier-of-italy-7-times-dies-at-94.html,Giulio Andreotti a seventime prime minister of Italy with a rsum of signal accomplishments and checkered failings that reads like a history of the republic died on Monday He was 94 and lived in Rome His death was announced by President Giorgio Napolitano Mr Andreotti had been at the center of Italys postwar political order until its collapse in 1992 emerging at the close of World War II as a close aide to Alcide De Gasperi a founding father of the Italian republic who had practically reinvented the Christian Democratic Party after it had been wiped out by Fascism The party became Italys dominant one furnishing all but three postwar prime ministers and governing  though at times barely so  through unruly coalitions or with the acquiescence of other parties Mr Andreottis long career epitomized many of the countrys contradictions He held one important position or another  his portfolios included finance treasury defense and industry  as Italy overcame wartime destruction and the threat of Stalinist totalitarianism coped with staggering social problems and labor discontent faced down terrorists and struggled against organized crime But to secure power for the Christian Democrats Mr Andreotti helped build a system of cronyism that led to vast corruption government investigations and the end of both the Christian Democratic Party in 1994 and his career A friend of popes and a daily attendant at Mass Mr Andreotti was complex and enigmatic He helped shape the policies that placed Italy among the worlds richest democracies the Group of 7 But his ultimate inability to rein in the government profligacy that had helped anchor his partys popularity caused Italys indebtedness to balloon He was known for a sardonic sometimes caustic wit Power he liked to say wears out only those who dont have it On another occasion he said Apart from the Punic Wars for which I was too young I have been blamed for everything Former Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain was wary of him In her memoirs she wrote of him as a man possessing a positive aversion to principle even a conviction that a man of principle was doomed to be a figure of fun Others believed his character and deeds reflected his Catholicism Gerardo Bianco a longtime political associate was quoted as saying Andreotti belongs to a certain Jesuitical clerical tradition in which you accept that in a fallen world you have to work with the material at hand Probably his most traumatic episode as prime minister unfolded in March 1978 when the Red Brigades a radical MarxistLeninist paramilitary group kidnapped the former Prime Minister Aldo Moro in a street ambush and killed his five bodyguards They demanded the release of their leaders who were then on trial in Turin Moro was one of Mr Andreottis oldest friends and associates but a sometime rival as well In desperate letters to Mr Andreotti and others he pleaded with them to rescue him through a prisoner exchange Mr Andreotti though clearly anguished refused having resolved not to negotiate with terrorists Weeks later Moros body was found in Rome in a battered old car two blocks from the headquarters of both the Christian Democrats and the Communists Mr Andreottis critics contended that his refusal to help Moro was politically motivated an accusation he denied Mr Andreottis detractors in Parliament had him investigated more than 20 times whenever some scandal or malfeasance was rumored As early as 1984 and perhaps even earlier American diplomats in Sicily had reported to Washington that Mr Andreottis Sicilian party faction was reputed to be closely tied to the Mafia In Italy he won full vindication each time Mr Andreottis reputation was sullied again in his later years when he was put on trial twice Informers said that he had colluded with the Mafia in exchange for electoral support and implicated him in the killing of a muckraking Italian journalist He was acquitted in both trials Mr Andreotti maintained strong ties with the Vatican having had a hand in rewriting its 1929 agreement with Mussolini In 1976 as prime minister Mr Andreotti presented to Parliament an updated version of the accord bringing it into line with the secular lives led by most Italians it abolished Roman Catholicism as the state religion made religious instruction in public schools optional and removed the churchs ban of Italys sixyearold divorce law The accord was finally ratified in 1984 under Bettino Craxi Italys first Socialist prime minister whom Mr Andreotti was serving as foreign minister Mr Andreotti was also prime minister when Parliament after years of arguments and compromises passed a liberal abortion law in 1978 despite Vatican opposition and only lax support from his Christian Democrats Three years later the electorate voted by better than two to one to uphold the law He could be shrewd and pragmatic Though he started out as a staunch antiCommunist Mr Andreotti was the first prime minister to find an accommodation with the Italian Communist Party the countrys secondstrongest electoral force The compromise engineered in 1976 ostensibly gave the Communist Party a role in policy making in return for a promise not to trip up the government in votes of confidence Ignoring the outcries of its rank and file the Communists helped Mr Andreotti pass painful austerity measures that kept the country from drowning in debt In the end it was the Communists who called off the engagement The break came in December 1978 with Mr Andreottis decision to take Italy into the European monetary system He wheedled concessions out of Germany and France for a weaker lira and put his proposal to a vote As foreseen the Communists cast their first nays on a substantive issue But the Socialists abstained rather than derail the government and that left a comfortable margin for membership in the monetary system Thus Mr Andreotti won an impressive gamble The Communists caused his fall a month later on a vote of confidence Giulio Andreotti was born on Jan 14 1919 to a teacher who died when he was a year old After growing up in Rome in modest circumstances he worked his way through the University of Rome and earned a law degree From 1942 to 1945 he presided over the Italian Catholic University Federation a student organization and edited its weekly While doing research at the Vatican in 1942 he met De Gasperi an antiFascist who had found refuge there as a librarian and hoped to resuscitate the Christian Democratic Party when Mussolini had passed from the scene De Gasperi led eight successive cabinets from 1945 to 1953 and Mr Andreotti served him as under secretary of state a post with considerable influence Mr Andreotti is survived by his wife Livia Danese and four children He was the author of numerous books including Lives Encounters With History Makers published in 1989 After the fall of Communism Mr Andreotti spent six months in 1990 as the president of the European Community working to improve relations with the new democracies of the former Soviet bloc to establish a European Central Bank and to keep world trade from becoming mired in protectionism He raised eyebrows in Paris and London by saying out loud what others had said only privately that France and Britain should accept their diminished power and yield their permanent United Nations Security Council seats to the European Community and Japan The events that tested Mr Andreotti most in his later years began to unfold in late 1992 when charges resurfaced that he had for years been the Sicilian Mafias protector in Rome in exchange for political support One Mafia informant said that Mr Andreotti had met with Salvatore Toto Riina the boss of all bosses in 1987 and the men had exchanged a kiss of respect Other accusations centered on allegations that Mr Andreotti had conspired in the killing of an investigative journalist Carmine Pecorelli in March 1979 After Parliament stripped Mr Andreotti of his immunity in 1993 he was tried in Palermo Sicily in 1995 on charges of associating with the Mafia and in Perugia in 1996 on charges of conspiring in the killing of the journalist The Palermo trial was adjourned pending a verdict in Perugia Mr Andreotti was acquitted in Perugia in 1999 That same year he was acquitted in Palermo on the basis of insufficient evidence not quite the exoneration he had hoped for Mr Andreotti repeatedly questioned the motives and reliability of the informers suggesting the Mafia was getting back at him for his efforts to fight organized crime As far as I know none of the informers has ever said anything that they knew directly he told The New York Times in January 1993 They always say I heard about it And the people they cite are all dead Praised for his political durability Mr Andreotti was also labeled Beelzebub for his secretive dealings Others called him the Divo Giulio a play on his first name and the Latin Divus Iulius or Divine Julius used for Julius Caesar His political career inspired biographies and an unflattering movie that gave him a dismal place in Italian history The film Il Divo by Paolo Sorrentino won the Jury Prize at the Cannes Film Festival in 2008 Asked for his reaction to the film Mr Andreotti told the Italian news media If you are a politician I hear its better to be criticized than ignored Â 
Religion Beyond the Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/opinion/bruni-religion-beyond-the-right.html,As the Boy Scouts of America reassesses its ban on gay scouts and leaders were hearing a lot about the organizations need to remain sensitive to people whose religions condemn homosexual behavior Their morals must be properly respected their God aptly revered But what about the morals and the God of people whose religions exhort them to be inclusive and to treat gays and lesbians with the same dignity as anyone else There are many Americans in this camp and their opposition to the Scouts ban is as faithbased as the stance of those who want it maintained Take Scott Ward 48 a public relations executive and married father of three in Takoma Park Md Hes a scout leader with a 10yearold son whos a scout Hes also an elder in his Presbyterian church And for him the ban must go not in spite of what Christianity says about homosexuality or what selective literalists have decided it says but because of what it says about humanity From my faith perspective singling people out for exclusion from the life of the church or the life of the community cannot possibly be part of Gods plan Ward told me on the phone recently He added If you look at the people Jesus tended to be most suspicious of they were people who sat in positions of authority to say that they had the unique ability to judge others We refer incessantly in this country to the religious right a phrase routinely presented as if its some sort of syllogism to be devoutly religious is to gravitate to a certain side of the political spectrum one set of values dictating the other Christian conservatives is an almost equally ubiquitous bit of alliteration But theres a religious center A religious left There are Christian moderates and Christian liberals less alliterative and less dogmatic but perhaps no less concerned with acting in ways that reflect moral ideals We should better acknowledge that and them And we should stop equating conventional piety with certain issues only and sexual morality above other kinds Our tendency to do that was illustrated by the hullabaloo last year over the Nuns on the Bus The Vatican officials who wanted them to be more assertively antiabortion and antibirth control were portrayed as the dutiful guardians of tradition while the nuns focused on matters of economic justice were the rebels Why Its as fundamentally Catholic and Christian to care about the underprivileged as to safeguard the unborn or to combat homosexuality Indeed many Catholics look to a politicians social welfare policies as much as they do to other positions and vote in a manner that would be accorded a label other than conservative Many people of faith are pacifists and thats a decisive factor in how they cast their ballots though this concern is infrequently characterized in religious terms I find it perplexing the way the moral values phrase is used said the Rev Mark Greiner the pastor at the Presbyterian church that Ward attends Concern for the environment concern for workers rights those are moral values he told me But the phrase ends up being limited to matters of human sexuality as if Jesus was primarily concerned with what people did with their reproductive parts Its crazymaking Greiner wants the ban on gay scouts and leaders lifted Religion is inevitably part of the Scouts debate more than 70 percent of local scout troops are chartered by religious groups Later this month the organizations National Council will vote on a recommendation that the ban on gay scouts be lifted but the prohibition against gay leaders be preserved The Mormons have indicated that they can live with this The National Catholic Committee on Scouting has been vague The Baptists have cried foul as have evangelicals like Tony Perkins the president of the Family Research Council which sponsored a webcast over the weekend called Stand with Scouts Sunday Rick Perry the Texas governor appeared on it to denounce any change to the ban and for good measure called homosexuality the flavor of the month Like pralines n cream I guess But thats not the whole story The Episcopal Church wants all aspects of the ban lifted as does the National Jewish Committee on Scouting whose former chairman a Baltimore lawyer named Jay Lenrow told me that while no troop should be forced to choose a gay leader no troop should be prevented from doing so either He noted that our country was founded on a principle of religious freedom that the Scouts bylaws require equal treatment of every religions teachings and that certain denominations  the Episcopal Church and the Presbyterian Church USA for example  ordain gay and lesbian ministers By the Scouts current rules those very ministers fit for the pulpit arent deemed fit to lead a troop Isnt that as much of an insult to their religions as the bans end would be to Perkins Perry and their kind
"Changing Sex, and Changing Teams",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/07/us/transgender-high-school-students-gain-admission-to-sports-teams.html,LOS ANGELES  Not so long ago Toni Bias dreamed of playing in the WNBA But after starring on the girls junior varsity basketball team as a high school freshman Toni came out as transgender last summer began going by the name Tony and started transitioning to male At the time California had no policy governing transgender high school athletes Already finding himself the target of bullies who often taunt him with heshe Tony feared he would have to endure even more abuse if he pushed to try out for the boys team So he made a wrenching decision he quit basketball They dont understand Im not trying to pretend to be someone else Tony now a 16yearold sophomore at River City High School in West Sacramento said Im just trying to be who I was all along Professional sports have grappled with this question for decades since Rene Richards who was born male underwent sexchange surgery and sued the United States Tennis Association to be allowed to play in the womens draw at the 1977 US Open How if at all should transgender athletes be allowed to compete Over the last decade the International Olympic Committee and the National Collegiate Athletic Association have adopted regulations for athletes who were born male but now consider themselves females and want to play on womens teams And now high schools are beginning to take on the issue as well as a small but growing number students who identify themselves as transgender have begun demanding access to the same school activities like interscholastic sports that other students enjoy More than half a dozen states from Washington to Massachusetts have adopted rules to allow transgender students to compete on teams that correspond with their gender identities rather than the sex listed on their school records Half a dozen more states are considering similar regulations And a bill in the Legislature would make California the first to specifically guarantee by law that transgender students like Tony are allowed to play school sports Transgender students deserve equal access to everything in public education including sports said Tom Ammiano the state assemblyman sponsoring the bill You cant discriminate just because youre uncomfortable with a young man transitioning to become a young woman The push to include transgender students in school sports reflects the rapidly growing visibility of transgender people in all walks of society  like Fallon Fox the mixedmartial artist who was born a man but fights women and Chaz Bono the child ofSonny BonoandCher who has transitioned from female to male  as well as shifting ideas about how to define gender But state regulators now face the difficult challenge maintaining competitive fairness What if a 6foot6 student who is biologically male identified as female and wanted to play on the girls basketball team That student would have a dramatically unfair advantage because of his anatomical sex said Andrew Beckwith executive vice president of the Massachusetts Family Institute a conservative group that has also opposed gay marriage and abortion And then after the game he can go to the girls locker room and shower alongside all the girls While transgender students would be allowed to use the locker rooms along with their teammates under the Massachusetts guideline  a thorny issue that has sparked its own debates  state education officials noted that transgender students have often used gender neutral bathrooms at school The International Olympic Committee initially required transgender athletes who want to compete in the Olympics to undergo a full sexchange operation and hormone therapy The National Collegiate Athletic Association requires maletofemale transgender athletes to complete a year of hormone therapy before they may compete on a womens team Regulations for transgender high schoolers are far less stringent No state requires students to undergo surgery or hormone therapy before they are allowed to compete In some states including California where the state interscholastic federation adopted a new policy about transgender students in February students or their parents need only submit a letter to the school asserting their gender identity and the case will be reviewed Thus far only a handful of transgender students have sought to play high school sports according to officials from several states all without major controversy in part because most have been biological females who wanted to play on boys teams  often a less controversial transition that ignites fewer fears about a students gaining competitive advantages But Mr Beckwith said guidelines issued this year in his state Massachusetts were far too lenient calling them ripe for abuse The policy says to just completely ignore anatomical sex he said If a student decides that is his identity the school has to accept that at face value Along with members of other conservative organizations he said the only way to maintain a fair competitive environment would be to permit students to play only with other students of their biological sex Transgender rights advocates and school administrators have said that fears that male students will pose as transgender so they can play on girls teams are far overblown Rhonda BlanfordGreen executive director of the Nebraska School Activities Association said the policy in her state offered transgender students  who are frequently targets of bullying and have elevated rates of depression and suicide  a fair opportunity to participate in school activities Do you know the stigma and psychological trauma most of these kids probably go through just to come out Ms BlanfordGreen said No kid is going to put himself in that situation as a joke Nor are interscholastic sports the only school activities that transgender students say they are often barred from Eli Erlick a high school senior in Willits Calif who was born male but declared a female gender identity at age 8 tried in middle school to take girls gym classes The school said I was a boy so I couldnt participate in them Eli now 17 said After that I just avoided sports altogether Although California law already prohibits discrimination against transgender people policies vary from school to school Mr Ammiano said and some students do not know which teams they are allowed to play on His said his bill would ensure that transgender students all over the state were able to play school sports on teams where they felt safe and comfortable With the new state interscholastic federation policy in place the athletic director at River City High School said Tony would be allowed to try out for the boys team next season But he does not plan to still fearing the social fallout with his classmates He still shoots baskets in the gym sometimes but only by himself I miss it so much Tony said To be who I am Ive had to give up something thats really big in my life
Undercover Video Targets Abortion Doctor,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/09/us/undercover-video-targets-abortion-doctor.html,An antiabortion group released an undercover video on Wednesday showing what it says were offensive and inhumane remarks about abortions by one of the countrys most prominent abortion doctors  The release by the activist group Live Action is part of a new effort by abortion foes to portray clinics that perform later abortions in the second or third trimester of pregnancy as being riddled with illegal or cruel practices  They also assert that the grisly and illegal practices alleged at the trial of Dr Kermit B Gosnell in Philadelphia which include evidence of unsterile tools and untrained workers and charges that he killed babies born live by snipping their spines are typical more widely  The new video captures the doctor LeRoy H Carhart using some imprudent phrases while discussing the process of a lateterm abortion with women posing as patients At one point he describes a fetus that has died after an injection in the womb as softening like meat in a CrockPot But the video provides no evidence of illegal action or subpar medical techniques Other medical experts as well as defenders of abortion rights said the comparison with Dr Gosnell who seemed to show blatant disregard for his patients and the law was misleading and unfair  Comparing an offensive and inappropriate comment to Gosnells horrific crimes is politics at its worst said Eric Ferrero vice president of communications for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America In the tape of two visits to a Nebraska clinic run by Dr Carhart dated Dec 7 and March 28 a woman described as 22 weeks pregnant and another described as 26 weeks pregnant tell him that they want abortions and they question him in detail about how it would be done Both secretly taped the conversation and did not intend to have abortions Dr Carhart did not respond to a request on Wednesday for comment  Dr Carhart is known for his widely reported vow to carry on the work of Dr George R Tiller who performed lateterm abortions in Kansas and was killed in 2009 In part to prevent Dr Carhart from doing lateterm abortions Nebraska banned them after 22 weeks from a womans last menstrual period with few exceptions He has continued to practice in Nebraska performing earlier abortions but he also opened a clinic in Germantown Md where the rules for lateterm abortions are less stringent  In the video Dr Carhart repeatedly emphasizes that he must abide by the law telling both women that at their late stages they would have to travel to Maryland for him to help them He makes it clear that in the extremely unlikely event that a fetus emerges alive the law requires trying to save it  He describes his procedure for second and thirdtrimester abortions which take two to four days and involve first giving an injection to kill the fetus then dilating the cervix trying to induce labor and if that fails pulling out the fetus in pieces  But in a few spots Dr Carhart seems to be trying to find simple metaphors and uses language that his critics called grossly inappropriate and revealing When asked what tools he uses to extract a fetus he first tries to joke saying A pickax a drill bit but then becomes serious and says No  theres just instruments that have been developed  The abortion lobby claims that the Gosnell clinic is an outlier but the footage released this morning by Live Action reveals once more that the abortion industry treats women and children as mere pieces of meat said Marjorie Dannenfelser president of the Susan B Anthony List an antiabortion group  Tracy Weitz a medical sociologist at the University of California San Francisco who viewed the video said people should not be quick to pass judgment on a doctor based on a few phrases on a videotape Doctors struggle to find terminology to help a client understand whats happening and while it may seem wrong to us it may be appropriate for that conversation she said In the video Dr Weitz said Dr Carhart shows compassion for the women and concern for their medical safety Thats so different from what Dr Gosnell is accused of she said  Dr Carhart at one point counsels a woman that its your life thats going to be affected by this pregnancy and be affected by the termination  I mean this baby is a part of you forever he says  The president of Live Action Lila Rose called Dr Carhart a grave threat to women and children citing the death in February of a 29yearold patient who was having an abortion at later than 30 weeks apparently because the fetus had severe deformities The Maryland medical examiner said the woman had died of natural causes from a rare complication of delivery  The antiabortion group Operation Rescue filed a complaint with the Maryland Board of Physicians charging that Dr Carhart had mismanaged the case and should lose his license The board according to a letter on Operation Rescues Web site said it would undertake a preliminary inquiry to see if a full investigation was warranted The board reached Wednesday said its activities were confidential 
Chinese Filmmaker Is Investigated by Family Planning Officials ,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/world/asia/family-planning-officials-investigate-chinese-film-director.html,BEIJING  Chinas most celebrated film director Zhang Yimou is being investigated for a potential violation of family planning laws an official said Thursday confirming reports in the state news media Family planning officials are examining discussions on the Internet that say Mr Zhang has fathered up to seven children with four women If he is found to have violated the laws he could be fined nearly 27 million because the fines are based on the offenders income according to a  report in the online edition of Peoples Daily the official mouthpiece of the Communist Party An official in a propaganda office attached to the family planning committee of Jiangsu Province near Shanghai on the east coast confirmed the substance of the Peoples Daily report which was published Wednesday Calls to the family planning committee of Wuxi the city where Chen Ting Mr Zhangs second wife is registered as a resident went unanswered on Thursday Family planning laws generally restrict families to one child and fines are levied for additional children There are numerous exceptions though Many rural families and ethnic minorities are allowed to have more than one child without penalty Xinhua the state news agency said Thursday that the local family planning committee would release the results of its investigation into Mr Zhang soon Mr Zhangs most recent feature film is The Flowers of War starring Christian Bale China entered it in the Oscar contest for best foreign film of 2011 Early in his career Mr Zhang made a string of films that became popular on the international film festival circuit and in foreign art theaters including Red Sorghum Raise the Red Lantern and To Live adaptations of wellknown literary works He achieved commercial success with Hero a martial arts film and was commissioned by Communist Party leaders to direct the opening and closing ceremonies of the 2008 Olympics in Beijing Mr Zhang 61 is a member of the Chinese Peoples Political Consultative Conference a sort of honorary legislature whose seats are often distributed by the party as political rewards His critics say he has changed over the years from a director with an uncompromising vision to one who bows to the whims of party officials In an interview with The New York Times published last year Mr Zhang said censorship cant be changed and it will be there in the future He added Foreigners think that because I did the opening ceremony of the Olympics I have certain privileges but in fact its not like that at all In front of censorship everyone is equal Mr Zhang could not be reached for comment on Thursday Scholars have been pushing to end the onechild policy which critics say has led to forced abortions and sterilizations Some economists say that China will face a dwindling pool of young workers in the coming years and that it no longer makes sense to continue the policy Furthermore for economic reasons the birthrate is falling across China especially in urban areas There is no reliable public report that gives the exact number of children Mr Zhang has with Ms Chen an actress The recent surge of interest among Chinese Internet users in Mr Zhangs children appeared to have begun on Monday when Southern Entertainment Weekly published an article that said the couple had two sons and a daughter That assertion has not been independently confirmed and the article did not name the sources of the information The reporter and a photographer camped outside Mr Zhangs many homes in Beijing and the photographer followed a car of his to the airport and witnessed what appeared to be family members emerging from the car the article said Mr Zhang has a daughter with his first wife Xiao Hua whom he divorced around the time he was in a relationship with Gong Li who starred in Mr Zhangs early films and became Chinas bestknown actress The daughter Zhang Mo is about 30 and studied filmmaking at New York University She has worked as a film editor for her father and was an interpreter for Mr Bale on the set of The Flowers of War The Peoples Daily report indicated there was speculation that Mr Zhang may have three other children with two other women but it did not give their identities
Comfortable Out of Their Own Skin,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/10/arts/design/body-worlds-pulse-at-discovery-times-square.html,A man and woman stripped of skin are balanced in a balletic embrace but their skulls and thoracic and abdominal cavities are open from behind and their spines are pulled backward with organs and muscles attached A woman stands erect also skinless a slightly melancholy expression emerging from her facial musculature her belly sliced vertically so we can see her liver and intestines along with a 5monthold fetus in her womb Another flayed body welcomes us into this new exhibition Body Worlds Pulse at Discovery Times Square holding aloft with pride the complete coat of skin that has been removed from his body These are not models or allusions to The Silence of the Lambs but actual people who since 1983 have donated their bodies for such preservation and display More than 13200 of the living made such promises 1254 of them are deceased and some of them with organs from other sources appear among the 200 specimens displayed here You might assume that sliced and pulledapart human cadavers preserved in all the freshness of death by infusions of plastics and resin no longer have the power to shock or amaze After all since the German anatomist Gunther von Hagens invented the process he calls plastination in 1977 then started the donation program with his Institute of Plastination and finally began mounting specimens in Body Worlds exhibitions in 1995 some 36 million people have seen the shows in nearly two dozen countries in 11 different incarnations This one Pulse was designed for New York A competitor arose Premier Exhibitions and opened a series of successful exhibitions in the United States including one that has been closed at the South Street Seaport since Hurricane Sandy There have been scandals  including criticism of displays of human corpses deemed insufficiently respectful  and serious doubts have been raised about the provenance of the Chinese cadavers used in the Premier shows Dr von Hagenss exhibitions specify that bodies are all personally donated though individual organs can come from hospital anatomy programs since 2007 all plastination has taken place in Germany There have also been sensations and showmanship in 2002 in London Dr von Hagens sold tickets to an autopsy he performed defying British law and two years ago he announced that after his death he said he has Parkinsons disease he too would be plastinated and in that form would welcome visitors to continuing shows So after all this you might expect to feel less shocked by the evidence of deaths handiwork or by the sense that one distinction after another is being plastinated into oblivion  the boundaries between life and death between skin and muscle between private and public And in some ways familiarity has bred a certain amount of contentment we can see some of these samples now in science museums and react just as medical school students do after they become comfortable with what happens beneath our bodies decorative exteriors And there are times in during this exhibition when you even feel a deep appreciation This show is organized like a textbook you survey the body system by system You are actually seeing the forces of life on display in this dead matter and those forces are extraordinary Every major organ is shown in isolation and in context When you see all of the digestive organs of the body actually of a particular body on display almost as a compressed jigsaw puzzle  the way they fit together within our hollow chests and bellies when you see the profusion of vessels that gather in the kidneys or around the small intestine ensuring that the blood leaves behind its detritus for later expulsion when you see the vagaries of joints and bones and brain  how can you be less than amazed Another powerful impression here is that some specimens they cant really be called objects are diseased and we see at least in a vague somewhat impressionistic way just how different parts of our body look when they are malfunctioning A pockmarked arthritic knee joint is near a healthy one an infarct in the apex of the heart is seen in the web of white scar tissue and the thinning of the walls and the blackened lungs of a heavy smoker look like theyve been dragged along the floors of a coal mine It was with these signs of malfunction in this strange mechanism we inhabit that I started becoming queasy These failings become reminders of the vulnerability of the complex systems that preserve life  systems nearly invisible to us in health though they eclipse the rest of the world during illness And in some ways dissecting the whole and revealing its parts with such clarity lets us see just how tenuous that vitality is the processes of life are revealed through an extravagantly processed death The freestanding displays of blood vessels in the head or leg are both marvelous and unsettling unsettling because we learn that they are created here by hardening those vessels with the preserving plastic and then dissolving the rest of the head or leg marvelous because these intricate webs of blood seem to dramatize the power of the human pulse These sensations may also be a reason that the most difficult part of this exhibition is concerned with birth There are cases displaying fetuses of different ages Within eight weeks a trivial clump of cells already has differentiated organs We follow this development nearly to birth but realize along the way that we are not looking at diagrams or at a single organism developing but at different fetuses each of which died at a different age and a different time and place The contrast between the incipient freshness of new life and the ruthless finality of preserved death is jarring The discomfort may be universal Dr von Hagens points out that these fetuses were originally preserved in formaldehyde in museum collections and morphological institutes They are thus distanced from his enterprise This approach may partly reflect a sensitivity about abortion and provenance But I think it is also meant to prevent an instinctive human recoil at seeing our origins so profoundly undermined In all this I am describing what might be an anatomy exhibition But that is only one aspect of the whole and on its own it would not lure crowds So we come to the shows more extravagant sensations  the posing of entire bodies  and to its intellectual shape And here I found myself resisting the artifice It is amazing to see the interiors of our bodies so finely articulated and displayed But most of these bodies are given titles and posed as if in the midst of athletic activity or dance A Limber Gymnast for example is meant to show the interactions of muscles as he balances But like 17thcentury anatomical drawings doubling as allegories these bodies are also posed to teach contemporary morality lessons which tend to focus on health The gymnast we read knows that our lives are juggling acts Using his legs and an arm he balances on three balls The Jumping Dancer poses in front of hectic video cityscapes intended to demonstrate something about the effects of stress These figures are also meant to be startling provoking The back of the dancer is literally pulled down hanging from his pelvis showing his internal organs And the gymnast holds aloft all the internal organs of his body as if putting them in balance The exhibition is not a simple exploration of life and health it also means to shock with its aestheticized grotesqueries And in the framework of contemporary healthrelated morality who is the most shocking The Smoker He demonically holds a cigarette Half his body is an image of skeletal death with his organs barely staying in his rib cage the musculature of his other half is slack Satanically disturbing The way the exhibition mollifies those who might be overly dismayed at some bodily displays is to cloak everything with sweeping homilies about keeping healthy I was prepared to accept some of this we are after all seeing effects of illnesses but lessons about the importance of exercise the need to control stress and the importance of a balanced diet wore thin when compared with the uncanny evocations of life and death latent in these specimens Death illuminates clarifies and crystallizes the meaning of our lives we read And it does but I also wanted the life to speak more for itself
Packing the Courts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/books/review/the-federalist-society-by-michael-avery-and-danielle-mclaughlin.html,More than two decades ago when I was a law student I used to sneak into meetings of the conservative Federalist Society for lunchtime conversations about constitutional issues Although neither conservative nor a Republican I had libertarian leanings and appreciated the societys openness to debating its political opponents I felt slightly illicit in crossing ideological lines once when the dean spotted me leaving a meeting I felt as if Id been caught walking out of an Xrated movie But the discussions themselves were always intellectually engaging and my fellow law students seemed more interested in converging around a shared approach to interpreting the Constitution than in squabbling about partisan differences  The Federalist Society How Conservatives Took the Law Back From Liberals suggests that my experience was not unique The societys membership includes economic conservatives social conservatives Christian conservatives and libertarians many of whom disagree with each other on significant issues but who cooperate in advancing a broad conservative agenda write Michael Avery a professor at Suffolk University Law School and Danielle McLaughlin an associate at the law firm Nixon Peabody It had its origins in the unhappiness over liberal bias of three law students one at Yale and two at the University of Chicago Within a year of its first major event a symposium in 1982 partly financed by the Olin Foundation it had 17 chapters on law school campuses Today according to Avery and McLaughlin over 45000 lawyers and law students are involved in Federalist Society activities and every single federal judge appointed by the two Presidents Bush was either a member or approved by members of the society including four Supreme Court justices Antonin Scalia Clarence Thomas John Roberts and Samuel Alito The Federalist Society model has been so successful that other organizations have adopted it  societies named after Benjamin Rush Alexander Hamilton and Adam Smith have been started to promote conservative and free market ideas in medical education foreign policy and business school How was the society able to achieve this remarkable feat According to the authors by persuading the competing factions of the modern conservative movement to set aside their ideological differences and to converge around a constitutional methodology known as originalism  the idea that judges should interpret the Constitution as understood by its framers and ratifiers This book promises to explain to liberals how precisely the society took the law back from the liberal orthodoxy that prevailed through the 1970s But those who hope for a howto manual for seizing power  like Saul Alinskys Rules for Radicals  will not find it here The Federalist Society reads like a collection of law review articles and contains no original interviews with the 100 conservative lawyers the authors identify in their appendix as key Federalist Society Members and Allies Readers seeking more insight into the groups success will find it in books like Steven M Teless Rise of the Conservative Legal Movement published in 2008  Still its possible given the volume of information in this book to reconstruct a thesis about why the Federalist Society was so effective in changing the legal debate in America The conservative counterrevolution against the excesses of the Warren court began like the Council of Trent by enumerating heresies and defining orthodoxies In the case of the Federalists the founding document was a report issued in 1988 by the Meese Justice Department of the Reagan administration The report described 15 areas of potential conflict on the Supreme Court  including abortion gay rights affirmative action and states rights With striking clairvoyance it outlined an incrementalist strategy for narrowing the right to reproductive choice and predicted accurately that the expansive jurisprudence of personal autonomy recognized in cases like Roe v Wade might eventually lead to the judicial recognition of gay marriage To counteract these disturbing trends the report emphasized the importance of selecting the right judges There are few factors that are more critical to determining the course of the nation and yet more often overlooked than the values and philosophies of    the federal judiciary Far more than Presidents Obama and Clinton Presidents Reagan and both Bushes cared intensely about the selection of judges Brett M Kavanaugh now a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit said that George W Bush devoted more attention to the issue of judges than any other president Like his Republican predecessors he promoted wellknown legal academics who had been allies and advisers of the Federalist Society although they came from different wings of the conservative legal movement and therefore sometimes disagreed about crucial agenda items The libertarian Anthony Kennedy for example parted company with the social conservatives Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas in abortion and gay rights cases while Scalia worried that the constitutionalizing of economic rights advocated by libertarians would resurrect the liberal brand of judicial activism he objected to in Roe v Wade At the same time the Federalist Society didnt put all of its faith in judicial victories The greatest strength of this book is showing how conservatives viewed their effort to take back the Constitution as a multifront war also involving legislatures and ballot initiatives not to mention winning the hearts and minds of the American people After the Supreme Court rejected a property rights claim and allowed Susette Kelos home to be seized for commercial development for example lawyers from the libertarian Institute for Justice were instrumental in the campaign that helped persuade 42 states to limit the use of the eminent domain power The Federalist Societys role in coordinating this multifront war is hard to assess especially because the society as the authors note does not take public positions on policy issues legislation the outcome of Supreme Court cases or judicial appointments Instead lawsuits are filed and briefs are written by individual members like James Bopp one of the more interesting figures in the book As the first general counsel of the National Right to Life Committee Bopp is perhaps the most prolific antiabortion litigator of his generation responsible for encouraging states to pass laws chipping away at Roe v Wade and then defending them in court And as the longtime leader of the Federalist Societys Free Speech and Election Law Practice Group Bopp has been credited as being the intellectual architect of the arguments that persuaded the Supreme Court in Citizens United to equate the free speech of corporations with that of human beings An interview with Bopp about his litigation strategy would have been illuminating  There is much that citizens from all points on the ideological spectrum can learn from the story of the Federalist Society Avery and McLaughlin conclude And indeed there is Although they dont spell out the lessons for liberals at least two emerge from the data they present First the various strands of legal liberalism  civil libertarians Great Society liberals neoprogressive technocrats economic populists and advocates of equal rights on the basis of race gender and sexual orientation  would do well to set aside their ideological differences and converge around a common approach to constitutional interpretation that citizens can understand And second if liberals want to take the courts back from conservatives they have to recognize that ideas  and judicial appointments  matter 
Judge Refuses to Drop His Order Allowing Morning-After Pill for All Ages,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/11/health/judge-refuses-to-drop-order-on-contraceptive-pill-without-regard-to-age.html,WASHINGTON  A federal judge on Friday stepped up his criticism of the Obama administration accusing the Justice Department of making frivolous and silly arguments in its attempt to delay making the morningafter emergency contraceptive pill available to women and girls of all ages without a prescription Judge Edward R Korman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York ordered last month that the drug be made widely available and said that raw politics  not scientific evidence  was behind efforts by Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services to block easier distribution to young girls On Friday he denied the request by government lawyers to suspend his ruling while they appeal In the process he lashed out again at Ms Sebelius in unusually harsh terms questioning her credibility and integrity If a stay is granted it will allow the badfaith politically motivated decision of Secretary Sebelius who lacks any medical or scientific expertise to prevail  thus justifiably undermining the publics confidence in the drug approval process Judge Korman wrote Officials at the Justice Department and the Department of Health and Human Services declined to comment on Judge Kormans ruling citing the continuing legal case The issue of how broadly to distribute the morningafter pill is a politically charged one that puts President Obamas administration at the center of a clash involving some womens rights groups conservative opponents of abortion and defenders of scientific integrity In Fridays ruling Judge Korman said that the governments appeal of his order was nothing more than an attempt to vindicate the improper conduct of the secretary Andrea Costello a lawyer for the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund and counsel to plaintiffs in the case before Judge Korman agreed with him saying that this is politics at its worst and the administration should be ashamed of its duplicitous conduct Judge Korman postponed the enforcement of his order until Monday to allow lawyers for the Justice Department to take their request for a delay to the appeals court If the government ultimately fails to secure a suspension of Judge Kormans order it would clear the path for overthecounter sales of the morningafter pill to very young girls an outcome that the Obama administration has tried to block In 2011 Ms Sebelius overruled a decision by the Food and Drug Administration to allow the drug to be sold without a prescription to anyone Instead she required that the drug be kept behind the counter at pharmacies and sold without a prescription only to women 17 and older Last week the FDA approved a change in that rule that would allow women and girls 15 and older to buy the drug without a prescription At a hearing last week Judge Korman said that decision was politically motivated and intended to sugarcoat the governments appeal He indicated he believed the drug should be made more widely available Judge Kormans rulings have been filled with harsh criticism of Ms Sebelius and the administrations legal efforts to defend her decision Fridays ruling on the request for a delay in the enforcement of his order was no exception The judge repeatedly accused the government of operating in bad faith and said the process of denying broad distribution of the drug had been corrupted by political interference for years He said he did not believe that ordering Ms Sebelius or the FDA to reexamine their decisions would make any difference The cause of the rejection of overthecounter sale of levonorgestrelbased emergency contraceptives was the secretary of health and human services Judge Korman wrote She has not changed her position A remand would thus be futile More significantly I have been there and done that Indeed in my view the defendants appeal is frivolous and is taken for the purpose of delay he wrote At one point in his ruling Judge Korman notes that lawyers for the administration insist that allowing overthecounter access to the drug for everyone while the government appeals the case would mean uncertainty for girls and women about whether they could get the drug The judge rejected that argument out of hand saying that this silly argument ignores the fact it is the governments appeal from the order that sustained the judgment of the commissioner of the FDA that is the cause of any uncertainty and that that appeal is taken solely to vindicate the improper conduct of the secretary and possibly for the purpose of further delaying greater access to emergency contraceptives for purely political reasons He also rejected the governments argument that women might be confused about the drugs availability if it was made available to everyone without a prescription and then later restricted because the government won its appeal Judge Korman called that argument largely an insult to the intelligence of women
Still Licensed to Be Indie,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/movies/oscilloscope-laboratories-a-year-after-adam-yauchs-death.html,W W A D That was the question  a wry twist on the evangelical invocation of Jesus  that Dan Berger and David Laub the copresidents of Oscilloscope Laboratories an independent film company were considering as they prepared for a visit by a reporter The issue at hand whether Oscilloscopes staff should dress up in crisp white lab coats for the meeting which was to discuss the company a year after its founder and leader Adam Yauch better known as MCA of the Beastie Boys died at 47 after a threeyear bout with salivary gland cancer  To the unknowing visitor it was slightly unsettling to open the door to Oscilloscopes woodpaneled offices in a former paint factory on Canal Street in the South Village and encounter a dozen or so straightfaced employees dressed as lab technicians It was funny but also like stepping into the middle of a joke Adam absolutely would have had that idea Mr Berger said after copping to the stunt He inflected this good humor in everything he did Both Mr Berger 30 and Mr Laub 31 chose not to don the coats but followed the office dress code for men still in place as dictated by Mr Yauch ties buttondown shirts no jeans or sneakers Mr Berger complemented his monochromatic grays with argyle socks while Mr Laub dressed in a checkered shirt and khakis They looked more like high school film club presidents than executives but thats not necessarily a negative in todays independent film world where passion and social media savvy can have more relevance than a sense of authority in a boardroom They do look like kids said the director Todd Louiso 43 whose love story Hello I Must Be Going was released by Oscilloscope in the fall But Adam wouldnt pick people who werent on his level In fact they are three steps ahead of everyone else  Its been an emotional roller coaster of a year for Mr Berger and Mr Laub who had been deputies under Mr Yauch and his primary partner David Fenkel When Mr Fenkel made plans to create a new company A24 in the beginning of 2012 Mr Yauch anointed Mr Berger and Mr Laub just weeks before his death telling them over the phone Lets do this but adding an expletive  Mr Yauch died the day after Mr Fenkels departure was officially announced and though Mr Fenkel stayed on a few months to assist in the transition it was a crazy time Mr Louiso said But they pressed on Three weeks after Mr Yauchs death the Oscilloscope team went to the Cannes Film Festival where it acquired the Italian film Reality which would go on to win the Grand Prix award the equivalent of runnerup The companys acquisition pace  about a dozen films a year  didnt slow And it released its highest grossing film in its fiveyear history the nonverbal documentary Samsara which made 27 million in theaters It also took the ambitious gamble of releasing an LCD Soundsystem concert documentary Shut up and Play the Hits as if it were a concert showing one night only in more than 160 theaters more than any other Oscilloscope film and earning 510000 Those successes belie a more uneven track record Of 11 theatrical releases under Oscilloscopes current regime none has been a critical home run and eight took in 100000 or less  often much less  at the box office One year after Mr Yauchs death gags might still be integral to the culture of a company he founded but they send mixed messages about whether the company can move ahead Adam embedded a philosophy in the company we will always have Mr Laub said But theres a balance between cherishing that and figuring out when to be more independent  In February Oscilloscope announced that it was releasing Its a Disaster a lowbudget apocalyptic black comedy through Twitters Vine app which allows the widespread sharing of sixsecond videos The 88minute film would be seen in its totality through the snippets marking the future of film distribution said a news release It was a prank but also lowcost marketing sly branding and perhaps a way to honor a boss and mentor  one who would bond with a filmmaker over a shared love of flamethrowers  and at the same time grow a business that Mr Berger said has been profitable the last three years The company declined to release figures How a company can be a financial success when most of its films have sold so few tickets reflects the business model of some independents said Doug Stone president of Box Office Analyst which analyzes and forecasts receipts for Hollywood studios and their arthouse units but not Oscilloscope For instance a distributor can spend very little on film rights and advertising and keep the theatrical release limited but earn income primarily from television rights DVD sales and videoondemand outlets like iTunes  Mr Stone who ranks independent distributors by box office said Oscilloscope was barely on the list  But does that mean they cant be profitable he said No  Mr Yauchs wife Dechen now owns Oscilloscope and she shares Mr Berger and Mr Laubs confident outlook Dan and David completely know what they are doing Ms Yauch said in a phone call in response to queries about their age and experience In their case youth is not wasted on the young She said she has been impressed to see the office lights on when shes driven past late at night The director Kelly Reichardt whose features Wendy and Lucy and Meeks Cutoff were released by Oscilloscope said Adam wanted a work environment where people like going to work And for everyone to feel creative  Mr Fenkel had more commercial inclinations Mr Berger and Mr Laub said For instance his new company A24 released the violent drama Spring Breakers which has earned 14 million this year  Mr Berger said We sometimes approach a filmmaker and say Maybe we wont make a lot of money That might not be worth it for other distributors but it is for us Mr Yauch once said he was drawn to movies that were not marketable  Mark Magidson the veteran producer of Samsara said he was impressed by the companys understanding of theatrical venues beyond Los Angeles and New York Still distributing films is a whathaveyoudonelatelybusiness he said They just have to keep choosing interesting films and make them work  Coming Oscilloscope films include After Tiller a documentary about lateterm abortion providers and the documentary These Birds Walk about a Pakistani orphanage For the last year the companys Web site featured an image of Mr Yauch holding a banana like a telephone with text honoring his legacy It was recently taken down  They were all really influenced by Adam Ms Reichardt said But the companys their own now Even if Adam were alive nothing stays the same They cant run the company guessing what he would do Anyway Adam was a go for it person
The Taxman vs. the Tea Party,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/12/opinion/sunday/douthat-the-taxman-vs-the-tea-party.html,AS a taxpayer and a conservative who hopes to remain on good terms with the Internal Revenue Service for many April 15ths to come I dont want to speculate too freely about the motives of the low level IRS employees who decided to single out Tea Party groups for an inappropriate level of attention during the heat of the 2012 campaign But Im willing to guess this much Even though an American Civil Liberties Union official described their excessive interest in rightwing groups as about as constitutionally troubling as it gets the bureaucrats in question probably thought they were just doing their patriotic duty and giving dangerous extremists the treatment they deserved Where might an enterprising publicspirited IRS agent get the idea that a Tea Party group deserved more scrutiny from the government than the typical band of activists seeking taxexempt status Oh I dont know why maybe from all the prominent voices who spent the first two years of the Obama era worrying that the Tea Party wasnt just a typically messy expression of citizen activism but something much darker  an expression of cryptofascist cryptoracist rage part Timothy McVeigh and part Bull Connor potentially carrying a wave of terrorist violence in its wings The historical term for this kind of anxiety is Brown Scare  an inordinate fear of a vast farright conspiracy which resembles the antiCommunist panics of our past As the historian Philip Jenkins wrote in 2009 Brown Scares no less than Red Scares recur throughout American history They fasten on realenough phenomena from homegrown fascist sympathizers in the 1930s to the militia movements in the 1990s but then wildly exaggerate both the danger these extremists pose and their ties to the conservative mainstream In the 30s Jenkins noted this mentality inspired the persistent mediafed fear that the US was about to be overwhelmed by ultraRight fifth columnists millions strong intimately allied with the Axis powers In the 60s it persuaded many liberals that Dallass rightwing fever was somehow responsible for John F Kennedys assassination even though the presidents actual assassin was a Communist sympathizer This ide fixe persists to the present day After the Oklahoma City bombing it led many people to tar the entire militia movement as terrorist not just extremist and then to conflate the militias this was one of Bill Clintons defter moves with the mainstream smallgovernment right Our own eras Brown Scare followed a similar pattern Early in President Obamas first term a Department of Homeland Security report predicted an increase in rightwing extremism citing real threats but also employing a definition of extremist so broad Reason magazines Jesse Walker noted that it seemed to include anyone who opposed abortion or immigration or excessive federal power As the Tea Party movement gathered steam liberals consistently echoed the DHS reports themes warning that the movements fringier elements and oftenoverheated rhetoric which were real enough and worth criticizing were laying the groundwork for a wave of farright violence Invoking JFKs assassination and Oklahoma City these critics then leapt to connect the dots every time a kook pulled a gun or set off a bomb somewhere  whether it was a lone neoNazi shooting a guard at the Holocaust museum in Washington the apparent murder ultimately ruled a suicide of a census worker in rural Kentucky or even the failed Times Square bombing which turned out to be the work of a wouldbe jihadist but not before Michael Bloomberg had suggested that it might be someone with a political agenda that doesnt like the health care bill or something The dotsconnecting peaked of course with the shooting of Gabrielle Giffords which was instantly deemed a case of rightwing incitement leading to political violence with the blame going to Sarah Palin Glenn Beck and conservatism in general When none of this turned out to be true however  the shooter was not really a political actor at all but just a mentally ill lost soul with no connection to partisan politics  the scare began a slow retreat The Tea Party had won its midterm victory and as the movements ardor cooled and its influence diminished the fears of its critics began to diminish as well With Beck off Fox and the Tea Partyers off the streets  replaced by Occupy Wall Street and union protesters often shouting nonetoomoderate slogans of their own  it became harder to look at American conservatism and see Brownshirts or grand wizards on the march But moods and prejudices linger even after panics recede The IRS and the conservative movement have never been on the best of terms and perhaps the recent abuses just reflect that longstanding tension But I suspect its more than that and that this episode will be remembered as one of the last embarrassments produced by our eras Brown Scare
Hospital Mergers Reset Abortion-Access Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/us/hospital-mergers-in-northwest-raise-issue-of-abortion-barriers.html,MOUNT VERNON Wash  Politicians seeking to restrict access to abortion a marked trend this year from North Dakota to Arkansas tend not to get much traction in this part of the country Washington is heavily Democratic leaning left especially on social issues A majority of voters even put into law a statutory right to abortion in 1970  the only state ever to do that The governor Jay Inslee a Democrat is pushing the Legislature even now to pass a law at a special session on Monday requiring health insurers to pay for elective abortions another first for the state if it makes it to Mr Inslees desk But now a wave of proposed and completed mergers between secular and Roman Catholic hospitals which are barred by church doctrine from performing procedures that could harm the unborn is raising the prospect that unelected health care administrators could go where politicians could not The merger wave is mirrored around the country driven by the shifting economic landscape in health care and the looming changes in federal regulation Previous Catholic takeovers in Kentucky Illinois and Pennsylvania have made news and drawn scrutiny The concentration of mergers here through happenstance and history  Catholic nuns arrived in Washington with the first waves of settlers in the 1850s  is particularly pronounced If all the proposed religious and secular combinations go through almost half of the hospital beds in the state  the highest percentage in the nation and up from less than a third at the beginning of last year  would be controlled by the Catholic health systems according to Merger Watch a nonprofit group in New York that tracks hospitals Another wrinkle is that many Washingtonians are not that keen on religion to start with A poll by Gallup conducted throughout 2012 put the state at 12th from the bottom in percentage of people who described themselves as very religious It is also one of only two states  Oregon is the other  where voters have approved a physicianassisted suicide law for terminally ill people Centuries of Catholic teaching hold suicide as a mortal sin You happen to be the hot zone Sarah A Dunne the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Washington said on a recent evening to a group of 75 or so residents here in Mount Vernon who are opposing the mergers Skagit Valley Hospital in Mount Vernon about an hour north of Seattle has joined with two other small local hospitals in seeking a merger partner and is entertaining bids from two Catholic and two secular hospitals A decision is expected this summer The ACLU has been exploring plans for possible litigation as Ms Dunne put it in an interview over whether mergers involving religious and secular hospitals that get taxpayer support could violate a provision of the State Constitution barring public funds for religious purposes Ten counties out of 39 in the state would have 100 percent of their hospital beds in Catholic health system hands by years end if all the proposed mergers went through according to the ACLU Frankly I wish we could do nothing said Vince Oliver the chief executive at the 43bed Island Hospital in nearby Anacortes which is one of the three hospitals including Skagit Valley that are shopping for a partner But the future for a small independent hospital is not a very rosy picture right now he said Catholic hospital leaders said that changes in the medical and economic landscape could threaten service to millions of Americans in rural and suburban areas who might have no choices at all if their local hospital closed or shrank and that Catholic partners  driven by a mission to serve the underserved  are uniquely fitted to help The issue is not availability of abortion or consult to the dying they say which will still be available in secular institutions not that far away but access to care at all The Catholic health system is in many of the communities were in because other health care providers have not wanted to serve those communities and have not had a commitment to serve every human being said Peter Adler a senior vice president at PeaceHealth a Catholic hospital system based in the Pacific Northwest that is one of the bidders for the three hospitals in northwest Washington But critics said that Catholic hospitals do not in fact serve every human being because they deny certain reproductive services or endoflife care that could help a dying patient end his or her suffering Its a collision course said Suzanne Holland a science and values professor in the department of religion at the University of Puget Sound referring to the potential of constriction in health care options from economic change and at the same time restricted choice on moral grounds at hospitals operated through a lens of religious doctrine Professor Holland a Catholic and a lesbian said she already tried to avoid going to a Catholic hospital near her because she was concerned that administrators there would not recognize the rights of her civil union partner A spokesman for the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops which issues rules for Catholic care providers called the Ethical and Religious Directives said that procedures deemed by the church to be immoral are bright lines that cannot be crossed Anything relating to abortion is one such line but anything making it easier for a person to end his or her own life as Washingtons Death with Dignity law does would also be prohibited said the Rev Thomas Weinandy the executive director of the Conference of Catholic Bishops Secretariat for Doctrine Washingtons assisted suicide law passed by the voters in 2008 gives all hospitals and individual caregivers the option to participate And that creates a very mixed complicated picture on the merger front with physicians and pharmacists even in secular hospitals that back the program able to decide for themselves whether to be involved The question at formerly secular hospitals under new Catholic control is therefore not whether helping terminal patients die would be allowed on the premises  clearly not church authorities said  but what kind of private confidential advice a physician would have the authority to give about endoflife options under the state law including where legal services to ease death might be obtained If you go to a Catholic medical institution youre going to get medical advice that is in keeping with the moral norms of that institution Father Weinandy said We think Catholic medical advice is the best medical advice to give The Religious Directives document puts it even more assertively The professionalpatient relationship is never separated then from the Catholic identity of the health care institution But Mr Adler the spokesman for PeaceHealth said that in his organization at least the confidentiality of a physicians advice is protected The conversation between patients and their physicians at PeaceHealth we consider sacred he said
Ginsburgâ€™s Roe v. Wade Blind Spot,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/13/ginsburgs-roe-v-wade-blindspot/,"During a public conversation at the University of Chicago Law School on Saturday Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg yet again expressed her wellknown misgivings about Roe v Wadethat the Supreme Court went too far too fast Her interlocutor at the event Geoffrey Stone reported her comments in The
                                        Huffington Post She said the court should have held only that the Texas law before it in Roe which prohibited abortion unless necessary to save the life of the woman was unconstitutional leaving
                                        for the future the question of what other restrictions on abortion might be constitutional Instead Justice Ginsburg contended the court prevented the states from working out on their own how best to regulate abortion shortcircuiting the democratic process and provoking an angry backlash
                                        among conservatives and resistance to Roe that continues to this day
                                         But as the Times editorial page summarized                                        last month The real story as explained by Linda Greenhouse a former New York Times reporter who now teaches at Yale Law School and Reva Siegel a professor there is that political conflict over abortion
                                        was escalating before the Roe decision and that state progress on decriminalization had reached a standstill in the face of opposition from the Roman Catholic Church Forty years ago when the court decided Roe v Wade 72 it was not considered an especially difficult ruling
                                        A substantial majority of Americans favored the outcome Even if the justices could have anticipated a backlash they should not have let that influence their reasoning Prof Stone put this well The essential
                                        nature of constitutional rights is that they protect fundamental personal liberties even though others do not want to recognize them Justice Ginsburgs view about Roe has been prominently cited as a reason the Supreme Court should not go too far too fast with samesex marriagewhy the court should strike down Californias

Philadelphia Abortion Doctor Guilty of Murder in Late-Term Procedures,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/us/kermit-gosnell-abortion-doctor-found-guilty-of-murder.html,PHILADELPHIA  A doctor who was responsible for cutting the spines of babies after botched abortions was convicted Monday of three counts of firstdegree murder in a case that became a sharp rallying cry for antiabortion activists The doctor Kermit Gosnell 72 operated a clinic in West Philadelphia catering to poor women that prosecutors called a house of horrors The case turned on whether the lateterm pregnancies Dr Gosnell terminated resulted in live births His lawyer Jack McMahon argued that because Dr Gosnell injected a drug in utero to stop the heart the deliveries were stillbirths and movements that witnesses testified to observing  a jerked arm a cry swimming motions  were mere spasms But after deliberating 10 days the jury found Dr Gosnell guilty in the deaths of victims known as Baby A Baby C and Baby D He was found not guilty of murdering Baby E Prosecutors have said they will seek the death penalty when the trial moves into the sentencing phase next Tuesday While abortion rights groups argued that Dr Gosnell operated far outside the legalities and norms of womens health care abortion opponents seized on the case to raise questions about the ethics of lateterm abortions Put simply they asked why a procedure done to a living baby outside the womb is murder but destroying a fetus of similar gestation before delivery can be legal What we need to learn from the Gosnell case is that lateterm abortion is infanticide the Daily Beast columnist Kirsten Powers wrote last week after starting an online furor earlier with a column suggesting that the news media had ignored the case for ideological reasons  Abortion rights supporters said it was opponents who politicized the trial What abortion opponents really sought from the trial they said was an acceleration of restrictions at the state level to effectively end legal abortion  Justice was served to Kermit Gosnell today and he will pay the price for the atrocities he committed Ilyse Hogue president of Naral ProChoice America said in a statement Antichoice politicians and their unrelenting efforts to deny women access to safe and legal abortion care will only drive more women to backalley butchers like Kermit Gosnell In recent weeks the case was cited in Congress to support restricting abortions past 20 weeks of pregnancy and it was invoked by an antiabortion political action committee in radio ads to attack the Democratic candidate for governor of Virginia Terry McAuliffe Although the trial has not brought new issues or tactics to Americas longrunning abortion wars it provided an emotional jolt through five weeks of graphic testimony and an earlier grand jury report This is a visual argument that no one would ever want to have said Marjorie Dannenfelser president of the Susan B Anthony List which works to elect women opposed to abortion But if were going to have it lets go ahead and have it What are the limits What are we as a society willing to forbear She and others predicted greater support for laws banning abortions past 20 weeks which have been adopted in several states in recent years on the disputed theory that fetuses of that age feel pain Dr Gosnell was found guilty of 24 counts of performing an abortion beyond 24 weeks the limit in Pennsylvania Opponents of the restrictions argue that later abortions are very rare fewer than 13 percent are past 20 weeks of gestation according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention Abortion rights activists say restrictions before fetal viability generally 24 weeks violate the constitutional protections of Roe v Wade  Nonetheless the imagery of later abortion is very powerful said Elizabeth Nash state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute a research group that supports abortion access In 2010 Nebraska banned abortion at 20 weeks postfertilization she said That bill was seen as the type of bill that was going to catch fire across the country It did Dr Gosnell was also convicted of involuntary manslaughter in the death of a 41yearold patient Karnamaya Mongar who died of an overdose of sedatives Among lesser charges he was found guilty of 211 counts of not waiting 24 hours after consulting with a patient before performing an abortion Activists on both sides debated whether the deplorable conditions at Dr Gosnells clinic  including broken equipment bloodstained recovery chairs and an untrained staff giving anesthesia and other drugs  could be found at other clinics  Antiabortion groups cited the case to press for more regulations of clinics By pulling back the secrecy that cloaks this industry that preys on womens misery we have a real agenda moving forward said Charmaine Yoest the president of Americans United for Life which pushes for stricter clinic rules  But abortion rights groups attacked the regulations as a backdoor route to shut clinics by requiring costly but medically unneeded upgrades like wider hallways and bigger closets Whats going on with these laws is really about the agenda of having abortion eventually made illegal again said Nancy Northup president of the Center for Reproductive Rights in Washington which has challenged the laws in court And if that were to happen unfortunately youd have a lot more Gosnells out there The scathing grand jury report in 2011 on Dr Gosnells clinic the Womens Medical Society on Lancaster Avenue detailed how despite complaints and malpractice suits no inspector had visited in 16 years The clinic was raided only after a tip that it operated as an illegal prescription mill A month after the report Gov Tom Corbett fired six employees of the Health and State departments  In the witness box clinic employees said live births occurred regularly and they believed Dr Gosnells explanation for snipping necks with surgical scissors  to ensure fetal demise  was accepted practice in lateterm abortions An abortion doctor who testified for the prosecution said such practice was unheard of One witness Steven Massof testifying under a plea agreement to avoid firstdegree murder charges instructed jurors to feel the backs of their own necks and said Its like a beheading  Another former employee Adrienne Moton sobbed as she described the death of Baby A aborted when his teenage mother was about 29 weeks pregnant Ms Moton was so upset she took a cellphone photograph of him which was shown in court She said Dr Gosnell had joked that the baby was big enough to walk to a bus stop  Ms Moton who also testified under a plea agreement said she cut the neck of Baby D who was delivered into a toilet while its mother given a large dose of a drug to dilate the cervix waited for Dr Gosnell to arrive  Another clinic worker said she followed Dr Gosnells instructions and cut the neck of Baby C after it moved an arm The doctor told her was an involuntary movement  Dr Gosnell was originally charged with seven counts of firstdegree murder but Judge Jeffrey P Minehart of Common Pleas Court earlier threw out three other cases of infants said to have been born alive known as Baby B Baby F and Baby G  Several weeks into the trial which began March 18 antiabortion activists and some conservative commentators accused the national news media of skipping it a charge amplified across social media On April 15 President Obamas spokesman was asked if he was following the trial The president is aware of the case said Jay Carney the White House spokesman  Even as reporters from national newspapers arrived in Courtroom 304 of the Criminal Justice Center a blog war continued between abortionrights supporters who had written of Dr Gosnells abuses from the time of his indictment and conservatives who continued to fault broadcast television for a blackout On Monday there were 29 reporters in the courtroom and a row of television crews on the sidewalk 
"In Abortion Protests, Which to Protect, Children or Speech?",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/us/church-suit-says-abortion-protest-upset-children.html,WASHINGTON  Kenneth T Scott opposes abortion and he says so in public Sometimes he holds up large pictures of aborted fetuses Sometimes he makes his points near churches that he believes are not doing enough to combat abortion A couple of years ago the Supreme Court ruled that hateful antigay protests at military funerals deserved First Amendment protection It will soon decide whether to hear a sequel this one involving Mr Scott On Palm Sunday in 2005 he and other protesters turned up near an Episcopal church in Denver As the parishioners reenacted Jesus entry into Jerusalem in an outdoor ceremony Mr Scott stood on a parked car on public property and addressed the procession from about 20 feet away Some observers said he was loud Others said he was screaming He showed large pictures of aborted fetuses About 200 children were present and some of them became upset The church sued and a Colorado court issued an order barring Mr Scott from engaging in various kinds of disruptive conduct near the church when services are under way Most of the restrictions were not based on what he had to say Those parts of the order were as lawyers would put it content neutral But one part of the order raises a difficult First Amendment question It bars Mr Scott from displaying large posters or similar displays depicting gruesome images of mutilated fetuses or dead bodies in a manner reasonably likely to be viewed by children under 12 In a candid ruling last year the Colorado Court of Appeals said the order was meant to suppress Mr Scotts speech based on its content something the government can do only if it has an exceptionally good reason There was such a reason here the court said a compelling government interest in protecting children from disturbing images The court noted in passing that the ban might seem to bar some depictions of the crucifixion In urging the justices not to hear the case the church St Johns Church in the Wilderness said it had no interest in suppressing petitioners message and just wanted to let its parishioners pray and worship in peace The congregation could not pray and participate meaningfully in the Palm Sunday service without being forced to view gruesome images the brief said Mr Scott is represented by Eugene Volokh a prominent First Amendment specialist at the University of California Los Angeles Religious institutions like other institutions that play an important role in spreading ideas are often fitting targets for criticism he wrote in his petition seeking Supreme Court review Nailing 95 theses to a church door might today be a technical trespass he said referring to the manifesto from Martin Luther that helped spark the Reformation But displaying signs containing those theses on a nearby sidewalk has to be constitutionally protected Lower courts have issued conflicting rulings about whether pictures of aborted fetuses may be banned from public places because they disturb children In 2008 for instance the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco considered what to do about a truck that displayed enlarged graphic photographs of earlyterm aborted fetuses around the perimeter of a public middle school Some students started crying others discussed throwing rocks at the truck The appeals court said that none of that mattered and that it would be an unprecedented departure from bedrock First Amendment principles to allow the government to restrict speech based on listener reaction simply because the listeners are children The Wyoming Supreme Court by contrast last year said the constitutionality of a court order banning the display of disturbing images of aborted and dismembered fetuses turned on evidence concerning the injury or potential injury to children from viewing the images The United States Supreme Court has endorsed different standards where children are involved only for materials concerning sex or that are broadcast over the airwaves In 2011 the court refused to go further striking down a California law that barred the sale of violent video games to minors Professor Volokh said that allowing the presence of children to limit what adults may see could justify all sorts of pernicious restrictions on speech Mr Scotts images he added provided valuable information to young people Regrettably many American girls are getting pregnant and participating in the making of decisions about abortion even in their teens he told the justices adding Children must be allowed the freedom to form their moral religious and political views about abortion on the basis of uncensored speech before they reach the age when they have to decide whether to have an abortion Mr Scotts petition in the case Scott v St Johns Church in the Wilderness No 121077 Â is supported by an impressive array of First Amendment lawyers and scholars including Floyd Abrams Jack M Balkin David D Cole Sanford Levinson Geoffrey Stone and Nadine Strossen Many of them are liberals who support abortion rights The decision below represents a startling and dangerous departure from fundamental First Amendment doctrine the brief said The Constitution does not permit the government to restrict speech because it offends or disturbs others A second supporting brief from religion scholars was critical of Mr Scott for his incivility But this is not a case for Miss Manners it said A third one from art historians traced how disturbing images have shaped public understanding of conflicts from the Civil War to Iraq Photographs of abuses at Abu Ghraib prison for instance are incontrovertibly gruesome and to say

What the Gosnell Case Doesnâ€™t Mean,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/14/what-the-gosnell-case-doesnt-tell-us/,"A jury in Philadelphia on Monday convicted Kermit Gosnell a doctor who clearly
                                        does not deserve that title before his name of three counts of firstdegree murder The details of the crimes are horrific  Mr Gosnell conducted illegal lateterm abortions past the 24week mark which in some cases resulted in live births Dr Gosnell then instructed his employees to plunge
                                        scissors into the babies necks to kill them These acts were illegal not just under Pennsylvania law but also under the framework established by Roe v Wade which said that states and the federal government may not prohibit a woman from choosing to have an abortion
                                        prior to viability meaning potentially able to live outside the mothers womb albeit with artificial aid The date of viability is a matter of controversy But Mr
                                        Gosnells actions dont seem to have fallen into a grey area he was stepping over an established line
                                         Moreover lateterm abortions illegal or not are rare The Times story on Gosnell notes that fewer than 13 percent of abortions are past 20 weeks gestation For these reasons the Gosnell case does not really speak to the broader abortion debate Ive said this before
                                        Of course that wont stop antiabortion groups from drawing the connection for their own ideological purposes They have already done so using the case in their effort to move the commonly defined date of
                                        viability from 24 weeks to 20 weeks or even earlier The attempt to limit the abortion window is part of a larger push to prevent women from exercising their reproductive rights  unnecessary waiting periods physically intrusive sonograms onerous requirements
                                        for doctors who perform abortions and so on Some extremists have committed murder in their supposed campaign for life Antiabortion groups dont seem to care that in their struggle against Planned Parenthood
                                        for instance they are also cutting off poor women from basic health care services that have nothing to do with abortions  like cancer screening prenatal care and family planning No one is arguing that lateterm abortions should be common practice and theyre not No one except I suppose his defense attorney is arguing that what Mr Gosnell was convicted of doing was anything other
                                        than a crime But if antiabortion activists get their way  and lets not doubt that the ultimate goal is to deny women the right to choose under virtually any set of circumstance  Gosnelltype stories wont
                                        disappear If abortion were illegal women wouldnt stop having abortions theyd just have trouble accessing medically safe abortions Many would resort to unscrupulous doctors who operate
                                        in unsanitary conditions like Mr Gosnell"
Doctor Avoids Death Penalty in Murders at His Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/us/doctor-avoids-death-penalty-in-murders-at-clinic.html,Kermit Gosnell the doctor convicted of murdering babies after failed abortions in his Philadelphia clinic avoided the death penalty on Tuesday by agreeing to a sentence of life in prison without parole  Dr Gosnell 72 waived his right to appeal three firstdegree murder convictions handed down Monday and he was immediately sentenced in two of the cases known as Baby C and Baby D the Philadelphia district attorney R Seth Williams announced Dr Gosnell who did not testify during his fiveweek trial will be sentenced Wednesday on the remaining convictions including a third murder case that of Baby A and manslaughter in the death of a 41yearold patient who received a fatal dose of anesthesia Prosecutors had said from the start of the trial that they would seek the death penalty because of the aggravated circumstances of the crimes Dr Gosnell was charged with murder of more than one person and the young age of the victims  But the district attorneys willingness to compromise on a lifewithoutparole sentence seemed a calculation about the difficulty of persuading the same 12 jurors to agree on capital punishment after they spent 10 days sifting evidence and acquitted Dr Gosnell on one firstdegree murder charge Before deliberations began the judge dismissed charges in three other pregnancy terminations  The trial included graphic testimony that galvanized debate over abortion far beyond the downtown Philadelphia courthouse Dr Gosnells lawyer Jack McMahon argued that in each case the fetus was dead before delivery But jurors heard testimony from clinic workers who described babies moving after botched abortions and told how Dr Gosnell and in some cases the workers themselves cut the babies necks with scissors  The case drew wide attention from antiabortion activists for whom it illustrated the need for much tighter regulation of clinics and more important what they consider the immorality of all abortion  Abortion rights groups were equally adamant in condemning Dr Gosnell But they drew an opposite conclusion abortion must be safe and available they said or desperate women will be driven to other backalley practitioners like Dr Gosnell
Archbishop Presses Cuomo Over Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/15/nyregion/dolan-presses-cuomo-over-abortion.html,ALBANY  Cardinal Timothy M Dolan declined on Tuesday to say whether Gov Andrew M Cuomo was a Catholic in good standing as he ratcheted up his criticism of the governors continued advocacy for abortion rights I dont mind telling you thats one of the things the governor and I talk about Cardinal Dolan said in a radio interview with Fredric U Dicker a columnist for The New York Post on Mr Dickers radio talk show on WGDJAM Look he and I have very grave differences and this is one of them  Cardinal Dolan the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York added that he appreciated the governors company Ive always welcomed his visits and his conversations the cardinal said before adding that he had to be cautious about disclosing the contents of his pastoral discussions even with the governor I dont like to blab that on the radio  But he was clear that the issue of the governors Catholicism had been discussed Thats something that I talk turkey with him about the cardinal said Ill just leave it at that  Asked for his reaction at a news conference later in the day Mr Cuomo a Democrat was brief The archbishop has mentioned his opposition to the choice law multiple times he said The Catholic Church has made their opposition to choice known for many many many many many years So theres nothing new to that The Catholic Church has had differences with Mr Cuomo in the past particularly over his successful advocacy for the legalization of samesex marriage and in 2011 a Vatican consultant suggested that Mr Cuomo should be denied communion because he lives with his girlfriend the Food Network personality Sandra Lee Church leaders have also praised Mr Cuomo on occasion particularly for his advocacy of gun control  Cardinal Dolan said there were parts of Mr Cuomos agenda that he supported including most of the governors proposed 10point Womens Equality Act  However the Catholic Church opposes a crucial element of the equality proposal which would codify in state law abortionrights regulations that now exist only in federal law  It just strikes me as a supreme oxymoron that more abortions would be thought of as womens health Cardinal Dolan said I mean half the babies aborted are women So how does this help them
Archbishop Clarifies Remarks About Cuomo,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/nyregion/cardinal-dolan-clarifies-remarks-about-cuomo.html,ALBANY  Cardinal Timothy M Dolan did not intend to question Gov Andrew M Cuomos standing in the Roman Catholic Church despite the governors support for abortion rights the cardinals spokesman said on Wednesday The spokesman Joseph Zwilling was seeking to clarify comments the cardinal made in a radio interview on Tuesday when the cardinal said in response to a question about Mr Cuomos standing in the church that thats one of the things the governor and I talk about But on Wednesday Mr Zwilling said that the cardinal who is the archbishop of New York would not and did not suggest the governor might not be a Catholic in good standing going forward Mr Zwilling also said that another of Cardinal Dolans remarks  Thats something that I talk turkey with him about  was meant to address the issue of abortion not the governors faith I do realize that was part of the question he was asked and so I do understand how the answer could have been misinterpreted Mr Zwilling said in an email But I assure you that was not what the cardinal was saying Governor Cuomo has been criticized by Cardinal Dolan and other Catholic bishops for an element of his proposed Womens Equality Act which would codify existing federal protections for abortion in state law And on that issue at least there seemed to be no confusion on Wednesday He and the governor have very different positions on abortion Mr Zwilling said And he has been forthright with the governor on the matter in public and in private
Doctor Starts His Life Term in Grisly Abortion Clinic Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/us/kermit-gosnell-abortion-doctor-gets-life-term.html,PHILADELPHIA  Dr Kermit Gosnell was sentenced on Wednesday to life in prison without parole for the murder of a baby born alive in a botched abortion who prosecutors said would have survived if the doctor had not snipped its neck with scissors The sentence was part of an agreement that Dr Gosnell reached with the Philadelphia district attorneys office under which he waives his right to appeal the firstdegree murder conviction and two others that a jury returned on Monday  Under the agreement Dr Gosnell 72 will be spared the death penalty which prosecutors previously said they would seek Dr Gosnell in a dark suit similar to one he wore throughout his fiveweek trial declined an offer by Judge Jeffrey P Minehart of Common Pleas Court to speak to the court before being sentenced After he was told that he would spend the rest of his life in prison without parole for the murder of a victim known as Baby A Dr Gosnell shook hands with his lawyer Jack J McMahon and was escorted out of the courtroom to begin his sentence Dr Gosnell was also sentenced to a total of 30 to 60 years on two charges of conspiring to kill two of the babies and on one charge of violating the corrupt organizations act which has to do with ordering subordinates to commit crimes And he was sentenced to two and a half to five years on involuntary manslaughter in the case of Karnamaya Mongar a woman who died after being given too much anesthetic in Dr Gosnells West Philadelphia abortion clinic  Outside the courthouse members of the jury spoke publicly for the first time The foreman David Misko said it had been emotionally hard for the jurors seven women and five men to deal with the trials gruesome images and searing testimony It was emotionally tolling for everyone involved he said Asked what had led the jury to convict Dr Gosnell on three counts of firstdegree murder Mr Misko said Premeditation It was business as usual He snipped the necks no matter what Mr Misko 27 who works for a health care company said he had been offended by Dr Gosnells expression during the trial He just sat there smirking Mr Misko said It wasnt good I didnt care for it Sarah Glinski one of three jurors who appeared before the news media after the trial said she believed that Dr Gosnell had started his clinic with good intentions of helping women who had little ability to afford abortions but that he had gone wrong along the way He is an abortion doctor who tried to give people who may not have had the money the services they needed said Ms Glinski a public affairs officer with the Defense Department I think somewhere something went wrong in his mind that made him do these things to these children that were born alive Ms Glinski 23 said she believed in a womans right to choose whether to have an abortion but added That doesnt mean I dont believe in the sanctity of life She does not have children which she said had made it easier to take a detached view of the evidence but she concluded that the acts Dr Gosnell were convicted of were evil It was hard for me to admit that this kind of evil exists in this world she said Another juror Joseph Carroll 46 said he might need to seek counseling after hearing all the evidence and seeing disturbing images of aborted fetuses and of the squalid conditions and grisly items in Dr Gosnells clinic including jars of fetuses feet discovered by law enforcement officers during a drug raid in 2010 The Philadelphia district attorney R Seth Williams said the Gosnell case was probably the most gruesome he had dealt with since becoming district attorney three years ago I will not mince my words Kermit Gosnell is a monster Mr Williams said after the sentencing Any doctor who cuts into the necks severing the spinal cords of living breathing babies who would survive with proper medical attention is a murderer and a monster But Dr Gosnells lawyer Mr McMahon reiterated his defense that his client had snipped the necks only of fetuses that were already dead He believes he never killed a live baby Mr McMahon told reporters The jury has made its decision on what happened here We respect it but that doesnt mean its the truth

                                        hardly calculated to make me reach for my checkbook Open Border Liberals will be the winner as they want nothing more than to get rid of a tough Arizona Sheriff that will never back down Before the 80yearold sheriff won national fame for exercising self help in enforcing his own personal immigration policy he was known for his punitive attitude toward prison inmates in his custody In 2004 the American
                                        Civil Liberties Union sued him over the obstacle he placed in the path of pregnant prisoners seeking to exercise their right to abortion Even when the prisoners offered to pay for their transportation and security
                                        as well as for the abortions the sheriff required the women to obtain a court order directing him to provide the transportation  When an Arizona appeals court ruled that this unwritten policy amounted to an
                                        unconstitutional burden on the right to abortion Mr Arpaio appealed to the Supreme Court In March 2008 the court turned him down and let the state courts ruling stand The ACLU had to threaten him
                                        with contempt proceedings to get him to comply with the court order As I was pondering Sheriff Arpaios mysterious letter as well as his impact on the countrys public life the news broke that the Colorado Legislature had given final approval                                        to a law permitting undocumented residents of the state to obtain drivers licenses Colorado will join a handful of other states including New Mexico Washington Oregon Illinois and Maryland that have
                                        taken this step to enable immigrants to come out of the shadows and drive lawfully once they pass an ordinary driving test  Connecticuts legislative leaders and governor have endorsed similar legislation which is expected to pass soon there Why do we even ask where somebody is coming from Connecticuts governor
                                        Dannel P Malloy asked at a news conference in Hartford last month The important thing the governor added was to make sure that our highways and byways are being driven by people who have a skills set
                                        necessary to drive on our roads Rhode Island may soon join the list as well Whats the connection between Sheriff Arpaio and the drivers license developments Simply this the states turn on drivers licenses suggests that the sheriff representing for so long
                                        the leading edge of antiimmigrant political activism may by now have become the trailing edge He once embodied public anger about the countrys porous borders a rage that seemed to freeze out common sense

                                        rising power of the Latino vote And of course the effort may yet crumble in a dysfunctional Congress That makes all the more significant whats happening in the states Consider that Gov Martin OMalley of Maryland who signed that states new drivers license bill a few weeks ago had blocked such a measure in 2008 saying then that no one should be able to drive
                                        in Maryland without proof of legal residency  Consider what happened in 2007 when Gov Eliot Spitzer of New York announced that the state as a matter of executivebranch policy would begin offering licenses to undocumented residents The immediate pushback was
                                        tremendous and Governor Spitzer abandoned his plan two months later You dont need
                                        a stethoscope to hear the heartbeat of the public on this one he said at the time  While New York politicians havent yet mustered the courage to tackle the issue again its clear that the antiimmigrant spasm that seized the country after 911 has eased Republican efforts last month
                                        to exploit the foreign origins of the Boston Marathon bombers achieved no traction Im too far away from Arizona politics to guess whether those seeking to oust Sheriff Arpaio will get enough signatures
                                        by the end of this month to place the recall effort on the ballot But its worth noting that in 2011 the states voters surprised nearly everyone by recalling the president of the state Senate Russell

North Dakotaâ€™s Sole Abortion Clinic Sues to Block New Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/us/north-dakotas-sole-abortion-clinic-sues-to-block-new-law.html,The running battle over the regulation of abortions entered a North Dakota courtroom on Wednesday as the states sole abortion clinic sued to block a new law that it says could force it to shut down  The law requiring doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital was promoted by antiabortion legislators who argued that it would mean better care for women who suffer medical emergencies  The Red River Womens Clinic in Fargo relies on doctors who are licensed in North Dakota but fly in from out of state to perform abortions Its director said that in the rare event of serious complications women would be rushed to a hospital for appropriate care whether or not the clinic doctor had admitting privileges  Its purpose is to shut down the clinic the sole abortion facility in the state the suit alleges of the law which is scheduled to take effect on Aug 1 The suit filed in a state district court on behalf of the clinic by the Center for Reproductive Rights says the law would pose an unconstitutional infringement on the right to abortion  A similar law in Mississippi which could force that states only abortion clinic to close because it too relies on traveling doctors has been blocked by a federal court pending a final ruling  Arizona Kansas and Tennessee also require that abortion providers have local admitting privileges and at least one clinic in Knoxville Tenn shut down as a result But these states have multiple abortion providers that continue to operate  The law on hospital privileges was one of several abortion measures adopted in North Dakota in April including the countrys most stringent which bars abortions at six weeks of pregnancy  That ban according to legal experts violates Supreme Court rulings which give a woman a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb usually at around 24 weeks and may be declared unconstitutional The Center for Reproductive Rights based in New York said it planned to file a challenge before Aug 1  But even if the states early ban is thrown out the requirement of hospital privileges could effectively end abortion rights in North Dakota said Tammi Kromenaker director of the Red River Clinic The clinic performs abortions only up to the 16th week of pregnancy The visiting doctors are unlikely to gain privileges at Fargos three hospitals Ms Kromenaker said which include a veterans hospital one with Roman Catholic affiliations and one that requires a doctor to admit at least five patients a year A doctor who had to admit five abortion patients in a year would not be working at this clinic Ms Kromenaker said She said that since the clinic began operating in 1998 performing thousands of abortions only one patient had required an ambulance ride to an emergency room and that there had been no deaths  Denise M Burke vice president of legal affairs for Americans United for Life which has promoted tighter abortion rules around the country countered that admitting privileges could affect safety  The doctor with direct knowledge of the patient can ensure better care in the ER and can continue to be involved with her care in the hospital she said 
Texas: Investigation of Abortion Doctor,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/16/us/texas-investigation-of-abortion-doctor.html,The Harris County district attorneys office said Wednesday that it would investigate charges that a Houston doctor had delivered live babies during thirdtrimester abortions and killed them after they emerged which federal and state laws forbid The antiabortion group Operation Rescue made the charges based on statements by three former employees of the abortion doctor Douglas Karpen which could not be independently verified The organization said the doctors actions echoed the charges that led to the murder conviction of Dr Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia Lt Gov David Dewhurst said he had read the allegations with disgust and called for a full investigation 
Abortion Law in Arkansas Is Blocked by U.S. Judge,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/us/abortion-law-in-arkansas-is-blocked-by-us-judge.html,A federal judge on Friday temporarily blocked enforcement of one of the countrys most stringent abortion laws an Arkansas ban on the procedure at the 12th week of pregnancy saying the law was likely to be declared unconstitutional Adopted in March the law was the sharpest challenge yet to the standard set by the Supreme Court Roe v Wade in 1973 and later decisions determined that a woman has a right to an abortion up to the point that a fetus is viable outside the womb usually around 24 weeks Abortion rights groups quickly brought a legal challenge resulting in Fridays preliminary injunction which was issued by Judge Susan Webber Wright of Federal District Court in Little Rock The injunction will prevent the law from taking effect on its scheduled date of Aug 16 and will remain in place until the judge hears final arguments and rules on its constitutionality  Also in March North Dakota passed an even more restrictive law banning abortions at the sixth week of pregnancy which is before many women even know they are pregnant The Center for Reproductive Rights a New Yorkbased group that challenged the Arkansas law along with the American Civil Liberties Union said it planned to file a plea in North Dakota to block that law before it takes effect on Aug 1  In both states the sharp time limits were linked by legislators to the detection of fetal heartbeats They were the first victories for an impatient faction of the antiabortion movement that wants to strike major blows against abortion rather than chipping away at Roe v Wade with less sweeping rules that are more likely to pass constitutional muster  Their hope dismissed as wishful thinking by many established leaders of the antiabortion movement like National Right to Life and the Roman Catholic Church is that the Supreme Court might be willing to adopt a radical new framework for regulating abortion  Arguing against the preliminary injunction on Friday lawyers for Arkansas claimed it was too early to pass judgment on the law because it had not taken effect They also said the law was true to the spirit of Supreme Court rulings because it would permit a large majority of abortions which already occur before 12 weeks to proceed and would encourage pregnant women and doctors to seek earlier safer and more humane abortions But the judge as expected by many legal experts agreed with the challengers statement that the US Supreme Court has held unequivocally that a state may not ban abortion prior to viability State Senator Jason Rapert the author of the 12week ban said Friday that he was obviously disappointed by the injunction He said he hoped the court before making a final decision would allow new arguments and evidence from a coalition of conservative legal groups  Even without the law Arkansas now has one of the countrys strictest abortion limits In another law passed this spring that took effect immediately it became one of 10 states to ban abortions at 20 weeks These measures also appear to violate the Supreme Courts viability threshold and have been blocked in a few states but no legal challenge has been filed in Arkansas 
Massachusetts G.O.P. Hopes Lightning Strikes Again in Senate Race,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/21/us/politics/massachusetts-gop-again-seeks-senate-seat-left-by-democrat.html,BOSTON  The major political question here is whether Representative Edward J Markey a longtime member of Congress whose liberal views generally reflect those of Massachusetts voters could actually lose the special election for the Senate seat vacated this year by John Kerry Mr Markey 66 who was first elected to Congress in 1976 is facing Gabriel Gomez 47 a Republican and untested political newcomer Mr Gomez has no policy experience but offers a compelling life story that includes service as a member of the Navy SEALs and a fighter pilot a biography that he puts forth at every opportunity as he campaigns in his olivedrab bomber jacket Even asking whether a Republican could beat a Democrat in deep blue Massachusetts might sound preposterous except that it happened three years ago The circumstances in 2010 when Scott P Brown won a special Senate election after the death of Senator Edward M Kennedy were different  voters were agitated the Senate was closely divided the Democrats were asleep at the switch But it taught everyone here never to say never Its unlikely but plausible said Jeffrey M Berry a political scientist at Tufts University Markey comes across as someone who has been in Washington a long long time and the theme that its time for a fresh face is appealing to voters The polls so far have been all over the map but all of them have showed Mr Markey leading The wide variations are due not only to different methodologies but also to the difficulties in predicting who will vote on June 25 in a special election that is expected to have a very low turnout But the Markey campaign has seized on the polls that show the race almost neck and neck in hopes of injecting a sense of urgency among the troops and prodding donors to open their wallets Those in the Gomez campaign have seized on those same polls as well mainly as evidence that theirs is not a lost cause  But some of Mr Gomezs potential donors say that while the polls may suggest the race is competitive they are waiting to see whether it is winnable Were watching the race closely but are not committed to a course of action said Jonathan Collegio a spokesman for American Crossroads the super PAC founded by Karl Rove President George W Bushs chief strategist For a Senate race to be winnable for Republicans in Massachusetts you need to have the trifecta of a great candidate a weak opponent and a perfect environment that brings independents to the polls for Republicans Mr Collegio said While the first two elements may be in place he said it is not yet clear whether the controversies brewing in Washington particularly involving the Internal Revenue Service will develop into something that galvanizes voters The atmosphere in Washington is beginning to decisively turn against the Obama administration he said Were waiting to see if that flows out into real America One Republican not waiting is Senator John McCain of Arizona who on Monday visited a VFW hall in Bostons Dorchester neighborhood with Mr Gomez and helped him raise money later at a hotel reception where top donors paid as much as 37600 to sit for a roundtable discussion In Dorchester Mr McCain praised Mr Gomez as part of the next generation of leaders and said he would work in a bipartisan manner in Congress including on such issues as immigration  But in the midst of his praise Mr McCain added a reality check Lets have a little straight talk he said invoking the signature line from his 2008 presidential campaign This is a tough fight Hes the underdog now Were close but hes down OK It will come down to who gets out the vote That is true in any election of course but especially true in elections with low turnouts The rule of thumb here is that the lower the turnout the more Republicans benefit because Democrats are less likely on their own to go to the polls Given that tendency and the history with the 2010 special election the state Democratic Party is already conducting a fullcourt press with phone banks and door knocks to get out the vote next month Michelle Obama is scheduled to help Mr Markey raise money here on May 29 and many expect President Obama  who beat Mr McCain here in 2008 by 26 percentage points  to campaign for him closer to the election Markey has some builtin advantages said Mary Anne Marsh a Bostonbased Democratic consultant not affiliated with the Markey campaign Voter sentiment is with him demographics registration getting independents and coming off a successful election for Elizabeth Warren and Obama last year But this is an election at the end of June where the only people who will vote are the ones you drag to the polls Mr Markey is essentially running on his record of consistent liberal votes over almost four decades and he will be banking on traditional Democratic allies like labor unions as well as environmental groups and those that favor abortion rights to campaign on his behalf The thrust of Mr Gomezs message is that he wants to reboot Congress he has pledged to stay in the Senate for only two sixyear terms He has said he is personally opposed to abortion but would not seek to overturn abortion rights He supports the current bill to expand background checks for people buying guns but he opposes a ban on assault weapons which Mr Markey supports The two are to meet in their first debate on June 5 The total sums that each candidate has raised will not be known until later in June when they file their financial reports But Mr Markey began with about four times as much cash as Mr Gomez  Rob Gray a Bostonbased Republican consultant who is not affiliated with the Gomez campaign said that Mr Markey is still in pretty good shape partly because Mr Gomez had not yet raised enough money for negative television ads against him But he said national Republicans are putting out feelers on the race and trying to decide the costbenefit of getting involved Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas who is the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee said that his analysis of the polling data and discussions with Mr Gomez and others led him to conclude that the race is clearly winnable We intend to participate to the fullest extent possible and legally permissible he said though he declined to say how much money the national party would put in and how it would be used If Mr Gomez cannot raise enough money to win in June he may at least have bought himself enough name recognition to start from a better position next year when the winner of the special election will have to run for a full term
Arizona Law on Abortions Struck Down as Restrictive,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/us/arizonas-ban-on-abortions-struck-down-in-federal-court.html,A federal appellate panel struck down Arizonas abortion law on Tuesday saying it was unconstitutional under a long line of invariant Supreme Court precedents that guarantee a womans right to end a pregnancy any time before a fetus is deemed viable outside her womb  generally at 24 weeks The law enacted in April 2012 despite vociferous protest by womens and civil rights groups made abortions illegal if performed 20 weeks after a womans last menstrual period or roughly 18 weeks after fertilization even if the woman learned that the fetus had no chance of surviving after birth At 18 weeks many fetal abnormalities can be detected through sonograms In its opinion the panel of three judges assigned to the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit in San Francisco wrote that a fetuss viability varies from pregnancy to pregnancy which should be determined by doctors not legislators While the state may regulate the model and manner of abortion prior to fetal viability it may not proscribe a woman from electing abortion nor may it impose an undue burden on her choice through regulation wrote Judge Marsha S Berzon the opinions author The American Civil Liberties Union and other organizations challenged the law in federal court last year on behalf of three physicians and their patients On Tuesday Talcott Camp deputy director of the ACLUs reproductive freedom project welcomed the courts opinion Politicians do not have the right to interfere in serious and personal decisions that should only be made by a woman with the help of her family and her doctor she said In arguments Nov 5 the defendants  the states attorney general Tom Horne the Maricopa County attorney Bill Montgomery and the Arizona Medical Board  said the laws main purpose was to protect a mothers health and shield fetuses from pain Mr Montgomery in a statement said he would seek review from the Supreme Court given the compelling and important interest Arizona has in protecting the health and wellbeing of expectant mothers from the dangers of abortions after 20 weeks and to protect children in the womb from needless and horrific imposition of pain Arizona is one of 10 states to pass an abortion ban at 20 weeks based on theory rejected by many medical groups that a fetus feels pain then Many of those bans have not yet been challenged Dan Pochoda legal director of Arizonas chapter of the ACLU called the ruling the strongest and most definitive so far on recent laws placing restrictive limits on abortions The decision applies to Arizona and the eight other Western states under the Ninth Circuits jurisdiction including Idaho where similar legislation had already been deemed unconstitutional North Dakota which falls under the authority of a different appellate court passed the countrys most farreaching abortion law in March banning women from terminating a pregnancy once a fetal heartbeat is detectable which can be as early as six weeks into a pregnancy A ban at 12 weeks in Arkansas has been blocked by court because it violates the viability rule
Chinaâ€™s Brutal One-Child Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/22/opinion/chinas-brutal-one-child-policy.html,LONDON  ZHANG YIMOU the celebrated film director and arranger of the 2008 Summer Olympics opening ceremony in Beijing was accused last week of being the latest highprofile violator of Chinas onechild policy The Peoples Daily the Communist Party mouthpiece alleged that Mr Zhang had fathered seven children with four different women The news has ignited an angry online debate with Internet users condemning the unequal application of a 1979 law that stipulates every couple may have just one child or two for ethnic minorities and for rural couples whose first child is a girl The truth is for the rich the law is a paper tiger easily circumvented by paying a social compensation fee  a fine of 3 to 10 times a households annual income set by each provinces family planning bureau or by traveling to Hong Kong Singapore or even America to give birth For the poor however the policy is a fleshandblood tiger with claws and fangs In the countryside where the need for extra hands to help in the fields and the deeply entrenched patriarchal desire for a male heir have created strong resistance to population control measures the tiger has been merciless  Village familyplanning officers vigilantly chart the menstrual cycle and pelvicexam results of every woman of childbearing age in their area If a woman gets pregnant without permission and is unable to pay the often exorbitant fine for violating the policy she risks being subjected to a forced abortion  According to Chinese Health Ministry data released in March 336 million abortions and 222 million sterilizations have been carried out since 1971 Though the onechild policy was introduced in 1979 other lessstringent family planning policies were in place before it These figures are easy to quote but they fail to convey the magnitude of the horror faced by rural Chinese women During a long journey through the hinterlands of southwest China in 2009 I was able to find some of the faces behind these numbers  On ramshackle barges moored on the remote waterways of Hubei and Guangxi I met hundreds of familyplanning fugitives  couples whod fled their villages to give birth to an unauthorized second or third child in neighboring provinces Almost every one of the pregnant women I spoke to had suffered a mandatory abortion One woman told me how when she was eight months pregnant with an illegal second child and was unable to pay the 20000 yuan fine about 3200 family planning officers dragged her to the local clinic bound her to a surgical table and injected a lethal drug into her abdomen  For two days she writhed on the table her hands and feet still bound with rope waiting for her body to eject the murdered baby In the final stage of labor a male doctor yanked the dead fetus out by the foot then dropped it into a garbage can She had no money for a cab She had to hobble home blood dripping down her legs and staining her white sandals red It is not surprising that China has the highest rate of female suicide in the world The onechild policy has reduced women to numbers objects a means of production it has denied them control of their bodies and the basic human right to determine freely and responsibly the number and spacing of their children  Baby girls are also victims of the policy Under family pressure to ensure that their only child is a son women often choose to abort baby girls or discard them at birth practices that have skewed Chinas sex ratio to 118 boys for every 100 girls The Communist Party argues that the means justify the ends When Deng Xiaoping and his fellow economic reformers introduced the onechild policy as a temporary measure in 1979 after Maos death and the end of the calamitous Cultural Revolution they claimed that without the onechild policy the economy would falter and the population would explode  Thirtyfour years on despite mounting criticism the Party still clings to it But their argument is based on shoddy science the birthrate already falling before the policy was introduced is now officially 18 or nearer 12 according to independent demographic experts like Yi Fuxian  much lower than the necessary 21 population replacement level Mr Yi and others have warned of Chinas impending demographic disaster a rapidly aging nation that a dwindling work force will be unable to support  Rising incomes and urbanization generally lead to falling birthrates If the onechild policy were scrapped tomorrow most Chinese wouldnt rush to produce as many offspring as Zhang Yimou And despite recent signals that the Party might be considering gradually relaxing birth restrictions there is still considerable resistance  Stubborn hardliners will not willingly abandon population control measures that have provided the government with an estimated two trillion yuan in revenue from fines according to the demographer He Yafu while allowing it to maintain firm control over peoples lives Â  The public outrage voiced against Mr Zhang during the last week plays into the Partys hands Instead of attacking the governments barbaric policy the people are being encouraged to criticize the rich for escaping its claws  Ending this scourge is a moral imperative The atrocities committed in the name of the onechild policy over the last three decades rank among the worst crimes against humanity of the last century The stains it has left on China may never be erased
"On Eve of Vote, Boy Scouts Are Divided Over Accepting Gay Youths",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/us/boy-scouts-to-vote-on-permitting-gay-youths.html,GRAPEVINE Tex  Boy Scout leaders from around the country engulfed in a culture war over homosexuality gathered for a vote here Thursday on a landmark proposal that would permit openly gay youths  but not openly gay adult leaders  to participate in scouting In a secret ballot more than 1400 volunteer leaders from scoutings 270 councils will accept or reject a proposal that has led to strident divisions and debate The emotions were evident Wednesday outside the conference center here in a suburb of Dallas where dozens of conservative Christians many in scout uniforms carried no signs and waved American flags Were trying to uphold traditional values said Bill Lizzio 58 a scout leader who had driven from Tennessee to register his concern Angry parents threatened to pull their sons out of scouting saying they would never let them share a tent with a gay boy  Current and former Boy Scouts who want to end the exclusionary policy including several who were forced out of scouting for being gay gave their own news briefing  David Rice 84 of Petaluma Calif who said he was ejected as a scout leader in 1998 after he publicly advocated including gays said that if scouting did not change with the culture it will be left behind We cannot afford to lose this American icon he said Mythologized by Norman Rockwell and a formative experience for no fewer than 181 NASA astronauts the Boy Scouts have for more than a century been a symbol of an upright America But over the last year the growing public acceptance of homosexuality has collided with the social conservatism of many Boy Scout leaders and parents as well as the churches that sponsor a majority of Cub Scout packs and Boy Scout troops The longstanding policy of barring openly gay members  the Scouts version of dont ask dont tell  has been sharply challenged from outside the organization and from within After publicly wavering which only fueled the divisions Boy Scout executives conducted exhaustive research this spring on member attitudes They devised a plan that they hoped might defuse the debate opening the door to gay youths but keeping it shut for gay adults a step that based on their surveys they feared would cause mass defections  But more conflict appears inevitable no matter which way the vote goes Last week the Connecticut Yankee Council promised it would defy national policy in either case saying it intended to accept gay leaders and would be open to all youths and adults who subscribe to the values of the Scout Oath and Law regardless of their personal sexual orientation The vote Thursday is expected to be close Prospects for passage improved when the Mormon Church the largest single sponsor of scout units indicated support for limited change and the Roman Catholic Church another major sponsor also said that it would not abandon scouting so long as any new policy applied to youths and not leaders Glaad formerly known as the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against Defamation and other rights groups as well as internal advocates said that allowing openly gay youths would be a step in the right direction but only that They vowed to continue with a public campaign against any discrimination Evangelical conservatives the public spearhead of opposition said that even the limited opening being voted on would expose youths to immoral behavior and progay politics ruining a rare bastion of traditional America Allowing openly gay scouts will mean the blunt injection of hypersexuality and gay activism into a youth organization said John Stemberger head of the Florida Family Policy Council a conservative evangelical group Mr Stemberger an Eagle Scout who has crusaded against gay marriage and abortion has sought to mobilize likeminded former scouts with a group called OnMyHonorNet Zach Wahls a 21yearold Eagle Scout who was raised by two mothers and who took this year off college to organize Scouts for Equality called Mr Stembergers fears absurd Being open doesnt mean waving a rainbow flag or advancing some agenda he said It means that two gay parents can feel comfortable going to their sons Eagle Scout Court of Honor Those on both sides predict that once gay scouts are allowed the Scouts will soon be forced to allow gay leaders too whether by lawsuits or the simple lack of logic in forcing a gay Eagle Scout to quit the day he turns 18 The Cub Scouts Boy Scouts Venture Scouts and other branches include more than 26 million youths  down by some 40 percent since the early 1970s They are guided by about one million adult volunteers including parents and many former scouts Arguments over the exclusion of gays have simmered for years and some municipal agencies charities and corporations have ended donations because of it The issue erupted with force last year after a lesbian in Ohio Jennifer Tyrrell was ousted as leader of her 7yearold sons Tiger Cubs den Glaad and other rights groups took up the cause enlisting celebrities like Madonna who wore a Boy Scout uniform to an awards ceremony and publicizing calls for change by corporate executives whose companies embrace gay and lesbian employees Nearly two million people signed online petitions on ChangeOrg calling on the Boy Scouts to end discrimination Over the last few months as the scouts surveyed youths and adults and met with sponsoring religious and civic groups they found divisions by region and age Councils in the Northeast endorsed opening the Scouts to gay leaders as well as youths arguing that a failure to do so would accelerate a death spiral for scouting further alienating younger parents who are the lifeblood of the organization But majorities in the Midwest South and West except for parts of California were against changing policy and were especially hostile to allowing openly gay leaders In conservative forums some people have warned that allowing gay scouts and leaders would lead to more cases of sex abuse The Boy Scouts who have dealt with revelations of abuse by Scout leaders going back decades dismissed that concern in their information package for delegates citing expert opinion and studies showing that gay men are no more likely than others to commit sex abuse In their public statements the Boy Scouts have not clearly explained why they proposed relaxing the policy for youths but not for adults Scout officials who spoke on condition of anonymity concluded that a proposal to allow gay leaders would have no chance of passing and could drive away large numbers of sponsors and conservative parents Some liberal parents and scouts however said they could be driven away if the proposal fails to pass on Thursday Max Sullivan 15 a ninth grader from Gillette Wyo who is working on his Eagle badge in a Mormon troop said he was shocked to learn this year that gay scouts were prohibited  As soon as I learned about it I said I would leave if they did not change their policy he said adding I dont want to be associated with any sort of organization that would be discriminatory Max said that most scouts in his troop disagreed with his stance but that he had the support of his family He will miss scouting he said if Thursdays vote pushes him to quit  I like the kind of skills I learn with scouting and the way that it will look on college applications he said Plus its fun

Abortion After 20 Weeks,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/23/abortion-after-20-weeks/,"On the list of treasured Republican pastimes trying to outlaw abortion and imposing a rightwing agenda on the District of Columbia which is heavily Democratic and lacks any representation in Congress both rank high So it must have given Rep Trent Franks of Arizona special pleasure to combine those hobbies by introducing a bill to ban abortion in DC after 20 weeks But why stop there Late last week according to Think Progress
                                        Mr Franks said that the Kermit Gosnell trial compelled him to amend his bill so it applies to women across the country On Wednesday he held a press conference
                                        dominated by men naturally to promote his bold proposal Mr Franks bill ignores the central principle of the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade decision which is that women have a constitutional right to terminate a pregnancy before viability For
                                        40 years that date has been set roughly at 24 weeks  not because that number sounded good to a random lawmaker but because thats when scientists say a fetus has a good chance of survival outside
                                        of the womb
                                         The 24week rule however has been under heavy assault recently by antiabortion forces who have managed to get several states to pass laws moving the line to 20 weeks or earlier
                                        Thats just one step in the direction of their notsosecret ultimate aim to ban abortions entirely Antiabortion groups have been disturbingly successful in restricting reproductive rights  convincing legislatures to impose a mandatory waiting period after a woman first seeks an abortion require physically
                                        violating and medically unnecessary transvaginal ultrasounds and enact onerous hospitalaffiliation requirements They also have systematically attacked subsidies for cancer screening and family planning programs
                                        for poor women that have nothing to do with abortion The 20week campaign has not been as successful lately thanks to federal courts that still respect Supreme Court decisions Just one day before Mr Franks announced the nationalization of his proposed DC ban the
                                        Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals struck down a 20week law in Arizona The court rejected Arizonas argument that the law was not a ban on abortion but rather a medical regulation because it allowed for medical emergencies That the court said does not transform the law
                                        from a prohibition on abortion into a regulation of abortion procedure Allowing a physician to decide if abortion is medically necessary is not the same as allowing a woman to decide whether to carry her own pregnancy
                                        to term Antiabortion advocates in Arizona immediately derided the decision as coming from a liberal court the Ninth Circuit is based in San Francisco But judges in Idaho and Georgia far more conservative
                                        areas have blocked similar bans"
Texas Lawmakers Put Down Their Swords,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/26/us/texas-83rd-legislative-session-characterized-by-agreement.html,If Texas lessthantheatrical 83rd legislative session is remembered at all it will be known for accords not discord Lawmakers put down their partisan swords to expand financing for water infrastructure womens health public education and the mentally ill steering almost entirely clear of bitter ideological battles over immigration enforcement and abortion The states Republican majority pulled its weight in a few major areas passing legislation requiring drug screening for unemployment benefits and blocking measures opening the door for an expansion of Medicaid the joint state and federal health care program for children the disabled and the very poor under the federal health care overhaul But Republicans themselves warded off some of the sessions most anticipated battles like Senator Dan Patricks school choice effort to finance scholarships so public school students could attend private schools And House Speaker Joe Strauss reluctance to tackle redistricting  though Gov Rick Perry Lt Gov David Dewhurst and Attorney General Greg Abbott wanted to  was an effort to keep Democrats in the fold That effort seems unlikely to last if the governor calls legislators into a special session on the issue Indeed many of the lawmakers hardestfought initiatives this session  preventing wrongful convictions and prosecutorial misconduct overhauling high school diploma requirements and highstakes testing and curbing the authority of regents of the states public university systems  did not fall along party lines Behind the curtain there were many forces at play a more robust state budget the biggest freshman class in years a Republican base just small enough to require allegiances with Democrats or the Tea Party depending on the issue and the soontoberevealed political aspirations of Mr Perry along with the chessboard of elected officials waiting for him to make his move In many ways the most gripping stories of the 2013 legislative session happened outside the House and Senate chambers EMILY RAMSHAW SPECIAL SESSIONS  Special sessions are like Fight Club other than Gov Rick Perry and his trusty dachshund Lucy nobody knows for sure if and when there will be one and nobody knows what it will be about But this being a legislature everyone feels free to speculate Lawmakers have talked among themselves about the possibility for weeks Mr Perry has said he wants lawmakers to address water and transportation issues cut taxes and write a balanced budget that leaves enough money in the Rainy Day Fund to maintain the states tripleA bond rating If they do not complete his wish list he could summon them for a special session on one of those topics As this session came to a close the only open question was whether the tax cuts that were made were big enough to keep the governor happy but a hitch in any of those issues could force lawmakers into overtime A couple of other issues remain A state district judge found Texas financing plan for public schools unconstitutional Lawyers on both sides expect an appeal to the Texas Supreme Court Depending on the content and timing of a ruling by the top court legislators could be forced to return for a special session before their regular session in 2015 to patch the budget Then there is redistricting Attorney General Greg Abbott wants lawmakers to ratify courtdrawn maps that were used in 2012 freeing the state from defending maps drawn by lawmakers in 2011 that are still tangled up in litigation If the governor agrees to go along that could mean a quick special session  perhaps as early as this week And Lt Gov David Dewhurst has a list of special session topics too antiabortion bills drug screenings for welfare recipients and allowing the carrying of concealed firearms in university buildings ROSS RAMSEY SPECIAL INTERESTS  Special interest groups on the far right were a noisy bunch this session but in many ways their bark was worse than their bite When the conservative advocate Michael Quinn Sullivan took aim at an expensive water deal or a transportationfinancing plan that would have raised vehicle registration fees the Tea Party set in the House showed strength in numbers Still the influence of groups like Mr Sullivans Empower Texans and the Texas Public Policy Foundation was mixed particularly when compared with their successes in 2011 Their efforts to keep the Rainy Day Fund intact have failed the legislative budget deal would ask voters to spend 2 billion of it for water projects Any tax relief approved this session will be smaller than they had hoped for While they avoided a Medicaid expansion under the federal health overhaul there has been little movement to formally ask the Obama administration for block grants Other groups had bigger successes Homebuilders who played a key role in blocking immigration enforcement legislation last session helped derail a measure to crack down on worker misclassification and payroll fraud in the construction industry In legislation to prevent wrongful convictions the Texas defense bar successfully removed language requiring defense lawyers to open their files to prosecutors The measure only forces prosecutors to turn their records over to the defense But Texans for Education Reform and Texans Deserve Great Schools two groups that tried to pass school choice legislation underperformed despite hefty spending Although they got the cap on charter schools raised they struggle to find support for a number of other measures on their agendaÂ EMILY RAMSHAW BUDGET BARGAINING  In 2011 lawmakers struggled with how to address a multibilliondollar revenue shortfall Now the Legislature has a much different problem Tax collections are surging and state coffers are flush in large part because of an oil drilling boom Before the session began it was clear that three issues would drive the budget debate restoring the 2011 education cuts finding money for water infrastructure projects and addressing a financing crisis at the Texas Department of Transportation With a Rainy Day Fund of about 12 billion some legislators were hopeful that all three could be resolved That became less likely as a debate emerged among Republicans Is the fund there to address revenue needs during recessions and in the event of natural disasters Or is it meant to preserve the states high bond ratings so that lawmakers can continue borrowing money cheaply Rick Perry and a contingent of Tea Partyfriendly Republicans insisted that the latter was crucial and they pushed for withdrawing as little from the fund as possible Others said the state would be just fine with a savings account 6 billion lighter A deal backed by budget leaders last week had legislators spending about 39 billion from the fund As the factions fighting for school and water financing gained traction those focused on transportation were not as successful Transportation Department leaders said the agency needed to address congestion but lawmakers did not get worked up over the issue this session In the final week Democrats resigned themselves to coming up short of their goal to fully restore 54 billion in cuts to education But farright lawmakers and conservative activists also failed in their efforts to maintain all the cuts AMAN BATHEJA BAD BEHAVIOR  For those who reach for the popcorn whenever they spot drama unfolding on the House or Senate floor the 2013 session was a bit of a letdown Lawmakers largely sidestepped the most contentious issues at least in public It would have been hard to surpass the riveting theater of 2011 in which a House member displayed a transvaginal probe as a debate prop and protesters cried Criminal and Treason from the Senate gallery over the death of a bill that would have criminalized invasive body searches by Transportation Security Administration employees Much of that sessions rancor centered on volatile issues related to abortion and illegal immigration that Gov Rick Perry had deemed emergency items He did not designate any emergency items this session Even fights over the budget have been more congenial an unsurprising outcome given that the Legislature has had the luxury of debating where to invest rather than where to cut The angriest debates emerged in the fight over a measure to create a state innocence commission During a Senate committee hearing the brother of an exoneree who died while wrongly imprisoned shouted at Senator Joan Huffman Republican of Southside Place over her pivotal opposition to the bill Days later the bills author Representative Ruth Jones McClendon Democrat of San Antonio began using a parliamentary procedure to kill several of the senators bills in retaliation for Ms Huffmans opposition On Tuesday night Democrats used several delay tactics to run out the clock on a bill to create a drugtesting regimen for some welfare beneficiaries But they could not forestall a bill on drug tests for unemployment benefits AMAN BATHEJA TOP LEADERS  Two years ago Rick Perry was at the height of his power driving the Legislature to produce tough new restrictions on abortion pass new curbs on lawsuits and enact deep budget cuts This session he fell into a more traditional role nudging a lot and threatening when necessary but otherwise compromising even with Democrats Mr Perry played a major role in knocking off a bill that would have used increased fees to pay for expanded transportation financing He also put a lot of political capital behind passage of a 2 billion water infrastructure upgrade and a large business franchise tax cut While he still has veto power Mr Perry faces the prospect of making concessions on the details Though he insisted on 18 billion in tax cuts the Legislature was at last check leaning toward giving him less Education financing at the insistence of Democrats is also set to rise more than Mr Perry had urged House Speaker Joe Straus and Lt Gov David Dewhurst faced similar pressure to compromise Mr Straus had initially criticized Mr Dewhursts plan to let voters decide whether money should be taken out of the Rainy Day Fund to pay for water transportation and education programs In the compromise reached by the two chambers voters will be asked to approve financing for only water projects The legislative process when its working normally forces people to move off their ideal position said Jim Henson a political scientist at the University of Texas at Austin and a Texas Tribune pollster It does look like everyones going to have to give a little something UTAustin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune JAY ROOT FRESHMEN Even geniuses have to learn the ropes Somewhere in the Legislatures huge freshman class there may be a genius It is too early to know This much is known 41 people in the 150member House were serving in their first legislative session along with three former representatives who returned after losing their seats in 2010 The 31member Senate got six new members this year The big numbers in the House led to some substantial changes For example a group of conservatives banded together several times during the session to influence debates on the budget pensions and ethics legislation This freshman class will be more influential when the members learn their way around the Capitol The traditional advice for new legislators is blunt Sit down and shut up Many of them took that seriously Some did not And some got schooled for opening their mouths in debate with senior members ribbing them goodnaturedly as they presented their first bills and much more roughly when they challenged or amended other bills  especially for political reasons The freshman class and the large sophomore cohort together include most state officeholders who might be classified as exponents of the Tea Party When they are engaged they can swing issues like using the states Rainy Day Fund That is partly because of their numbers and partly because other Republicans are wary of crossing Tea Party voters who have an outsize voice in primary elections That power can only grow when they gain some experience ROSS RAMSEY  WHATS NEXT  The Legislature has all but finished the business of the regular 2013 session and all eyes will be on Rick Perry as he weighs major decisions on the policy and political fronts First he will have to decide whether to sign or veto the state budget which might not have everything he wanted a tax cut which probably will not reach the 18 billion he insisted on and scores of other measures  from new ethics rules to education reforms  hurtling toward his desk He has until June 16 to sign or veto legislation if he does neither the legislation becomes law Even if the mustpass budget legislation survives there are several avenues toward a special session this summer and beyond Attorney General Greg Abbott wants a session so the Legislature can adopt the redistricting maps put into place by the federal courts And if voters do not approve financing for an enormous water infrastructure plan lawmakers could be back sooner rather than later to find the money Later a fix for the school financing system already deemed unconstitutional by a state court might prompt another All the while Mr Perry will have to decide whether he is running for reelection running for president or both Or even none of the above He has said that he will send a signal about his future in June just months before the filing deadline for the 2014 elections There are numerous signs he will step aside and let Mr Abbott become the heir apparent But Mr Perry is keeping the decision under wraps and anyone who knows him has learned to expect the unexpected JAY ROOT
Archdiocese Pays for Health Plan That Covers Birth Control,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/27/nyregion/new-york-archdiocese-reluctantly-paying-for-birth-control.html,As the nations leading Roman Catholic bishop Cardinal Timothy M Dolan of New York has been spearheading the fight against a provision of the new health care law that requires employers including some that are religiously affiliated to cover birth control in employee health plans But even as Cardinal Dolan insists that requiring some religiously affiliated employers to pay for contraception services would be an unprecedented and intolerable government intrusion on religious liberty the archdiocese he heads has quietly been paying for such coverage albeit reluctantly and indirectly for thousands of its unionized employees for over a decade The Archdiocese of New York has previously acknowledged that some local Catholic institutions offer health insurance plans that include contraceptive drugs to comply with state law now it is also acknowledging that the archdioceses own money is used to pay for a union health plan that covers contraception and even abortion for workers at its affiliated nursing homes and clinics We provide the services under protest said Joseph Zwilling a spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York As president of the United States Council of Catholic Bishops Cardinal Dolan has consistently rejected similar armslength compromises offered by the Obama administration which has agreed to exempt many religious institutions from the provision but not religiously affiliated employers like schools and hospitals that employ people of many faiths and do not exist primarily to inculcate religious values In February the bishops opposed a proposal that would have allowed employees of those nonexempt religious institutions to receive contraceptive coverage through policies paid for directly by insurance companies The New York Archdiocese is also suing the federal government to stop the mandate There remains the possibility that ministries may yet be forced to fund and facilitate such morally illicit activities Cardinal Dolan said at the time The archdiocese agreed to cover its own health workers long before Cardinal Dolan became archbishop of New York and even today insists that it has no choice As a result about 3000 fulltime workers at ArchCare also known as the Catholic Health Care System receive coverage for contraception and voluntary pregnancy termination through their membership in 1199 SEIU United Healthcare Workers East a powerful health care workers union according to Dave Bates a spokesman for the union ArchCare which operates seven nursing homes and a variety of other health facilities gives its 1199 union employees the same coverage they would get at over 100 other nonprofit hospitals or nursing homes in the New York area because ArchCare voluntarily belongs to the League of Voluntary Hospitals and Homes a multiemployer organization that negotiates with the union every few years for a joint labor contract Bruce McIver the president of the league since 1991 said he recalled that some Catholic organizations had expressed concern about paying for the contraception benefits in the mid to late 1990s But in recent years as the number of Catholic hospitals in the city dwindled they just kind of stopped from my perspective paying attention to this issue he said Eventually the Catholics just said you know we are going to ignore the issue and pay into the fund and people are going to make their own choices about contraception and so forth Mr McIver said During union negotiations I dont remember it coming up in the last dozen years or so ever he said In a place like New York their employees not all of whom are Catholic would react pretty badly ArchCare like other employers in the league does not directly pay for the coverage Instead employers contribute to the unions National Benefits Fund in amounts equal to roughly 25 percent of each employees base pay that money is used to pay for the insurance coverage It is not known how many ArchCare workers actually use the disputed services Mr Zwilling the spokesman for the New York archdiocese said that Cardinal John J OConnor and the archdiocese objected to these services being included in the National Benefit Funds health insurance plan when joining the league in the 1990s But the cardinal then decided there was no other option if the Catholic Church was to continue to provide health care to these unionaffiliated employees in the city of New York Mr Zwilling said Since 2002 other New York Catholic agencies with standard commercial insurance have been subject to a state mandate to provide contraceptive services Mr Zwilling added Fordham University for example covers contraception for employees and students But rather than nullify the issue in fact these rare exceptional concessions have made the bishops even more aware of the gravity of the situation and lead to the attempt to remedy the matter on a national level he said In theory ArchCare could have negotiated independently with the union to avoid providing its 1199 employees  health support staff members ranging from physician assistants to orderlies  abortion and contraception coverage The archdiocese avoids providing those services for 1100 other ArchCare employees for example by insuring them through a special selfinsurance plan that is exempt from the mandate But in reality it would be very difficult Mr McIver said Its hard to go backwards Similar skepticism was expressed by Scott LaRue the chief executive of ArchCare It doesnt matter whether you join the league or you dont join the league determines the contract and then the union goes and forces the same arrangement on the other homes whether you are in the league or notÂ he said Religious employers nationally have often grudgingly covered contraception whether to comply with state health care mandates or because they simply did not realize they were doing so said Stephen S Schneck director of the Institute for Policy Research and Catholic Studies at the Catholic University of America in Washington Its surprising but a good number of employers dont really get into the weeds that much with their insurance plans to know if they are covering contraception and sterilization Mr Schneck said Even among the more than two dozen forprofit companies suing the Health and Human Services Department over the mandate some were paying for contraception and other objectionable coverage until recently They included the American Manufacturing Corporation a mud pumping company in Minnesota whose owner Gregory Hall a Catholic deacon played a pivotal role in helping to free trapped Chilean miners in 2010 Mr Halls lawyer Tom Matthews said his client realized that he was covering contraception for his employees only in December when reviewing what the government would require in his next health care contract More recently he was very upset to find the plan had also been covering abortion Mr Matthews said A federal court granted the company an injunction that will allow it to stop the coverage until the courts settle the matter Another company Korte  Luitjohan Contractors in Illinois found out in August that its insurance was covering abortion contraception and sterilization as a mistake according to Edward L White senior counsel at the American Center for Law and Justice in Washington Korte is one of seven companies represented by the American Center in a challenge to the mandate Federal courts have dismissed most of the roughly 30 lawsuits already filed against the mandate by Catholic dioceses and other nonprofit corporations because the government is not enforcing the mandate for religiously affiliated nonprofits until this August The case brought by the New York Archdiocese however is moving forward The mandate already applies to forprofit companies but many of those suing have been granted reprieves until the end of their legal cases In courtrooms government lawyers have pointed out to judges that some of the employers challenging the mandate have already been providing similar coverage But Mark Rienzi senior counsel at Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which is also representing companies suing against the mandate said that so far the courts have not bought the argument that aha you must not really mean it if you havent caught it before now Sarah LiptonLubet an analyst at the American Civil Liberties Union which supports the contraception mandate sees the matter differently I cant begin to understand the argument that coverage that has been part of the plan for however many years is suddenly anathema she said
"Divided Court, in 2 Rulings, Makes It Easier to Challenge Criminal Convictions",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/us/justices-make-it-easier-for-inmates-to-challenge-convictions.html,WASHINGTON  In a pair of 5to4 decisions that divided along ideological lines the Supreme Court on Tuesday made it easier for inmates to challenge their convictions In McQuiggin v Perkins No 12126 the majority said that a oneyear filing deadline for prisoners seeking federal review of their state court convictions under a 1996 law may be relaxed if they present compelling evidence of their innocence The new miscarriage of justice exception to the deadline Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg wrote for the majority applies to a severely confined category  cases in which no reasonable juror aware of the new evidence would have voted to convict the defendant The decision did not seem likely to help the prisoner whose case was under review but the exception it announced drew a barbed dissent from Justice Antonin Scalia who called the majority opinion a series of transparent non sequiturs and a flagrant breach of the separation of powers The appeal was brought by Floyd Perkins a Michigan man serving a life sentence for murder He was convicted based largely on the testimony of Damarr Jones who said he saw Mr Perkins stab a third man in the head in 1993 after they left a house party in Flint The third man Rodney Henderson was found dead on a wooded trail Mr Perkins testified that he had parted from the other two men before the killing and later saw his accuser under a streetlight bloody and agitated The jury believed Mr Jones While in prison Mr Perkins obtained sworn statements from three people who said they had evidence that Mr Jones was the actual killer Their basic contention was that Mr Jones had taken a bloody pair of orange pants to a dry cleaner the day after the killing Though Mr Perkins obtained the last statement in 2002 he did not ask a federal judge to throw out his conviction until 2008 The judge refused saying that it had been filed too late and that the statements were in any event dubious The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit in Cincinnati reversed the judges ruling saying that Mr Perkinss lack of diligence in presenting the new evidence did not matter Justice Ginsburg said that was not quite right Diligence she wrote was a factor in assessing the reliability of the new evidence Justice Ginsburg even as she said that strong evidence of innocence may be considered at any time indicated that she did not think much of Mr Perkinss efforts Her opinion returned the case to the Sixth Circuit with instructions to adopt the trial courts negative assessment of the statements Mr Perkins had collected absent cause which we do not currently see for the Sixth Circuit to upset that evaluation Justices Anthony M Kennedy Stephen G Breyer Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan joined the majority opinion In dissent Justice Scalia wrote that there is not a whit of precedential support for the idea that the Supreme Court was entitled to alter the deadline set out in the 1996 law Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr and Justice Clarence Thomas joined all of the dissent and Justice Samuel A Alito Jr joined most of it Justice Ginsburg dismissed the dissent as bluster In the second decision issued Tuesday in Trevino v Thaler No 1110189 the same fivejustice majority extended a ruling last year that had allowed prisoners to challenge their state convictions in federal courts based on the argument that their trial lawyers had been ineffective even though the prisoners had not raised the issue in earlier proceedings In the decision last year in Martinez v Ryan a sevenjustice majority considered Arizonas criminal justice system which required claims of ineffective assistance of counsel to be raised in a separate state postconviction challenge in which there is no right to a lawyer and not in the direct appeal from the conviction in which there is The Supreme Court ruled that federal courts may hear challenges to Arizona convictions based on claims of ineffective assistance at trial if the prisoner had no lawyer in the separate proceeding or if that lawyer was also ineffective By deliberately choosing to move trialineffectiveness claims outside the directappeal process where counsel is constitutionally guaranteed the state significantly diminishes prisoners ability to file such claims Justice Kennedy wrote for the majority in the Martinez decision The new case considered Texas system which appears to encourage but not require that such claims be raised in a separate proceeding Justice Breyer writing for the majority said that difference did not matter What the Arizona law prohibited by explicit terms he wrote Texas precludes as a matter of course In dissent Chief Justice Roberts said the Martinez decision had announced a crisp limit But today he added the court takes all the starch out of its rule with an assortment of adjectives adverbs and modifying clauses Chief Justice Roberts had voted with the majority in Martinez as had Justice Alito who joined the chief justices dissent Tuesday The two dissenters in Martinez Justices Scalia and Thomas filed a separate dissent In another case on Tuesday Secretary of the Indiana Family and Social Services Administration v Planned Parenthood of Indiana No 121039 the court let stand without comment an appeals court ruling blocking an Indiana law that would have withheld Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood because it performs abortions
Finding Democrats to Run Where Republicans Win,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/us/politics/democrats-weigh-electability-in-backing-candidates.html,SIOUX FALLS SD  Many Democrats in this state and beyond saw in Stephanie Herseth Sandlin an ideal candidate to help the party retain the Senate seat that Tim Johnson is giving up next year  She gained statewide popularity winning three full terms to the House of Representatives where she voted against President Obamas health care law for a constitutional amendment to ban samesex marriage and against cap and trade That is the type of Democrat who is considered able to win elections in red states So when Ms Herseth Sandlin recently announced that she would not run it not only upended Democratic plans but spurred deeper reflection over exactly what kind of candidate should represent the party  one who adheres to the partys core principles or someone moderate even conservative enough to appeal to more voters The debate in South Dakota could set a guidepost for Democrats nationwide weighing candidates electability versus their ideological purity South Dakota is among three states where the balancing act in choosing a candidate who reflects the partys values yet can attract enough voters to win could be particularly important in next years Senate elections There and in West Virginia and Montana the Democratic incumbent is retiring but in all three states voters went resoundingly Republican in last years presidential contest suggesting that keeping the seat in Democratic hands will be an uphill battle And at the same time the Democratic incumbents who are vying for reelection in three reliably Republican states  Arkansas Alaska and Louisiana  expect difficult challenges as well That makes a total of six seats  precisely the number Republicans need to retake control of the Senate Democrats say the split in their party between ideological activists and moderates is not nearly as pronounced as it is in the Republican Party where some are blaming rightwing purists for the partys disappointing showing in the 2012 elections But as Congress and state legislatures tackle core liberal issues like gun control health care and gay rights Democrats are starting to engage in their own soulsearching Several liberal groups for instance have said they might find candidates to challenge the Democratic senators who voted against tightening gun backgroundcheck laws Theres a substantial population of the electorate coast to coast that wishes the Democrats would elect candidates who are stronger on certain issues said James R Fleischmann who has advised several redstate Democrats including Senator Max Baucus of Montana who is retiring But theres not a powerful organized strain of purists trying to correct what they perceive to be the incorrect position of the party Here in South Dakota with Ms Herseth Sandlin opting out of the Senate race the only declared Democratic candidate so far is Rick Weiland a smallbusiness owner who has said he would fight corporate interests Mr Weiland also favors samesex marriage and universal background checks for guns and he is concerned about the weakening of Social Security and Medicare Mr Weiland has the support of his onetime boss Tom Daschle the former Senate majority leader also a South Dakota Democrat and of the partys more liberal base But his candidacy has upset some in the Democratic establishment Many South Dakota Democrats are hoping for a centrist to compete in a state where the number of registered independents has increased nearly 20 percent over the past five years while Democratic registration has dipped 7 percent Senator Harry Reid of Nevada the current majority leader had said he would prefer that someone other than Mr Weiland run according to Mr Daschle A spokesman for Mr Reid declined to comment  Mr Daschle said he believed that Mr Weiland would be able to earn the establishments support Ive been through this hundreds of times  a candidate has to prove himself or herself before they get support of the DSCC he said referring to the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee in Washington I believe Rick will be able to do that But Jason Frerichs a state senator who leads the Democrats sevenmember minority caucus said We are a state that comes to the center I dont see Rick coming across as being a moderate Mr Frerichs continued later adding There isnt currently that type of clear dialogue happening on progressive versus moderate for a Democratic Party candidate I think that dialogue needs to happen based on what we want to see the direction of this party be in our state because we certainly need to be more relevant While Democrats in conservative states like South Dakota have to appeal to large populations that favor oil and gas drilling and oppose burdensome environmental regulations strict gun control abortion and samesex marriage South Dakota liberals say their state is not as conservative as some believe A Democrat after all has held at least one of the states two Senate seats for most of the last halfcentury and it was just about a decade ago that all three members of South Dakotas Congressional delegation were Democrats if only for a few months It is a state in which residents have twice voted by wide margins to repeal bans on abortion passed by the State Legislature Voters also recently increased the cigarette tax passed an indoor smoking ban and killed the Republican governors education reform bill which would have weakened tenure for teachers and tied their ratings to student performance And Democrats note that although South Dakotas voters approved a samesex marriage ban they did so by a narrower margin 37 percent than Californias 46 percent I think they can respect that youre a Democrat and you have a certain perspective just as long as you dont go fullblown Nancy Pelosi on them said Matt McLarty a Democrat active in South Dakota politics speaking of his states voters and referring to the liberal House Democratic leader Still Republicans currently hold all but one of the 13 statewide elected offices and if they win the next years Senate race they could have a clean sweep for the first time in half a century They have supermajorities in both houses of the Legislature And Mr Obama lost the state last year by about 18 percentage points more than double his margin of defeat four years earlier In a state with just over 530000 voters experts say that personality plays a big role in candidates success and Republicans in recent years have simply put up candidates who connected with voters better So far Mike Rounds a former twoterm governor is the only Republican in the Senate race Nationally and locally some in the party have said they are looking for a more conservative candidate criticizing Mr Rounds for tax increases enacted under his watch and for what they considered bloated budgets Mr Rounds defended his fiscal record saying much of the spending in his budgets was from federal dollars needed to help the state through the recession Who in their right mind would ever say Dont take the stimulus on principle Cut school funding cut Medicaid and give the money away to another state Mr Rounds said Questions still linger about how strong a candidate Mr Weiland can be especially given that he does not have the name recognition of Mr Rounds Mr Weiland ran twice for Congress and lost  I also believe that the whole value of fairness is one that rings true to both Democrats and Republicans he said I think that there are a lot of moderate Republicans that are concerned about sort of the radicalization of whats happened in their own party Some local and national Democrats have said they hoped that Senator Johnsons son Brendan the United States attorney for South Dakota would run but that appears unlikely If Mr Weiland emerges as the Democratic candidate it could provide a test of whether liberalism has made any dent in South Dakotas conservatism Maybe times are changing and theres enough young people that get out there and vote that like somebody a little more liberal said Deb Knecht the vice chairwoman of the states Democratic Party Well find out when we have a progressive candidate
A Salvadoran at Risk Tests Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/29/world/americas/pregnant-sick-and-pressing-salvadoran-abortion-law.html,MEXICO CITY  Beatriz spends her days in a hospital room anxiously watching her belly grow Her doctors say she is inching along a highrisk pregnancy that could ultimately kill her fraught with risks caused by lupus and other complications The fetus itself has such a severe birth defect that it has almost no chance of surviving they say urging an end to the pregnancy to protect Beatrizs health before it gets worse But in El Salvador where she lives abortion is illegal under any circumstances Now she is waiting for the Salvadoran Supreme Court to rule on her case which has quickly become a focal point in a broad battle over abortion in Latin America a largely conservative region where the Roman Catholic Church holds considerable sway  Long home to some of the worlds most stringent abortion laws the region has begun experiencing a shift in recent years with some nations loosening restrictions or even legalizing the procedure Now Beatrizs case is testing the limits of El Salvadors law one of the more ironclad bans the region still has by challenging whether abortion should remain off limits even when the mother is at risk and the baby has little hope of survival  I dont want to die Beatriz 22 said in a telephone interview explaining her reason for seeking an abortion I want to be with my boy taking care of him Advocates have adopted her cause to intensify a regional push to change abortion laws arguing that her rights under international law are being violated the fetus is not viable the danger of serious illness or death is increasing as her pregnancy progresses and she already has an infant child to care for A group of United Nations human rights experts called on El Salvadors government to grant exceptions to its general prohibition especially in cases of therapeutic abortion The Salvadoran church by contrast has argued that the babys malformation should not be met with a death sentence This case should not be used to legislate against human life read a statement from the Episcopal Conference of El Salvador Several Latin American nations have softened their stances against abortion in recent years Uruguays Senate approved a bill last year allowing women to have abortions during the first trimester for any reason after an earlier move to legalize the procedure in Mexico City Courts in Colombia Brazil and Argentina have also loosened restrictions on some abortions allowing them in certain cases like rape or when the fetus is expected to die  But a total ban on the procedure remains in El Salvador Chile and Nicaragua Doctors who perform abortions and mothers who request them can be sentenced to long prison terms Under Salvadoran law Beatriz who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her identity and her doctors could face up to eight years in prison if one is performed A group of doctors at the National Maternity Hospital where she is being treated determined that Beatrizs risk of serious illness or death increased as the pregnancy continued and that the fetus would die They suggested terminating the pregnancy We agree in what proceeds the doctors wrote in a report but we are all subject to the laws of this country In a letter addressed to the Supreme Court last month Health Minister Mara Isabel Rodrguez described Beatrizs situation as grave maternal illness with a high probability of deterioration or maternal death Given the fatal prognosis of the fetus it is necessary to undertake a medicallegal approach urgently Ms Rodrguez wrote But the case has its medical detractors as well Jos Miguel Fortn Magaa director of the Institute of Legal Medicine which evaluates medical issues for the Supreme Court acknowledged Beatrizs medical problems but said that her health was currently under control and that she was not in danger at the moment  If someone has appendicitis we have to remove the appendix but we cant say Well remove it now because maybe in the future therell be a problemÂ  he said arguing that when a mother was in more immediate peril doctors would be allowed to induce a premature birth possibly saving both the woman and the baby  Other nations have wrestled with the question of whether to prioritize the health of the mother or the fetus In 2010 the InterAmerican Commission on Human Rights ordered chemotherapy or radiation to protect the life of a Nicaraguan woman with metastatic cancer who was being denied treatment because she was pregnant Last year in the Dominican Republic a pregnant 16yearold with cancer was denied chemotherapy for several weeks while doctors deliberated whether the drugs amounted to an induced abortion The girl lost the baby and died herself after beginning treatment Last month the interAmerican commission told the Salvadoran government to protect Beatrizs life by following the doctors recommendations for an abortion but the government has been waiting for the Supreme Court to weigh in on the matter Beatriz is well aware that there is an international frenzy swirling around her but it seems far from her mind  an abstraction compared with the palpable yearning to touch the young son she left behind in her rural village three hours away She says she believes abortions are almost always wrong acceptable only when the mother is at risk Her first pregnancy in 2012 was fraught with complications especially after the sixth month Preexisting lupus an autoimmune disease coupled with severe preeclampsia a serious condition that leads to high blood pressure forced her doctors to perform a premature Caesarean section The baby remained in the hospital for over a month Medical records show that following her doctors advice Beatriz had a sterilization procedure scheduled shortly after the birth She did not show up Then Beatriz found out she was pregnant again Doctors told her the fetus had anencephaly a birth defect in which the baby is born without parts of the brain and skull According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention almost all anencephalic babies die soon after birth Beatriz testified at a twoday oral Supreme Court hearing two weeks ago the first of its kind in the countrys history During a crossexamination Vctor Hugo Mata Beatrizs lawyer asked her to remove her shawl Standing in front of the judges she uncovered her arms chest and back to reveal lupusrelated sores Her lupus is under control now Overwhelmed she had to leave the chamber The judges announced they would make a decision within 15 business days Mr Mata said that no matter what the Supreme Court ruled doctors would probably have to remove the fetus as Beatriz enters her third  and riskiest  trimester Several American hospitals have offered to perform an abortion but Mr Mata said this was an opportunity for El Salvador to modify its law In a video posted on Vimeo this month Beatriz asks that her doctors not be imprisoned for what they may do to me The camera remains closed in on her small spotted hands fidgeting on her thighs Her burgeoning belly is covered with a red shirt
"Bachmann, Facing Inquiries, Will Not Seek Re-election in 2014",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/us/politics/michele-bachmann-wont-seek-re-election-next-year.html,WASHINGTON  Representative Michele Bachmann the Minnesota Republican whose status as a leading Tea Party voice in Congress has faded in the wake of a failed bid for president and a widening investigation into her campaign spending said Wednesday that she would not seek reelection Mrs Bachmann defiant as ever as she insisted that she would have won reelection had she tried said the legal inquiries had nothing to do with her decision She vowed to continue to fight for the principles she said she holds dear religious liberty traditional marriage family values and opposition to abortion I fully anticipate the mainstream liberal media to put a detrimental spin on my decision not to seek a fifth term she said in a gauzy networktelevision quality video posted on her campaign Web site They always seemed to attempt to find a dishonest way to disparage me But I take being the focus of their attention and disparagement as a true compliment of my public service effectiveness Like other conservative politicians with a national profile  Sarah Palin Newt Gingrich Rick Santorum  Mrs Bachmann 57 may find numerous options many of them lucrative available to her in talk radio television advocacy for conservative causes and the speaking circuit Given the uncertain political and legal paths that she faced a new career in the private sector may have presented a more attractive option  Mrs Bachmann spent heavily in her last Congressional campaign and eked out a victory by less than two percentage points Her opponent in that race had already declared his intention to run against her again in 2014 And so far this year her fundraising has been paltry Mrs Bachmann raised less than 700000 during the first three months of the year according to the most recent federal disclosures That is less than half of what she raised during the same period in 2011 In addition to a tough fight for reelection Mrs Bachmann faces growing legal troubles The Office of Congressional Ethics a quasiindependent House agency that acts like a grand jury to examine allegations of ethics violations has been conducting a review of Mrs Bachmann and her staff since early this year That inquiry first disclosed in March will soon result either in a move to dismiss the allegations or a recommendation for a formal investigation by the House Ethics Committee as there is a strict time limit of about 100 days for how long such preliminary investigations can go on The Star Tribune of Minneapolis reported this month that the Federal Bureau of Investigation was conducting its own investigation joining the Federal Election Commission and the Iowa Senate Ethics Committee on the growing list of investigative bodies looking into her campaign activity Mrs Bachmanns lawyer William McGinley declined to comment on Wednesday Mrs Bachmann is facing allegations that her campaign improperly used money from an affiliated political action committee MichelePAC to pay a fundraising consultant who worked for her during the 2012 Iowa caucuses Her campaign has also been accused of making secret and improper payments to Kent Sorenson an Iowa state senator and popular Republican conservative leader in the state in advance of the nominating caucuses And she has been accused of improperly using her presidential campaign staff to help promote her book Core of Conviction Given her growing troubles Mrs Bachmann would have been one of the Democrats top targets in the 2014 elections But now they are left with an unknown opponent in a conservativeleaning district who will probably not have her political baggage Top Democrats said they took her decision not as a sign that the Tea Party movements influence was on the decline in Congress  where a recent spate of controversies involving the Obama administration has emboldened Republicans  but as a reason to believe that the political right is only just getting revved up Michele Bachmann is not retiring because she thinks her Tea Party views are out of touch shes retiring because shes under investigation said Representative Steve Israel of New York chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee What really concerns me now is the competition that will emerge in the House GOP to fill her shoes That competition is going to pull House Republicans even further to the right of where they are now Though she was not always a reliable yes vote when the House Republican leadership needed her Mrs Bachmann enjoys the trust of Speaker John A Boehner of Ohio who thanked her on Wednesday for her service and called her a courageous voice for freedom in the peoples House She was never as problematic as some of the other members of the Tea Party Caucus a group she founded in 2010 though she did have a history of making provocative statements that sometimes drew unwanted attention because they were either unprovable or false Just this month she said it was fair to ask  given the Internal Revenue Services recent disclosure it had targeted conservatives  whether the Obama administration might deny health care benefits to people it disagrees with politically And at a prayer service in the Capitol recently she suggested that Gods judgment was responsible for the attacks on the American compound in Benghazi Libya on Sept 11 2012 Our nation has seen judgment not once but twice on Sept 11 she said In a video announcing her decision Mrs Bachmann indicated that she had no plans to withdraw from the limelight I will continue to do everything I can to advance our conservative constitutional principles that have served as the bedrock for who we are as a nation she said So far at least one option for a postpolitics career seems to be off the table A spokeswoman for Fox News a coveted landing spot for conservative politicians who leave public office said it has had no discussions with Mrs Bachmann about joining the network
"Henry Morgentaler, 90, Dies; Abortion Defender in Canada",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/world/americas/henry-morgentaler-abortion-doctor-in-canada-dies-at-90.html,Dr Henry Morgentaler Canadas most heralded and vilified abortion doctor who was assaulted and imprisoned for defying restrictive laws but who won the landmark Canadian Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion nationally in 1988 died on Tuesday at his home in Toronto He was 90 Carolyn Egan who is with the Ontario Coalition for Abortion Clinics told The Associated Press that his family had confirmed the death In a country known for tolerance and free medical care for all citizens Dr Morgentaler was for decades at the center of battles between powerful forces like the Roman Catholic Church which opposed abortion for any reason short of saving an endangered mothers life and womens groups that contended that the decision not to bear a child is a personal one Dr Morgentaler who had survived Nazi death camps at Auschwitz and Dachau and emigrated from Poland to Canada after World War II basically founded the Canadian abortionrights movement in the late 1960s He opened abortion clinics across the country trained hundreds of doctors to perform abortions and said he had performed tens of thousands of them himself Dr Morgentaler was threatened with death attacked with garden shears roughed up by a mob caricatured as a baby butcher splashed with ketchup and accused of fomenting violence He escaped injury when one clinic was firebombed After several abortion doctors were shot he wore bulletproof vests and installed bulletproof windows at home He became a household name in Canada featured in books articles and films including a 1984 documentary directed by Paul Cowan Democracy on Trial The Morgentaler Affair From Dr Morgentalers perspective antiabortion laws violated a womans right to control her body and imposed untold suffering on unwanted children to assuage the sensibilities of religious moralists and he refused to shut up or be discreetIn her biography Morgentaler A Difficult Hero 1996 Catherine Dunphy wrote that Dr Morgentaler performed an illegal abortion for the first time on Jan 9 1968 The patient was the 18yearold daughter of a friend I decided to break the law to provide a necessary medical service because women were dying at the hands of butchers and incompetent quacks and there was no one there to help them Ms Dunphy quoted him as saying The law was barbarous cruel and unjust I had been in a concentration camp and I knew what suffering was If I can ease suffering I feel perfectly justified in doing so His clinics were picketed by protesters and raided by the police He was arrested four times for performing illegal abortions and acquitted each time by jurors who accepted his defense that the operations had been necessary for the patients mental or physical health Canadian prosecutors can appeal jury verdicts and one of his early acquittals was reversed in Quebec He was sentenced to 18 months in prison but released in 10 months after he had a heart attack Another acquittal was overturned in Ontario and his appeal went to Canadas Supreme Court The appeal challenged the constitutionality of Canadas federal abortion law which allowed hospital abortions only if a committee of three doctors had concluded that a continued pregnancy would endanger the mother On Jan 28 1988 the court struck down the law ruling that it denied women the right of life liberty and security of the person as guaranteed in Canadas Charter of Rights and Freedoms Forcing a woman by threat of criminal sanctions to carry a fetus to term unless she meets certain criteria unrelated to her own priorities and aspirations is a profound interference with a womans body and thus an infringement of security of the person Chief Justice Brian Dickson wrote in a 5to2 ruling that threw out Dr Morgentalers conviction While specific issues were different the Canadian ruling like the United States Supreme Courts in Roe v Wade in 1973 recognized a womans right to make her own childbearing decisions But in Canadas 10 provinces laws and customs varied and for years after winning his landmark case Dr Morgentaler challenged provincial restrictions and payment practices He looked like an aging hippie graybearded and balding ascetic eyes behind hornrimmed glasses a gentle smile and delicate hands His extraordinary thinness was a lifelong reminder of the near starvation he experienced in a Polish ghetto and the concentration camps Dr Morgentaler who received many humanitarian awards underwent heart bypass surgery in 2006 and stopped performing abortions By then Canadian women in most cities though not in many rural areas had access to publicly financed abortions in hospitals and clinics Only New Brunswick refused to pay for clinic abortions in violation of the Canada Health Act Abortionrights advocates hailed him on Tuesday as a man of courage who had saved an untold number of womens lives Ontarios premier Kathleen Wynne said Dr Morgentalers contributions to a fair society had been felt worldwide But Mary Ellen Douglas national coordinator for the Canadian antiabortion group Campaign Life Coalition said it was impossible to respect the man she called the face of abortion in Canada Her group had prayed that Dr Morgentaler would have a change of heart before the very end she told The AP Now she said she prayed that this will be an end to the killing in Canada He was born Henryk Morgentaler on March 19 1923 in Lodz Poland His parents Josef and Golda Morgentaler were Jewish socialists When the Nazis invaded in 1939 his father a textile worker and union organizer was killed by the Gestapo He and his mother his brother Mumek and his sister Ghitel lived in the Lodz ghetto with little food and rampant disease for most of the war Ghitel died there In 1944 Henryk his mother and his brother were sent to Auschwitz in Poland His mother was killed and the brothers became slave laborers They were later shipped to Dachau in Germany and liberated in 1945 After living in refugee camps Mumek went to the United States and Henryk studied medicine in Germany and Belgium In 1949 he married Chava Rosenfarb They had two children Goldie and Bamie before divorcing In 1979 he married Carmen Wernli and had a son Yann before a second divorce He later married Arlene Leibovich and had a son Benny with her She and his children survive him as do several grandchildren Dr Morgentaler moved to Canada in 1950 finished medical school at the University of Montreal in 1953 and for 15 years practiced general medicine in a workingclass district of Montreal He joined humanist groups and in 1967 addressed a Parliament hearing calling for safe unrestricted abortions While polls showed that most Canadians believed abortion should be a womans choice nearly half the population was Catholic and abortion laws were among the worlds strictest They were eased in 1969 to allow abortions approved by committees if a mother was endangered But flaws were apparent Most hospitals refused even to form committees and red tape often delayed pregnancies beyond safe limits Dr Morgentaler opened his first abortion clinic in Montreal in 1969 and soon began the odyssey that led to the landmark ruling In 2008 he was

Salvadoran Court Denies Abortion to Ailing Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/world/americas/salvadoran-court-denies-abortion-to-ailing-woman.html,MEXICO CITY  El Salvadors highest court on Wednesday denied an appeal from a woman with a highrisk pregnancy to be allowed to undergo an abortion upholding the countrys strict law banning abortion under any circumstances  Beatriz a 22yearold woman who asked that her last name be withheld to protect her identity has lupus and related complications that doctors say will get worse as the pregnancy which is in its 26th week continues possibly leading to serious illness or even death  Her fetus which has anencephaly a severe birth defect in which parts of the brain and skull are missing has almost no chance of surviving after birth leading her doctors to urge an abortion to protect Beatrizs health before it deteriorates further  But in a 4to1 ruling the court cited the countrys legal absolute impediment to authorize the practice of abortion and ruled that the rights of the mother cannot be privileged over those of the fetus  The court recognized that Beatriz has lupus but it said that her disease was currently under control and that the threat to her life is not actual or imminent but rather eventual  It ordered that her health continue to be closely monitored saying that if complications arose that put her right to life in imminent danger doctors could proceed with interventions  While abortion is banned doctors are allowed to induce premature birth if the mother is facing imminent risk possibly saving the life of the mother and the baby at the same time according to Jos Miguel Fortn Magaa director of the Institute of Legal Medicine which advises the court on medical issues In the ruling the court cited doctors as saying that an eventual interruption of the pregnancy would not imply much less have as an objective the destruction of the fetus Beatrizs lawyer however described the ruling as misogynistic because it placed the rights of a fetus with little chance of surviving after birth over the welfare of a sick woman who already has an infant boy to care for The court placed the life of the anencephalic baby over Beatrizs life said Vctor Hugo Mata one of her lawyers speaking by phone from the Supreme Court Justice here does not respect the rights of women  Last month a group of doctors overseeing Beatrizs care at the National Maternity Hospital sent a report to the Health Ministry arguing that as the pregnancy progressed the risk of hemorrhaging kidney failure and maternal death would increase  Legislation in the region which has been home to some of the worlds most restrictive abortion laws has been loosening somewhat on the issue in recent years Uruguay and Mexico City have legalized the procedure during the first trimester while Colombia Brazil and Argentina have relaxed restrictions in certain cases including rape  But El Salvador Chile and Nicaragua have made no exceptions not even to save the life of the mother Beatrizs case has become a test to gauge how expansive the shift toward looser restrictions will be This has hit us like a bucket of cold water said Marta Maria Blandn the Central America director for Ipas a global abortion rights organization We had the hope that the state would take a more humane decision Antiabortion groups in El Salvador praised the ruling Once again Salvadorans have given an example to the entire world that we defend the right to life of all human beings however small poor vulnerable or defenseless said Julia Regina de Cardenal director of the foundation Yes to Life Â  She said the group was willing to offer whatever help Beatriz needed adding Abortion is a cruel and bloody murder in which not only does the child die but the mother is hurt physically and mentally It is up the Health Ministry to decide what steps to take nextÂ  The health minister had said earlier that Beatriz could travel abroad for an abortion although she does not have a visa to enter the United States and would have to obtain a special humanitarian one  But Mr Mata said that the trip would pose risks to her health and that she should be treated in El Salvador There are many more cases like this he said There has to be an integrated solution

What Is Reform Conservatism?,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/05/30/what-is-reform-conservatism/,"As I noted earlier this week theres been a lot of liberal discussion of conservative reformers recently ranging from the Washington Monthlys attempt at a taxonomy of the tendency                                        to Mike Konczals recent piece expressing doubts echoed by my colleague Paul Krugman
                                        about whether the reforming tendency within conservatism adds up to anything significant at all Reading through the responses                                        to Konczals post from reformish types Im in the rare position of disagreeing
                                        eversoslightly with my friend and coauthorÂ Reihan SalamÂ who writes One challenge for [Konczal] is that he is describing an idiosyncratic and diverse group of thinkers and its not at all clear that the loose collection of conservative reformers he has in mind has coalesced
                                            into anything like a cohesive movement That is if the question is whether or not there really is a conservative reform movement in policy the answer would have to be noÂ under a stringent definition of a movement
                                            It might be more apt to refer to a reformistÂ tendency which doesnt so much represent a dramatic departure from US conservatism as its been practiced in recent decades but rather
                                            a shift of emphasis I agree with the last part As Salam says conservative reform is conservative which is part of why it understandably strikes many liberals as disappointing counterproductive or woefully insufficient
                                        But I think theres a little more intellectual cohesion among wouldbe reformers than he suggests  maybe not enough to qualify as a movement but getting there at least How much cohesion you see of course depends on the definition you employ If a reform conservative just means somebody who thinks that the Republican Party should offer
                                        different arguments on domestic policy than it did in 2012 then its hard to find anyone on the right of center who isnt a reformer Sheldon Adelson qualifies so does Allen West so does
                                         you get the idea But what people who use the term mostly have in mind I think are those of us who think that the American rights biggest problem both politically and practically lies in economic
                                        policy whereÂ the Reaganera catechism is insufficient to meet contemporary challenges and where the Republican Party is currently offering a set of policies and slogans that simply arent responsive
                                        to the anxieties of Americans who arent already securely in the upper class Now this reformist camp too is a broad circle It includes veterans of Bushera compassionate conservatism like Pete Wehner and Michael Gerson
                                        combative moderates like David Frum and Josh Barro moderate moderates like my colleague David Brooks freemarket populists like the Washington Examiners Tim Carney crunchy con localists
                                        like The American Conservatives Rod Dreher pragmatic libertarians like The Daily Beasts Megan McArdle and her husband Reasons Peter Suderman and many others But within that circle and close to its center Id say though Im biased theres a tighter circle still consisting of writers like Salam National Reviews Ramesh Ponnuru the American
                                        Enterprise Institutes Jim Pethokoukis National Affairs editor Yuval Levin and others And here I think you can see not just a tendency or an impulse but at least the outline of a reasonably coherent reform
                                        agenda Its rooted in two major premises which I would summarize as follows 1 The core economic challenge facing the American experiment is not income inequality per se but rather stratification and stagnation Â weak mobility from the bottom of the income ladder and wage stagnation
                                        for the middle class These challenges are bound up in a growing social crisisÂ  a retreat from marriage a weakening of religious
                                        and communal ties a decline in workforce participationÂ  that cannot be solved in Washington DC But economic and social policy can make a difference nonetheless
                                        making family life more affordable upward mobility more likely and employment easier to find 2 The existing welfarestate institutions weve inherited from the New Deal and the Great Society however often make these tasks harder rather than easier Their exploding costs crowd out every other form
                                        of spending require middle class tax increases and threaten to drag on economic growth their tangled web of subsidies and credits and tax breaks often benefit the alreadyaffluent                                        and create perverse incentives for the poor and the distortions created by the way they pay for health care in particular
                                        contribute mightily to the rising cost of health insurance and thus the stagnation of middle class incomes So we dont face a choice between streamlining the welfare state and making it more supportive of
                                        work and family we should be doing both at once Proceeding from these premises the basic reform conservative agenda looks something like this a A tax reform that caps deductions and lowers rates but also reduces the burden on working parents and the lower middle class whether through an expanded child tax credit or some other means of reducing
                                        payroll tax liability Other measures that might improve the prospects of lowskilled men ranging from a larger earned income tax credit to criminal justice reforms that reduce the incarceration rate should also
                                        be part of the conversation b A repeal or revision of Obamacare that aims to ease us toward a system of nearuniversal catastrophic health insurance
                                        and includes some kind of flat tax credit or voucher explicitly designed for that purpose c A Medicare reform along the lines of the WydenRyan premium support proposal and a Social Security reform focused on means testing and extending work lives rather than a renewed push for private accounts d An immigration reform that tilts much more toward Canadianstyle recruitment of highskilled workers and that doesnt necessarily seek to accelerate the pace of lowskilled immigration Any amnesty should
                                        follow the implementation of EVerify rather than the other way around guest worker programsÂ should not be expanded
                                        etc
                                     e A market monetarist monetary policy as an alternative both to further fiscal stimulus and to the tight moneyfiscal austerity combination advanced
                                        by many Republicans today f An attack not only on explicit subsidies for powerful incumbents farm subsidies etc but also other protections and implicit guarantees in arenas ranging from copyright law to the problem of Too Big To
                                        Fail
                                     To bring things to a finer pointÂ if reform conservatives were suddenly put in charge of the Congressional GOPs legislative agenda the party would immediately advance Robert Steins plan for familyfriendly tax reform                                        and champion some version of James Caprettas proposed replacement for Obamacare It would continue to push hard for Paul
                                        Ryans entitlement reforms while setting more realistic targets for discretionary spending than his budget blueprints have done to date It would try to revise the immigration reform bill along the lines
                                        suggested by Levin here and failing that would probably push a more modest increase in highskilled immigration paired with more
                                        enforcement mechanisms as an alternative to the comprehensive approach It would become notably more sympathetic to the BrownVitter banking overhaulÂ and
                                        to Derek Khannastyle proposals for copyright reform And it would stop attacking Ben Bernanke for his supposed dovishness                                        and recognize that if anything monetary policy has probably been too tight Youll notice in what Ive included and what Ive left out above that there are also things that a GOP reformed along these lines wouldnt do It wouldnt embrace Â or
                                        reembrace a capandtrade bill or any sweeping regulatory response to climate change The influence of Jim Manzi                                        is strong here It wouldnt endorse further tax increases  or notÂ unless something like the WydenRyan Medicare plan was actually on the table It would remain skeptical of many of the major
                                        features of ObamanomicsÂ  theÂ design of the stimulus bill the individual mandate forays into industrial policyÂ It would be realitybased regarding the likely outcome of the gay marriage
                                        debate and nonAkinist on abortion but it wouldnt try to jettison social conservatives or sideline their concerns instead it would mostly work to broaden the profamily message into the realm of economic
                                        policy And it wouldnt make immigration reform central to the partys rebranding effort Again you can be a reforming conservative and disagree with some most or all of these ideas and choices and emphases But I think that they constitute a common ground that a number of wouldbe reformers share almost
                                        completely and that draws from multiple reformish tendencies  libertarian moderate compassionate conservative etcÂ Â within the broader right Is this a policy synthesis that would make the GOP more effective at winning national elections I think so but thats certainly debatable Is it an agenda that the party is likely to actually embrace anytime
                                        soon Thats much more doubtful On a few fronts its already there or on its way but the crucial idea that conservatism ought to focus directly on the economic interests of downscale Americans has
                                        not exactly caught fire within the GOP and the partys relationship to reformminded policy wonks remains  well distant is a kind way of putting it But obviously I think it does have at least one quality that makes it worth supporting even if the effort is ultimately in vain Both its diagnosis and prescriptions are correct"

"Will Perry Run Again? And if So, for What?",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/us/politics/will-gov-rick-perry-run-again-and-for-which-office.html,Outside a 2008 meeting of the Republican Governors Association in Grapevine Tex a reporter asked Gov Rick Perry if he was running for reelection It was a farfetched notion at the time Until Mr Perry came along no Texas governor had been on track to serve three consecutive fouryear terms  So when Mr Perry answered yes it was like a bomb went off inside the Texas political establishment  and inside Mr Perrys office too because his aides were about as surprised as the average Capitol insider With Mr Perry approaching the end of another term the idea that he would tempt reelection fate again strikes many observers as improbable Not only would it put Mr Perry within reach of serving for 18 years but it also could set up a heavyweight showdown in the Republican primary for governor Attorney General Greg Abbott appears to be setting up for a run for the office and has not said publicly whether he would step aside should Mr Perry go for it  The wellfinanced Mr Abbott is popular with the same grassroots conservatives who have propelled Mr Perry to one statewide victory after another since 1990 But the conventional wisdom in Austin is that the two will not face off  All the indications are that Perry will not run and Abbott is the designated successor by the Austin insiders said Tom Pauken a former Perry appointee who is waging his own campaign to become governor But who can predict what Rick Perry is going to do  Those who know Mr Perry best are not ruling out anything That is because the farm boy from Paint Creek Tex who became the governor in late 2000 has a long and colorful history of political shockandawe moves At a billsigning ceremony in May 2011 Mr Perry stunned his staff yet again when he said he would think about running for president That marked a departure from previous remarks and it was the first step in a climb toward his 2012 presidential run  It turned out to be a bumpy ride prompting one of his former advisers Ted Delisi to compare Mr Perry presciently to a speedboat  fast agile but capable of crashing A few weeks after Mr Delisi said that Mr Perry during a televised debate in November 2011 famously forgot the third federal department he wanted to shut down He never recovered On the night of the January 2012 Iowa caucuses where Mr Perry finished in fifth place his bedraggled campaign staff staged an impromptu party at the Sheraton West Des Moines Hotel bidding tearful goodbyes and discussing plans for a future without Mr Perry as a presidential candidate Why not Mr Perry had just announced he would go home for some prayer and reflection universally interpreted as a sign he was out But the next day Mr Perry tweeted Here we come South Carolina  a reference to the next state he was contesting He wound up pulling out two days before that contest but the sudden Iowa turnabout has not been forgotten  Ultimately decisions like this he makes only with his family said Robert Black a former Perry aide who was at the governors side in 2008 when he announced his reelection plans He does what he thinks is right and sometimes his decisions come as a surprise even to people who are close to him  For those out there trying to read the tea leaves dont Because youre probably going to be wrong That said with political insiders being who they are the tealeafreading season is well under way And there are plenty of signs to interpret For starters there is the juggernaut that Mr Abbott has systematically assembled an 18 million war chest an evergrowing staff and a spacious new campaign office near the Capitol By contrast Mr Perry at last count had 6 million in the bank and he has not been noticeably ramping up his campaign or appointing bigname consultants Nor have the last few months been filled with the kind of partisan intensity that characterized the runup to Mr Perrys 2012 presidential run when he was coming off a Tea Partybacked reelection victory and used his emergency powers to push conservative priorities on abortion voter identification laws property rights and immigration This legislative session he issued no emergency decrees and instead focused mostly on a few core budgetary and fiscal priorities A governor bent on a potentially tough reelection campaign would be expected to exhibit more aggressive and confrontational behavior and perhaps some public jabs at Mr Abbott Yet recently the two men jointly toured the devastation wrought by North Texas tornadoes that killed six people and associates say they genuinely like each other  For many observers those are subtle signs that come 2014 Mr Perrys name will be missing from the statewide ballot for the first time in nearly 25 years On the other hand Mr Perry just called a 30day special session and he still has not combed through the newly passed state budget and most of the bills passed during the recently concluded regular session So there is plenty of time to shake things up with his veto pen or by pushing for the enactment of hotbutton measures on abortion guns and school vouchers  which is just what one of his top allies Lt Gov David Dewhurst is asking him to do It has not escaped Team Perrys notice that the governor was leading Mr Abbott almost three to one in a spring University of TexasTexas Tribune poll of likely Republican voters And while Mr Abbott has a bigger and betterfinanced organization the governor is far better known and allies say he would have no trouble putting together a campaign in a hurry His campaign manager in the 2010 race for governor Rob Johnson did not settle into the post until June 2009  If Governor Perry decides to run he will have the team and the resources to win said Mark Miner a former Perry spokesman Mr Perry has also quietly made two recent campaign hires including a fundraiser and while there is talk of foreign trips this summer and fall nothing is locked in Ultimately his schedule will depend on what he decides to do said Allison Castle a spokeswoman for Mr Perry While Republicans play the guessing game about their primaries the downandout Texas Democrats who have not won statewide office since 1994 are not close to coalescing around a candidate for governor Many want the telegenic mayor of San Antonio Julin Castro to run but he has said he wants to stay at City Hall State Senator Wendy Davis of Fort Worth who is up for reelection in 2014 has been mentioned as a possibility Battleground Texas a new Democratic group led by former organizers for President Obama is making the first serious concerted effort in years to reenergize moribund Democrats and register new voters in the only reliably Republican state where minorities are in the majority This is really a longterm project said Jenn Brown the groups director But whether its 14 or 16 or 18 or 20 whenever it happens its this kind of work thats going to make that happen 
"El Salvador: Doctors Can Induce Birth to Save Woman, Official Says",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/world/americas/el-salvador-doctors-can-induce-birth-to-save-woman-official-says.html, A 22yearold woman who was denied an abortion by El Salvadors Supreme Court can terminate her pregnancy at the first sign of danger the health minister Mara Isabel Rodrguez said Thursday At this point the interruption of the pregnancy is no longer an abortion Ms Rodrguez said it is an induced birth Doctors say that the woman known only as Beatriz is carrying a fetus with a severe birth defect and almost no chance of surviving and that she faces serious health risks if her pregnancy continues because she has lupus and related complications After the Supreme Courts ruling the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights called on the government to Â immediately adopt the necessary measures to protect the life personal integrity and health of Beatriz Ms Rodrguez said the woman could be induced to have either an abdominal or vaginal birth because the important thing is saving Beatrizs life 
Special Session Puts Governor in Driverâ€™s Seat,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/31/us/texas-special-legislative-session-puts-perry-in-drivers-seat.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor of The Texas Tribune writes a regular column for the Tribune Texas lawmakers got out of the Kumbaya session alive ducking most of the opportunities for bitter fights by ducking most of the issues that cause legislative fights to turn bitter They didnt mess with immigration abortion laws voting laws or school vouchers  issues that divide lawmakers along ideological lines and make for contentious gatherings like the 2011 legislative session That peace might end After the regular session came to a close on Monday Gov Rick Perry immediately called lawmakers back He wants them to ratify redistricting maps drawn by federal judges for use in the 2012 elections And he has the power to add to the agenda as the 30day special session proceeds The list of items he might add is almost as long as the line of lawmakers and other supplicants asking for additions And thats the measure of his power now that the regular session has ended The control of the agenda moves from the offices of the legislative leaders into the office of the executive branch That shift along with a potential change in legislative math in the special session means that some of the people thwarted in the regular session now have the upper hand and that the back seat is full of people who had been in front Lt Gov David Dewhurst for instance might get a chance to deliver some of the pelts he promised Texas conservatives including new limits on abortions and allowing concealed handguns on college campuses In a special session hes pushing the Senate to get rid of its socalled twothirds rule which requires approval from twothirds of the senators before something can come up for a vote On partisan issues it means Democrats have enough votes to block the Republican majority As you might imagine that rule can be frustrating to the majority though it sometimes provides cover for not taking votes they would rather not take It has certainly been frustrating to Mr Dewhurst who blames the Democrats for the absence of action on the issues he especially wanted to advance A special session plays to the disadvantage of other regular session winners That would include the Democrats  who could should they wish flaunt the lieutenant governors complaint as proof of their own value They make up barely more than a third of each house of the Legislature and yet they have had outsize influence so far this year The newly disadvantaged could also include a prominent Republican leader House Speaker Joe Straus Going into overtime on redistricting or other conservative redmeat issues could be especially difficult for the speaker who managed his chamber with a coalition of Republicans and Democrats  the same Democrats who would have to be elbowed aside to get those conservative issues passed For instance during the session the House stymied the redistricting effort saying it would be happy to look at anything that had already been approved by the Senate Thats an insiders way to kill a political bill a longstanding tradition prevents either chamber from voting on the other chambers political map first The House approves the Senate map only after the upper chamber backs it and vice versa Anything else would be a breach of protocol Mr Straus and everyone else in that conversation understands that But a special session changes things The map question is limited  all the governor has asked is that lawmakers ratify maps drawn by federal judges Real mapmaking isnt what hes after A simple upordown vote on the maps could be fast drawing new maps could raise the political stakes for everyone especially in the HouseIts on the other issues that the pendulum could swing Republicans needed Democrats during the session to pass a state budget a water plan and so on Without those issues in play the majority doesnt have to trade a vote on one thing for support on another Simple majorities if they can put them together are all that would be needed to settle some of those partisan questions Republicans can produce those simple majorities all by themselves if they can settle their internal differences And if the governor with his power over the agenda decides to add those issues to their todo list

"Eager to Adopt, Evangelicals Find Perils Abroad",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/01/us/moved-to-adopt-evangelicals-find-children-and-pitfalls-abroad.html,BOZEMAN Mont  As a girl Danna Hopkins dreamed of having 20 children Today she and her husband Brian the pastor of an evangelical church here are building a large family but not in the way she had imagined Ms Hopkins gave birth to four children now ages 7 to 11 A few years ago inspired by compassion and a biblical mandate to aid widows and orphans the couple adopted two teenage boys and a young girl from Ethiopia Then in 2012 they adopted another girl from Ethiopia Last year when they read about the dismal orphanages in the wartorn Democratic Republic of Congo they started adoption proceedings for four young sisters whose parents an agency said had died of malaria and typhus I believe its what God called us to do said  Ms Hopkins 34 She and her husband and the Journey Church where he is lead pastor are part of a fastgrowing evangelical Christian movement that promotes adoption as a religious and moral calling Its supporters say a surge in adoptions by Christians has offered hope and middleclass lives to thousands of parentless or abandoned children from abroad and increasingly to foster children in the United States as well Hundreds of churches have established orphan ministries that send aid abroad and help prospective parents raise the tens of thousands of dollars needed to adopt But the movement has also revived debate about ethical practices in international adoptions with fears that some parents and churches in their zeal have navely entered terrain long filled with pitfalls especially in countries susceptible to corruption These include the risk of falsified documents for children who have relatives able to care for them middlemen out to profit and perhaps bribe officials and even the willingness of poor parents to send a child to a promised land without understanding the permanence of adoption In March sending shudders through adoption agencies and wouldbe parents the State Department issued an alert about Congo It warned that several children whose adoptions had already been approved by the Congolese government had been taken from orphanages by a birth parent or relative indicating that those children were not orphans eligible for American adoption in the first place The American Embassy in the Congolese capital Kinshasa  said last month that it had stepped up its own investigations of prospective adoptions resulting in delays of up to six months The Hopkinses are now anxiously waiting for the Embassy to approve visas for the four Congolese girls whose adoptions have been approved by the Congolese government The movement has been promoted by theologians and in one milestone it was endorsed in 2009 by the Southern Baptist Convention which called on churches to create an adoption culture in response to the horrors of a divorce culture an abortion industry and the global plagues of disease starvation and warfare Many of the adoptions involve couples like the Hopkinses who already have children The orphan crisis is the greatest humanitarian issue in modern times said Jodi Jackson Tucker 51 of Durham NC As their children left home she and her husband adopted four children from Uganda over the last three years The presence of evangelical Christians is especially evident in international adoptions which have declined over all as more countries restrict or ban them because of scandals or politics In 2012 some 8668 adoptees entered the United States down from a peak of 22991 in 2004 Though no one collects data on the religions of adopting parents couples encouraged by the new Christian movement account for a significant and growing minority of international adoptions in the words of Adam Pertman executive director of the Evan B Donaldson Adoption Institute a research group  Critics of the movement include Kathryn Joyce the author of a new book The Child Catchers Rescue Trafficking and the New Gospel of Adoption Public Affairs 2013 which charges that a sense of mission has frequently obscured the harm  David M Smolin director of the Center for Children Law and Ethics at Samford University in Alabama said the movement had often fallen into the same traps that led a succession of countries including Cambodia Guatemala Nepal and Vietnam to halt foreign adoptions after babyselling scandals Now people are repeating the same mistakes in Uganda and the Democratic Republic of the Congo he said Amanda Bennett an evangelical Christian and a lawyer in Chicago and her husband had a heartwrenching encounter with fraud  in Congo last year Through an American agency they signed up to take three young siblings from an orphanage From the start they spotted red flags contradictory accounts about the family indications that the mother was alive the sudden firing of the orphanage director Last August they flew to Kinshasa to investigate for themselves and discovered that the fired director was the aunt of the children whose mother and father in eastern Congo had other children at home In a bizarre clash of cultures the Bennetts met in Kinshasa with relatives who said they were hoping that the three children would be taken to America get educated and eventually send cash home or sponsor other family members to emigrate The Bennetts withdrew losing 28000 they had already paid the agency and have joined with other misled parents to promote more intense scrutiny of African adoptions Its the biggest fear of adoptive parents  that there is family out there looking for the child Ms Bennett said I think people go into this with good hearts but like many who go into the developing world and want to help they dont know how easy it is to hurt Leaders of the adoption movement respond that such lapses are uncommon Jedd Medefind president of the nineyear old Christian Alliance for Orphans said that the maturing movement was acting to prevent abuses and help orphans in their home countries  Many panels at the alliances latest summit held in May in a Baptist megachurch outside Nashville and attended by 2500 people focused on the need for churches to provide postadoption support particularly as more families adopt older children with physical or emotional problems In their work abroad he said more churches are supporting family preservation efforts and indigenous adoption Rick Warrens Saddleback Church in Southern California for example has won praise in Rwanda a country hoping to close down orphanages for working to keep children with their relatives and aiding poor families At the Nashville meeting Susan S Jacobs the State Departments special adviser for childrens issues said some problems have been eased by the Hague Convention on adoption But a number of countries including Congo have not signed it Bill Blacquiere the president of Bethany Christian Services condemned adoptionagency payments to orphanages that are tied to the number of children they refer which he said opens the door to trafficking Done properly an adoption can seem like the advertised godsend Silas Hopkins now 18 arrived in Montana from Ethiopia where he was abandoned as a child and shined shoes in the streets Through a window of his orphanage in Ethiopia he recalled he first spotted Brian Hopkins who was on a mission trip and told a friend Dude thats my dad The feeling proved mutual Four years later Silas is doing well in high school and says he hopes one day to go back to Ethiopia and do something cool like helping children find schooling and work Mr and Mrs Hopkins beamed But they are worried about the four Congolese girls  Embassy officials in Kinshasa said they would be making a visit in late June to eastern Congo the unstable region where the girls orphanage is Mr and Mrs Hopkins are flying to Kinshasa this weekend to urge the officials to investigate their case as soon as possible We dont know the next time they will have permission to travel there Ms Hopkins said of the officials It could be months

                                        state  women Women tend to vote in greater numbers than men and are among the most stalwart supporters of Democrats In their Senate race last year Elizabeth Warren beat Scott Brown by 8 percentage points overall but by 20 percentage
                                        points among women Mr Markeys campaign is relying on women for the same kind of advantage And like Ms Warren Mr Markey needs to appeal especially to women who are independents Independents who are men tend to favor Republican candidates regardless of who the Democratic candidate is  Ms Warren
                                        lost them and Mr Markey will likely lose them too said David Paleologos a pollster at Suffolk University But Mr Markey needs to win at least 35 percent of independents in order to prevail and he can do that
                                        by appealing to independent women Independent men wont vote for Markey Mr Paleologos said His best shot is to focus on women not only Democratic women but independent women And so it was that Carole King the singer who had been in Boston Thursday for a concert to raise money for victims of the Marathon bombings took to the campaign trail Friday for Mr Markey She has planned a full
                                        weekend of Women for Markey events throughout the Boston area to stir enthusiasm among women voters and fire up campaign volunteers The Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund of Massachusetts has joined the fight on behalf of Mr Markey by highlighting his support for abortion rights as one of the most significant differences between him and his Republican
                                        opponent Gabriel Gomez And an outside group over which the Markey campaign has no control is also stepping in with a series of online advertisements aimed specifically at encouraging Democratic and independent
                                        women to vote against Mr Gomez Mr Gomez a newcomer to politics says he personally opposes abortion but would not seek to outlaw it His opposition runs counter to the majority view in deep blue Massachusetts where a poll conducted in March by
                                        WBUR the NPR affiliate in Boston showed that 73 percent of voters said abortion should be legal in all or almost all cases Ms King appearing Friday at Zaftigs Delicatessen in Brookline said she was supporting Mr Markey whom she first worked with on environmental issues for many reasons including his support for women  Ed is a strong believer in womens health issues and making sure that women have their own right to decide for themselves she said as she was greeted enthusiastically by baby boomer women carrying
                                        her Tapestry record album as well as younger men and women volunteering for the Markey campaign  A few weeks ago Mr Gomez was unable to answer questions from the Boston Globe about how he would have voted on the Blunt Amendment which would have allowed employers to opt out of paying for birth control coverage
                                        for employees if the employers deemed it objectionable Mr Gomez said he had not read the amendment Since then the Markey campaign and the Planned Parenthood Advocacy Fund have sought to portray Mr Gomez as uninformed and unreliable on womens issues Various reproductive rights advocates appeared at the

                                        Committee is financed by Tom Steyer a hedgefund founder and environmental activist who opposes many of Mr Gomezs positions including his support for the Keystone pipeline NextGen is one of those outside special interests of the type that Mr Markey has railed against and tried to block from coming into the state He has warned that such groups like one financed by Karl Rove a strategist
                                        for President George W Bush would be spending big sums for Mr Gomez but so far no such Republican groups have materialized  only NextGen is here on Mr Markeys behalf NextGen is starting a series of ads against Mr Gomez this weekend on YouTube Pandora and Facebook which allow their messages to be highly targeted The ads costing a total of about 125000 were initially aimed
                                        at progressive voters in Massachusetts but have been refined to reach collegeeducated women who are 55 and older and who are either Democratic or independent We cant trust another antichoice antiSocial Security proassault weapon and probig oil Republican says the ad on Facebook as

Googleâ€™s Washington Insider,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/business/susan-molinari-adds-to-googles-political-firepower.html,WASHINGTON  Susan Molinari had wrapped up her second week as Googles chief Washington lobbyist when she got a call at home late on a Friday that blindsided her the Federal Communications Commission was fining Google 25000 for having deliberately impeded and delayed an investigation into its Street View mapping project The finding the result of an investigation into a Google project that swept up confidential personal information from home wireless networks while photographing streetscapes sent shock waves through Googles headquarters in Mountain View Calif and the Washington team that Ms Molinari had been hired to lead  Anybody who has worked in this town approaches days or missions like a campaign Ms Molinari said in a recent interview So sometimes youre on defense and sometimes youre on offense Since that night in April 2012 Ms Molinari has vowed never again to let Washington surprise Google A brassy wellconnected New York Republican who served seven years in the House Ms Molinari is paid handsomely to broaden the tech giants support beyond Silicon Valley Democrats and to lavish money and attention on selected Republicans Google employees gave 90 percent of their political donations to President Obama last year If she needs motivation it occasionally comes from Microsoft where the former Clinton operative Mark Penn oversaw an ad campaign portraying Google as a nefarious invader of privacy which helped to keep the pressure on regulators to hold Google under the microscope To fight off the now constant scrutiny of Google as a behemoth monopoly that reaches far into peoples personal lives Ms Molinari has aggressively courted lawmakers and federal regulators as she has managed a Google effort that spent a record 182 million on lobbying in 2012  The company that once had no use for Washington is now the eighthbiggest spender on lobbying in the capital ahead of not only Microsoft but also mainstays like Lockheed Martin Today she is pushing Congress on a range of issues critical to Google like a proposed overhaul of the nations immigration laws that would revise rules governing when and how foreign students  particularly those studying engineering or mathematics  could remain in the United States after finishing their degrees Ms Molinari worked with Googles lawyers this year to help fend off an antitrust lawsuit after a twoyear investigation of the company by the Federal Trade Commission began navigating another FTC antitrust inquiry into Googles practices only last week and continues to spend hours pushing the companys case in Congressional offices on Capitol Hill  We thought it was important to have somebody who could reach across the aisle or appeal to both sides of the aisle and Susan was that kind of person said David Drummond the chief legal officer at Google  Republicans have long been wary of Google not least because of the Democratic politics of its billionaire executive chairman Eric E Schmidt But Ms Molinari who supports abortion rights and was once a close ally of Newt Gingrich has entree into Republican offices and an eye for how to dole out campaign contributions  In November 10 Senate Republicans sent a letter to the FTC warning against unauthorized use of its powers in the antitrust investigation into the way Google arranges its Web search results which the FTC closed in January without bringing charges  Six of those Republicans including John Thune of South Dakota now the ranking member of the Senate Commerce Committee received a total of 28500 from Googles political action committee An FTC official said the letter did not affect its investigation Over all Google donated about 1 million to candidates in the 2012 election cycle and roughly 3 percent more went to Republican incumbents than Democratic ones  As a member of Congress you dont ever take the Batman cape off Ms Molinari said at the companys downtown Washington office a space bursting with Googles signature primary colors Google is in the news and leading conversations every day So in many ways its similar in that you dont ever drop the mantle Ms Molinari is a familiar face to Representative Greg Walden an Oregon Republican who is chairman of the House subcommittee on communications and technology and who received 10000 from Google for his 2012 reelection campaign  She knows the business world and the intricacies of Capitol Hill he said Even though the free food and foosball tables at Google are different from what Mr Walden called the spartan offices in Congress Ms Molinari he said can make an impression in both places Ms Molinari declined to disclose how much Google pays her The companys filings show that she is not among Googles five highest paid employees who in salary and stock awards have each made 20 million to 50 million annually in recent years But based on comparisons with trade group lobbyists Ms Molinari is probably paid into seven figures in salary and stock Representatives of the pharmaceutical and cable industries for example which each spent close to Googles 18 million in lobbying in 2012 earned salaries of 2 million to 3 million  Unlike Mr Penn a political brawler Ms Molinari has always hidden her edge behind a sunny exterior Her father is Guy Molinari the former Staten Island borough president and a former fiveterm member of Congress and her husband is Bill Paxon also a former member of Congress and now a lobbyist In such company she has learned how to work with competitors At one time she was the only Republican member of the New York City Council In Congress she was known as a conciliator who usually played good cop to Mr Gingrichs intimidator a 5feet2inch former Most Perky from St Joseph Hill Academy on Staten Island whose people skills have served her well After a recent company symposium she made easy cocktail chatter with technology enthusiasts and then stopped briefly to rest her feet revealing Googlegreen nail polish  In some ways she is the opposite of the stereotypical Google employee  an intense codewriting engineer said Joe Lockhart a former adviser to President Clinton and now a lobbyist I dont think you grow up in the Republican Party in Staten Island without a certain level of toughness but one thing about Susan is she is able to be tough in a way that doesnt alienate people  Google did not even have a Washington operation until 2005 a year after the companys public offering Like a lot of technology companies they tried to put off growing up in DC for as long as they could said Marvin Ammori a legal adviser on Internet law who has worked with Google  The Washington lobbying operation had grown to five people in 2007 and 30 people by the time Ms Molinari arrived last year It now numbers more than 35 including two people who once worked for Senator John McCain the Arizona Republican and former chairman of the Senate Commerce Committee Googles entire Washington office including engineers and lawyers numbers more than 100 people Like many large companies Google has drawn criticism for making frequent use of the revolving door between government and those who benefit from it Though she left Congress in 1997 for an illfated ninemonth run as the cohost of the CBS program Saturday Morning Ms Molinari spent about 14 years as a Washington lobbyist before signing up with Google  Of the 14 registered lobbyists on Googles staff 11 formerly worked in government The less charitable view is these are people who are paid to peddle influence said Sheila Krumholz executive director at the Center for Responsive Politics That is reflective of the importance theyve placed on that experience  In addition to lobbying on immigration Ms Molinari is also pressing Congress to update the Electronic Communications Privacy Act to make it harder for law enforcement to gain access to emails and to pass legislation that would stymie the power of patent trolls companies that buy and stockpile patents  and then sue companies like Google to protect them  Not least Ms Molinari and Google are pushing the FCC to keep ample space available for WiFi which is critical to Googles existence as the commission moves toward an auction of the nations wireless airwaves Upon joining Google she had a crash course in Internet operations and policy and went through a steep learning curve I do sleep with the phone with the emails right next to me Ms Molinari said I have become that person who checks them right before I go to bed and when I wake up in the morning
Secrets and Leaks,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/03/opinion/keller-secrets-and-leaks.html,CONGRESSMAN Ted Poe and I are not what youd call kindred spirits Hes a shrinkthegovernmentthendrownitinthebathtub Texas Republican a global warming denier an NRA 100percenter a devout foe of abortion rights He comes from a political tribe that regards the mainstream media as a hive of Bolsheviks Yet Poe and I see eye to eye on one thing He is the main House sponsor of a bill intended to protect journalists from being compelled to give up information about their government sources even when the sources have divulged matters of national security  For Poe and quite a few likeminded conservatives a law to shield confidential sources is not about pampering the press It is about maintaining a check on a big government that has been known to abuse its powers  We cannot allow our government to arbitrarily abolish the First Amendment in the name of state secretsÂ  Poe said last month responding to the Justice Departments fishing expedition into the phone records of The Associated Press Thanks in part to the outrage over two aggressive government leak hunts  the AP case and the electronic tracking of a Fox News correspondent  there is now a flicker of hope that Poes bill will become law President Obama as part of his professed intention of softening the security state he inherited and enhanced has revived the idea of a federal shield law Scandals at the Internal Revenue Service and a few other federal agencies have reminded everyone of the need for a probing press And that Fox News case has given the conservative wing of our national press a more personal stake in the matter The Fox anchor Megyn Kelly sounds like Daniel Ellsberg these days A federal shield law has been a goal of news organizations for decades Such legislation has passed the House twice with large bipartisan majorities and in 2009 a version won the approval of the Senate Judiciary Committee  only to stall after the hemorrhage of classified documents from the antisecrecy group WikiLeaks A lot of people I respect including some eminent journalists have questioned the idea that Congress should exempt reporters from the civic duty to give evidence Anthony Lewis the Times correspondent columnist and selftaught legal scholar who died this year worried six years ago that giving reporters an inviolable right to protect sources might make it hard for someone who had been ruined by false allegations to find his accuser and get justice Walter Pincus the veteran Washington Post investigator who has himself been a target of leakhunting subpoenas argues that a shield law would make the press too beholden to Congress and subject to a worrisome degree of government regulation He insists that the right to protect sources already exists in law The Supreme Court in its 1972 ruling in Branzburg v Hayes failed to find such a right in the Constitution but a few federal judges have found it in common law The fact that every state in the country except Wyoming offers a measure of protection for confidential sources has persuaded some judges that this is societys will even if Congress has not yet said so  Pincus and other critics complain that a sanctimonious press is quick to wrap itself in the First Amendment but often slow to acknowledge that some secrets are worth keeping A closer look at the two cases currently fueling media indignation suggests they have a point In the first case The Associated Press disclosed last year that the CIA had thwarted a terrorist plot to blow up an airliner The initial scoop uncorked a gusher of sensitive details as other news organizations raced to advance the story and the Obama administration tried to supply some selfserving context So we now know this A CIASaudiBritish operation planted a mole inside the Qaeda affiliate in Yemen The agent volunteered to blow up an airliner using a new bomb designed to get past airport security Instead he turned over the device to his handlers  At the CIAs request The AP held its story for several days  apparently so the agency could use information from the infiltrator to locate and kill a top Qaeda official  and then the story spilled into many headlines Its hard to imagine the mole having failed to blow up an airliner was ever going to be welcomed back into the bosom of Al Qaeda But the administration argues that the disclosure of his role at least put the terrorists on high alert and made future infiltration more difficult In its hunt for the leakers the FBI secretly studied twomonths worth of calls on phones used by 100 AP reporters In the second case James Rosen of Fox News reported in 2009 that according to the CIAs sources in Pyongyang North Korea was contemplating another nuclear test Not earthshaking news but the feds feared this story would tip off North Korean leaders that we have the ability to intercept their conversations So they seized Rosens email records and traced the movements of his electronic State Department visitors badge to zero in on his source The government kept this surveillance a secret on the grounds that Rosen was an aider abettor andor coconspirator in violation of the Espionage Act Rosen was not indicted but the language revealed an ominous mindset I think the Justice Department had ample reason to find these particular leaks troubling At the very least both put enemies on guard In neither case was the leak hunt launched to silence a whistleblower or hide official malfeasance on the contrary both leaks revealed intelligence agencies doing their jobs And in pursuing the leakers the Justice Department was doing its The question is whether the leaks justified such an extensive invasion of journalists activities with no advance notice and no independent oversight That is exactly the kind of dispute a shield law is meant to resolve Before compelling a journalist to testify or surrender records the government would be obliged to meet the journalists lawyers in front of a judge The prosecutors would have to make a good case that they had no other way to find the leak that they would not cast their net so widely as to intrude on other reporting operations and that identifying the leak was more important than the public value of the story Its not clear whether a shield law would have thwarted the governments surveillance of The AP or Rosen But it would have taken away the prosecutors power to decide unilaterally  Judges are not always wise Anthony Lewis wrote in 2007 endorsing the kind of compromise contained in Poes measure But in our system they are the ones we trust to weigh acutely conflicting interests Sadly the current Senate version of the shield law which has been laboriously massaged to accommodate both media companies and secrecy hawks has an intolerably large loophole for cases in which the government claims national security is at risk That would leave the government with a free hand not only in the AP and Rosen cases but in genuinely notorious revelations such as warrantless eavesdropping secret prisons and torture which would not have been disclosed without confidential sources To be sure nothing Congress is likely to pass will satisfy First Amendment absolutists Some judges will side with the government reflexively We may occasionally see a principled journalist going to jail rather than obey a court order to divulge a source  But I would settle for a law like Poes that at least requires government secrecy to be weighed against our need to know what the government is up to and that puts that judgment in the hands of someone other than our chief prosecutor Even an imperfect shield law would restore a little balance in the perpetual struggle between necessary secrets and democratic accountability

Park and Taksim Square an important civic space with beautiful water fountains and flower stands has touched a nerve because it seems an effort to erase the face of the old majestic Istanbul which has largely disappeared in recent years in favor of shallow gaudy stupefied consumerism  But the protests are not just about protecting urban greenery they reflect a much deeper resistance to the political path being taken by Turkeys prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan and his increasingly Islamist Justice and Development Party known by its Turkish initials AKP Mr Erdogan was reelected for a third term in 2011 and he has used the mandate to pursue an authoritarian agenda that many see as an assault on the secular republic that emerged after the fall of the Ottoman Empire  In the weeks preceding the Taksim demonstrations tempers were already flaring around new curbs on serving alcohol in public places passed hastily by the AKPdominated Parliament but not yet signed into law The real problem in a country where alcoholism is minimal is Mr Erdogans culture war against the countrys secular classes and the illiberal form of democracy that he is advancing Ive heard many Turks both devout and nonobservant say If consuming alcohol is a sin let me reckon with my own maker The government cannot force us not to sin Mr Erdogans attempt to forge a Muslim moral majority is evident also in his governments stance on abortion which until recently had prompted no theological or political controversies Islam like Judaism gives priority to the mothers life and health over that of the fetus but Mr Erdogan borrowing a page from Americas Christian right has introduced legislation to curb the availability of abortion through Turkeys national health insurance system And he has compounded such measures which would hurt poor women more than the wealthy with nationalistic calls to increase the population of the great Turkish nation by recommending that all women have at least three children This moral micromanagement of peoples private lives comes amid an increasingly strident government assault on political and civil liberties Turkeys record on journalistic and artistic freedoms is abysmal rights of assembly and protest are also increasingly restricted The highest political stakes involve a proposed transition from a parliamentary to a presidential system Mr Erdogans model would give a newly empowered president the prerogative to dissolve the legislative assembly Coupled with other reforms of Turkeys Constitutional Court Mr Erdogans proposal portends the most extensive refashioning of the political system since the establishment of the secular republic in 1923 If a constitutional referendum is approved and Mr Erdogan is elected the new president next year Turkey could find itself with an authoritarian charismatic presidential system resembling Russias or Venezuelas much more than that of the United States or France where a strict separation of powers defines and limits the presidents authority  Mr Erdogan is playing shrewdly with the prospects of peace with the countrys Kurdish separatists by seeking to conclude a threedecadeold war by coopting them into his presidential vision The legislative wing of the militant Kurdish movement has become a junior member of the parliamentary committee on constitutional reform giving Mr Erdogan the numbers he needs to eviscerate Turkeys parliamentary system It is widely believed that he has promised the imprisoned Kurdish militant leader Abdullah Ocalan some regional and cultural autonomy in return for this support  For Turkish progressives who have supported some form of Kurdish autonomy for decades it is bitterly ironic to see their old allies becoming pawns on Mr Erdogans chessboard as he seeks to fulfill his presidential ambitions  Not all of the proposed reforms are objectionable The 1982 Constitution which remains in force still bears marks from a military coup and Mr Erdogans proposals would rightly establish a more representative Constitutional Court not dominated by the old secular elite What is irritating and bewildering to most Turks is the speed with which both good and bad reforms are being undertaken This power grab has struck chords of alarm and anger deep enough to suggest that Mr Erdogan may have miscalculated his strength Some factions of his own party oppose him Even President Abdullah Gul has urged moderation in response to the demonstrators  The people who have now taken to the streets all over the country represent a new majority of observant and nonobservant Muslim Turks as well as some Kurds who had supported Mr Erdogans government because it seemed tolerant pluralistic and cosmopolitan But a new opposition not only secularist and nationalist is stirring So far Mr Erdogan has arrogantly dismissed his critics If he continues to ignore their voices the danger is that Turkey will descend further into violence and see its muchtrumpeted experiment in Islamic democracy fail

Some Republicans See I.R.S. Troubles as Means to a Big Goal: Tax Overhaul,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/04/us/politics/some-republicans-see-irs-scandal-yielding-tax-reform.html,WASHINGTON  When Representative Dave Camp chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee calls conservative activists to the witness table on Tuesday to talk about their experiences in seeking a tax exemption from the Internal Revenue Service his chief aim will not be to scar the Obama administration or to fuel the continuing Congressional inquiries The goal of Mr Camp a Republican from Michigan is more complex He wants tax reform Other Republicans see the cloud around the IRS in the light of raw politics and how much damage it can do to President Obama For Mr Camp spotlighting the taxcollecting agency  and stoking voter antipathy for it  are ways to build momentum for his plan to rewrite and simplify the entire tax code a goal he has set for the end of the year There isnt a person I come into contact with back home  or anyone in this country frankly  who does not fear the IRS Mr Camp said last month in opening the first hearing into the agencys targeting of conservative groups for special scrutiny They fear getting something wrong on their tax filings And they fear the IRSs ability to audit them and wreak havoc in their lives It is a difficult leap even Republicans on the Ways and Means panel admit Anger is building not only over the targeting of certain applicants for taxexempt status but also over a new issue lavish IRS spending on travel and training But it is not so easy convincing voters that the answer is to drastically simplify the bloated tax code then to downsize a sprawling IRS built to police that code People are outraged with IRS more than Ive seen about anything else said Representative Aaron Schock Republican of Illinois and a Ways and Means member Theyre just mad that theyre presumably getting away with this behavior But theyre not saying This is outrageous You guys need to do tax reformÂ   Representative Sander M Levin of Michigan the committees ranking Democrat said the strategy simply will not work Tax reform has to stand on its own two feet and if it doesnt it will lose any chance to succeed he said For Mr Camp the first major overhaul of the tax code since 1986 has been a goal nurtured for years but it may be slipping away The 113th Congress will most likely be his last at the helm of the powerful taxwriting committee because of Republican term limits on chairmanships The chairman of the Senate Finance Committee and his partner in the venture Senator Max Baucus Democrat of Montana has announced his retirement Mr Camp has approached the task methodically Eleven bipartisan working groups last month completed their assessments of tax issues in areas like taxexempt organizations education manufacturing retirement savings and real estate On May 6 the bipartisan Joint Committee on Taxation wrapped up a 568page compendium of options to overhaul the code What he lacks at least so far is the voter backing needed to propel the effort which by definition would mean sacrificing or curtailing some politically popular tax breaks like education tax credits and the mortgage interest deduction Republican aides say that support fueled by anger could be building  The IRS controversies have trained voter attention on an agency they have long reviled for personal reasons  A bipartisan group of senators meantime have spotlighted the byzantine efforts of Apple Inc to take advantage of the tax codes complexity to shield record profits from United States taxation with a web of offshore holdings And come this fall Congress will once again have to raise the federal governments statutory borrowing limit  Already Mr Camp is angling to link any debt ceiling increase to some measure that would push the taxoverhaul cause forward House Republicans are determined to stoke the anger and Democrats are in no mood to stand in their way At a hearing Monday of the House Appropriations Committee lawmakers from both parties flailed Daniel I Werfel the newly appointed acting IRS commissioner demanding drastic change It seems we have a new misstep every day at the IRS said Representative Harold Rogers of Kentucky the committees chairman Im very troubled with what might come to light next  Representative Nita M Lowey of New York the panels ranking Democrat pronounced herself furious What was the IRS thinking she asked Mr Werfel went much further than the acting commissioner he replaced Steven Miller saying he had reached the inescapable conclusion that organizations applying for taxexempt status had been targeted according to political labels  And he pledged to report to President Obama and Treasury Secretary Jacob J Lew by the end of the month what efforts he had begun to deal with the management lapses hold those responsible accountable and put in place new controls on spending for travel and training On Tuesday the Ways and Means Committee will hear from the leaders of four groups associated with the Tea Party an antigay marriage organization and an antiabortion coalition all of whom say they were inappropriately scrutinized Susan Martinek president of the Coalition for Life of Iowa said Monday her group was provisionally granted 501c3 nonprofit status on the condition that its officers sign a promise that they would not protest at Planned Parenthood or organize protests or pickets of Planned Parenthood Thats not what were even about said Ms Martinek a witness at Tuesdays hearing When we go to Planned Parenthood were there to pray Granted some of our members do bring signs  But even the witnesses are not so sure that the message from their travails is that the tax code needs an overhaul  Ms Martinek said her groups push for taxexempt status was driven by the desire by many supporters to be able to deduct their donations from their taxes The desire for such writeoffs does give the IRS the political power to grant or deny taxexempt status But another witness Kevin Kookogey president of Linchpins of Liberty a oneman organization in Williamson County Tenn said any effort to jump from IRS targeting to taxcode simplification would be a misstep I do not like the complexity of the tax code but this is political targeting as simple as two plus two he said Monday If this is used as a political ploy to change the tax code we will have missed the moral issue here and nothing much will have changed
A High-Risk Pregnancy Is Terminated. But Was It an Abortion?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/world/americas/woman-who-sought-abortion-in-el-salvador-delivers-baby.html,MEXICO CITY  The womans doctors urged an end to her pregnancy saying her life could be at risk and that the fetus would not survive anyway El Salvadors highest court rejected the plea knocking down a challenge to one of the strongest antiabortion laws in the world But on Tuesday less than a week later the woman known publicly only as Beatriz was recovering from a Caesarean section that ended her highrisk pregnancy after almost seven months of gestation raising a fundamental question Did doctors in a country that bans abortion under any circumstances manage to terminate the pregnancy without violating the law The answer lies in El Salvadors terse and stringent law itself doctors said With no guidance on how to proceed in complicated cases or a clear definition of what constitutes an abortion they say the countrys strict penal code has left itself open to interpretation The court seemed to recognize the ambiguity even as it ruled 4 to 1 against Beatrizs appeal citing the governments absolute impediment to authorize the practice of abortion  But the ruling continued the decision to intervene medically to save Beatriz was to be determined by medical professionals On Monday doctors removed Beatrizs fetus  which had a severe defect that prevented the brain from developing  through an incision in her abdomen They would have used the same procedure had the court ruled in Beatrizs favor according to her lawyer and the nations health minister Mara Isabel Rodrguez Yet the procedure was not an abortion the health minister said because the fetus was delivered placed in an incubator and provided fluids It lived for five hours  One Salvadoran antiabortion group called the outcome a victory describing the procedure as an induced birth in which the baby died of natural causes Some abortionrights advocates welcomed the outcome too saying it showed that El Salvadors ironclad restriction did not have to imperil women with dangerous pregnancies even when the fetus had little or no chance of surviving  It is an abortion said Alejandra Crdenas legal adviser for the Center for Reproductive Rights They are interrupting an unviable pregnancy  At its root some legal experts said the case was largely a battle over words Salvadoran law makes no distinction between an abortion and an induced premature birth said Evelyn Farfn a professor of constitutional law at the University of El Salvador So when the judges said that an intervention was allowed but an abortion was not she said they modulated the terminology they used in the ruling to say the same thing without referencing the same word  Salvadoran obstetricians and gynecologists have developed their own procedural guidelines to fill the gap in the law including defining the 20th week of pregnancy as the dividing line between what would be an abortion and a premature delivery  But many uncertainties remain Morena Herrera an abortionrights advocate and a close adviser to Beatriz said that one of the doctors involved in Mondays procedure was worried that he would be prosecuted Sidney Blanco one of the high court judges who ruled against Beatriz said that if they intervene and only Beatriz survives because the fetus could not be saved then it could be that her doctors were not committing any crime Lawyers and doctors say that pregnancies in El Salvador are regularly terminated at different gestation periods  Its a risk that individuals take Ms Herrera said Motivation has become a determining factor in distinguishing abortions from early deliveries some doctors say An abortion is done with the intent of killing the baby said Jos Miguel Fortn Magaa director of the Institute of Legal Medicine which evaluates medical issues for the nations highest court An induction is done with the intent of saving the mother Dr Margarita de Romero has been a gynecologist in San Salvador for 20 years She said she was deeply religious and opposed to abortion but had terminated pregnancies or induced premature births many times  In 2010 Dr de Romero treated a woman named Melanie who had an ectopic pregnancy in which the fetus was growing outside the uterus At eight and a half weeks of gestation the woman complained of pain and her hemoglobin levels began dropping Within 48 hours Dr de Romero had extracted the embryo through an abdominal incision  I didnt ask for permission said Dr de Romero who labeled the procedure as a laparotomy  a surgical abdominal incision  and not an abortion But prosecutions do occur According to the Center for Reproductive Rights at least 120 women in El Salvador were tried between 2000 and 2011 charged with the crimes of abortion or aggravated homicide in connection with the death of a fetus Thirtyeight of them were convicted the center says  Heavily influenced by the Roman Catholic Church Latin American nations have long been known as having some of the worlds strongest laws against abortion El Salvador Nicaragua and Chile retain total bans on the procedure and threaten lengthy prison sentences for the women who undergo them and the doctors who perform them But a trend to loosen restrictions has emerged in recent years with Mexico City and Uruguay legalizing abortions during the first trimester Courts in Colombia Brazil and Argentina have granted exceptions for certain cases like those involving rape incest or severe fetal malformations Shortly after El Salvadors highest court issued its ruling the InterAmerican Court of Human Rights ordered the government to immediately adopt the necessary measures to protect Beatrizs health and to ensure that there would be no punitive action from the state Beatriz said her doctors would have terminated her pregnancy regardless of what the high court ruled expressing a confidence that they would value her life over that of an unviable fetus  Melanie the woman with an ectopic pregnancy said she felt the same way  I knew that at no moment they would say Were going to risk Melanies lifeÂ  she said 
Cuomo Womenâ€™s Rights Plan May Hinge on Abortion Proposal,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/05/nyregion/cuomo-womens-rights-plan-may-hinge-on-abortion-proposal.html,ALBANY  Gov Andrew M Cuomo on Tuesday unveiled his longpromised Womens Equality Act a 10point plan whose controversial final element which includes codifying federal abortion rights into state law could determine the fate of various other antidiscrimination provisions included in the bill  The governor has made the proposal a central part of his plan to reclaim New Yorks progressive mantle and cement his own reputation as a defender of womens rights something that could be critical to any presidential bid But the legislations prospects were unclear in the State Senate which is currently controlled by a coalition of independent Democrats who support abortion rights and Republicans who generally oppose abortion On Tuesday Mr Cuomo a Democrat sounded cautiously optimistic about the bills chances We do not have any assurances he said in a news conference attended by about two dozen representatives of womens groups But the language of this bill I believe this is a bill that can and should pass But Senator Dean G Skelos of Long Island the Senate Republican leader does not plan to consent to bring the abortion portion of the act up for a vote according to his spokeswoman Kelly Cummings though she added that Republicans felt they would come to agreement on all other nine parts of Mr Cuomos plan Because the Senates leadership coalition is new this year it is not clear whether opposition from the Republican leader on abortion will actually prevent a vote Senator Jeffrey D Klein a Bronx Democrat who leads the fourmember Independent Democratic Conference that shares control of the Senate said he supported an even broader plan for womens rights than the governors 10point act but also hoped that abortion does not become a political football used to divide legislators  The language about abortion in the measure is spare five sentences at the end of a 59page bill The sentences would guarantee a womans right to an abortion as established by Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized the procedure The measure would secure a right to lateterm abortions when the health of the pregnant woman is at risk or when the fetus is not viable as determined by a doctor  Current state law allows abortions after 24 weeks of pregnancy only if the mothers life is in danger but the state law is superseded by federal court rulings that allow for lateterm abortions to protect a womans health  In his announcement Mr Cuomo took pains to insist that the abortion element of the act did not expand or extend abortion rights but simply protected existing rights for New Yorkers in case federal court rulings change But groups opposed to abortion disagreed in a flurry of statements including one from Cardinal Timothy M Dolan the Roman Catholic archbishop of New York who said the governors bill runs the serious risk of broadly expanding abortion access at all stages of gestation The inclusion in a single bill of the abortion rights language and less controversial womens rights provisions was most likely to pose a challenge for some Republicans  Jessica M Cherry counsel to Senator John J Bonacic a Hudson Valley Republican who believes abortion should be safe legal and rare said Mr Bonacic for one felt the governor should separate the 10 issues out  Mr Cuomo said that all 10 points were vitally important and that he  and other members of a coalition of womens groups who helped devise the legislation  want all 10 passed I think it will bring clarity and transparency to the people of New York the governor said They have a right to know how their elected officials feel on each and every one of these 10 points In the Assembly where Democrats have a big majority the abortion measure is likely to pass But in the Senate where Democrats hold a narrow numerical majority but do not have a functional majority even if the measure came to the floor for a vote it is not clear what would happen most but not all Senate Democrats support abortion rights and most but not all Senate Republicans oppose abortion 
Judge Orders All Restrictions Lifted on Some â€˜Morning-Afterâ€™ Pills,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/health/appeals-court-lifts-limit-on-emergency-contraceptive.html,A federal appeals court in New York on Wednesday ordered that some types of emergency contraceptives be made available for now to women of all ages without a prescription adding another layer of confusion to a complex and intensely political fight over the drugs availability In a brief ruling the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit ordered that the federal government lift all age and sales restrictions for twopill versions of emergency contraceptives until the court finally rules on an appeal by the federal government which is trying to maintain limits on the drugs overthecounter availability  Twopill versions of the drug and all but one brand of the onepill version are now available without a prescription only to women 17 and older In April a federal district judge ruled that all versions of the socalled morningafter contraceptive be made available overthecounter to all ages The Obama administration appealed that ruling and asked that the judges order be postponed until the appeals court renders a final judgment All briefs in the case are due Aug 14 The Food and Drug Administration last month ruled that PlanB OneStep but not other onepill brands be made available without a prescription for girls and women ages 15 and older Purchasers are still required to show identification to verify their age The appeals courts interim ruling Wednesday does not change that brands availability  Officials with the FDA the Health and Human Services department and the Justice Department said they were reviewing Wednesdays decision Both the onepill and twopill emergency contraceptives involve the same ingredient the hormone levonorgestrel But the distinction between the two versions has been invoked primarily for legal or technical reasons The appeals court on Wednesday did not explain why it permitted twopill versions to be sold overthecounter but not any onepill versions which have been overtaking the United States market However the original lawsuit filed nearly a decade ago referred to twopill versions because there were no onepill versions at the time Legal experts said the appeals court might have decided Wednesday that the government had less of a chance of succeeding in its appeal regarding twopill versions The issue of emergency contraception is fraught with political sensitivities for the Obama administration Conservative groups object to the drug itself arguing that it may encourage young people to have unprotected sex Some antiabortion groups also contend that the drug is tantamount to an abortion pill despite strong scientific evidence that the pill only prevents fertilization and does not act after an egg is fertilized Scientists have long argued against the need for any restrictions on the pills sale saying that studies show it is safer than many common overthecounter drugs including acetaminophen And womens rights groups have advocated for the drug as a safe option for women in an emergency Supporters of lifting all restrictions note that most people who use the drug are not adolescents but that having any age limits at all requires pharmacies to make access to the pills more difficult for everyone since governmentissued picture identification is needed and some people do not have such identification or may not have it readily available In December 2011 as President Obama was running for reelection his secretary of health and human services Kathleen Sebelius took the unprecedented step of overruling an FDA plan to lift all age restrictions Ms Sebelius said she was concerned that there were not enough studies to prove that the drug was safe for girls as young as 11 Mr Obama supported her decision saying that as a father of young girls the idea of making the drug available to them without a prescription made him uncomfortable The administration sought to strike a balance in May supporting a change that made Plan B OneStep available to girl ages 15 and older without a prescription and directed drugstores to sell that pill openly rather than locking it up behind a counter The FDA said it had restricted its decision to Plan B OneStep because the manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals filed an amended application to lower the age of availability to 15 The FDA also said that more studies would be required to show that girls under age 17 could understand how to take two pills instead of just one  The next day the government appealed the broader federal court order issued in April by Judge Edward R Korman of Federal District Court for the Eastern District of New York who accused the government of placing politics ahead of science The judge issued a similarly scathing response to the governments appeal singling out what he called the badfaith politically motivated decision of Secretary Sebelius who lacks any medical or scientific expertise
2 Vying to Succeed Kerry in Senate Clash in Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/06/us/politics/2-vying-to-succeed-kerry-in-senate-hold-debate.html,BOSTON  From the opening bell to a dramatic closing clash Representative Edward J Markey and Gabriel Gomez squabbled for an hour Wednesday night in a tense debate that sharply contrasted their differences on issues like banning assault weapons United States involvement in Syria and abortion rights The two are vying for the Senate seat vacated by John Kerry who became secretary of state Pollsters do not have a firm fix on the race because the number of voters who will turn out in a special election at an odd time of year  the election is June 25  is highly unpredictable But all polls have shown Mr Markey the Democrat in the lead though by varying margins  Mr Gomez the Republican a former member of the Navy SEALs and a former private equity investor opposes a ban on assault weapons supports expanding background checks on gun purchases and called for a noflyzone over Syria His views on abortion were more nuanced and appeared to run counter to those of a majority of voters in Massachusetts where recent polling shows that threequarters of voters support abortion in all or almost all cases Mr Gomez has said he is personally prolife but would not seek to outlaw abortion During the debate he said it was not asking a lot for a woman to wait for 24 hours before having an abortion In a riveting exchange in the final moments of the debate he emphasized that he would not use abortion as a litmus test in voting on nominees to the Supreme Court saying he could vote for a nominee on either side of the issue  There should be no litmus test on anything he said going on to say that thats the problem with Mr Markey who he said politicizes everything Earlier in the debate he had said to Mr Markey You are the most hyperpartisan Congressman in the last 40 years Mr Markey pounced on the abortion issue declaring that he would vote only for nominees who supported abortion rights He said that Senator Elizabeth Warren former Senator John Kerry and Senator Edward M Kennedy all Massachusetts Democrats had a litmus test on this bedrock issue While Mr Gomez repeatedly insisted that he was not going to Washington to change any law  he avoided referring specifically to Roe v Wade  Mr Markey used his words against him  If theyre prolife and you vote for them Mr Markey said of Supreme Court nominees theyre going to have the ability to overturn Roe v Wade and thats your vote He added You just said to the women of this state that you could support a Supreme Court nominee who could do that and I dont think that serves the best interests of the women of this state The dispute over abortion was important because Democratic and independent women are a crucial constituency for Mr Markey any threat to abortion rights could make those women more determined to go to the polls Mr Gomez appeared to believe his strongest arguments against Mr Markey who was first elected to Congress in 1976 had to do with his length of service He opened the debate by turning to Mr Markey and saying After 37 years in DC welcome back to Boston At another point he noted that Mr Markey had been in Washington when Gerald Ford was president With less than three weeks until the vote the campaign has been competing for attention in a news media environment obsessed with the Stanley Cup playoffs and the trial of the crime boss James Whitey Bulger Peter Ubertaccio a political scientist at Stonehill College said that the debate might have marginally helped Mr Gomez a newcomer to politics by giving him visibility But ultimately he said the debate wont change the contours of this race It will remain a lowturnout affair The parties abilities to turn out their voters will be of paramount importance and in Massachusetts the Democrats have the edge
Same-Sex Marriage Is Seen in Poll as an Issue for the States,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/07/us/politics/states-should-decide-gay-marriage-poll-finds.html,A solid majority of Americans opposes a broad national right to samesex marriage saying the power to legalize gay unions should rest with the states  even as most support marriage equality for gay people according to the latest New York TimesCBS News poll The survey comes as the Supreme Court is preparing to issue decisions this month on two highprofile samesex marriage cases Justices are weighing the constitutionality of Californias ban and the Defense of Marriage Act a 1996 law that denies federal benefits to samesex couples the public appears squarely in favor of overturning that law  The poll also found Americans are increasingly upbeat about the economy with 39 percent of respondents calling the economys condition good the highest percentage since late 2007 And it found stark racial and partisan divisions on two other matters before the Supreme Court affirmative action and voting rights On national security Americans expressed strong skepticism about taking the lead in trying to solve overseas conflicts but support for action against Iran if it is on the verge of acquiring a nuclear weapon The public continues to support the Obama administrations use of unmanned drone aircraft 72 percent back their use against people suspected of being terrorists but 66 percent are concerned the drone program suffers from not enough oversight  The poll found mistrust of the federal government amid national debate about whether it has grown too intrusive in subsequent interviews several respondents said the federal government should stay out of private lives and one cited the recent controversy at the Internal Revenue Service which has acknowledged targeting Tea Party conservatives in arguing marriage should be left to the states The federal government is too involved in too many personal things that they dont need to be involved in said Frances Narramore 75 a retired teacher in Arizona who calls herself an independent Just look at whats happening at the IRS and you see what I mean by that Asked whether samesex marriage rights should be determined by the federal government or left to each individual state government to decide 60 percent preferred leaving it to the states and 33 percent the federal government Yet respondents also wanted equal treatment for gay people who are already legally married By a 17point margin  56 percent in favor 39 percent against  they said the federal government should recognize legal marriages of samesex couples and provide them the same federal benefits given legally married heterosexual couples In addition to the samesex marriage cases the Supreme Court is also likely to issue decisions on two other major cases  one on the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and one on whether public universities can consider race as a factor in admissions  by the end of June Americans are divided over whether the voting act is necessary 49 percent said it is but 44 percent said it is not Black respondents and Democrats were far more apt to say the act was still needed The Supreme Court is now reviewing the part of the act that bars jurisdictions with a history of discrimination from changing voting laws without federal approval More than half of Americans 53 percent favor affirmative action programs for minorities in college admissions and hiring the poll found Other surveys that frame the question in terms of giving minorities preference find less support In a case brought by Abigail Fisher a white student denied admission to the University of Texas at Austin the Supreme Court is considering whether to affirm limit or overturn a 2003 ruling allowing public universities to consider race as one factor in an holistic review In the TimesCBS News Poll those who favor affirmative action said by large margins that they believe achieving diversity is a stronger rationale for it than making up for discrimination But here too there are racial and partisan differences While threequarters of blacks support affirmative action fewer than half of whites do according to the TimesCBS News Poll And while support stands at 75 percent among Democrats it drops to 37 percent among Republicans If youre smart enough to get into college you should be smart enough without your race said one Republican respondent Krista Bumgarner 27 a homemaker and personal care assistant in Foley Minn The question of stateversusfederal authority is at the heart of all three major pending court cases Gayrights advocates liken Californias Proposition 8 which in 2008 banned samesex marriage there to earlier state bans on interracial marriage which fell across the country in 1967 after the Supreme Courts landmark decision in Loving v Virginia Chad Griffin who organized the challenge of the California law and is now president of the Human Rights Campaign an advocacy group argued that the court must intervene saying marriage rights should be fundamental and not determined by what side of a state border one lives on  The exact same arguments were made in the 1950s and 60s  let the states decide integration let the states decide voting rights he said  Some justices have expressed skepticism though including Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg citing the firestorm after the courts 1973 Roe v Wade ruling establishing a right to abortion Many legal analysts expect the court to issue a narrow ruling that applies to California alone Respondents to the poll seemed to support that course regardless of whether they favored allowing gay people to marry Were sort of set up for things to go through the states and then filter up to the federal government said Steve Koivisto 47 a Democrat and music instrument repair technician in Baton Rouge La who backs samesex marriage Samesex marriage is legal in 12 states and the District of Columbia in

Breaking the Evangelical Mold at a Church With Ethnic Roots,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/08/us/breaking-the-evangelical-mold-at-an-austin-church.html,AUSTIN Tex  Last Sunday at Vox Veniae a 200person church in workingclass East Austin the volunteer baristas showed up an hour before worship services to make locally sourced coffee in the vaunted Chemex system beloved of connoisseurs To enhance the javasnob appeal no milk or sugar was provided Its a purist thing one barista said Keep Austin Weird the local slogan goes And the approach to coffee is just one unusual feature of this rulebreaking church in the notably alternative Texas capital Theres the building for example The church meets in what used to be Chesters an afterhours BYOB club that shut down in 2007 after a fatal shooting close by Members of Vox as the church is known cleaned up the building christened it Space 12 and made it a hub for Austinstyle activity Its their church hall yes but also a WiFiequipped space that freelancers can use for a small daily donation a yoga studio an art gallery and the home of the Inside Books Project which sends books to prison inmates But whats really unexpected about Vox to anyone who knows American Protestantism is that what began as a church for ChineseAmericans quickly became multiracial Last Sunday morning whites were in the majority and in addition to AsianAmericans there were Latinos and AfricanAmericans in the pews  or rather the metal folding chairs around the small stage where a sixpiece band played before the pastor the Rev Gideon Tsang delivered his sermon In a country that is growing more racially diverse and in an evangelical movement that is becoming more politically diverse Vox Veniae which is Latin for voice of forgiveness may be as Jesus said a sign of the times Racially diverse churches are often led by white pastors who recruit in minority communities usually by hiring nonwhite assistant pastors It is less common to see an ethnic church attract whites It may be that white people avoid churches where at first they will be outnumbered Or perhaps the ethnic churches worship styles feel alien especially if prayers and sermons are in a foreign language Whatever the reason white churches sometimes succeed in drawing minority worshipers but minority churches rarely attract white people Mr Tsang sports arm tattoos and the modish buzzedonthesides longontop haircut that many young men who request it call the Hitler Youth He was raised in Toronto the son of a ChineseCanadian pastor of an ethnic church In 2006 he started Vox Veniae as an independent planting of the Austin Chinese Church a larger church that wanted a mission to young people especially University of Texas students In 2007 the church opened Space 12 and in 2009 it moved its worship services there Along the way it began to draw older people And whiter people The average age when we started was 22 Mr Tsang said Today the average age is 27 28 Last Sunday I sat behind a woman who must have been in her 60s When she had trouble reading the passage from I Corinthians on the monitor above her neighbor about 40 years younger whispered the words in her ear In 2011 Vox Veniae affiliated with the Evangelical Covenant Church a large North American denomination founded in the 19th century by Swedish immigrants This means that Vox Veniae is a multiracial church that began with Chinese roots and has recently acquired Swedish Lutheran roots In the 1970s and 1980s the Covenant made some collective decisions to be more intentional about becoming more multiethnic in every area of our life together Garth Bolinder a regional superintendent for the denomination said in an email It began to admit more nonSwedish churches including black and Latino congregations When Mr Tsang was looking for institutional support for Vox Veniae a friend suggested the Evangelical Covenant At first Mr Tsang resisted believing his church was so specific to Austin and the culture of Austin Ultimately he met with Evangelical Covenant pastors and he decided it was a good fit We think its healthy to be connected to something bigger Mr Tsang said That SwedishChinese mingling is a significant innovation in American church history but its not what brings new worshipers to Space 12 on Sunday mornings Hannah Perez 24 works for Cuvee Coffee the local roaster whose beans she was putting through the Chemex She grew up in a Methodist church in Indiana and her husbands church was Hispanic Pentecostal But when they moved to Austin they joined Vox We felt like Wow this is awesome It feels like hanging out in someones houseÂ  Ms Perez said Space 12 is one large room with comfortable chairs scattered about Mr Tsang preaches from a stool like a slam poet intimate with his audience The books for the prisoner project line one wall There are no crosses although Resurrection is spelled in red thread strung between nails When Leena Pacak now 33 was growing up her parents were nonobservant Hindus Ms Pacak was baptized when she was 24 and met her husband also now a Vox member at a church in Chicago She said that before becoming a Christian she had to overcome negative impressions about evangelicals who always seemed to be intertwined with the religious right My impression from the community is there is a real mix including a lot of liberalthinking people here said Ms Pacak a midwifery student Her husband Cole said Vox felt freer than other churches on issues like abortion and gay marriage poverty and Middle Eastern politics Vox is a church where no one political viewpoint is pushed which is great Mr Pacak said Some hope that this kind of postpolitical postracial congregation is the future of evangelicalism But Mr Tsang has complicated feelings about his success He is after all the son of an immigrant church whose rich tradition is joyously obliterated in this diverse congregation Im struggling to have a better understanding of my own Christian heritage and of my own Chinese Christian heritage he said But James Miller an Arkansas native and one of three white musicians in the band that played last Sunday pointed out that Austin Chinese Church when it planted Vox wanted it to be an Austincentered church If the original idea was to provide Englishlanguage services for Americanized Chinese it was perhaps inevitable that with a preacher like Mr Tsang and in a city like Austin the racial lines would not hold So I figure Mr Miller said were living out their vision

Governor Cuomo Fights for Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/opinion/governor-cuomo-fights-for-women.html,Gov Andrew Cuomo of New York who coaxed legislators into allowing samesex marriage two years ago has challenged them to broaden and strengthen the rights of women including abortion rights Should he persuade the Legislature to go along he would stand in striking contrast to Republican governors across the country who are doing just the opposite  A bill he proposed last week would provide assurance that abortions would remain safe and legal in New York even if the United States Supreme Court strikes down Roe v Wade the 1973 decision establishing the right to an abortion Yet with only two weeks left in New Yorks official legislative session the excuses about why the Womens Equality Act cannot be passed are already flying  The Senates coalition leadership is working to keep the abortion rights section of the bill from reaching the floor That is pure legislative cowardice polls show that even in Republican areas almost twothirds of women want the option to choose a safe and legal abortion but the leaders apparently dont want to risk making anyone unhappy Mr Cuomo has been taking his message around the state At a meeting last Wednesday in Poughkeepsie he struck a note of outrage before a cheering crowd The truth he said is we discriminate against women in society in this state and in this country and it is pervasive and we havent admitted it and it goes on every day and its a shame and its wrong and its immoral and its unethical and it has to stop and its going to stop in the state of New York and then its going to stop everywhere  His bill would strengthen wage protections prohibit employers from discriminating against women with children and provide more safeguards from housing discrimination for victims of domestic violence or female heads of household on welfare It would increase penalties for human trafficking and expand the states sexual harassment law to include all workplaces  But the Senates Republican leader Dean Skelos says he will not allow the abortion section of the bill to come to the floor even though some Republican senators would almost certainly support it And Jeffrey Klein the Democrat who shares the leadership of the Senate has insisted that while he supports abortion rights he also could carve out that section before a floor vote  The full bill deserves the support of every lawmaker who is ready to do more than talk about equal rights and increased protections for women 
War on Women Continues,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/war-on-women-continues/,"Republican leaders eager to reject criticism that they are waging a war on women should read the legislation that their members endorsed last week On Tuesday all six GOP members of the allmale Judiciary Subcommittee on the Constitution and Civil Justice voted to approve a blatantly unconstitutional bill that would ban all abortions performed after 20 weeks

                                     All four Democrats on the committee voted against the measure technically an expansion of a bill that Representative Trent Franks an Arizona Republican introduced last month                                        to restrict reproductive health services for women residing in Washington DC
                                         In their zeal to chip away at Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that recognized womens right to terminate a pregnancy until the fetus is viable outside the womb
                                         generally understood to occur around the 24th week  the Republicans were undeterred by the fact that the courts have already struck down similar state bans including one enacted in Mr

                                        go a step beyond the current restrictive federal policy regarding the ability of women held in immigration detention centers to access abortion services The extreme provision which the Senate should firmly reject
                                        could be read to allow an employee with no medical training to decide whether or not a womans pregnancy is lifethreatening and to grant leeway to refuse to facilitate an abortion even then"
Justices Decline Case on Graphic Abortion Images,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/justices-decline-case-on-graphic-abortion-images.html,WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Monday let stand a court order barring abortion protesters from displaying images of aborted fetuses in places where they might disturb children As is their custom the justices gave no reasons for declining to hear the case The case arose from a protest in 2005 near an outdoor Palm Sunday service at an Episcopal church in Denver As the parishioners reenacted Jesus entry into Jerusalem in a ceremony Kenneth T Scott and other protesters unhappy with the churchs stance on abortion loudly addressed the procession from public property They showed large pictures of aborted fetuses About 200 children were present and some of them became upset The church sued and a Colorado court issued an order barring Mr Scott from displaying large posters or similar displays depicting gruesome images of mutilated fetuses or dead bodies in a manner reasonably likely to be viewed by children under 12 The Colorado Court of Appeals acknowledged last year that its order was meant to suppress Mr Scotts speech based on its content something the government can do only if it has an exceptionally good reason There was such a reason here the court said a compelling government interest in protecting children from disturbing images The court noted in passing that the ban might seem to bar some depictions of the crucifixion In 2011 the Supreme Court ruled that hateful antigay protests at military funerals deserved First Amendment protection The court has not generally required a different First Amendment analysis where children are involved though it has endorsed special restrictions for materials that concern sex or that are broadcast over the airwaves In 2011 the court struck down a California law that banned the sale of violent video games to minors The case concerning the disturbing images is Scott v St Johns Church in the Wilderness No 121077
New Massachusetts Senate Poll Suggests Support for Markey Is Slipping,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/10/new-massachusetts-senate-poll-suggests-support-for-markey-is-slipping/,"BOSTON  Representative Edward J Markeys lead over Gabriel Gomez a Republican businessman and former member of the Navy SEALs in the special Senate election in Massachusetts has slipped by 10 percentage
                                        points since May according to a new poll which suggests that Mr Markey has lost support among women and independents The poll by Suffolk University shows Mr Markey with 48 percent support and Mr Gomez with 41 percent among likely voters  a difference within the polls margin of sampling error of plus or minus 4
                                        percentage points The same poll in May showed Mr Markey ahead by 17 percentage points Some considered the May poll an outlier as most other polls showed Mr Markey with a smaller lead though special elections
                                        are notoriously difficult in polling since turnout is so unpredictable  The new poll found that support for Mr Markey had flagged just as concern about President Obamas handling of various controversies in Washington had grown Mr Obama is scheduled to campaign here for Mr Markey
                                        on Wednesday   David Paleologos the director of the Suffolk poll said that since the White House controversies voters seem to be pulling back or pausing on support for Mr Markeys candidacy  Mr Markey still leads Mr Gomez among women 47 percent to 31 percent according to the poll But his advantage among them has shrunk since May when he was leading among women 56 percent to 33 percent   And the percentage of women who are undecided has risen sharply since May to 21 percent according to the poll  At the same time Mr Gomez has strengthened his support among independents and now leads among them 46 percent to 36 percent  This could spell danger for Mr Markey given that his campaign is banking on support from female voters to compensate for his lack of support among independents This is often the dynamic with Democrats in Massachusetts
                                         Elizabeth Warren for example built a strong 20percentagepoint lead among women in her race in November which made up for her deficit among independents  But to win a Republican needs at least 60 percent of independents Mr Paleologos said and Mr Gomez is still 14 percentage points shy of reaching that level  The Markey campaign thought it gained ground among women last week after Mr Gomez said he could vote for a Supreme Court nominee regardless of where the nominee stood on abortion rights He also indicated that he could
                                        support a 24hour waiting period before a woman could have an abortion  While voters in the poll said by 2 to 1 that Mr Markey who strongly supports abortion rights won the candidates first debate last week only 21 percent of voters watched the debate in the first place The
                                        Senate race which has stirred considerably less interest than last years Senate race has had to compete for attention among the news media with the marathon bombings the criminal trial of James Whitey
                                        Bulger and the Stanley Cup playoffs  The poll also showed that the controversies in Washington have taken a toll on views toward Mr Obama even here in deepblue Massachusetts which voted for him last year over Mitt Romney a former Massachusetts governor
                                        by 61 percent to 31 percent Mr Obamas job approval rating is still relatively high at 57 percent but that fell from 63 percent in May according to the poll His 67 percent personal favorability rating in May is down to 60 percent  While President Obama remains popular he struggles to maintain the voters trust in the wake of the three controversies which have become national news since the May Suffolk poll Mr Paleologos
                                        said
                                      Half of voters told the pollsters that they believed the Obama administration did not deliberately mislead the public regarding the attacks in Benghazi Libya but 43 percent said the administration did mislead the

                                      And only half said they believed that the president was being truthful when he said he did not have prior knowledge that the IRS was giving extra scrutiny to conservative groups The Suffolk poll was conducted Thursday June 6 through Sunday June 9  Mr Markey and Mr Gomez are scheduled to debate Tuesday night in Springfield and meet in a third and final debate June 18 in Boston The special election is June 25"
"Harsher Sentencing Guidelines Canâ€™t Be Used for Old Offenses, Justices Say",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/politics/supreme-court-divides-over-sentencing-guidelines.html,WASHINGTON  In a 5to4 decision that broke along ideological lines the Supreme Court on Monday ruled that courts violate the Constitution when they rely on current federal sentencing guidelines if those guidelines call for harsher punishment than the ones in place at the time of the offense If such sentencing guidelines were mandatory as they once were the case would have been easy But in 2005 the Supreme Court ruled that the guidelines must be treated as advisory to avoid running afoul of a line of Sixth Amendment cases requiring that juries rather than judges make the factual findings supporting criminal sentences The question that divided the justices on Monday was whether the current discretionary guidelines retained enough force to subject defendants to a substantial risk of additional punishment and thus violate the Constitutions ex post facto clause which prohibits enhanced retroactive punishment The case Peugh v United States No 1262 arose from bank fraud committed in 1999 and 2000 by Marvin Peugh an owner of two farming businesses When it came time for sentencing in 2010 the trial judge took note of the guidelines then in place which suggested a sentence between 70 and 87 months The judge settled on the lower number Had the judge instead referred to the guidelines in place at the time of the fraud the suggested range would have been 30 to 37 months The low end of the 2009 guidelines range still in effect in 2010 Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote for the majority on Monday was 33 months higher than the high end of the 1998 guidelines range which were in effect in 1999 and 2000 Justice Sotomayor said guidelines imposed significant constraints on sentencing judges even after being made advisory The guidelines remained she said quoting an earlier Supreme Court decision the starting point and the initial benchmark Trial judges are required to explain the basis for the sentences they impose she added with a major departure from the guidelines requiring a more significant justification than a minor one Appellate review of sentences is relaxed though it does take account of variance from the guidelines along with other factors Common sense indicates that in general this system will steer district courts to more withinguidelines sentences Justice Sotomayor wrote That was enough she said to establish a violation of the ex post facto clause in Mr Peughs case under the standard set out in a 1995 decision California Department of Corrections v Morales That decision said the clause bars new laws that create a sufficient risk of increasing the measure of punishment attached to the covered crimes A retrospective increase in the guidelines range applicable to a defendant Justice Sotomayor concluded creates a sufficient risk of a higher sentence to constitute an ex post facto violation Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg Stephen G Breyer and Elena Kagan joined all of the majority opinion and Justice Anthony M Kennedy most of it In dissent Justice Clarence Thomas wrote that the guidelines since they are only advisory do not constrain the discretion of district courts and thus have no legal effect on a defendants sentence That means he said that there was no violation of the ex post facto clause under the standard announced in the Morales case Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr and Justices Antonin Scalia and Samuel A Alito Jr joined that part of Justice Thomass dissent Writing only for himself Justice Thomas added that the analysis both sides had used derived from the Morales decision was at odds with the original meaning of the ex post facto clause which referred he said only to the punishment affixed by law This was he said selfcriticism As the author of Morales Justice Thomas wrote failure to apply the original meaning was an error to which I succumbed In another development on Monday the court let stand a court order barring abortion protesters from displaying images of aborted fetuses in places where they may disturb children As is their custom the justices gave no reasons for declining to hear the case
"U.S. Drops Bid
to Limit Sales
of Morning-After Pill",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/11/us/in-reversal-obama-to-end-effort-to-restrict-morning-after-pill.html,WASHINGTON  The Obama administration has decided to stop trying to block overthecounter availability of the bestknown morningafter contraceptive pill for all women and girls a move fraught with political repercussions for President Obama The governments decision means that any woman or girl will soon be able to walk into a drugstore and buy the pill Plan B OneStep without a prescription The Justice Department had been fighting to prevent that outcome but said late Monday afternoon that it would accept its losses in recent court rulings and begin putting into effect a judges order to have the Food and Drug Administration certify the drug for nonprescription use In a letter to Judge Edward R Korman of the United States District Court for the Eastern District of New York the administration said it would comply with his demands The Justice Department appears to have concluded that it might lose its case with the appeals court and would have to decide whether to appeal to the Supreme Court That would drastically elevate the debate over the politically delicate issue for Mr Obama Womens reproductive rights groups who had sued the government to clear the way for broader distribution of the drug cautiously hailed the decision as a significant moment in the battle over reproductive rights but said they remained skeptical until they saw details about how the change will be put into practice The drug prevents conception if taken within 72 hours after sexual intercourse We will not rest in this fight until the morningafter pill is made available without delay and obstruction said Mara VerheydenHilliard a lawyer and the executive director of the Partnership for Civil Justice Fund which represented the plaintiffs in the case Cecile Richards the president of Planned Parenthood said This is a huge breakthrough for access to birth control and a historic moment for womens health and equity The FDA issued a statement Monday night saying that it planned to drop its appeal To comply with the order the FDA has asked the manufacturer of Plan B OneStep to submit a supplemental application seeking approval of the onepill product to be made available OTC without any such restrictions the statement said Once FDA receives that supplemental application the FDA intends to approve it promptly The decision is certain to anger abortion rights opponents who oppose letting young girls have access to the drug without the involvement of a parent or a doctor For Mr Obama the decision could rekindle a highintensity politically turbulent debate about contraceptives even as he is already dealing with a series of distracting controversies and national security leaks Mr Obama had expressed personal concern about making the drug more broadly available last year and offered support to Kathleen Sebelius his secretary of health and human services when she blocked a decision by the FDA that would have cleared the way for nonprescription distribution to all girls and women regardless of age He said that as the father of two young girls the idea of making the drug available to them without a prescription made him uncomfortable But a federal judge angrily accused the administration of blocking the drug because of politics not science and ordered Ms Sebelius to reverse her decision Last week the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York City partially refused the Justice Departments request for a delay in the judges order while the government appealed In its letter to the court the Justice Department outlined the procedural steps that the FDA plans to take It said the maker of Plan B OneStep Teva Pharmaceuticals has been asked to promptly file an application asking for no age or sales restrictions and that the FDA will approve it without delay Once that is done the FDA expects makers of generic versions of Plan B OneStep  the most popular of those is Next Choice One Dose  to ask for a similar arrangement The FDA will evaluate those requests based on whether it decides to give Plan B OneStep any type of market exclusivity but most likely generic pills will also eventually be available without restrictions The Justice Department said it would not remove restrictions from twopill emergency contraceptives because it is concerned that young girls might not be able to adequately understand how to take two separate doses But twopill versions are a diminishing fraction of the market The fight to make emergency contraceptives universally available without a prescription is more than a decade old Plan B the trade name for the morningafter pill was approved in 1999 as a prescriptiononly product In 2001 the Center for Reproductive Rights filed a citizens petition for it to be made available over the counter or without a prescription By December 2011 after years of pressure from womens reproductive rights groups and the companies selling the drug the FDA was poised to lift all age restrictions By then the FDA also said it had determined that the drug was safe But in an unprecedented move Ms Sebelius overruled the agency She said at the time that she had based her decision on science because she said the manufacturer had failed to study whether the drug was safe for girls as young as 11 about 10 percent of whom are physically able to bear children In April Judge Korman once again ordered the government to make all morningafter pills available without a prescription and without any sales restrictions In a stridently worded ruling Judge Korman wrote that Ms Sebeliuss decision to overrule the FDA was politically motivated scientifically unjustified and contrary to agency precedent He also accused the federal government of bad faith in dealing with the requests over more than a decade to make the pill universally available The FDA has engaged in intolerable delays in processing the petition the judge wrote Indeed it could accurately be described as an administrative agency filibuster

newest intersection of soccer and cultural controversy has an unusual address  Canada The Canadian Soccer Association on Monday suspended the Quebec Soccer Federation which oversees leagues of all ages in the province after it refused to comply with a national directive permitting players who wear turbans to participate in games A spokeswoman for the national governing body said it sent a memo to all of its local associations in April affirming its position that turbans and two other types of headwear  patkas and keski  were allowed to be worn by players That provision was successfully applied everywhere in Canada the spokeswoman said except for Quebec the Quebec Soccer Federation known as FSQ voted earlier this month to ban such headwear saying it was concerned that it presented a safety issue Brigitte Frot the director general of the FSQ told reporters last week that she was unaware of any injuries directly caused by players wearing turbans but believed they should be banned anyway Asked during a teleconference what she would say to a young child who was unable to play because of the rule she said They can play in their backyard but not with official referees not in the official rules of soccer They have no choice Aneel Samra an 18yearold student from Montreal who was affected by the ban on turbans called Frots comments one of the most disrespectful things Ive ever heard In an interview Tuesday Samra added Ive played for 11 years but this year I didnt even register because they told me I couldnt play Its ridiculous Frot and other FSQ officials were not made available for comment Tuesday Leaders of the organization were said to be planning a meeting for Tuesday night to discuss the suspension Frot previously said her organization was taking its direction from FIFA the governing body of world soccer which does not clearly state that turbans are allowed Critics of the FSQs decision note however that FIFA which has explicit rules regarding uniforms also does not unequivocally ban turbans in the way that it does say jewelry Many other countries including the United States allow players to wear turbans and other religious head coverings like skullcaps as long as the referee does not deem them to be dangerous The turban ban has played out against a familiar backdrop Quebecs Frenchspeaking majority long ago went from being dominated politically and socially by the Roman Catholic church to being the most secular people in Canada Only about 15 percent of Quebecers attend church and most people in the province long ago rejected its teachings on birth control samesex marriage and abortion But the question of how to deal with immigrants cultural religious practices remains a thorny issue in the province where there are about 9200 Sikhs according to recent census data Months of public hearings on the subject in 2007 and 2008 showed that many Frenchspeaking Quebecers felt anxious that their identity and language would be threatened by making allowances for the ways of others The special commission called that a crisis of perception and the evidence suggested that the worry was strongest in parts of the province with relatively few immigrants  Daniel Weinstock a philosopher and a professor at McGill Universitys law school in Montreal said the fact that the soccer federations bans largely involved childrens play have made them stand out Even if the motivations of the federation are completely innocent and bureaucratic this has been set into a toxic culture of us and them Weinstock said After initially staying out of the turban debate Quebecs separatist Parti Qubcois government took the side of the federation Tuesday Speaking to reporters Pauline Marois the Quebec premier avoided discussing the safety issues She turned the issue instead into an example of Canada unjustly telling Quebec what to do a common theme of the separatist movement I think the Quebec federation has the right to establish its own regulations she said It is autonomous not subject to the Canadian federation Soccer was at the center of another accommodation debate during those hearings after the Quebec federation in 2007 banned the use of hijabs Muslim head scarfs from play a move matched by the provinces taekwondo federation Then as now with turbans safety was the soccer federations ostensible concern The hijab ban was finally lifted last year The Canadian Soccer Associations suspension of the FSQ does not affect the Montreal Impact who play in Major League Soccer but it does affect some youth teams including allstar teams that compete outside the province In addition if the suspension continues through the summer teams from Quebec will not be allowed to compete in Canadas national championships Further nationally certified referees are prohibited from working games in Quebec Balpreet Singh who serves as legal counsel for the World Sikh Organization of Canada said his organization had been attempting to address the issue with the FSQ for years Singh said in an interview Tuesday that his organization initially protested to the federation in 2007 when it would not allow a girl to play soccer because she was wearing a hijab In 2011 Singh said a referee in Quebec was not allowed to officiate because she was wearing a hijab Last year the policy disallowing turbans was unofficially instituted We have reached out with letters and phone calls and have received no response not one from the Quebec Soccer Federation Singh said adding that his organization would consider legal action if the FSQ did not reverse its decision Were not asking anyone else to wear a turban Singh said Were not trying to give a message through our turban Its a personal expression of faith that is absolutely essential But its not something that imposes a message on anyone else Its not something that should keep anyone from playing a game

Alabama: Suit Is Filed to Block Abortion Clinic Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/us/alabama-suit-is-filed-to-block-abortion-clinic-law.html,Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union filed a lawsuit in federal court Tuesday to block a new Alabama law that would force three of the states five abortion clinics to shut down The law like measures passed in Mississippi and North Dakota that are under challenge would require doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals Proponents say it will protect patients in emergencies but the clinics and prominent medical groups call it medically unnecessary and an unconstitutional effort to force the closing of the clinics in Birmingham Mobile and Montgomery which rely on visiting doctors 
What Happens to Women Who Are Denied Abortions?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/16/magazine/study-women-denied-abortions.html,S arrived alone at a Planned Parenthood in Richmond Calif four days before Christmas As she filled out her paperwork she looked at the women around her Nearly all had someone with them S wondered if they also felt terrible about themselves or if having someone along made things easier She began to cry quietly She kept reminding herself that she felt secure in her decision I knew that that was going to be the rightwrong thing to do she told me later I was ready for it After S urinated in a cup she was led into a small room She texted one of her sisters Do you think God would forgive me if I were to murder my unborn child It was the first time anyone in her family knew she was pregnant Where are you her sister asked Are you OK Im at Planned Parenthood about to have an abortion God knows your heart and I understand that you are not ready her sister texted back I think God will understand The pregnancy had crept up on S She was a strong believer in birth control  in high school she was selected to help teach sex education But having been celibate for months and strapped for cash she stopped taking the pill Then an exboyfriend came around For months after she had only a little spotting but because her periods are typically light she didnt think much of it at first Then she started to worry I used to press on my stomach really hard thinking maybe it would make my period come she said Around Thanksgiving in 2011 S then 24 took her first pregnancy test  a home kit from Longs Drugs S her first initial lived alone with her dog and her parrot and it was late at night when she read the results She stared into space past the plastic stick Shed never been pregnant before I cried I was heartbroken Her ex had begun a new relationship and she knew he wouldnt be there to support her or a child She was working five parttime jobs to keep herself afloat and still didnt always have enough money for proper meals How could she feed a baby She kept the news to herself and made an appointment at Planned Parenthood At the clinic a counselor comforted S and asked her why she had come if anyone had coerced her into making this decision No S explained she was simply not ready to have a child The woman asked how far along she thought she might be S estimated that she was about three months pregnant In the exam room a technician asked her to lie down She did an ultrasound sliding the instrument across Ss stomach Oh    it shows here that you are a little further along She repeated the exam S she estimated was nearly 20 weeks pregnant too far along for this Planned Parenthood clinic S felt numb I was thinking If it is too late here it is probably too late other places    And I was like Oh my God now what Planned Parenthood gave S a packet of information including two pieces of paper  one green for adoption and one yellow for other abortion providers S still wanted to have an abortion She called a clinic in Oakland and took the first available appointment just after Christmas I was a ticking time bomb running out of days she told me On the Internet another of Ss sisters also found a place called First Resort which provided abortion counseling S didnt know that First Resorts president once said that abortion is never the right answer A spokeswoman for First Resort says that while the organization takes no public stand on legalized abortion it does not provide abortions or abortion referrals S went to First Resort the day before her appointment in Oakland unsure what to expect It provided a free ultrasound The nurse asked S if she wanted to see the baby and turned the monitor toward her Look Your baby is smiling at you S was shaken convinced she also saw the baby smiling The nurse told her that she was at least a week further along than the Planned Parenthood estimate ultrasound estimates can be off by several days either way S sobbed all the way to her car and called the clinic in Oakland giving it the First Resort estimate If it was correct they told her she would be past its deadline S never made it to the Oakland clinic and in a matter of days gave up looking for another clinic that could perform a later procedure She was out of gas money hadnt eaten a decent meal in weeks and resigned herself to the fact that no matter what she wanted or how it would affect her life she was going to have a baby When Diana Greene Foster a demographer and an associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California San Francisco first began studying women who were turned away from abortion clinics she was struck by how little data there were A few clinics kept records but no one had compiled them nationally And there was no research on how these women fared over time What Foster wondered were the consequences of having to carry an unwanted pregnancy to term Did it take a higher psychological or economic toll than having an abortion Or was the reverse true  did the new baby make up for any social or financial difficulties Its not that the study was so hard to do Foster says But no one had done it before Since Roe v Wade was decided in 1973 the debate over abortion has focused primarily on the ramifications of having one The abortion rights community maintains that abortion is safe both physically and psychologically  a position most scientists endorse Those on the antiabortion side argue that abortion is immoral can cause a fetus pain and leads to longlasting negative physical and psychological effects in the women who have the procedure There is no credible research to support a postabortion syndrome as a report published by the American Psychological Association in 2008 made clear Yet the notion has influenced restrictive laws in many states In Alabama women who seek an abortion must have an ultrasound and be offered the option to view the image in South Dakota women must wait at least 72 hours after a consultation with a doctor before having the procedure The unstated assumption of most new abortion restrictions  mandatory ultrasound viewing waiting periods mandated state information  Foster says is that women dont know what they are doing when they try to terminate a pregnancy Or they cant make a decision they wont regret Lost in the controversy however is the flip side of the question What Foster wondered could the women who did not have the abortions they sought tell us about the women who did Most studies on the effects of abortion compare women who have abortions with those who choose to carry their pregnancies to term It is like comparing people who are divorced with people who stay married instead of people who get the divorce they want with the people who dont Foster saw this as a fundamental flaw By choosing the right comparison groups  women who obtain abortions just before the gestational deadline versus women who miss that deadline and are turned away  Foster hoped to paint a more accurate picture Do the physical psychological and socioeconomic outcomes for these two groups of women differ Which is safer for them abortion or childbirth Which causes more depression and anxiety I tried to measure all the ways in which I thought having a baby might make you worse off Foster says and the ways in which having a baby might make you better off and the same with having an abortion Foster began by gathering data locally She ran the study out of her office at UCSF I am a student in the UC BerkeleyUCSF Joint Medical Program but did not know Foster before reporting this article When the counselors at a nearby abortion clinic received a woman who was too far along to terminate her pregnancy they called Foster who would run over and arrange to interview the patient Given the stigma attached to seeking an abortion later in pregnancy Foster expected that many women would be reluctant to be part of her study But four out of five women agreed to participate Sometimes if you tell them that their experience is valuable that it might help other people in their situation they will come through she says Initially Fosters study was confined to women whose pregnancies were in a narrow band of time on either side of this particular clinics gestational limit  two weeks under or three weeks over In California state law allows an abortion up to what a physician considers viability but clinics can set their own limits Eventually Foster received multiple foundation grants that allowed her to hire additional staff and recruit more subjects The study which is ongoing encompasses 30 clinics from 21 states across the country The clinics gestational limits vary from 10 weeks to the end of the second trimester with a vast majority falling in the second trimester typically defined as Weeks 14 to 26 of pregnancy Women turned away from these last stop clinics had no other options within 150 miles Of some 3000 women who were asked to participate 956 have completed a baseline interview and agreed to followup interviews every six months Of those women 452 were within two weeks of their facilitys cutoff and received an abortion and 231 missed the cutoff by up to three weeks and were turned away About 20 percent of the turnaways received an abortion elsewhere Foster compared the remaining women who carried their pregnancies to term with the nearlimit abortion patients The 273 other women in the study received a firsttrimester abortion and acted as a control group In the United States 88 percent of abortions occur in the first 12 weeks and Foster wanted to be sure that the nearlimit abortion patients did not differ significantly in their outcomes from firsttrimester abortion patients Of the turnaways in Fosters study who gave birth 9 percent eventually put their children up for adoption There are many reasons women are turned away from an abortion clinic  lack of funds many insurance plans dont cover abortion or obesity excess weight can make the procedure more complicated  but most simply arrive too late Women cite not recognizing their pregnancies travel and procedure costs insurance problems and not knowing where to find care as common reasons for delay These are the women for whom society has the absolute least sympathy Foster acknowledges While a majority of Americans 53 percent agree with Roe many of those who support abortion rights draw the line at later stages of pregnancy And the law reflects this view Roe v Wade guarantees a womans right to abortion only up to the viability of a fetus with exceptions for danger to a womans health Viability varies depending on the medical expert you ask typically at 23 weeks or more But the widespread discomfort with abortions near viability is reflected in recent bans on socalled partialbirth abortions And many clinics reacting to state law set their own gestational limits  often 20 to 22 weeks  making laterterm abortion more difficult to find in some states than in others In the US 87 percent of counties have no abortion provider at all Usually the only difference between making it and not is just realizing you are pregnant Foster says If youre late abortion gets much harder to find All the logistic concerns snowball  money travel support Women who seek abortions tend in general to be less well off than those who dont and those seeking secondtrimester abortions tend to be particularly vulnerable given the difficulties of finding an appropriate clinic and the higher cost of a later procedure As the argument that abortion harms women gains political traction it is especially critical to look at how turnaways fare All past studies of women denied abortion in the United States have been hospitalspecific and local focusing on a brief amount of time without a control group says Roger Rochat former director of the division of reproductive health at the CDC and a professor of global health and epidemiology at Emory University Fosters turnaway study had a sample across the United States that she followed over a long period of time It is the best science we have ever done on the subject  Fosters study does have a precedent  of a sort In 1957 Czechoslovakia liberalized its abortion laws while maintaining significant restrictions Women were required to apply to an abortion commission and could be denied for a host of reasons  if they were past 12 weeks gestation presented false or insufficient reasons or had had an abortion too recently Women denied by the first commission could appeal to regional review boards Some were denied twice and thus carried their pregnancies to term An eminent American psychologist Henry David took note of this and embarked on a pioneering study Between 1961 and 1963 24989 Czech women applied for abortions 638 of the applications were denied after initial application and appeal With a team of Czech colleagues David enrolled 220 of the women who were twice denied the abortion they sought and 220 women who never pursued an abortion For the next 35 years he followed their children making regular inquiries and comparisons between the two groups The first results examined the children at age 9 David reported that the children born of unwanted pregnancies had significant disadvantages They were breastfed for shorter periods were slightly but consistently overweight had more instances of acute illness and lower grades in Czech They seemed less capable in socially demanding situations they were less popular among peers and teachers and even if sons with their own mothers David concluded that the child of a woman denied abortion appears to be born into a potentially handicapping situation After David published his first round of data Czechoslovakia made firsttrimester abortion available on demand In the course of interviewing the mothers about their children Davids research suggested that whether the mother wanted the child was a significant predictor of the childs future negative qualities independent of the effect of the mothers personality But he did not have a proper control group to determine if a childs unwantedness rather than a poor family environment was the source of the trouble David called it the Achilles heel of his work Fosters study by contrast seeks to isolate the impact of abortion by comparing two groups of very similar women there are few differences in their educational and socioeconomic backgrounds and they all sought an abortion Only 66 percent of nearlimit patients in the study and 56 percent of turnaways finished college nearly 30 percent of adult American women have a bachelors degree One in 10 were on welfare and approximately 80 percent reported not having enough money to meet basic living needs A majority in both groups already had at least one child Foster hoped that their similarities would allow her to answer more fully how abortion affects womens mental health and emotional states The APA report from 2008 concluded that among adult women with unplanned pregnancies the relative risk of mentalhealth problems is no greater if [women] have a single elective firsttrimester abortion than if they delivered the pregnancy But it did not go beyond the first trimester It also noted the complexity of women and their circumstances and suggested that further study was needed to disentangle confounding factors and establish relative risks of abortion compared to its alternatives Foster saw that most abortion studies failed to acknowledge that women seeking abortions are likely to have mixed emotions  regret anger happiness relief They also often failed to separate the reaction to pregnancy from the reaction to the abortion She has designed her study to do both relying on a series of questions and periodic interviews and initial results to be published in the fall show that the emotion that predominates right after an abortion is relief When she looked at more objective measures of mental health over time  rates of depression and anxiety  she also found no correlation between having an abortion and increased symptoms In a working paper based on her study Foster notes that womens depression and anxiety symptoms either remained steady or decreased over the twoyear period after receiving an abortion and that in fact initial and subsequent levels of depressive symptoms were similar between those who received an abortion and those who were turned away Turnaways did however suffer from higher levels of anxiety but six months out there were no appreciable differences between the two groups Where the turnaways had more significant negative outcomes was in their physical health and economic stability Because new mothers are eligible for government programs Foster thought that they might have better health over time But women in the turnaway group suffered more ill effects including higher rates of hypertension and chronic pelvic pain though Foster cannot say whether turnaways face greater risk from pregnancy than an average woman Even later abortions are significantly safer than childbirth she says and we see that through lower complications and low incidence of chronic conditions In the National Right to Lifes fivepart response to preliminary findings of Fosters study which were presented at the American Public Health Association conference last year the group noted that the ill effects of abortion  future miscarriage breast cancer infertility  may become apparent only later Reputable research does not support such claims Economically the results are even more striking Adjusting for any previous differences between the two groups women denied abortion were three times as likely to end up below the federal poverty line two years later Having a child is expensive and many mothers have trouble holding down a job while caring for an infant Had the turnaways not had access to public assistance for women with newborns Foster says they would have experienced greater hardship Though S is not part of Fosters turnaway study she is in many ways typical The same month that she realized she would be having her baby she was confronted with a host of financial hurdles She couldnt move in with her parents because theyd lost their home to foreclosure By late March S exhausted by the pregnancy had stopped working Everyone moved into her older sisters house  a threebedroom onebathroom  where now seven people would be living There was a family meeting S and her baby would take one room her sisters daughter would move into the small playroom the parents would move into the garage Their parents brought 20 years of belongings with them S sold gave away or threw out everything she could but brought her parrot and her dog S who had never seriously considered adoption was overwhelmed when Baby S a healthy girl was born in May 2012 It was like whoa S recalled That first night was terrible I was tired and she was so hungry and she had a very loud cry They dont tell you how hard it is to nurse your baby You dont know how painful it is for something to eat off you and its pulling your skin She developed plugged ducts a condition in which the breasts become painfully engorged with milk Its not unusual for new mothers to have trouble breast feeding but S felt overwhelmed in other ways too This baby is such a crybaby and I didnt know what was going on she said I felt like she didnt love me like maybe she was mad at me S watched bitterly as her family members held a contented Baby S When S held her the baby would begin to cry It went on like that for weeks S sometimes buried her head in her pillow crying when the baby cried Her tone was negative one of Ss sisters remembers She would become angry saying she wished the baby would shut up S wanted to be a good mother so she kept trying to nurse even when she began to develop sores on her breasts Perhaps because of Ss difficulty breastfeeding Baby S wasnt gaining weight Her physician threatened to call social services Through a federal program  Women Infants and Children WIC  S found a lactation consultant who rented her a breast pump and provided her with information on baby formula Once she stopped breastfeeding Baby S began to gain weight One day when Baby S was nearly 3 months old S left her on a pillow at the center of her bed while she went to the bathroom She was gone for about a minute When she came back Baby S was on the floor lying face up whimpering softly S and her mother took the baby to the hospital It turned out nothing was wrong but like many new parents in that situation S was terrified The thought of losing Baby S made her sick From that point on she no longer buried herself under the pillow when her baby cried She didnt let Baby S out of her sight S now says that Baby S is the best thing that ever happened to her She is more than my best friend more than the love of my life S told me glowingly There were white spitup stains on her green top She is just my whole world When I told Foster Ss story she wasnt surprised that S ended up bonding with her baby That would be consistent with our study Foster said About 5 percent of the women after they have had the baby still wish they hadnt And the rest of them adjust Ss experience is also consistent with one of the most striking statistics from Henry Davids Czech study David found that nine years after being denied abortions 38 percent of women said they never sought one in the first place Some would use these data as justification to further restrict abortion  women rarely regret having a child even one they thought they didnt want But as Katie Watson a bioethicist at Northwestern Universitys Feinberg School of Medicine points out we tell ourselves certain stories for a reason Its psychologically in our interest to tell a positive story and move forward she says Its wonderfully functional for women who have children to be glad they have them and for women who did not have children to enjoy the opportunities that afforded them Yet it is still true that being denied an abortion resulted in some measurable negative effects for S She had to give up work and her apartment and her precarious finances became more precarious When women seek abortion you have to ask yourself Foster says what is the alternative they are trying to avoid And how might the life of a turnaway look if shed had the abortion she sought You would need to look at the people who managed to get the abortion and find whether a woman who started out similarly is now in school building a stable relationship career or possibly that later she had a baby she was ready for Talking with Foster I was reminded of a woman I met at a last resort clinic in New Mexico J as I will call her lived in Kansas with her partner and teenage son She was 38 one of the longterm unemployed and struggling to support the child she had She thought she was too old to become pregnant When she missed her period she and her partner drove to a nearby abortion clinic in Oklahoma knowing that they couldnt afford another baby The clinic estimated that J was five weeks pregnant but when they tried to perform an abortion the procedure was not successful Two weeks later J and her partner went to a more specialized clinic in Tulsa and were told that J was actually 23 weeks pregnant past the clinics gestational limit J cried in the parking lot She and her partner drove to Texas where she missed the gestational limit again Finally in New Mexico J was able to terminate her pregnancy A month later J got a job operating heavy machinery at a manufacturing plant for 15 an hour She had been applying for the past six months If she had had the baby she said she wouldnt have been able to take the job They wouldnt have even looked at me Given some of the negative outcomes for turnaways Fosters study raises an uncomfortable question Is abortion a social good Steven D Levitt a University of Chicago economist and coauthor of the book Freakonomics famously argued that the passage of Roe v Wade led directly to a sharp drop in crime during the early 90s women who were able to plan their families gave birth to betteradjusted children The study was widely criticized but the extent to which it was discussed shows the intensity of the desire to understand abortions effect on society Its offensive Foster said of the Levitt study Let people have abortions or they will breed criminals If there is a social good to abortion Foster prefers to frame that good in terms of positive alternatives Maybe women know what is in their own and their familys best interest she said They may be making a choice that they believe is better for their physical and mental health and material wellbeing And they may be making a decision that they believe is better for their kids  the kids they already have andor the kids they would like to have when the time is right Ss baby turned 1 on May 13 She still qualifies for WIC benefits and is still living with her sibling and parents working two days a week Of her living arrangement S says We have had family talks and pretty much come to the conclusion that we are trying to move by the end of the year But we havent really found a place to go What will happen when she leaves her sisters house and she has to support herself and her baby And what about Baby S Will Henry David be right that being born unwanted is a predictor of poor development There is a chance of course that S and her baby will thrive How Fosters turnaway subjects will be affected longterm is still unclear In assessing how women like S and J fare over time Foster plans to look at several variables motherchild bonding whether women who carry unwanted pregnancies to term face lasting economic difficulties how the children of turnaways compare with children who are born later to women who once had abortions The purpose of Fosters study is not to set policy by suggesting new or uniform gestational limits She notes however that there are ways to reduce the number of women seeking abortion at an advanced gestational age by improving access to reproductive health care But Foster sees herself as a scientist not an advocate She did not set out she says to disprove that abortion is harmful If abortion hurts women she says I definitely want to know
Is Forced Fatherhood Fair?,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/is-forced-fatherhood-fair/,"This weekend millions of Americans will happily celebrate the role that fathers play in their families For some families though  specifically those in which dads role was not freely assumed but legally
                                        mandated  Fathers Day can be an emotionally complicated occasion And that somewhat messy reality raises a question that is worth examining today as the very definition of parents and families continues
                                        to undergo legal and social transformation Womens rights advocates have long struggled for motherhood to be a voluntary condition and not one imposed by nature or culture In places where women and girls have access to affordable and safe contraception
                                        and abortion services and where there are programs to assist mothers in distress find foster or adoptive parents voluntary motherhood is basically a reality In many states infant safe haven laws allow a birth
                                        mother to walk away from her newborn baby if she leaves it unharmed at a designated facility
                                         If a man accidentally conceives a child with a woman and does not want to raise the child with her what are his choices Surprisingly he has few options in the United States
                                        He can urge her to seek an abortion but ultimately that decision is hers to make Should she decide to continue the pregnancy and raise the child and should she or our government attempt to establish him as the
                                        legal father he can be stuck with years of child support payments Do men now have less reproductive autonomy than women Â Should men have more control over when and how they become parents as many women now do The political philosopher Elizabeth Brake has argued that our policies should give men who accidentally impregnate a woman more options and that feminists should oppose policies that make fatherhood compulsory In
                                        a 2005 article in the Journal of Applied Philosophy she wrote if womens partial responsibility for pregnancy does not obligate them to support a fetus then mens partial responsibility for
                                        pregnancy does not obligate them to support a resulting child At most according to Brake men should be responsible for helping with the medical expenses and other costs of a pregnancy for which they are
                                        partly responsible Few feminists including Brake would grant men the right to coerce a woman to have or not to have an abortion because they recognize a womans right to control her own body However if a woman decides to
                                        give birth to a child without securing the biological fathers consent to raise a child with her some scholars and policy makers question whether he should be assigned legal paternity Historically it was important for women to have husbands who acknowledged paternity for their children as children born to unmarried parents were deemed illegitimate and had fewer rights than children
                                        born to married parents Today the marital status of a childs parents affects much less that childs future Nevertheless having two legal parents is a significant advantage for a child and establishing
                                        legal paternity for both married and unmarried fathers is a complicated but necessary part of our public policies As more children are born to unmarried parents the social and legal preference for awarding paternity to the mothers husband becomes more outdated When there is a dispute about fatherhood rights and obligations
                                        the courts can use different criteria for assigning legal paternity These include a mans marital or marriagelike relationship with the childs mother his caregiving and support role in the childs
                                        life and his biological relationship to the child The legal scholar Jane Murphy has argued that a new definition of fatherhood is emerging in our laws and court decisions which privileges a mans biological tie to a child over other criteria In a 2005 article
                                        in the Notre Dame Law Review Murphy wrote about paternity disestablishment cases in which men who have assumed the father role in a childs life seek genetic testing to avoid the obligations
                                        of legal fatherhood typically when they break up with the childs mother Her research shows that replacing the limited mothers husband conception of fatherhood with a narrow biologically
                                        based one still leaves many children legally fatherless Furthermore Murphy explains how the new definition of fatherhood is driven by the governments goal of collecting child support from men whose biological offspring are in the welfare system
                                        as well as lawsuits from men aiming to avoid financial responsibility for their dependents Murphy then reasonably proposes that judges and legislators recognize multiple bases for legal fatherhood
                                        and be guided by the traditional goals of family law  protecting children and preserving family stabilityÂ  Murphy argues for revising paternity establishment policies so that fewer
                                        men become legal fathers involuntarily or without understanding the legal responsibilities they are assuming Murphys proposed reforms would apply to men who have different kinds of ties to a child They would protect a nave man who in a moment of exuberance with a girlfriend allows his name to be put on a birth
                                        certificate and a man whose only tie to a child is biological Coercing legal paternity in such cases leads to painful disestablishment battles that are unlikely to be in the best interest of the
                                        child or promote stable family relationships Murphy discusses cases in which legal fathers resort to violence or threats of violence against a mother and her children when child support orders are enforced against
                                        them
                                     I happen to be familiar with the social consequences of forced paternity because my mother worked in the district attorneys office in Santa Clara County Calif in the 1970s and 80s I remember the
                                        stories that she told about mothers on public assistance who lived in fear that a former abuser would return to harm them or their children because of the DAs enforcement of a child support settlement
                                        Coerced paternity in such caseswhere there has been little informed consent at the moment of assigning legal paternityis typically costly to enforce and does not protect children or preserve family
                                        stability
                                     Feminists have long held that women should not be penalized for being sexually active by taking away their options when an accidental pregnancy occurs Do our policies now aim to punish and shame men for their sexual
                                        promiscuity Many of my male students in Miami where I teach who come from lowincome immigrant communities believe that our punitive paternity policies are aimed at controlling their sexual behavior Moreover
                                        the asymmetrical options that men and women now have when dealing with an unplanned pregnancy set up power imbalances in their sexual relationships that my male students find hugely unfair to themÂ Rather than
                                        punish men or women for their apparent reproductive irresponsibility by coercing legal paternity or maternity the government has other options such as mandatory sex education family planning counseling or
                                        community service Courtordered child support does make sense say in the case of a divorce when a man who is already raising a child separates from the childs mother and when the childs mother retains custody of the
                                        child In such cases expectations of continued finiancial support recognize and stabilize a parents continued caregiving role in a childs lifeÂ  However just as courtordered child support
                                        does not make sense when a woman goes to a sperm bank and obtains sperm from a donor who has not agreed to father the resulting child it does not make sense when a woman is impregnated accidentally or possibly
                                        by her choice from sex with a partner who has not agreed to father a child with her In consenting to sex neither a man nor a woman gives consent to become a parent just as in consenting to any activity one
                                        does not consent to yield to all the accidental outcomes that might flow from that activity Policies that punish men for accidental pregnancies also punish those children who must manage a lifelong relationship with an absent but legal father These fathers are not deadbeat dads
                                        failing to live up to responsibilities they once took on  they are men who never voluntarily took on the responsibilities of fatherhood with respect to a particular child We need to respect mens
                                        reproductive autonomy as Brake suggests by providing them more options in the case of an accidental pregnancy And we need to protect children and stabilize family relationships as Murphy suggests by broadening
                                        our definition of father to include men who willingly perform fatherlike roles in a childs life and who with informed consent have accepted the responsibilities of fatherhood

House Panel Advances Bill to Restrict Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/13/us/house-advances-bill-to-limit-abortion-after-22-weeks-of-pregnancy.html,WASHINGTON  Legislation that would outlaw nearly all abortions after the 22nd week of pregnancy was put on a fast track to the House floor on Wednesday after being approved in committee on a partyline vote The 20to12 vote by the House Judiciary Committee on the Republicansponsored PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act is the latest instance in which abortion opponents emboldened by a series of victories in the states have pursued a new legislative strategy that aims to focus public attention on the disputed theory that fetuses can feel pain Delivered or not babies are babies and it has been shown that they can feel pain at least by 20 weeks said Representative Robert W Goodlatte the Virginia Republican who is the chairman of the committee It is time to welcome young children who can feel pain into the human family And this bill at last will do just that A vote by the full House could come as early as next week aides to Republican House leaders said though the bill is virtually certain to go no further because of opposition in the Democraticcontrolled Senate Republicans found themselves once again wading into politically perilous territory on a subject  reproductive rights  that badly tripped them up in the 2012 elections after Republican candidates made indelicate and erroneous comments about rape and contraception Indeed a brief aside before Wednesdays vote from the bills Republican sponsor Representative Trent Franks of Arizona showed how the issue continues to present problems for Republicans Responding to criticism from Democrats that the bill contained no exception for rape victims Mr Franks said that instances of pregnancies from rape were actually very low That prompted an outcry from Democrats on the committee and liberal commentators online who quickly seized on the remark as an example of Republican insensitivities to womens issues After a short recess for lunch Mr Franks returned to the committee meeting to address the matter saying that his words had been distorted He actually said he explained that pregnancies from rape that result in abortion beginning after the sixth month are very rare Democrats swiftly corrected him The exact quote was said Representative Jerrold Nadler of New York the incidents of rape resulting in pregnancy are very low House Democrats and abortion rights proponents seemed to relish the opportunity to once again portray conservatives as antiwoman antiscience and bent on wasting time on another measure that stands no chance of becoming law Representative Hank Johnson of Georgia was one of several Democrats who pointed out that no female Republicans sit on the Judiciary Committee This is a glaring deficiency in the caucus on the other side  no women he said This is 2013 Even before the session turned testy Democrats and Republicans spent the morning debating the issue of unwanted pregnancies Republicans made comparisons to genocide and state execution Democrats told stories of complicated pregnancies that endangered womens lives The legislations purpose is to make abortion illegal once a fetus has developed enough to feel pain It sets a limit of about 22 weeks based on science that is hotly disputed Most medical scientists say the fetal brain has not developed enough at 22 weeks of pregnancy to feel pain Â  The bill would ban abortions 20 weeks after fertilization which in the most common way of dating pregnancies is equal to 22 weeks because pregnancies are typically dated from the first day after a womans last menstrual period Â  The threshold the Supreme Court has set for legal abortions is around 24 weeks which is considered the approximate time of a fetuss viability Legal experts have therefore doubted that the House bill could survive a constitutional challengeÂ 
Whatâ€™s Your Hurry?,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/12/whats-your-hurry/,"Every Supreme Court decision day that goes by without a ruling in the University of Texas affirmative action case provokes
                                        a generalized wringing of hands from those eager or afraid to learn the constitutional future of university admissions Wheres the case Whats taking so long To which I say whats the rush True Fisher v University of Texas was argued way back on Oct 10 making it the oldest argued case on the courts docket by more than six weeks True cases argued as recently as                                        late April have already been decided and its rare for June to arrive with an October case still hanging So Im as puzzled as the next person as to precisely why the eight justices participating in this case Justice Elena Kagan is recused due to her earlier work on the case as solicitor general havent
                                        been able to produce a decision But thats not really my point Rather Im questioning why the justices set out to decide this case in the first place Why were they eager to get their hands around the issue so soon after suggesting in the 2003 decision that upheld raceconscious admission                                        in the University of Michigan Law School that the country and the court should let the matter rest for 25 years Why would they pick a case destined to be decided by an eightmember court a case afflicted with
                                        a major procedural obstacle  the disappointed white applicant has already received her college degree elsewhere a fact that would seem to make the case moot as an earlier more restrained Supreme Court
                                        found 40 years ago when confronted with a similar situation in an affirmative action case it had undertaken to decide
                                         This is a court in a hurry The justices made that strikingly clear back in March when they accepted a case                                        on the validity of a voter referendum in Michigan that barred affirmative action in public university admissions The United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit had declared the ban unconstitutional by
                                        a vote of 8 to 7 By the time the Supreme Court agreed on March 25 to hear the Michigan attorney generals appeal its calendar for the current term was full so the case wont be argued until after
                                        the new term begins in the fall The new case Schuette v Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action differs from the Texas case in presenting an oblique rather than direct attack on affirmative action The question is whether by adding the antiaffirmative
                                        action provision to the state constitution the referendum altered the political process in a way that violates the federal constitutional guarantee of equal protection This political process question
                                        which the court has wrestled with for years wont be answered by what the court does in the Texas case But its hard to imagine that the Texas decision wont provide the lens through which
                                        to examine the issue in the Michigan case  When the justices receive a new appeal that raises questions in the general vicinity of a case they have already agreed to decide their routine response is to place the new case on hold to see how things shake out
                                        It was therefore surprising that rather than deferring action on the Michigan case the court grabbed it  One reason might be that Justice Anthony M Kennedy who almost certainly received the opinion assignment in the Texas case isnt going far enough in that case to satisfy the other conservative justices Under
                                        this theory those justices responded to what they saw as a frustratingly narrow Kennedy opinion by jumping aboard the Michigan case as the next potential vehicle for shutting down affirmative action They might
                                        have waited  traditionally they would have waited  but as I said its a court in a hurry The question is why The answer I believe can be found in the faint but resonant drumbeat of conservative concern about the stability of the Roberts Courts narrow conservative majority Most uninformed commentary
                                        on the future of the Supreme Court  which is to say most commentary  has focused on Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who just passed her 80th birthday Is she about to retire everyone asks to permit
                                        President Obama to name her replacement The answer is no shes healthy and loves her job  This nearobsession with Justice Ginsburgs age health and plans has obscured the fact that the conservative justices are growing old at exactly the same rate Justice Antonin Scalia turned 77 in March Justice
                                        Kennedy turns 77 next month Even Justice Clarence Thomas a mere 43 when he was named to the court 22 years ago becomes eligible on June 23 for his Medicare card Curt Levey a prominent conservative commentator took the occasion of Justice Scalias birthday to observe in a Fox News oped
                                        that it was entirely likely that at least one of the five conservative justices would leave the bench during the remainder of the Obama presidency The result he warned apocalyptically was a Warren Court
                                        redux one that would erase all the strides conservatives have made since the Reagan era in containing judicial activism Mr Levey a Harvard Law School graduate heads an organization called the Committee for Justice devoted to blocking Obama administration judicial nominations His account of exactly what the court under Chief Justice
                                        Earl Warren can be blamed for left a bit to be desired The Warren Court brought us Roe v Wade he asserted In fact it was the Supreme Court under Chief Justice Warren E Burger that issued the
                                        1973 abortion decision with a 7to2 majority opinion joined by three of President Richard M Nixons four appointees including the chief justice Well the details matter less anyway than the overall theme which is be afraid be very afraid Or to put it another way in the words of the old Janis Joplin song
                                        get it while you can This is as good as its going to get That impulse may also explain the courts otherwise mysterious decision a few weeks ago to grant review in a new churchstate case Town of Greece v Galloway
                                        The western New York town is appealing a federal appeals courts decision that its practice of opening town board meetings with a prayer violates the Establishment Clause  The problem that the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit found was not the notion of prayer as such the Supreme Court upheld the concept of legislative prayer                                        30 years ago but the fact that nearly all the prayers offered at the board meetings were Christian with most containing explicit references to Jesus andor Christian theology That pattern the appeals court said
                                        meant that the towns prayer practice must be viewed as an endorsement of a particular religious viewpoint Other federal courts confronted with similar facts have ruled the same way  In recent years the Supreme Court has been able to find nearunanimity in religion cases only by deciding the cases on the narrowest possible grounds So what would motivate the justices to reach for this little case
                                        with its facts that are surely inauspicious for those who want to elevate the role of religion in the public square I suppose the answer is theres nothing to lose and if we dont go for it now
                                        it may only get harder in the years ahead Get it while you can  or even if you cant Well see soon enough"

Keep the Womenâ€™s Rights Bill Intact,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/opinion/keep-the-womens-rights-bill-intact.html,Gov Andrew Cuomo has proposed an excellent 10point bill to protect womens rights in New York State The problem now is that legislators are trying to chip away at his effort piece by piece nibble by nibble State Senate leaders for example are trying to remove crucial sections of the bill that would ensure abortion rights in New York even if the United States Supreme Court erodes or overturns those protections in Roe v Wade Its particularly distressing that Senator Diane Savino who has been an abortion rights proponent and is part of a breakaway group of Democrats in the Senate has said its time to set aside the abortion issue for now and pass the rest of the bill There are others in the Senate and Assembly who are trying to weaken protections including those for young victims of sex trafficking  Some in the Assembly apparently object to raising the penalty for sex trafficking to make it a violent felony crime That is the wrong move They are also wrong to try to remove sections that would make certain drivers who deliver prostitutes in brothels on wheels covered in the trafficking statute And Senate leaders are inexplicably resisting a section that would make sure girls ages 16 and 17 engaging in prostitution would be treated as victims not criminals Governor Cuomos entire bill which pushes for equal pay for women and provides safeguards against housing discrimination among other features deserves to be passed as is With less than a week to go before the official end of the session lawmakers should stop trying to dismantle the Womens Equality Act 
Texas Legislatureâ€™s Special Session: An Emergency Easily Avoided,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/14/us/texas-legislatures-special-session-an-emergency-easily-avoided.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor of The Texas Tribune writes a regular column for the Tribune Special sessions are the emergency rooms of legislation much of the work done there could have been avoided if people had taken some care The issues on the agenda for the current special session are prickly but they could have been addressed during the regular session had state leaders been able to gather legislative support for them They couldnt and now the patients are lined up on tables awaiting attention In the first bed lies redistricting which has been in the same condition since the day after the November elections Here in the second emergency bay is transportation an expensive piece of work stymied by the Legislatures longstanding resistance to new taxes and fees and its strong allergic reaction to debt The adage that everybody wants to go to heaven but nobody wants to die apparently has a government variation everybody wants a strong road system and a ready supply of water but nobody wants to pay for it Gov Rick Perry added a couple of other issues both of which came up during the regular session and after legislative consideration of one kind or another  leaving something ignored on the shelf is a kind of legislative consideration after all  neither one emerged at the end Now theyre in the emergency room Legislation that would tighten regulations for abortion providers and outlaw abortions after the 20th week of pregnancy  heralded by the governor in a midDecember speech before the beginning of the session and scarcely mentioned since  is now on the special session agenda So is legislation to clear up sentencing guidelines for 17yearolds This overtime treatment has an advantage for the people in charge During a regular session lawmakers file thousands of bills and approve more than a thousand pieces of legislation Things get lost in there Its a competition for attention You can pass something thats important and meaningful and never get on the evening news grab a headline or rise above a tweet This is a recognition business Legislators want to do good but they want credit for it so the folks at home  and if theyre lucky across the state  will notice them doing good and reward them for it In a special session the competition for headlines isnt with other legislation but with the rest of the world the Spurs versus the Heat towns running out of water hot housing markets whether the federal government is listening when you order pizza on the phone Lots of people dont even know the State Legislature is meeting Politically active people are tuned in however and the issues on the plate are particularly appealing to partisans The risks of special sessions revolve around deadlines and costs This session began a few minutes after the end of the regular session on May 27 and it comes to an end  whether lawmakers are done or not  on June 25 The House which didnt have anything to do while the redistricting committees were traveling the state hearing public testimony comes back on Monday after a twoweek recess The Senate met twice during the Houses recess without doing any substantive work So the list of things to do is expanding just as time is running out The governor can call lawmakers back as many times as he would like  and at this rate they might be around all summer Thats where cost comes in Some lawmakers have opted out of the daily 150 payments they are each entitled to whenever the Legislature is in session it just doesnt look right to some of them to be paid when there is no work going on With all 181 lawmakers and the lieutenant governor on the payroll the cost is 27300 per day or 819000 for a 30day session Thats barely measurable in the shadow of a 197 billion state budget but it is a big number one that the average voter can understand And if the special sessions drag on with few or no results and the costs mount negative impressions of state officials could rise with them It didnt have to be this way The abortion issue arose early in the regular session The attorney general was pushing for a redistricting vote in March Transportation was an issue before the session even began They just didnt seem like emergencies back then
"Behind Scolding of the F.D.A., a Complex and Gentle Judge",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/health/behind-scolding-of-the-fda-a-complex-and-gentle-judge.html,The judge whose vehement ruling ordered the Obama administration to surrender and make the morningafter pill available to all ages without a prescription is strikingly softspoken so much so that to hear him in chambers a visitor must sometimes lean forward from the raspberryandchartreuse striped sofa that is a legacy from his parents 1940s Brooklyn living room  And for a man who berated the government for acting in bad faith and placing politics over science Judge Edward R Kormans own politics are hard to pigeonhole Conservatives outraged by his ruling might be surprised that he was appointed to his judgeship by President Ronald Reagan and his oath of office was administered by Robert H Bork the conservative who was Judge Kormans early mentor  Defenders of the Obama administration which lost in a case that was not only a landmark for womens reproductive health but also a rare episode of a judge telling a federal agency what to do might be startled that Judge Kormans previous job as a United States attorney came courtesy of President Jimmy Carter and that another champion of his judicial appointment was Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  There are people who are very confused about where he stands politically Judge Korman 70 said He likes it that way  And that is especially true in this case which he calls the most politically charged lawsuit he has handled in 28 years of presiding over many highprofile cases including the Swiss Bank Holocaust reparations case and the 2003 crash of the Staten Island Ferry  He said he understood that the emergency contraception case was controversial because most people did not  rightly so  believe that adolescents should be engaging in activities that required these pills and because there was this view that it operated as an abortifacient  But his ruling noted that very few young girls would actually be using emergency contraceptives and that scientific evidence undercuts the view that the drug can cause an abortion He wrote that age restrictions made it difficult for all women to get timely access to a drug that must be used soon after sexual intercourse to prevent pregnancy  He is a registered Democrat primarily because in New York City most elections are decided in the Democratic primary and if youre not a Democrat youre disenfranchised he said  In legal philosophy I basically share Borks view that the Constitution should be interpreted based on the understanding of the framers of Constitution  When his staff members question a softerthanexpected criminal sentence saying Judge we heard you were conservative he responds with a Bushera term Im a compassionate conservative  His compassion notable in courtroom speeches that have moved his audience to tears springs from two deep wells of experience that Judge Korman has rarely discussed publicly One is his upbringing as a son of Jewish immigrants from the shtetls of Ukraine and Poland who sacrificed their own education to give their only child opportunities  My father  he was always embarrassed about this  he actually ironed shirts not with a Sunbeamtype iron but a heavy iron Judge Korman recalled He would be paid by piecework long hours in a laundry in Manhattan and one of the things he did he made me come and see him working so that I would know how important it was to get an education to make something of my life  The second source of what Judge Korman calls his rachmones a Yiddish term for empathy centers on his own two children especially his 30yearold daughter who is he said severely autistic Caring for his daughter whose autism was diagnosed before much was known about it has been consuming for the judge and his wife Diane and they visit her every Sunday in her group home on Staten Island  There a man whose lifes work involves intricate communication and analysis engages with a daughter who uses only a smattering of words Ive never had a conversation with her he said  A major victory has been teaching her to express the difference between yes and no so she could make preferences clear These sound like little things said Judge Korman his long bony fingers raking through his whitegray puffs of hair But one of the problems that children like that who have no language have is frustration they become selfabusive  Later he sighed and said I dont want to describe how difficult it was at times  Judge Korman said in cases involving disabled children he frequently increased damage awards not only for the child but for the family so that the child should not be viewed as a burden and family members feel theyve also gotten some benefit  Lawyers and judges who know him say Judge Korman is no pushover on the law Brian M Cogan a federal judge and friend said Judge Korman ruminates on issues going back and forth like those old cartoons with the angel on one shoulder and the devil on the other  Janet Crepps a lawyer who represented the plaintiffs in the morningafter pill case said Judge Korman appeared to do his own research even on scientific details in the case We heard that we should always be wellprepared and expect that he would be extremely wellprepared she said  Judge Korman had a Bassett hound Scooter who drove my wife crazy because itd take an hour to walk him around the block  its like he never sniffed that spot before he said But I enjoyed it because Id call a case up in my head and think about how to change it The judges fondness for Basset hounds is evident in his chambers where he has three dozen sculptures stuffed animals and even salt shakers depicting the dogs The judge seems disarmingly modest saying I floundered through college and I dont use my time as efficiently as I should  Claiming that he had received too much credit for the 125 billion Holocaust settlement case he said he was just a catalyst not a cattle prod  Still Judge Korman has repeatedly made a mark frequently by criticizing laws he was statutorily required to uphold Ive often written opinions that say this is wrong and doesnt make senseÂ  he said  Then he mentioned a poem The CalfPath by Sam Walter Foss about how a crooked path made by a wayward calf ended up becoming an official road followed by everyone for centuries For men are prone to go it blind Along the calfpaths of the mind the poem reads  The law depends on precedent but I think judges dont stop often enough to think about whether the path should be followed Judge Korman said adding I try and straighten the calfs path 
These Children Are Our Future,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/opinion/blow-these-children-are-our-future.html,Now that high school graduation season is winding down its worth taking a moment to remember that in the sea of flowing gowns lurk some unsettling statistical realities On many measures of childhood wellbeing the last decade in the United States has been one of stagnation We remain an outlier in many ways among developed countries  This doesnt mean that the United States hasnt made progress in recent memory It has Its just that much of that progress came in the 1990s Since then our progress has slowed or stalled This week the research group Child Trends released a statistical portrait of the high school class of 2013 compiled by a senior researcher David Murphey The numbers were depressing The report imagines a hypothetical class of 100 graduates Of those it estimates that  71 have experienced physical assault 28 have been victimized sexually 10 report that they have been the victims of dating violence in the past year and 10 report they have been raped 32 have experienced some form of child maltreatment 27 were in a physical fight and 16 carried a weapon in the past year   64 have had sexual intercourse 48 are sexually active 27 used a condom and 12 were on birth control pills the last time they had sex 21 percent had a sexually transmitted infection in the past year three or four of the young women have been or are pregnant and one has had an abortion  39 have been bullied physically or emotionally  16 in the past year 29 felt sad and hopeless continually for at least two weeks during the past year 14 thought seriously about attempting suicide and six went through with the attempt  34 are overweight and 22 are living in poverty 10 in deep poverty Those statistics are shameful We have not sufficiently prioritized some fundamental safety structures for children in this country  fighting child poverty supporting all families including singleparent ones and their children through policies like paid family leave and early childhood education insulating children from a culture soaked with violence and educating children fully about sexuality and pregnancy and allowing them open access to a full range of safe sex options which would reduce our extraordinary rate of sexually transmitted disease prevent more unintended pregnancies and reduce the number of abortions  Our problems would be fixable if only we could agree that the protection and healthy development of this countrys children is not only a humanitarian and moral imperative but also an economic and cultural one todays students are tomorrows workers However many conservatives seem too selfish to take the altruistic view and too blind to take the selfinterested one For instance we are among only three countries that have not ratified the United Nations 1989 Convention on the Rights of the Child which Unicef calls the first legally binding international instrument to incorporate the full range of human rights  civil cultural economic political and social rights The other two countries are South Sudan which just became a country in 2011 and Somalia  During a 2008 youth debate between the presidential candidates Barack Obama and John McCain were asked whether they would seek to ratify the treaty Obama responded Its important that the United States return to its position as a respected global leader and promoter of human rights Its embarrassing to find ourselves in the company of Somalia a lawless land I will review this and other treaties and ensure the United States resumes its global leadership in human rights Embarrassing is an understatement but efforts to have the United States ratify the treaty have been met with opposition from Republicans because as Mother Jones reported in 2010 Under the treaty parents would no longer be able to administer reasonable spankings to their childrenÂ the government couldnt sentence teenagers to life in prison kids could get sexed and birth control if they wanted it and  gasp  children would be able to choose their own religion according to a fact sheet published by ParentalRightsorg That year ParentalRightsorg reported that 31 senators were cosponsoring legislation to prevent the United States from ratifying the treaty two other senators signed a letter opposing ratification All of them were Republicans Only eight Republican senators did not sign on to this tomfoolery five of them are now gone from the Senate  When you prefer the company of Somalia on issues of childrens rights and wellbeing you know what your priorities are 
Court in Venezuela Orders Release of a Judge Once Scorned and Jailed by ChÃ¡vez,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/world/americas/court-in-venezuela-orders-release-of-a-judge-once-scorned-and-jailed-by-chavez.html,During the three and a half years that she was held in prison or under house arrest Judge Lourdes Afiuni became a symbol of political persecution for many in Venezuela under President Hugo Chvez On Friday a court in Caracas acting at the governments request ordered Ms Afiuni to be set free in the latest sign of a shifting political landscape in postChvez Venezuela  Ms Afiuni was jailed in December 2009 after issuing a court ruling that infuriated Mr Chvez who went on television and demanded that she be sentenced to 30 years in prison For years Mr Chvez ignored international appeals for her release including from the American leftist intellectual Noam Chomsky  Mr Chvez a charismatic socialist died in March leaving a bitterly divided country  His handpicked successor Nicols Maduro was elected by a slim margin in April and since then has confronted political turmoil and serious economic difficulties that have tested his nascent leadership skills As Mr Maduro lurches from one crisis to the next the quality he seems to have honed most is delivering mixed messages at top volume  He branded President Obama the big boss of the devils and then sent his foreign minister to shake hands with Secretary of State John Kerry and call for warmer relations  He assailed capitalists for causing soaring inflation and rampant product shortages and then sat down with the head of the countrys biggest private company to discuss the economy  And while he has relentlessly vilified the political opposition and the man he edged out in the election Henrique Capriles Radonski as traitors and coup plotters his government has made some moves that could be seen as concessions to longstanding grievances of the opposition which has been demanding Ms Afiunis release  There are lots of mixed signals said Elsa Cardozo a professor of political science at the Central University of Venezuela It is clear the government of President Maduro is in a situation that is forcing it to make some changes in direction What we dont know is if they are permanent changes or tactical changes  But while government opponents have long called for Ms Afiunis release the action may actually be intended to counter an opposition campaign to take its message abroad with leaders visiting countries around the world to make the case that Mr Maduro was unfairly declared the winner of a flawed election and that his government is repressive  The opposition routinely points to Ms Afiuni as the most prominent among a group of what it calls political prisoners who it says were jailed arbitrarily or were convicted in politically motivated trials  I view it as a sign from the government to the outside world the international community that it is trying to show that it is respectful of human rights Jos Vicente Haro a constitutional law expert said of Ms Afiunis release  Ms Afiuni was arrested after she ordered a jailed businessman accused of evading currency controls freed while awaiting trial She has said that the man had been held in custody for longer than Venezuelan law generally permitted under the circumstances and that her ruling complied with a recommendation by United Nations human rights monitors  Her lawyer Jos Amalio Graterol confirmed reports last year that she was raped while in prison became pregnant and had an abortion which led to other health problems She was moved to house arrest in Caracas in 2011  Ms Afiunis trial began last November and is continuing although she has refused to attend it  Last week the national prosecutors office made a surprise announcement that it had asked a court to release Ms Afiuni from house arrest citing her need for medical treatment The prosecutor asked the court to require her to report to the authorities every 15 days and to bar her from leaving the country and speaking to the news media  A judge never should have been imprisoned for three years and six months for issuing a decision in accordance with the law Ms Afiunis lawyer Mr Graterol said Friday adding that her case had intimidated other judges who feared defying the government 
Turkeyâ€™s False Nostalgia,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/17/opinion/turkeys-false-nostalgia.html,ISTANBUL  THE demonstrators who have filled the streets of Istanbul and other Turkish cities for nearly three weeks complain that Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogans Justice and Development Party known as the AKP has adopted an increasingly authoritarian attitude that threatens basic freedoms They also resent his tendency to meddle in the personal lives of citizens  by condemning abortion or trying to control the sale and consumption of alcohol  But Mr Erdogan isnt the first Turkish leader to have flirted with authoritarianism and social engineering This is important to remember since many of his opponents tend to hark back to a nostalgic past best illustrated by the profusion of Turkish flags and images of the republics founder Mustafa Kemal Ataturk  Before claiming that Mr Erdogans moves can be countered by returning to the foundations of the secular republic we should recall that Turkey was not a democracy until 1950 that it was ruled consecutively from 1923 to 1946 by two unchallenged leaders Ataturk and Ismet Inonu each invested with dictatorial powers and that its democracy was interrupted three times by military coups or interventions in 1960 1971 and 1980 not to mention a failed one in 1997 Moreover Turkish secularism often marginalized and oppressed those who openly displayed their beliefs headscarfwearing women were banned from universities and few protections were given to religious minorities  Turkeys past has little to offer in terms of democratic inspiration Ironically there is hardly any difference between the nostalgia for Ataturkera secularism and the AKPs glorification of the Ottoman imperial past Both rest on the reinvention of an imagined golden age  the former with a secularist emphasis and the latter with a focus on Islamic identity And both look back fondly on authoritarian regimes which makes them all the less credible as political models for a democratic present and future The current protest movement isnt about the past it is about today and tomorrow It started because a new generation wanted to defend Gezi Park a public green space against the violent abusive manner in which the government sought to sacrifice it to the gods of neoliberalism and neoOttomanism with a plan to build a replica of Ottoman barracks a shopping mall and apartments  The real challenge for the protesters therefore is to ensure that this movement is not hijacked by a Kemalist backlash that seeks to reduce Turkeys complex social problems to a simplistic dichotomy between Islam and secularism What Mr Erdogan is currently undermining and destroying isnt an imagined golden age of a secular and democratic Turkey which never really existed but rather the tat de grce that followed his partys first electoral victory in 2002 For five or six years the AKP used democracy as its only defense against the authoritarian ways of the old guard  the coalition formed by the secular political parties and the army long considered the guarantor of secularism It is disturbing that Mr Erdogan after years of successfully fighting the legacy of military control has now chosen to revive precisely the same methods and strategies that characterized his predecessors rule Banking on the combined power of religion and nationalism in a country whose population is known for its conservative attitudes on both counts he is seeking to do with the help of the police what previous governments did with the help of the army Just as it seemed that the protesters had sealed their victory and forced the government to recognize their legitimacy another brutal police crackdown began on Saturday evening To make matters worse Mr Erdogan is now inciting and mobilizing his own supporters in a dangerous game of intimidation and escalation Unless moderates in his own party abandon their unquestioning submission to his leadership and speak out the situation could deteriorate further  Turkey has come to a point where the government setting aside timid attempts at conciliation seems intent on waging allout war against any opposition to its policies A crisis that could have been managed through a democratic process has now escalated to a frightening level of polarization and violence  AKP leaders need to understand that true secular democracy is the only viable way to guarantee the rights and freedoms of all citizens including Muslims And Mr Erdogans opponents must grasp that true secularism contrary to its earlier Kemalist incarnation requires that the principles of democracy be applied to all members of society Unfortunately the new egalitarian discourses rising from Gezi Park risk being drowned out in the clamor of an outdated political struggle
G.O.P. Pushes New Abortion Limits to Appease Vocal Base,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/us/politics/undaunted-by-2012-elections-republicans-embrace-anti-abortion-agenda.html,WASHINGTON  After Republicans lost the presidential election and seats in both the House and the Senate last year many in the party offered a stern admonishment If we want to broaden our appeal steer clear of divisive social and cultural issues Yet after the highprofile murder trial of an abortion doctor in Philadelphia this spring many Republicans in Washington and in state capitals across the country seem eager to reopen the emotional fight over a womans right to end a pregnancy Their efforts will move to the forefront on Tuesday when House Republicans plan to bring to the floor a measure that would prohibit the procedure after 22 weeks of pregnancy  the most restrictive abortion bill to come to a vote in either chamber in a decade The bill stands no chance of becoming law with Democrats in control of the Senate and the White House Republican leaders acknowledge that its purpose is to satisfy vocal elements of their base who have renewed a push for greater restrictions on reproductive rights even if those issues harmed the partys reputation with women in 2012 But beyond Washington advocates on both sides of the issue say the chance to limit abortion in the near future is very real Republicandominated state legislatures in South Carolina and Wisconsin are weighing bans similar to the one the House will vote on which would impose the 22week limit based on the scientifically disputed theory that fetuses at that stage of development can feel pain  The measures stand a reasonable chance of passing in both states as well as in Texas where last week Gov Rick Perry added abortion restrictions to the Legislatures agenda Conservatives are pushing for a vote by next week Already this year Arkansas and North Dakota have passed even more restrictive bans in attempts to directly challenge Supreme Court precedent Much of the movement in recent weeks can be linked to the outcry over the case of Dr Kermit Gosnell the Philadelphia physician who was convicted last month of firstdegree murder for cutting the spines of babies after botched abortions His case coming on top of successful efforts to curtail reproductive rights in several states over the last three years has reinvigorated the antiabortion movement to a degree not seen in years advocates on both sides of the issue said These laws are flying through said Elizabeth Nash a policy analyst for the Guttmacher Institute a research group that supports access to abortions The attention has really been at the state level around abortion issues Now what you also see at the federal level is very disturbing and it shows that abortion opponents are very emboldened Douglas Johnson legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee called the House bill the most significant legislation on abortion at the federal level since 2003 when Congress passed a ban on a type of lateterm procedure that opponents call partialbirth abortion On the eve of the House vote the Obama administration released a statement late Monday opposing the bill saying it shows contempt for womens health and rights Aware of the risks inherent in abortion politics Republican leaders have moved to insulate themselves from Democrats criticism that they are opening a new front in the war on women Representative Marsha Blackburn Republican of Tennessee will manage the debate on the bill when it reaches the House floor a role that would customarily go to the sponsor Representative Trent Franks of Arizona And in a lastminute revision House leaders slipped in a provision that would allow for a limited exception in cases of rape or incest but only if the woman had reported the crime Still the reemergence of abortion as a driving issue among the conservative base has left some moderate Republicans baffled I think its a stupid idea to bring this up said Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania The economy is on everybodys minds Were seeing stagnant job numbers Confidence in the institution in government is eroding And now were going to have a debate on rape and abortion Mr Dent said the party risked opening itself up to another Akin eruption a reference to Todd Akin a Missouri congressman who was defeated last year in a Senate race after saying womens bodies could block a pregnancy after a legitimate rape Indeed Republicans had an unpleasant reminder last week of how perilous the politics of reproductive rights can be when Mr Franks defended his bills lack of an exception for rape by saying incidents of pregnancy after rape were very low This occurred at a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee which Democrats noted with some satisfaction contained not a single woman on the Republican side But most of the Republican rank and file and their leaders in Congress are solidly behind the bill arguing that voters back home are clamoring to see something done after the Gosnell case Were hearing from a lot of people who are appalled Ms Blackburn said pointing to surveys showing that nearly twothirds of the public opposes legal secondtrimester abortions They feel like this is an appropriate step in this discussion Unlike other major policy questions that Democrats and Republicans are fighting over this year like samesex marriage and background checks for gun buyers Democrats do not find themselves with either overwhelming public opinion on their side or a favorable shift in sentiment  House Republicans reject the notion that they are ignoring the lessons of 2012 by not focusing on a message of growth and opportunity as the partys introspective postelection report recommended While we continue to be focused on that Speaker John A Boehner said in defense there are other important issues that we have to deal with And after the Kermit Gosnell case and the publicity that it received I think the legislation is appropriate One thing is certain  the bill is a violation of Supreme Court precedent The court has ruled that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus could live outside the womb generally starting around 24 weeks of pregnancy The bill before the House called the PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act would ban abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization In the most common way of measuring pregnancies that is equal to 22 weeks because pregnancies are typically dated from the first day of a womans last menstrual period Similar laws that banned abortions at or near 22 weeks have been enacted in 11 states since 2010 In Georgia Idaho and Arizona which enacted an 18week postfertilization ban courts have blocked them These measures are very different from previous attempts to limit abortion because they are based on an argument that is rooted in the belief held by a minority in the medical community that fetuses begin to feel pain around 20 weeks Most scientists however believe that the nervous system is not developed enough to register pain until later in pregnancy The first law of this kind passed in Nebraska in 2010 And after the Republican wave of victories in elections that year more states began passing them In 2011 92 laws limiting the procedure went into effect The previous record had been fewer than 40 Last year there were 43 according to Guttmacher The House has taken up abortion regulations in the last few years but none have been as expansive or restrictive since Congress passed the Partial Birth Abortion Ban Act in 2003 And there are signs that the antiabortion push will continue Last month the House Judiciary Committee and the House Energy and Commerce Committee sent separate queries to all 50 states about abortion practices and the enforcement of current laws We look at these projects somewhat longterm said Mr Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee 
Cuomo Says Abortion and Anticorruption Bills Arenâ€™t Likely to Pass Legislature,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/18/nyregion/cuomo-says-abortion-and-anticorruption-bills-arent-likely-to-pass-legislature.html,ALBANY  Gov Andrew M Cuomo acknowledged on Monday that two of his priorities  enshrining abortion rights more firmly into state law and enacting new anticorruption laws  were not likely to be taken up by the Legislature this year In a radio interview Mr Cuomo said he did not expect the lawmakers to approve either measure before Thursday when they are scheduled to adjourn for the year The governor and legislators were still discussing several other issues including a proposal to ask voters to authorize the expansion of casino gambling and a plan to offer taxfree space on college campuses for businesses that are starting up or expanding  On Monday afternoon the governor met with legislative leaders to continue negotiations The developments of the day reflected an increasingly embittered mood in Albany Tainted by a series of corruption scandals and at loggerheads over the highestprofile legislative issues lawmakers seem eager simply to return home  Mr Cuomo who in the past has been successful in persuading the Legislature to get behind his agenda has had a harder time in recent months And a poll released by Siena College on Monday found him with his lowest jobperformance rating 50 percent since he took office In a sign of tension between the governor and legislative leaders Mr Cuomo said on Monday that he intended to appoint a commission to investigate the role of money in the states political system He said the commission was necessary because lawmakers were refusing to pass a package of anticorruption measures that he had proposed after the arrests of several lawmakers this spring The governor has also proposed a public matching funds program for state campaigns that he said would reduce the influence of big donors critics on the left however said he had not seriously pressed the measure while critics on the right opposed the use of matching funds for that purpose This has been an ugly few weeks here in Albany and it has shaken the public trust the governor said on the public radio program The Capitol Pressroom  He added People feel that there are questions and I want them to feel confident and Im not going to do a halfbaked bill Mr Cuomo is a Democrat Both the abortion and campaign finance proposals have been supported in the Assembly which is controlled by Democrats But they have faced a harder time in the Senate which is controlled by an unusual coalition of Republicans and a faction of breakaway Democrats He proposed passing the abortion measure as part of a 10part Womens Equality Act that would also address pay equality sexual harassment and human trafficking  Republicans have objected to the abortion language so on Sunday the leader of the breakaway Senate Democrats Jeffrey D Klein of the Bronx introduced a womens rights package that omitted the abortion provision In an interview Senator Klein said that as of Monday there were not enough votes to pass the abortion measure and he questioned why advocates and lawmakers were willing to sacrifice the other provisions in the womens rights package  We have to come to terms with the fact that the Republican conference in New York State in the State Senate is a righttolife conference Mr Klein said The governor needs to step up his game show some leadership and identify votes in the Republican conference just as he did with the marriage equality vote He added Im not going to bring a bill to the floor to fail But in the interview on Monday Mr Cuomo said the coalition of womens groups that had sought the package of legislation had concluded that if the abortion component was not included they did not want a scaleddown proposal  The Assembly Democratic majority and the mainline Senate Democratic conference also said they would only support a package that included the abortion language which was intended to codify the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade ruling into state law Andrea Miller the president of Naral ProChoice New York accused Mr Klein of giving cover to the Senate Republicans Its simply not good enough to say youre prochoice and then refuse the one moment when you have an opportunity to take an absolute crystalclear vote she said  You have that moment and youre going to walk away from that You cannot call yourself prochoice Mr Kleins role in the expected failure of the abortion and campaign finance measures was the subject of much discussion on Monday  Mr Klein a former deputy leader of the Senate Democrats joined forces with Republicans before the start of the legislative session to form a coalition that would govern the chamber after Democrats won a numerical majority in the November election Mr Cuomo tartly referred to the breakaway legislators as theoretically Democrats on Monday  The coalition of womens groups broadcast a television advertisement in Mr Kleins district over the weekend accusing him of blocking a vote on the abortion measure and a socalled super PAC that was cofounded by Jonathan Soros said it was prepared to support one or more primary challenges to members of the breakaway caucus Theyre choosing their own relationship and power with the Republican leader over what the voters of the state want said David Donnelly another founder of the super PAC Friends of Democracy It boils down to that Whats more important serving your constituents or your own power Mr Klein said his caucus would continue to push for public financing and described the criticism from

"In Partisan Vote, House Approves Ban on Abortions After 22 Weeks",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/us/politics/in-partisan-vote-house-acts-to-limit-abortions.html,WASHINGTON  The House of Representatives on Tuesday approved the most restrictive ban on abortion considered by Congress in a decade a largely symbolic vote that laid bare the deep ideological differences between Democrats and Republicans The measure which would ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the medically disputed theory that fetuses at that stage of development are capable of feeling pain passed in a 228to196 vote that broke down mostly along party lines Reflecting how little common ground the two parties share these days just six Republicans voted against the bill six Democrats voted for it Im not waging a war on anyone said Kristi Noem Republican of South Dakota offering a rejoinder to the Democratic assertion that Republicans have waged a war on women a line of attack that harmed conservative candidates in 2012 Regardless of your personal beliefs I would hope that stopping atrocities against little babies is something we can all agree to put an end to The bill has no chance in the Democratcontrolled Senate and was put forward by the House Republican leadership in response to demands from antiabortion lawmakers The tableau in the House chamber on Tuesday was intentionally far different from the scene last week at a meeting of the House Judiciary Committee at which all 19 of the Republicans arguing for and then voting to approve the bill were men Republican leaders made sure that their female members were front and center for the debate this time Representative Virginia Foxx a North Carolina conservative and Tea Party favorite and Representative Marsha Blackburn a longtime abortion opponent from Tennessee were assigned to manage the floor debate Representative Candice S Miller of Michigan and Representative Ileana RosLehtinen one of the Republican conferences more moderate members controlled the gavel But the simple math was difficult to ignore Only 19 of the 234 Republican House members are women Nearly all of them spoke on Tuesday Only three Republican men were allowed to participate in the debate Notably Trent Franks of Arizona the bills sponsor who last week caused an uproar after claiming that instances of pregnancy after rape were very low said nothing from the floor Representative Carolyn B Maloney Democrat of New York brought with her a blownup photo of the Republican side of the room during last weeks Judiciary Committee meeting Gesturing to it with her hand she cried out Where were the women  As politically charged as the debate was it was also at times heavy with emotion Ms Foxx nearly broke down in tears at one point May we mourn what abortion reveals about the conscience of our nation she said her voice quivering as she noted that none of her colleagues had acknowledged that half of those aborted are female We go to extraordinary lengths to save not only human beings but even animals because we value life so much However there are many who do not hold the unborn in the same esteem Even if Democrats believed the political upper hand was theirs as they used the issue of reproductive rights to portray their opponents yet again as hostile and indifferent to the needs of women it was clear that the question at hand  the termination of pregnancies that are five months or more along  was an uncomfortable one At a news conference Tuesday morning led by Democrats who favor abortion rights the mood quickly turned tense after two journalists tried to press the representatives about their support for lateterm abortions Representative Diana DeGette of Colorado cut off questions after being asked whether she would draw the line at legal abortion later in pregnancy The Supreme Court has spoken and this bill is unconstitutional Next question she said The debate was marked by graphic descriptions of abortion procedures and medical claims Representative Michael C Burgess a Texas Republican who practiced as an obstetrician before joining Congress appeared to suggest that male fetuses are capable of fondling themselves They have movements that are purposeful Mr Burgess said during a debate of the bill during the House Rules Committee meeting on Monday They stroke their face If theyre a male baby they may have their hand between their legs I mean they feel pleasure why is it so hard to think that they could feel pain Democrats used the debate to mock Republicans claims that their focus was on the economy and job growth They repeatedly interrupted the floor proceedings to make rhetorical jabs that were masked as parliamentary inquiries like asking when the House was scheduled to take up the student loan interest rate bill or why a Republican member of the Judiciary Committee was not managing debate on the bill which is customary Another day without a jobs bill another day without a budget agreement another day ignoring the top priorities of the American people said Nancy Pelosi the Democratic leader Once again Republicans refuse to listen Speaker John A Boehner called the legislation the most significant prolife legislation to come before Congress since enactment of the ban on partialbirth abortions We have a moral obligation to defend the defenseless and we will continue to fight to ensure our nations laws respect the sanctity of unborn human life
Irish Lawmakers Expected to Approve Limited Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/world/europe/irish-lawmakers-expected-to-approve-limited-abortion.html,DUBLIN  The Irish Parliament is expected to legalize limited abortion before its summer break after the publication of final government proposals that would allow terminations in cases when there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother including the threat of suicide In the face of intense opposition from the Roman Catholic Church and antiabortion groups Prime Minister Enda Kenny has pushed ahead with the changes while disallowing members of his party a free vote on conscience grounds Given the large government majority in favor of the legislation barring unforeseen circumstances it will pass into law The measure called the Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 would allow for an abortion when the life of the mother was threatened or if there was a possibility of suicide It also details the circumstances in which health professionals may carry out a termination One doctor would be required in the case of a medical emergency two when there is a physical threat to the life of the mother and three  either an obstetrician or a gynecologist and two psychiatrists  when there may be a risk of suicide Ahead of publication of the proposed legislation last week the Catholic Bishops issued a statement condemning it saying that no state has the right to undermine the right to life The church is calling on all Catholics including political representatives to oppose the bill but has stopped short of threatening excommunication for those who do not vote against it Mr Kenny has said opposition to the measure led to his being branded a murderer Antiabortion groups are promising to step up their efforts Niamh Ui Bhriain a spokeswoman for the Life Institute described the legislation as barbaric and said Mr Kennys assertions of harassment were a lame attempt to deflect from the grim reality of the abortion bill Much of the criticism of the bill has centered on the suicide provision which opponents characterize as a stalking horse that would open the door to abortion on demand Seeking to head this off the drafters included a section in which anyone found guilty of destroying unborn human life would face up to 14 years in prison It would apply to everyone involved including the pregnant woman While medical practitioners could still refuse to carry out a termination as a matter of conscience they would be obliged to arrange the transfer of an eligible case to the care of a colleague who was willing to carry out the procedure Hospitals even those governed by a religious ethos would not be allowed to opt out The bill was published on the same day as an official report into the death in a Galway hospital of Savita Halappanavar a young Indian dentist who was denied a potentially lifesaving abortion during a miscarriage while she was 17 weeks pregnant because the current guidelines do not allow a termination while a fetal heartbeat is present The interpretation of the law related to lawful termination in Ireland and particularly the lack of clear clinical guidelines and training is considered to have been a material contributory factor in this regard the report said Her death infuriated the public and emboldened the government to enact the legislation which would codify a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that allows abortion in certain circumstances
Postcard From Turkey,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/19/opinion/friedman-postcard-from-turkey.html,ISTANBUL  Having witnessed the Egyptian uprising in Tahrir Square in Cairo in 2011 I was eager to compare it with the protests by Turkish youths here in Taksim Square in 2013 They are very different The Egyptians wanted to oust President Hosni Mubarak Theirs was an act of revolution The Turks are engaged in an act of revulsion They arent yet trying to throw out their democratically elected Islamist prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan What theyre doing is calling him out Their message is simple Get out of our faces stop choking our democracy and stop acting like such a pompous overbearing modernday Sultan  The Turks took to the streets initially to protect one of Istanbuls few green spaces Gezi Park from being bulldozed for an Erdogan project They took to the streets because the prime minister  who has dominated Turkish politics for the last 11 years and still has strong support with the more religious half of Turkey  has stifled dissent Erdogan has used tax laws and other means to intimidate the press and opponents into silence  CNN Turk at first refused to cover the protests opting instead to air a show on penguins  and the formal parliamentary opposition is feckless So in a move that has intriguing implications Turkish youths used Twitter as their own news and communications network and Gezi Park and Taksim Square as their own parliament to become the real opposition In doing so they sent a message to Erdogan In todays flat world nobody gets to have oneway conversations anymore Leaders are now in a twoway conversation with their citizens Erdogan who is surrounded by yesmen got this lesson the hard way On June 7 he declared that those who try to lecture us about the Taksim crackdown what did they do about the Wall Street incidents Tear gas the death of 17 people happened there What was the reaction In an hour the American Embassy in Turkey issued a statement in English and Turkish via Twitter rebutting Erdogan No US deaths resulted from police actions in OWS a reference to Occupy Wall Street No wonder Erdogan denounced Twitter as societys worst menace  Three Turks in America responded to the events in Istanbul by starting a funding campaign on Indiegogocom that bought a fullpage ad in The New York Times supporting the protests According to Forbes they received donations from 50 countries at a clip of over 2500 per hour over its first day crossing its 53800 goal in about 21 hours  Whats sad is that Erdogans arrogance autocratic impulses and lately use of antiSemitic tropes are soiling what has been an outstanding record of leadership His Islamist party has greatly improved health care raised incomes built roads and bridges improved governance and pushed the Army out of politics But success has gone to his head He has been lecturing or trying to restrict Turks on where and when they can drink alcohol how many children each woman should have 3 the need to ban abortions the need to ban Caesarean sections and even what docudramas they should watch The Turkish daily Zaman on Monday published a poll showing that 544 percent of Turks thought the government was interfering in their lifestyle While the parents were cowed the kids lost their fear I walked with protesters on the streets of Istanbul on Saturday when the police armed with fire hoses and tear gas cleared Gezi Park The pavement literally shook with the energy of young people telling Erdogan to back off Or as Ilke 30 an aerospace engineer standing next to me remarked  before we were scattered by tear gas  They are trying to make rules about religion and to force them on everyone Democracy is not just about what the majority wants Its also what the minority wants Democracy is not just about elections  Erdogan like Russias Vladimir Putin confuses being in power with having power argued Dov Seidman whose company LRN advises CEOs on governance and who is the author of the book How There are essentially just two kinds of authority formal authority and moral authority he added And moral authority is now so much more important than formal authority in todays interconnected world where power is shifting to individuals who can easily connect and combine their power exponentially for good or ill You dont get moral authority just from being elected or born said Seidman Moral authority is something you have to continue to earnÂ by how you behave by how you build trust with your people  Every time you exercise formal authority  by calling out the police  you deplete it Every time you exercise moral authority leading by example treating people with respect you strengthen it  Any leader who wants to lead just by commanding power over people should think again he added In this age the only way to effectively lead is to generate power through people said Seidman because you have connected with them in a way that earned their trust and enlisted them in a shared vision Can Erdogan learn these lessons Turkeys nearterm stability and his legacy hang on the answer

Casino Referendum Planned by New York Leaders,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/nyregion/casino-referendum-planned-by-new-york-leaders.html,ALBANY  Gov Andrew M Cuomo and legislative leaders have agreed to ask voters in November to amend the State Constitution to allow a significant expansion of casino gambling Although voters would be asked to authorize as many as seven new casinos the governor and legislators said they would also approve a law allowing at least for the next seven years only four located in the Catskills the Albany area and the Southern Tier region along the border with Pennsylvania  If voters approve the constitutional amendment New York would become the most populous state in the nation with fullscale Las Vegasstyle casinos with table games like craps and roulette New York already has five upstate casinos owned by Indian tribes and as well as nine racetracks with electronic gambling also known as racinos The new casinos would not be near the tribal casinos or in New York City and its suburbs On Wednesday Mr Cuomo called casinos a critical part of a larger effort to revitalize the economies of longsuffering upstate regions along with taxfree zones at state universities and a financial restructuring board He said the casino legislation was about gaming and gaming is about tourism and tourism is about jobs  But the referendum is far from a sure thing A Quinnipiac University poll earlier this month showed that 48 percent of New York voters favored amending the Constitution to allow expanded casino gambling Support was even weaker in New York City a dynamic that poses a potential challenge to supporters of expanded gambling because the mayoral race is expected to mean higher turnout in the city than in other parts of the state Its pretty much a standoff said Maurice Carroll the director of the Quinnipiac University Polling Institute Businesses and organizations with strong interests in gambling have been spending millions on lobbying and political contributions in Albany to influence lawmakers on whether to reject or accept the expansion According to an analysis by the New York Public Interest Research Group a government watchdog group these groups with gambling interests have given nearly 2 million to statewide campaign committees candidates and parties  One of those donors is Genting New York which runs a successful slot parlor at the Aqueduct racetrack in Queens Genting has donated more than 125000 to dozens of Republican and Democratic candidates since the 2010 election The new casino deal would effectively ensure the companys monopoly in the borough for at least seven years and on Wednesday the company said it fully supported the governors goals of upstate job creation and economic development outlined in the proposal Mr Cuomo has also seemingly neutralized some of the potential instate opposition in part by striking three recent deals with Indian tribes to settle longsimmering contract disputes and other issues Those tribes which received geographic exclusivity for their gambling operations could have been potent financial backers of a no campaign  Another potential opponent  the New York Gaming Association which represents the states racinos  indicated that the proposal was a great improvement after the governor and leaders made several changes to protect the racetracks the associations president James Featherstonehaugh said  A casino referendum would quite likely be opposed by some religious groups and people who oppose gambling as a form of regressive taxation and possibly by the operators of casinos in neighboring states who fear competition from expanded casino gambling in New York Dennis Poust a spokesman for the New York State Catholic Conference said on Wednesday that the states bishops were concerned about the impact of compulsive gambling as well as social ills associated with casinos like crime and prostitution The casino bill introduced late on Tuesday and announced on Wednesday would also permit 2000 new video lottery terminals  similar to slot machines  at offtrackbetting parlors in Nassau and Suffolk Counties a plan backed by Dean G Skelos the Long Island Republican who shares leadership of the State Senate with a group of breakaway Democrats  The casino issue was not the only one being settled during the last days of the legislative session Late on Tuesday the governor split his 10point Womens Equality Act which includes a measure strengthening the states guarantee of abortion rights into 10 standalone bills after previously insisting that all 10 points be included in a single piece of legislation  Mr Cuomo said on Wednesday that he did not want lawmakers to be able to cite procedural reasons for skipping a vote If they dont vote its because they dont want to vote he said and a nonvote is a no vote Mr Cuomo anticipating lawmakers would not take up his proposals to address corruption in the Legislature also said on Wednesday that he would name a commission to investigate campaign fundraising by state elected officials
Preparing for the Pope,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/opinion/arana-preparing-for-the-pope.html,In April in the sunlit city of Natal Brazil two men knocked on Sandra Abdallas door to apply for a painting job Their pitch as she described it in an email they were evangelical Christians and therefore more reliable than the competition They didnt drink raise hell or steal as a Catholic might In a country that boasts the largest Roman Catholic population in the world  and a quickly rising tide of evangelicals  those are fighting words Not least to Pope Francis an Argentine who will visit Brazil next month in the first trip of his papacy The new pontiff represents many beginnings first Latin American first Jesuit first to take the name of St Francis of Assisi first to hail from the Southern Hemisphere first nonEuropean in 1272 years His election represents a clear shift in Catholicisms center of gravity away from Europe almost 40 percent of Catholics today live in Latin America and the Caribbean about 28 percent are in Asia or Africa in 1910 65 percent were European The choice also signals a church in fighting mode As the late Rev Edward L Cleary an American specialist in Latin American politics put it the future of the Catholic Church lies south of the border It is counting on Latin America to save its soul For 500 years since the cross was planted in the Western Hemisphere  since the first American priest received his holy orders  the Latin American church has been defined by race and class Bartolom de las Casas the first priest to be ordained in the New World around 1513 and the first to denounce the oppression of indigenous Americans turned the theology upside down Instead of the topdown rigid hierarchy practiced in Rome he wanted a grassroots perspective The Jesuits selfproclaimed soldiers of God agreed For the next 260 years they often aligned with the continents Indians and as a result were booted out by Portuguese and Spanish officials in the 1750s and 1760s Two centuries later in the 1960s as Communism made inroads Latin American priests rode the winds of the Second Vatican Council to focus anew on poverty and social justice A fullfledged liberation theology followed and for preaching it many were excommunicated some by Franciss predecessor Benedict XVI who retired in February Latin America remains fervently Catholic  the church boasts the regions highest level of confidence in any institution around 70 percent  but there is evidence that it may be losing ground to evangelicals like those who knocked on the Abdallas door Pentecostals who numbered 12 million in the 1970s along with Charismatic Christians today make up an estimated 75 million That is a mere 13 percent of the overall population but in Brazil those new evangelicals represent one in four Brazilians Thats serious erosion But according to Rogelio Saenz dean of the College of Public Policy at the University of Texas San Antonio and a specialist on Catholic demographics Francis may turn the tide A Latin American pope will bring a greater degree of attachment to the church It makes no difference that hes Argentine He is embraced Saenz says because he promises greater inclusion Within hours of the popes election in March a major supermarket chain in Lima Peru was giving out prayer cards with his image The faithful danced and sang in the streets of Quito Ecuador Ecstatic graffiti appeared on slum walls in Buenos Aires where Francis as Cardinal Jorge Bergoglio was archbishop Prayer circles proliferated throughout the Americas Banners flapped out of windows Airlines have been selling out of plane tickets to Brazil in advance of the visit The presidents of Mexico Uruguay Ecuador and Venezuela rushed to deepen ties with the Vatican For all the guesswork about the popes Sphinxlike comments about a gay lobby or his elliptical suggestion that priestly celibacy could change Latin Americans expect concrete outcomes from their pontiff a revival of concern for the poor a renewed effort to rebuild the church as St Francis was called to do a rejection of the blind pursuit of profit that the pope argues has scarred the human spirit Brazil  with a woman as president a cabinet that is a quarter female and businesses with robust female leadership that puts the United States to shame  will expect much from a man who has emphasized the importance of women Most of all however Latin American Catholics who are largely social conservatives will look to Francis for a return to core values honoring the poor the helpless the unborn the family the environment the Commandments All this even though developing countries have some of the worlds highest abortion rates even though gay men and lesbians are knocking at the door even though the profit motive has created an economic boom As Sylvia Koehne a homemaker and cousin of mine in Lima told me Faith in our new pope is great So much so that we Latin Americans may now end up evangelizing Europe as avidly as it once evangelized us
A Nation Divided Against Itself,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/20/opinion/blow-a-nation-divided-against-itself.html,Along with  and because of  dramatic social and demographic changes America is quickly dividing itself into two separate nations regional enclaves of rigid politics as the idea of common national priorities fades further into a distant past Rich Morin a senior editor at the Pew Research Center wrote about a new study on public opinion on Wednesday and found that Americans often say they want their representatives in Congress to put the countrys needs over local concerns But four novel experiments suggest that the public does just the opposite He continued Respondents rated a member of Congress far more favorably if the lawmaker put the interests of his or her district or state over those of the country as a whole He concluded in part with this damning line The studys author says legislators who nobly put national preferences ahead of local ones will be punished by constituents Heres why this is so problematic on a state level and even on a county and community level we as a country continue to selfsort into ideological islands According to the author Bill Bishop who in 2008 published The Big Sort Why the Clustering of LikeMinded America is Tearing Us Apart In 1976 only about a quarter of Americas voters lived in a county a presidential candidate won by a landslide margin By 2004 it was nearly half And the countrys seismic demographic and cultural shifts threaten to make our tribalism permanent There has been the rapid rise of minority populations and stagnation in the growth of the nonHispanic white population in this country Now nonwhites represent a majority of all births in America and last week The New York Times reported on census data that revealed that deaths exceeded births among nonHispanic white Americans for the first time in at least a century In fact according to an Associated Press report last week which cited government reports For the first time Americas racial and ethnic minorities now make up about half of the under5 age group But there were also some worrisome statistics in the report that could help to signal those childrens views on policy According to the report Black toddlers were most likely to be poor at 41 percent followed by Hispanics at 32 percent and whites at 13 percent Asian toddlers had a poverty rate of 11 percent As a Pew Research Center report found in 2009 while top earners those earning 100000 or more were almost evenly split among Democrats independents and Republicans the lowest earners those making 20000 or less were more than twice as likely to be Independents than Republicans and were nearly three times as likely to be Democrats than Republicans Furthermore what constitutes a family and who is seen as the head of that family has also changed According to a March report titled Knot Yet which was sponsored by The National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy the Relate Institute and The National Marriage Project at the University of Virginia By age 25 44 percent of women have had a baby while only 38 percent have married by the time they turn 30 about twothirds of American women have had a baby typically out of wedlock Over all 48 percent of first births are to unmarried women most of them in their 20s In fact the report found that for women as a whole the median age at first birth 257 now falls before the median age at first marriage 265 a phenomenon we call The Great CrossoverÂ  But in almost every case the states that went for Barack Obama in 2012 had the higher ages of first marriage and the ones that went for Mitt Romney had lower ones It would stand to reason that attacks on contraception and a full range of family planning options  including a womans right to an abortion  might be viewed differently by these families And we are becoming less blindly religious and more blindly militaristic The former is a good thing the latter not so much According to Gallup the percentage of Americans saying that they have quite a lot or a great deal of confidence in the church or organized religion went from 68 percent in 1975 to 48 percent in 2013 Over the same period those expressing the same amount of confidence in the military has gone from 58 percent to 76 percent This means that on the moral front more liberal views  like support for samesex marriage  are allowed to quickly spread and have gone from being seen as radical to mainstream But even on this issue we are becoming two Americas one where samesex marriage is legal in some states and another where its specifically outlawed But on the military front it means that revelations about recent government snooping on Americans doesnt sound as many alarms as it should have Politically it also means that some of the old ideological battle lines on national security have been scrambled so that Republicans no longer get all the credit nor Democrats all the blame These new realities have changed the conversation about the role and size of government about the line between individual liberty and the collective good about the meaning of personal responsibility and societal responsibility They have also signaled that conservative arguments on many of these issues are losing their resonance nationally and that the Republican pool of potential voters is shrinking while the Democratic pool expands So to defend themselves their ways of thinking and to their minds their way of life Republicans are pulling every lever to slow the change on the state level  gerrymandering limiting voter access passing antiimmigrant laws cutting assistance to the poor This means were now at a point where people may not worry as much about all of America as about their slice of America In the tumult and transition of change we may be becoming a nation divided against itself

Lawmakers Approve Use of Lever Voting Machines for Fallâ€™s Mayoral Voting,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/nyregion/lopez-case-raised-as-assembly-takes-up-womens-rights.html,ALBANY  Acknowledging that New York City election officials say they cannot count votes cast on electronic machines fast enough to smoothly administer this years mayoral election the State Legislature on Thursday night voted to allow the city to redeploy its old lever voting machines As part of the legislation lawmakers also agreed to delay a runoff  which will occur if no candidate receives 40 percent of the vote in the primary  by one week moving it to Oct 1 in order to avoid a conflict with the Jewish holiday of Sukkot The primary is Sept 10 and the general election Nov 5 The lever machines have been kept in storage by the citys Board of Elections since it began using new optical scan voting machines in 2010 But city election officials warned that if they were forced to use the electronic machines for the primary and runoff they might not be able to determine a winner quickly enough and then get ready for the runoff only weeks later especially in a tight race that would require counting hundreds of thousands of ballots by hand Instead they asked the Legislature to authorize the return of the lever machines for the primary and runoff elections Government reform groups objected but lawmakers concluded they had no choice lest the city face an embarrassing electoral debacle These lever machines are necessary so that the Board of Elections can get this done on time and that the city of New York can do a responsible race in a responsible period of time said Senator Martin J Golden a Brooklyn Republican The lever machines would not be a permanent solution the electronic machines would be used for the general election and the Board of Elections would be required to produce a report by next summer explaining how it will conduct future elections without redeploying the lever machines The measure which was amended this week after negotiations between the Senate and the Assembly passed the Assembly on Thursday evening The Senate approved it later in the evening after Senate Democrats attempted unsuccessfully to attach a hostile amendment to the bill that would put in place a system of public financing for state political campaigns Public financing is one of Democrats top priorities for this years legislative session but Republicans who have partial control of the Senate have opposed it The session had been scheduled to end on Thursday but was extended to Friday to allow for additional votes The passage of the lever measure was not without some dissent Twelve senators voted against the bill including Senator Adriano Espaillat a Manhattan Democrat who criticized the citys Board of Elections for what he described as its general incompetence Mr Espaillat has seen the board struggle firsthand it had a difficult time counting votes last year in a close primary in which Mr Espaillat was narrowly defeated by Representative Charles B Rangel There is no question that the New York City Board of Elections has repeatedly failed the voters it serves time and time again Mr Espaillat said This endemic and persistent refusal to undertake needed reform has hurt New York City voters The bill now requires the approval of Gov Andrew M Cuomo who has not taken a position on the return of the lever machines A spokesman for Mr Cuomo said the governor was still reviewing the matter although Mr Golden said this week that he expected Mr Cuomo would sign the bill Also on Thursday night the Senate confirmed Thomas F Prendergast as chairman and chief executive of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Mr Prendergast a former president of New York City Transit has been serving as interim executive director since Joseph J Lhota resigned as chairman to run for mayor of New York Earlier in the day the Assembly approved a bill titled the Womens Equality Act which would expand a sexual harassment ban to all businesses as well as take new steps to address domestic violence pregnancy discrimination and pay inequity But the Senate was not planning to vote on the bill because it also includes a measure that would strengthen the states abortion rights law a step that is opposed by the Republicans who are part of the coalition leading that chamber
"My Abortion, at 23 Weeks",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/opinion/my-abortion-at-23-weeks.html,KIRKLAND Wash  I BELIEVE that parenthood starts before conception at the moment you decide you want a child and are ready and able to create a safe and loving home for her or him I support abortion rights but I reject the false distinction between the terms prochoice and prolife Heres why A lawyer by training I was 38 when I completed a term on the Seattle City Council Two years later I married my husband who is five years younger We wanted children and started trying right away but had trouble conceiving Using in vitro fertilization we had our son Matthew now 4 When he was 2 after another round of IVF we conceived again I was six weeks pregnant when I learned I was carrying twins a boy and a girl We were elated  But in my 20th week during an ultrasound the technician looked concerned and we got the first hint that something might be wrong The next day a Friday my obstetrician called to say that the technician had had a hard time seeing the heart of the male fetus It is probably just the position she reassured me I wasnt reassured  On Monday I had a second ultrasound and my husband and I spent two hours  it felt like an eternity  with a different doctor and technician It looks as if the boy has a herniated diaphragm they told us All the organs are in his chest and not developing  I began sobbing What did that mean Would the organs move Was my baby fixable The clinic staff members were reluctant to tell us how bad it was They said I needed an MRI which would provide more details My world stopped I loved being pregnant with twins and trying to figure out which one was where in my uterus Sometimes it felt like a party in there with eight limbs moving The thought of losing one child was unbearable The MRI at Seattle Childrens Hospital confirmed our fears the organs were pushed up into our boys chest and not developing properly We were in the 22nd week In Washington State abortion is legal until the 24th week After 10 more days of tests and meetings we were in the 23rd week and had to make a decision My husband is more conservative than I am He also is a Catholic I am an oldschool liberal and I am not religious But from the start and through this ordeal we were in complete agreement We desperately wanted this child and would do whatever we could to save him if his hernia was fixable and he could have a good quality of life Once we had all the data we met with a nurse a surgeon and a pediatrician at the hospital The surgeon said our boy had a hole in his diaphragm Only one lung chamber had formed and it was only 20 percent complete If our boy survived birth he would be on oxygen and other life supports for a long time The thought of hearing him gasp for air and linger in pain was our nightmare  The surgeon described interventions that would give our son the best chance of surviving birth But the pediatrician could tell that we were looking for candid guidance He cautioned that medical ethics constrained what he could say then added Termination is a reasonable option and a reasonable option that I can support The surgeon and nurse nodded in agreement I burst out sobbing My husband cried too But in a sense the pediatricians words were a source of comfort and kindness He said what we already knew But we needed to hear it from professionals who knew we were good parents who wanted what was best for our children  The next day at a clinic near my home I felt my sons budding life end as a doctor inserted a needle through my belly into his tiny heart She had trouble finding it because of its abnormal position As horrible as that moment was  it will live with me forever  I am grateful We made sure our son was not born only to suffer He died in a warm and loving place inside me In having the abortion we took a risk that my body would expel both fetuses and that we would lose our daughter too In fact I asked if we could postpone the abortion until the third trimester by which time my daughter would have been almost fully developed my doctor pointed out that abortions after 24 weeks were illegal Thankfully Kaitlyn was born healthy and beautiful on March 2 2011 and we love her to pieces My little boy partially dissolved into me and I like to think his soul is in his sister On Tuesday the House of Representatives voted to ban abortion after 22 weeks of pregnancy based on the disputed theory that fetuses at that stage are capable of feeling pain The measure has no chance of passage in the Senate But it is part of a trend toward restricting second and even firsttrimester abortions Ten states have banned most abortions after 20 or 22 weeks Arkansas after 12 and North Dakota after 6 Some of these laws are being challenged in court  While some of these new restrictions allow exceptions for fetal genetic defects secondtrimester abortions must remain legal because until a child is viable outside the womb these decisions belong with the mother I dont know if Roe v Wade will be overturned in my lifetime but the chipping away of abortion rights is occurring at an astounding pace I share my story in the hope that our leaders will be more responsible and compassionate when they weigh what it means to truly value the lives of women and children 
A Pledge of Allegiance to Partisan Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/21/opinion/the-pledge-of-allegiance-to-partisan-policy.html,The Supreme Court on Thursday imposed an important limit on how far the government can go in controlling the speech of a group that takes government money  In Agency for International Development v Alliance for Open Society International the court found that the federal government violated the First Amendment when it required that organizations receiving money to combat HIVAIDS must have a policy opposing prostitution Chief Justice John Roberts Jr writing for the 6to2 majority said that the mandate that recipients pledge allegiance to the governments policy breached their right to free expression Justice Elena Kagan was recused The United States Leadership Against HIVAIDS Tuberculosis and Malaria Act a 2003 federal statute finances a wide range of public health initiatives to treat and prevent disease around the world That law prohibits the use of any government money to promote or advocate the legalization or practice of prostitution But it goes beyond that reasonable provision to require almost all recipients of funds to have a policy explicitly opposing prostitution and to refrain from any speech the government deems inconsistent with that policy The government contended that placing a condition on federal dollars is a legitimate way to promote its policies and those who do not want to make an explicit pledge can avoid it by not taking government money As Justice Antonin Scalia wrote in his dissenting opinion the government is not forcing anyone to say anything  But as Chief Justice Roberts explained this condition is coercive because a recipient has to take an affirmative position and is not allowed to get funds and then turn around and assert a contrary belief or claim neutrality when participating in activities on its own time and dime  By requiring recipients to advocate the governments position without the option of staying silent the court said this policy could hurt outreach programs by undermining trust with sex workers who may avoid seeking help from groups with a declared antiprostitution agenda This ruling does not limit the governments power to specify the kind of activities it wants to subsidize For example the court has long held that the government can prohibit federal family planning dollars from being used to advocate for abortion services in those cases the recipient groups are permitted to use nongovernmental money for that advocacy  Chief Justice Roberts quoting from a 1943 opinion barring the government from requiring public schoolchildren to salute the flag noted If there is any fixed star in our constitutional constellation it is that no official high or petty can prescribe what shall be orthodox in politics nationalism religion or other matters of opinion That principle guided the court to the right result in this case
Natural Lawyer,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/books/review/conscience-and-its-enemies-by-robert-p-george.html,Most of us live our partisan politics through the media which generally means crossfiring tweets posts and cable news shows about the latest scandal as interpreted by a rotating stable of Washington strategists party faithfuls and pundits But behind the klieg lights there has always been a less topical more abstract debate between liberal and conservative academics and philosophers about the nature of human flourishing and the political and social institutions that best promote it  Robert P George is one of the most prominent conservative backstagers The McCormick professor of jurisprudence at Princeton a former member of the Presidents Council on Bioethics author of myriad books and articles he is embraced in social conservative circles  and despised in liberal ones  for being staunchly opposed to abortion gay marriage assisted suicide and embryonic research His newest book Conscience and Its Enemies doesnt add much to what he has already written on these matters But it does bring together an accessible group of essays that put his highly burnished philosophical and constitutional learning on full display They should at the very least unsettle those whose only experiences of social conservatism are the blunderings of Todd Akin and the theatrics of Rush Limbaugh and perhaps even lead to some reflection that rises above the media brawl  Though a devoted Roman Catholic George is not preaching religious dogma in these essays Following the naturallaw tradition he relies on reason and science the very tools that liberals he posits wrongly believe are always in their corner to uncover immutable human nature Certainly his starting premise  Each human being possesses a profound inherent and equal dignity and is an end in himself  wont raise atheistic or liberal hackles Nor will the logic that this premise leads to infanticide slavery segregation and eugenics all of which deny human dignity are immoral But thats about where agreement will end George goes on to argue that the dignity we attach to the autonomous individual is also inherent in the human embryo Modern embryology has corrected an earlier view of the fetus as a part of the mother from the moment of conception he holds it is a complete selfintegrating organism with unique selfdirecting DNA The unborn are living individuals of the species Homo sapiens  members of the human family Like all vulnerable beings they need protection from the powerful who would like to control them Utilitarian arguments about the benefits that could come from embryonic research or from preventing the birth of an unwanted child are no more valid than the social improvements promised by a eugenicist  Critics will object  correctly  that a Georgian regime would impose an alien morality on nonbelievers But George contends that liberal secularists enforce their own morality which they mistakenly confuse with neutrality and more disingenuously with science In an essay that challenges his usual even temper George argues that Justice Harry A Blackmuns reasoning in Roe v Wade relied both on dubious constitutional doctrine  a position that has also been held by a number of highly regarded liberal scholars  and on assertions of medical necessity to disguise what was actually a moral claim The Supreme Court could get away with this in part because the liberal secularists who applauded the decision didnt grasp that they were asserting a particular morality based on a debatable view of the human person In Georges view they are dualists who believe the desiring mind is the locus of the authentic self with the right to use the body to pursue its own ends  Naturallaw followers on the other hand believe the self is a dynamic unity of body mind and spirit The difference in visions of personhood is at the heart of what he has called elsewhere a clash of orthodoxies Everywhere Georgians turn  on television and billboards in schools and universities music lyrics and videos laws and judicial decisions  they find messages seeped in secular orthodoxy reiterating that we are objects of sexual desire and satisfaction rather than integrated persons These hidden messages shape the next generations understanding of themselves and destroy the foundations of morality essential for a healthy political culture  George is exceptionally nimble when he spars with conventional contemporary political and social thought so much so that it presents us with a puzzle in naturallaw terms humans are rational beings who have intelligible reasons    for their choices and actions So why is he at odds with many whose logical skills are inferior to his It could be they are prisoners of their own orthodoxy Another possibility as contemporary moral psychologists like Jonathan Haidt might suggest is that they are guided by moral intuitions largely resistant to reason but potentially truthful nonetheless In the case of abortion for instance many people surely believe as George does that reason affirms the equal dignity and value of all human life from conception on Yet though women often grieve a miscarriage there is no human society where people mourn a fetus 12 weeks after conception to the same degree they do a stillbirth at 7 months or especially the death of a 1yearold In Georges schema these distinctions have no moral validity But moral intuition senses they do  The limits of moral reasoning hover even more around Georges discussion of marriage Again he begins with premises that are uncontroversial In the Western world marriage is now defined as an emotional union We assume you should marry for love Historians would agree that this view is relatively new in human history they would probably also agree that on its own love has proved a shaky foundation for the ancient institution The modern ideal of marriage as a pure emotional bond rather than the primary locus of procreation and child rearing eventually led to the easing of divorce laws and the mainstreaming of cohabitation and single motherhood and now  since clearly two individuals of the same sex are capable of loving each other  to gay marriage  George rejects the idea of marriage as an emotional union but not because of the way that ideal has weakened the institution He believes that conjugal or traditional marriage unites husband and wife across all levels of being physical emotional and spiritual Male and female complementarity allows them to unite organically as a single procreative principle Note the word principle whether they actually procreate or not men and women are engaging in one flesh unity  To chalk this up to homophobia is to miss something crucial George is relying on philosophical ideas that predate the modern concept of sexual identity and that lead him to reject all extramarital  and even some kinds of marital  sex The more pertinent philosophical objection is that his reasoning about the nature of marriage however well pedigreed is so far removed from most peoples lived experience that it will be inconsistent with their intuitions about the human good George might counter that contemporary liberal secularists have no coherent philosophy of marriage reasoned or intuited About that he is almost certainly right  In the end you dont have to agree with any of this to support the central message of Conscience and Its Enemies Georges book is more than anything a plea for liberty of conscience or more specifically for religious liberty Religion he reasons should be thought of as conscientious truthseeking regarding the ultimate sources of meaning and value and therefore a crucial dimension of human wellbeing and fulfillment  George in other words speaks for a sizable number of conscientious objectors to Americas ruling liberal secularism 
Action on Expanded Gambling as Albanyâ€™s Legislative Session Sputters to End ,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/nyregion/lawmakers-act-to-free-retired-officers-of-a-gun-rule.html,ALBANY  Lawmakers agreed on Friday night to ask voters to authorize expanded casino gambling across New York State but planned to end their annual legislative session without approving new measures to combat corruption in the capital The State Senate and the Assembly also could not reach an agreement on measures addressing womens rights including a contentious proposal to enshrine abortion rights in state law that had been embraced by Democrats but steadfastly opposed by Republicans This years session began in January with a burst of activity  the passage of strict new gun laws  but ended with more of a thud  The Senate was stalled for more than six hours on Friday as lawmakers huddled to decide how to proceed on the abortion measure and other issues Even before Friday the Legislature had already largely given up enacting legislation in response to the corruption scandals that swept through Albany this year Gov Andrew M Cuomo had recommended a package of anticorruption measures and government reform groups pressed to enact public financing for campaigns Without any action to address corruption Mr Cuomo said Friday that within the next week he would appoint an investigatory commission to scrutinize campaign fundraising and possible legislative corruption  I feel thats a clearer cleaner resolution to restore public trust the governor said on The Capitol Pressroom a public radio program The subject of the most intense discussion at the Capitol on Friday was the fate of a package of womens rights measures Most of it was not controversial but it included a contested abortion provision which Mr Cuomo said would codify in state law the Supreme Courts decision in Roe v Wade  The Democratcontrolled Assembly approved the 10point package on Thursday But the Senate which is controlled by a coalition of Republicans and independent Democrats did not consider the legislation because Republicans objected to the abortion provision  Under fire from womens groups the leader of the independent Democrats Senator Jeffrey D Klein of the Bronx sought to attach the abortion proposal to a health care bill but fell one vote short of success It was important that women got to know whos prochoice and whos not in the State Senate Mr Klein said and I think we achieved that Later Friday after the amendment failed the Senate approved the nine other parts of the package as individual bills But unless the two chambers pass the same legislation in the same form it cannot become law and Assembly Democrats were adamant that they would not hold votes on the individual measures that passed the Senate  The abortion dispute overshadowed the debate on expanding casino gambling  Lawmakers voted for a November referendum on a proposal to amend the states Constitution to authorize up to seven Las Vegasstyle casinos However they also approved legislation that would allow only four of those casinos to be developed in the next seven years in three regions the Catskills the Albany area and the Southern Tier The legislative debate over gambling offered a preview of the public campaign that lies ahead both for advocates of gambling who see it as an economic development tool for upstate and for opponents who have moral or public policy qualms Assemblyman Andy Goodell a Republican from Chautauqua County criticized the casino expansion calling it a form of taxation which preys often on the poor and those who can least afford it Also on Friday the Assembly passed a bill to authorize a pilot program for using speedtracking cameras in New York City but it was not clear if the Senate would take up the measure It was also not known if the Senate would take up a measure to allow the Hudson River Park Trust to sell air rights which the Assembly approved Thursday The Senate did agree to tweak the states new gun control measure to allow retired law enforcement officers to keep highcapacity firearms The Assembly had approved the change in May and Mr Cuomo said Friday that he would sign the measure Lawmakers also approved an overhaul of the Long Island Power Authority and a proposal by Mr Cuomo to create taxfree zones on college campuses for new and expanding businesses
An Advice Book by a 28-Year-Old? Not Quite,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/fashion/an-advice-book-by-a-28-year-old-not-quite.html,There was a crucial moment in the life of Kelly Williams Brown when she realized that she had not

always just existed The idea for Adulting which has just been optioned for television by J J Abrams executive producer of the Lost series was refined when Ms Brown worked as a reporter for the Statesman Journal in Salem Ore consulting her Facebook friends for a column about what skills or possessions they should have by the age of 30  Those ad hoc advisers inform the book along with what

"Devices Given to Chinese Legal Advocate Had Tracking Spyware, N.Y.U. Says ",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/22/world/asia/chinese-advocates-devices-were-loaded-with-spyware-nyu-says.html,BEIJING  Dissidents inside China have long been accustomed to a lack of privacy in their daily routines Phone conversations are monitored emails are read and public security agents trail human rights activists when they venture outside their homes But according to officials at New York University several electronic devices that were given to Chen Guangcheng a Chinese legal advocate soon after his arrival in the United States last year were loaded with spyware designed to track his familys movements and their online activity Two of those devices an iPhone and an iPad were given to Mr Chen by China Aid a Texasbased Christian group that pushes for greater religious freedom in China Bob Fu the president of the group said that he was out of the country when Mr Chen arrived in New York so his wife Heidi handed over the equipment The discovery of the tracking software came as a complete surprise he said This story is just crazy said Mr Fu an exiled Chinese dissident who championed Mr Chens plight during the years of persecution Mr Chen endured as an opponent of forced abortion The allegations first reported by Reuters threatened to further complicate an already messy narrative surrounding Mr Chens tenure at NYU which includes accusations that school officials bowing to pressure from the Chinese government sought to curtail his public advocacy and then forced him to leave the Greenwich Village campus sooner than he expected School officials and associates of Mr Chen who is blind have vehemently rejected such assertions and insisted that his fellowship at NYU was always meant to last one year Mr Chen has declined to provide evidence backing up his assertions issued in a brief statement last Sunday that Beijing pressured NYU to terminate what he acknowledged was a generous arrangement that included tutors security and housing for him his wife and their two children With Mr Chen silent in recent days Mr Fu has become one of his more vocal advocates eagerly telling reporters what Mr Fu said were instances in which NYU tried to limit Mr Chens access to conservative political figures and advocates who opposed abortion Representative Christopher H Smith Republican of New Jersey who frequently confers with Mr Fu on human rights issues in China has threatened to convene a Congressional hearing on Mr Chens time at NYU According to people with knowledge of the episode Mr Fus wife presented the Apple devices to an assistant of Jerome Cohen the NYU law professor who was instrumental in arranging Mr Chens exit from the American Embassy in Beijing where he had sought refuge after escaping house arrest The gifts along with at least two other phones that were handed to the assistant arrived on the chaotic day Mr Chen and his family landed in New York After an examination by NYU technicians all the devices were found to be compromised with spyware said an associate who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to the news media The spyware included global positioning software that allowed a third party to track the whereabouts of the device and presumably its owner and another program that copied its contents to a remote server After removing the spyware technicians returned the Apple devices to the Chens who were told about what had happened The two other phones their provenance a mystery were not given to Mr Chen He was upset but he was more concerned about the relatives he left behind who were being mistreated by the authorities the associate said Mr Fu was not informed about the spyware on the items and by all accounts his relationship with the family deepened in the months that followed John H Beckman an NYU spokesman confirmed the broad outlines of the episode but said he had no further information Professor Cohen told Reuters he thought the compromised devices were an attempt to keep tabs on Mr Chen remotely These people supposedly were out to help him and they give him a kind of Trojan horse that would have enabled them to monitor his communications secretly he said Professor Cohen was traveling in Asia on Friday and could not be reached for comment In an interview Mr Fu said he learned on Thursday from Reuters that the items his wife had bought at an ATT store in Texas were compromised He said a technician he employs had activated the devices and added Skype but nothing else He suggested that the spyware could have been installed after his wife dropped off the items but before they were given to the Chens a gap of at least a day More than anyone else we want to get to the bottom of this he said adding that he had asked the FBI to look into the matter We will fully cooperate with any investigation and hope NYU will do the same
New York City Gets Legislatureâ€™s Nod to Install Speed Cameras,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/23/nyregion/city-gets-legislatures-nod-to-install-speed-cameras.html,ALBANY  New York State lawmakers voted on Saturday to allow New York City to install cameras to catch speeding motorists near schools The measure was one of many bills approved in the middle of the night just before the Legislature ended its annual session The Senate adjourned about 645 am on Saturday after an allnight session the Assembly finished its work on Friday evening In this years session lawmakers approved new gun laws in response to the massacre in Newtown Conn voted to raise the states minimum wage and on Friday agreed to ask voters to authorize an expansion of casino gambling Yet they could not agree on a proposal that Gov Andrew M Cuomo said would strengthen abortion rights in state law and they did not approve any significant legislation to address the corruption scandals that have plagued the capital The speed cameras were a top priority of Mayor Michael R Bloomberg who erupted in fury in March when the issue appeared to have reached an impasse in the Senate and who has made traffic safety a goal of his philanthropic efforts  Mr Bloomberg and other city officials argued that the cameras would help reduce injuries and deaths that result from speeding which the mayor said was the top contributing factor in traffic fatalities in the city Decreasing the number of drivers who speed is a proven lifesaving measure Mr Bloomberg said in a statement on Saturday He added that the legislation would ensure that we continue to protect some of our most vulnerable New Yorkers New York City already operates cameras to catch motorists who run red lights and drive in bus lanes Speed cameras are in use in about a dozen states and the District of Columbia according to the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety but some opponents question their effectiveness or argue that their main purpose is to drum up revenue for the local governments that operate them  The Patrolmens Benevolent Association also opposed their approval saying money would be better spent hiring more police officers who in the process of enforcing speed limits can also look out for other criminal activity The legislation sponsored by Senator Jeffrey D Klein of the Bronx and Assemblywoman Deborah J Glick of Manhattan both Democrats authorizes a fiveyear pilot program that would allow the operation of 20 speedcamera systems in school speed zones Drivers who are caught speeding by the cameras would face a 50 fine The Assembly approved the speedcamera bill on Friday but it had not been clear if the Senate would take up the legislation before adjourning A spokesman for Mr Cuomo Richard Azzopardi said on Saturday that the governor would sign the measure The fight over the speed cameras  similar proposals had stalled in Albany for years  was yet another example of how what are considered local issues often require state approval to the frustration of city officials New York Citys public advocate Bill de Blasio said on Saturday that the city should be given the authority to install speed or redlight cameras without the need for an allout legislative campaign in Albany The Legislature also approved a measure that would allow the Hudson River Park Trust to sell air rights up to one block east of the parks boundaries across the West Side Highway The park has been struggling to find new sources of revenue The Assembly passed the bill on Thursday and the Senate gave its approval on Saturday Lawmakers also approved a measure that would allow a Park Avenue catering hall to receive a liquor license The building at Park Avenue and 63rd Street is home to the Third Church of Christ Scientist which leases most of its space to a caterer Rose Group Park Avenue State law prohibits issuing a liquor license to a business within 200 feet of a school or place of worship like the nearby Central Presbyterian Church Rose Group has waged a longrunning battle to serve liquor first by going to court and then by enlisting a battalion of lobbyists to press for legislation despite neighborhood objections The Assembly approved an exception for the catering hall on Thursday and the Senate followed suit on Saturday
All-or-Nothing Strategy on Womenâ€™s Equality Legislation Ends With Nothing,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/24/nyregion/in-albany-all-or-nothing-strategy-on-womens-equality-act-ends-with-nothing.html,In his State of the State address in January Gov Andrew M Cuomo described New York State as the equality capital of the nation and called on lawmakers to pass a 10point Womens Equality Act that would strengthen the states laws against sexual harassment human trafficking domestic violence and salary discrimination Much of the legislation had widespread support But after more than five months of advocacy by the governor  including a trip to Seneca Falls a landmark of the womens suffrage movement  lawmakers ended their annual session over the weekend without approving a single element of the proposal in large part because one of the measures provisions would have strengthened abortion rights language in state law The bills failure followed an abrupt strategic shift in the final days of the session Until then Mr Cuomo as well as womens rights advocates and other Democratic elected officials insisted that they would accept nothing less than the entire 10point package even if dropping the abortion language might allow them to win nine of the proposed provisions But on Friday the advocates splintered  Naral ProChoice New York stood by the allornothing approach while others including Mr Cuomo urged accepting a partial victory  and the entire package sank The result has left many lawmakers disappointed Womens equality and health should not be compromised because of a political game of chicken said Assemblywoman Nily Rozic a Queens Democrat who opposed ceding any element of the package There was little agreement even about the substance of the legislation Mr Cuomo and womens rights advocates said it would simply codify in state law the right already guaranteed by Roe v Wade but abortion opponents said it would expand the availability of abortions The Assembly controlled by Democrats voted for the entire package but the Senate controlled by a coalition of Republicans and independent Democrats approved only the nine provisions not about abortion When the leader of the independent faction of Democrats Senator Jeffrey D Klein of the Bronx tried to attach the abortion language to a bill on medical records the effort failed by one vote Some advocates of the legislation now want the Assembly to come back and approve the nonabortion measures even while hoping to strengthen abortion law at some other time The Assembly speaker Sheldon Silver has not ruled that out The bottom line is the other nine points provide important protections for women in the workplace and in the community said Donna Lieberman the executive director of the New York Civil Liberties Union and its a disappointment that with such broad support and such broad bipartisan support those have yet to become law But some lawmakers were adamant that the abortion issue was inseparable from other womens rights concerns I think its inappropriate and unfair to leave out womens health when youre claiming to be an advocate for all these other parts of a womans life said Assemblywoman Didi Barrett a Hudson Valley Democrat who is a former board member of Planned Parenthood of New York City and Naral Theyre all really important but if a woman cant make choices about her own body and her own reproductive health youre really not delivering equality in these other areasÂ  In addition to the abortion language the legislation according to the Cuomo administration would have banned sexual harassment in workplaces with fewer than four employees It would also have banned employers from denying jobs or promotions to workers because they have children barred landlords from discriminating against victims of domestic violence and increased potential damage payments in pay equity discrimination cases Opponents of abortion said the collapse of the legislation demonstrated that the only issue of concern to the bills champions was abortion Thats what we were saying from Day 1 that this was just a smoke screen for abortion expansion and the only reason they were bundled together was for political reasons which we found unconscionable said Dennis Poust a spokesman for the New York State Catholic Conference It would have been very nice to see these other pieces pass but their agenda is abortion he added They couldnt get that so they torpedoed the whole thing One thing is certain the abortion issue will be a prominent one in next years legislative elections Naral ProChoice New York ran an independentexpenditure campaign for some candidates in 2012 and Andrea Miller its president said One of the things that this made crystal clear and probably one of the most important things that this session demonstrated is what our roadblock is and that roadblock is the State Senate Mr Cuomo through a spokeswoman said he believed the debate had advanced the topic of womens rights and that now it was up to voters to respond Issues that have long been nonstarters in the Legislature including stronger laws against human trafficking sexual harassment in the workplace income inequality and other critically important protections are now in their strongest position in years to become law said the spokeswoman Melissa DeRosa In the end the public will hold individual legislators accountable if they stand in the way of finally achieving equality for women in New York State
Women Lose in New York State,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/opinion/women-lose-in-new-york-state.html,With too many misguided governors and legislators around the country trying to deny women the freedom to have an abortion New York State was supposed to be a shining example of a government that cares about a womans right to choose  That did not happen Late last week the State Legislature ended its 2013 session by failing to pass Gov Andrew Cuomos 10point Womens Equality Act The bill would have assured women of the protections now available under Roe v Wade even if the Supreme Court chooses to undermine or narrow that decision If Mr Cuomo still wants to make this an achievement of his first term which ends next year he will have to convince a few socalled moderate Republicans to come aboard  Senate Republicans including those who claim to support abortion rights allowed floor votes on nine points of the bill but refused to allow a vote on abortion rights That effectively killed the entire package even though the Assembly had approved it It also served as a reminder of how the Republicans will really vote on the matter Voters should keep this in mind when next years elections roll around especially those of Dean Skelos the State Senate leader his Republican allies and two Democrats who are hostile to womens issues Senators Rubn Daz Sr of the Bronx and Simcha Felder of Brooklyn In addition to the abortion provision the casualties included toughening state laws against human trafficking domestic violence and salary discrimination  The Assembly passed the governors complete plan with one Republican woman standing up for the entire package including the reaffirmation of present federal laws on abortion Janet Duprey a Republican from Plattsburgh told the hushed chamber last week I dont know why a woman chooses to have an abortion but I will strongly defend every womans right to make her own health care decisions including the right to choose  Such stalwart behavior was not in evidence in the Senate Women of New York deserve better
Texas House Restricts Abortions in a Move That Could Force Clinics to Shut,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/us/texas-house-restricts-abortions-in-a-move-that-could-force-clinics-to-shut.html,HOUSTON  The Republicandominated Texas Legislature inched closer on Monday to passing some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the country as the State House of Representatives approved a bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and hold abortion clinics to the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers Advocates for abortion rights said the measures would force dozens of abortion providers around the state to close and leave only a handful in a few major cities that are able to meet what they described as excessive costly and medically unnecessary restrictions Opponents of abortion including Gov Rick Perry Lt Gov David Dewhurst and other Republican leaders said the legislation was aimed at protecting womens health and unborn children After the State Senate passed a version of the bill last week Mr Dewhurst who has called for overturning Roe v Wade the landmark Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion posted a message on Twitter celebrating passage of the bill known as Senate Bill 5 He wrote We fought to pass SB5 thru the Senate last night  this is why Attached was a graphic produced by opponents of the bill that said the legislation would force many clinics to shut their doors A few hours later Mr Dewhurst attempted to play down his original post saying that both he and the bill were unapologetically prolife and for womens health But opponents said his first message demonstrated that the legislation was an unconstitutional attempt by Republican leaders at a backdoor statewide ban on abortion In January Mr Perry told those gathered at an annual antiabortion rally in Austin that his goal was to make abortion at any stage a thing of the past and that the ideal world was a world without abortion  This bill would endanger the health and safety of millions of women in Texas said Cecile Richards the president of the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and a daughter of Ann Richards the former Texas governor If this passes abortion would be virtually banned in the state of Texas and many women could be forced to resort to dangerous and unsafe measures The State House approved the measures Monday morning on a 95to34 vote Lawmakers first gave preliminary approval to the bill shortly after 3 am after hours of debate and attempts at delays by Democrats Though the State Senate passed a version of the bill last week the legislation did not contain the ban on abortions after 20 weeks The Senate was scheduled to take up the bill passed by the House on Tuesday under a tight deadline It has until midnight Tuesday to take action when the special session of the Legislature ends Aspects of the bill including the 20week ban have been blocked as unconstitutional by courts in several other states and even if adopted by Texas would be quickly challenged in court The Texas House voted to prohibit abortions after 20 weeks after fertilization or 22 weeks after a womans last menstrual period As such it passed a measure similar to the one the House of Representatives approved last week in Washington The bills in Texas and Washington were based on the medically disputed theory that fetuses at that stage of development can feel pain If the bill passed Texas would join Alabama Nebraska Oklahoma and eight other states that have approved socalled fetal pain initiatives according to Elizabeth Nash the state issues manager of the Guttmacher Institute a research organization that supports abortion rights Mainstream medical groups say the fetal brain is not developed enough to feel pain at that stage of development but a handful of doctors contend otherwise  Supreme Court rulings have established that a woman has a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb around the 24th week of pregnancy and 20week limits in Arizona Georgia and Idaho have been blocked by court orders  The bill would require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility Similar measures are being challenged in court in Alabama Mississippi and North Dakota The legislation would require clinics to meet surgicalcenter standards mandating that abortions take place in hospitalstyle operating rooms even if nonsurgical procedures were being done opponents of the bill said Mr Perry has called the admitting privileges and provisions for ambulatory surgery standards matters of common sense Other Republicans have disputed predictions that the restrictions will lead to widespread clinic closures Opponents of the bill hundreds of whom packed the Capitol in Austin and shouted Shame after the preliminary predawn vote argued that abortion providers already follow standard regulations and that the legislation would shutter all but 5 of the 42 facilities providing safe legal abortions in Texas including those run by Planned Parenthood as well as other entities The Texas Medical Association and the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists opposed the measures The Legislatures 140day regular session ended May 27 but Mr Perry kept lawmakers in Austin after he called a 30day special session whose agenda only he as governor could set On June 11 Mr Perry added the abortion legislation to the roster The horrors of the national lateterm abortion industry are continuing to come to light one atrocity at a time he said Sadly some of those same atrocities happen in our own state Even if the legislation failed Tuesday Mr Perry could call another special session to have lawmakers take up the matter again
Itâ€™s the Votersâ€™ Move in Race to Fill Kerryâ€™s Senate Seat in Massachusetts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/25/us/politics/its-the-voters-move-in-race-to-fill-kerrys-senate-seat-in-massachusetts.html,BOSTON  The Senate race to replace John Kerry has generated little excitement over the last few months and Massachusetts officials on Monday underscored just how low the interest level is predicting that only 37 percent of voters would go to the polls on Tuesday That would be a record low in recent times officials said falling substantially below the 53 percent who turned out in the last special Senate election in 2010 Mr Kerry became secretary of state earlier this year Every poll has shown Representative Edward J Markey a Democrat leading his Republican challenger Gabriel Gomez the most recent poll released Monday by the Suffolk University Political Research Center gave Mr Markey a 10point lead Mr Markeys campaign has been so concerned that voters will take his election for granted that it has resorted to pointing to internal Republican poll numbers to suggest the race is closer than it seems hoping this will rev up its field workers and keep a steady stream of money flowing in Its kind of an underwhelming election Secretary of State William F Galvin said in an interview He noted that the compressed campaign had been overshadowed by major events like the Boston Marathon bombings the Stanley Cup finals and the criminal trial of James Whitey Bulger The election comes at the end of the school year as people are preparing for the Fourth of July holiday And the candidates Mr Galvin said skirted serious discussion of compelling national issues Polls showed for example that voters believed the most important issue by far was the creation of jobs but neither candidate spent much time addressing it Mr Markey 66 appealing to the liberal bent of voters in deep blue Massachusetts campaigned chiefly on his support for abortion rights and a ban on assault weapons Mr Gomez 47 seeking to appeal to the states many independents called himself a new kind of Republican and sought to cast Mr Markey who was first elected to Congress in 1976 as a fossil who had been in Washington too long Markey ran a cautious campaign that was a reflection of his personality said Peter Ubertaccio a political scientist at Stonehill College in Easton Mass One drawback of that strategy however Dr Ubertaccio said is that Mr Markeys lowkey performance marked by a strange staccato in his diction could encourage other Republicans out of the woodwork to challenge him when he seeks reelection next year assuming he wins on Tuesday He could have prevented that by being much more aggressive now Dr Ubertaccio said Scott P Brown the former senator who declined to run in this special election said recently that he could have beaten Mr Markey Mr Gomez who has never held elective office made a number of rookie mistakes Dr Ubertaccio said like his faux outrage that he was being compared to Osama bin Laden and his efforts to suggest that Markey was politicizing the Newtown shootings Those didnt resonate and he doubled down on them Dr Ubertaccio said And Mr Gomez repeated an intemperate remark that Mr Markey was pond scum He doesnt yet have the instincts of a good political candidate Dr Ubertaccio said Mr Gomez who often wore his olivedrab Navy flight jacket on the campaign trail sought to run on his biography but never fleshed it out with details of his experience as a private equity investor or as a member of the Navy SEALs Mr Markey who has not faced a competitive challenge in years started with a significant financial advantage with a war chest of 31 million Through June 5 he raised 76 million not counting the old war chest and had 22 million left to spend in the last two weeks of the campaign Mr Gomez raised 582000 during the primary and lent himself 600000 Through June 5 he raised almost 23 million not including a total of 900000 that he lent himself  Dire threats that Mr Gomez would draw big money from conservative groups  threats amplified by the Markey campaign  never materialized although a group called Americans for Progressive Action ran ads on his behalf More outside groups including environmental organizations and unions helped Mr Markey By the end Mr Markey was saturating the airwaves with commercials As of Sunday the Markey campaign and supporting groups had spent a total of 26 million on ads according to Kantar MediaCMAG which tracks spending on political ads the Gomez campaign and supporters had spent 14 million Mr Gomez has suggested that even if he loses this race was a trial run and he would try again next year though it is not clear which office he might seek Already a dozen candidates are running for mayor of Boston Next year features races for governor and a full term for senator With so many elections Secretary of State Galvin said I joke that were becoming like Italy  without the climate or the food
Democrat Wins Special Election for Kerryâ€™s Senate Seat,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/massachusetts-special-senate-election.html,BOSTON  Representative Edward J Markey a Democrat who has toiled for almost 40 years in the House in both the majority and minority won a promotion to the Senate on Tuesday in a victory over Gabriel Gomez a Republican who has never served in elective office Mr Markey 66 succeeds John Kerry who stepped down this year to become secretary of state and he will provide a reliable vote for President Obamas agenda which seemed to be just what voters wanted The Senate needs to be controlled by Democrats said Pam Wechsler 52 a prosecutor as she voted Tuesday morning in the West End of Boston With almost all precincts reporting Mr Markey had won 55 percent of the vote to Mr Gomezs 45 percent Like you Im tired of gridlock Mr Markey told a jubilant crowd packed into the ballroom of the Boston Park Plaza Hotel but I will never compromise on our principles He said he would lead a green revolution and put steelworkers and ironworkers to work in a new economy  Mr Markeys election does not change the balance of power in the Senate where Democrats have 54 votes and Republicans have 46 But Democratic control had already slipped by one this month after Frank R Lautenberg of New Jersey died and was succeeded by an interim Republican Mr Markeys win came as a surprise to no one Every poll in the state showed him leading Mr Gomez though by varying margins since the primaries ended two months ago Mr Markeys biggest advantage was that his views were in line with those of most voters in deep blue Massachusetts With a much bigger war chest which he used to flood the airwaves with ads he campaigned consistently on his support for abortion rights and a ban on assault weapons and reminded voters constantly that Mr Gomez opposed both As the campaign went on Mr Markey added arguments that Democrats had used successfully in previous Senate races  that his opponent wanted to cut Medicare benefits raise the eligibility age for Social Security and give special tax breaks to corporations  For his part Mr Gomez repeatedly cast Mr Markey who was first elected to Congress in 1976 as a relic who had little to show for his decades in Washington He cast himself as a new kind of Republican who supported samesex marriage expanded background checks for gun purchases and a path to citizenship for illegal immigrants But he could not convince enough Massachusetts voters that he would vote independently of the national Republican Party While the Markey campaign feared that Mr Gomez would attract millions of dollars in outside money from special interests that backing did not materialize in a serious way Mr Markey himself did not exactly set the electorate on fire He was the consensus choice of the Democratic establishment which wanted to focus on one candidate early in hopes of avoiding a repeat of 2010 when a Republican Scott P Brown won the special Senate election to fill the seat of Edward M Kennedy who died in 2009 Mr Markey ran a cautious campaign that relied heavily on big Democratic stars including President Obama Michelle Obama former President Bill Clinton Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr and Senator Elizabeth Warren  Democrats are getting the outcome they were supposed to get but they had to put a lot of firepower into it said Jennifer Duffy a senior editor at The Cook Political Report She characterized the Democratic juggernaut including an extensive field operation that made contact with three million voters over the last five days as backup insurance that the loss of 2010 would not be repeated On Tuesday alone the party organized 7200 volunteers to get out the vote This victory has less to do with Ed Markey and more with the fact that hes the Democrat she said The Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee took considerable credit for the victory Tuesday night We recruited Ed Markey into the race worked with him to build a campaign team with the best Senate talent from Massachusetts and around the country and secured commitments early on from top Democratic leaders that they would actively support the Democratic nominee Guy Cecil the committees executive director said in a statement Looking ahead to other Senate races next year he said that winning in Massachusetts was an important first step in our efforts to preserve the Democratic majority Senator Jerry Moran of Kansas the chairman of the National Republican Senatorial Committee was upbeat declaring that Mr Gomez had forced the Democrats to spend millions to drag Mr Markey across the finish line in the most liberal state in the country  And he all but announced that Mr Gomez would challenge Mr Markey in November 2014 when Mr Markey will have to defend the seat for a full sixyear term Today marks the end of the first mile in the marathon to permanently fill the Massachusetts Senate seat Mr Moran said Gabriel Gomez is well prepared to win that marathon over the next 16 months
"In U.S., a Rekindled War Over Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/26iht-letter26.html,NEW YORK  As the Republicancontrolled House of Representatives approved this month the most restrictive abortion bill to come out of Congress in at least a decade abortion rights defenders mounted a fullblown campaign to blunt what they instantly labeled a new war on women The House of Representatives just passed the most extreme national antichoice bill weve seen in recent years said Jess McIntosh the communications director of Emilys List which supports female Democratic candidates and is one of the largest political action committees in the United States Its blatantly unconstitutional and decimates the rights of every single woman in the country she told me by email immediately after the vote on June 18 This attack on our hardestfought rights cannot go unanswered Her boss Stephanie Schriock the head of Emilys List took the fight directly to the Republicans Its clear that jobs the economy and the wellbeing of American women are not priorities for the GOP which just jumps from one piece of terrible antiwoman legislation to the next she said Women rejected the Republican agenda by historic margins in 2012 but its clear the GOP hasnt learned its lesson There is in fact little chance that the House measure which would ban abortions after 22 weeks of pregnancy will see the light of day in the Democraticcontrolled Senate and White House But it has undeniably had an effect Abortion is back on center stage in the countdown to the midterm elections next year and the vote in the House served to put the spotlight on several key states where antiabortion forces have quietly made significant inroads Prodded by public revulsion at the Philadelphia physician who was found guilty of murder for killing babies after botched lateterm abortions and citing a scientifically unproven theory that fetuses at 22 weeks can feel pain House Republicans and conservative lawmakers in state legislatures have reinvigorated the debate about abortion and have had some success in limiting it This is happening not only in Republicanled states For instance on Friday in New York considered among the most liberal of American states the State Senate which is controlled by Republicans and breakaway Democrats refused to pass the Womens Equality Act which included a provision to ensure abortion rights in the state Its unfortunate that political grandstanding has triumphed in New York State to the detriment of gender equality said Lauren Hersh the New York director of Equality Now an international organization working for justice for women and girls With the recent House vote in mind she said the New York measure would have furthered womens rights to reproductive health at a time when they are being eroded around the country not only at the state level but also at the federal level In the past three years at least 11 states have passed laws restricting abortions at or near 22 weeks the same limit imposed by the Houses PainCapable Unborn Child Protection Act South Carolina and Wisconsin are considering similar bans Arkansas and North Dakota have passed abortion restrictions and in Ohio an antiabortion bill would require transvaginal invasive ultrasounds In Texas spurred by Governor Rick Perry a Republican the State Senate passed a bill on June 18 that would close all but five abortion providers in the state This came after the state had curbed funding for Planned Parenthood clinics But the legislators put on hold pending legal challenges a provision similar to the Housepassed bill to limit abortions at 22 weeks of pregnancy Abortion opponents get a boost from national polls that show that abortion rights do not enjoy overwhelming public support unlike other hot social issues like samesex marriage and gun control Polls vary and none of them seem conclusive  which of course helps to fuel controversy and prompts each side to dig up surveys backing their positions Representative Marsha Blackburn Republican of Tennessee speaking on Fox News last Saturday brought up a poll showing that some 60 percent of Americans opposed secondtrimester abortions Ms Blackburn led the antiabortion legislation on the House floor though the bills author was Representative Trent Franks of Arizona who enraged some women with a comment that few rapes resulted in pregnancies But Ms Blackburn raised eyebrows too when she seemed to suggest that the House bill could lead to fewer rapes In any case a rekindled war over and between women has moved once again to the front lines in the American political and policy scene And it resonates well beyond US borders What is happening in the United States signals to the rest of the world that there is far more work to do to break down barriers to accessing safe abortion for women everywhere Pamela W Barnes the president and chief executive of the nonprofit global womens health organization EngenderHealth said in an email In EngenderHealths 70 years of experience she said what is constant is that women no matter how they live will go to great lengths to end an unwanted pregnancy even risking their lives
Lawsuit Challenges North Dakotaâ€™s Abortion Limits,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/lawsuit-challenges-north-dakotas-abortion-limits.html,A womens rights group filed a lawsuit in federal court on Tuesday to block the countrys most stringent abortion law a North Dakota ban on abortions as early as six weeks into pregnancy Adopted in March the law forbids abortions once a fetal heartbeat is detectable which can be as early as six weeks and before some women know they are pregnant Rights groups and the states only abortion clinic the Red River Womens Clinic in Fargo promised at the time to bring a legal challenge According to the Supreme Court women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb which is often around 24 weeks into pregnancy The enforcement of another early limit on abortions  a ban at 12 weeks that was enacted by Arkansas in March  was temporarily blocked last month by a federal judge who said it was likely to be found unconstitutional The latest lawsuit was filed in Federal District Court in Bismarck by the Center for Reproductive Rights on behalf of the clinic in Fargo The suit is also challenging the constitutionality of two other measures adopted by North Dakota this year one barring abortion because of genetic defects in the fetus the first provision of its kind in the country and one barring abortions for the purpose of sex selection The challenged measures seek to interfere directly in personal private medical decisions that the Constitution and more than 40 years of US Supreme Court precedent guarantee to women as a fundamental right said Nancy Northup the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights The adoption by North Dakota and Arkansas of earlyabortion bans based on the detection of a fetal heartbeat were the first victories for an impatient faction of the antiabortion movement that is seeking aggressive action to end abortions Proponents know the laws will face stiff legal resistance but are intending to take the fight to the Supreme Court where they hope a majority might be ready to scrap the fetalviability threshold that has stood for decades More mainstream organizations that oppose abortion including the National Right to Life and the Roman Catholic Church have advocated an incremental strategy of tightening regulations on clinics and working to ban abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization Such bans based on the scientifically disputed argument that the fetus can feel pain at that stage have been adopted by 11 states These laws are also inconsistent with Supreme Court rulings and have been temporarily blocked or declared unconstitutional in Arizona Georgia and Idaho On Monday the Texas House of Representatives adopted a 20week ban and other rules that could force dozens of abortion clinics to close The measures which are supported by Gov Rick Perry a Republican were expected to be debated by the State Senate on Tuesday

Filibuster in Texas Senate Tries to Halt Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/26/us/politics/senate-democrats-in-texas-try-blocking-abortion-bill-with-filibuster.html,AUSTIN Tex  Texas Democrats tried to prevent Republicans from passing a bill on Tuesday that would give the state some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the country even as Gov Rick Perry appeared ready to keep lawmakers in town to give the bill another chance The bill would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy require abortion clinics to meet the same standards that hospitalstyle surgical centers do and mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital Supporters of the bill including the governor and other top Republicans said the measures would protect womens health and hold clinics to safety standards but womens rights advocates said the legislation amounted to an unconstitutional politically motivated attempt to shut legal abortion clinics The bills opponents said it would most likely cause all but 5 of the 42 abortion clinics in the state to close because the renovations and equipment upgrades necessary to meet surgicalcenter standards would be too costly On Tuesday the Senate took up a version of the bill that the House had passed the day before But the 30day special session of the Legislature expired at midnight and there was confusion about whether a Senate vote passing the bill was legitimate Lt Gov David Dewhurst the presiding officer of the Senate and a supporter of the bill asked Senator Wendy Davis a Fort Worth Democrat if she still intended a filibuster as she had announced She told him yes and at 1118 am she began talking continuing until late Tuesday night Ms Davis wearing pink sneakers stood for hours on the floor of the Senate in an effort to run out the clock before lawmakers could vote on the bill The filibuster was interrupted shortly after 630 pm when Senator Tommy Williams a Republican from The Woodlands called for Ms Davis to be found in violation of filibuster rules because Senator Rodney Ellis a Houston Democrat had tried to put a back brace on her for assistance The tradition of this filibuster in the Senate has always been that you had to do it on your own Mr Williams said Senator Ellis youre well aware of that I believe Senators convened with Mr Dewhurst and later voted to uphold Mr Williamss objection It was Ms Daviss second violation of Senate rules after a third senators would be asked to vote on whether to allow her filibuster to proceed Mr Dewhurst said Ms Davis resumed speaking about 730 pm A third violation for straying off topic was sustained by Mr Dewhurst at 10 pm nearly 11 hours after the filibuster began causing opponents of the bill in the upstairs gallery to erupt in boos and jeers Senators then debated procedural points but with only a little more than an hour remaining until midnight the bills fate remained unclear Ms Davis remained standing because it was uncertain whether the filibuster had officially ended Republicans who control both the Senate and House would probably have another chance at passage Mr Perry who called the special session and put the abortion legislation Senate Bill 5 on the agenda may call a second special session and tell lawmakers to consider the bill again Democrats are likely to win the battle but lose the war over Senate Bill 5 said Mark P Jones a political science professor at Rice University in Houston The five clinics that would remain open if the bill passed are the only ones in Texas that meet the surgicalcenter requirements and all are in large cities Austin San Antonio and Dallas each have one and Houston has two Advocates for abortion rights said that the burden on those five clinics to provide womens health services would be extreme and that women in rural areas and small towns far from those cities would be underserved Two clinics in McAllen and Harlingen in South Texas  the only abortion providers in the area  would close they said forcing women seeking abortions to travel a few miles across the border into Mexico rather than drive four hours to San Antonio During her filibuster Ms Davis spoke about her opposition to the bill calling it a raw abuse of power by Mr Perry and other Republican leaders to shut legal clinics but also read aloud various documents letters and statements including testimony from numerous opponents of the bill Ms Davis 50 is something of a filibuster star among Texas Democrats At the end of the legislative term in 2011 she forced Mr Perry to call a special session after her filibuster ran the clock out on a budget bill that included billions of dollars in education cuts Lawmakers came back and passed them in a special session The United States Supreme Court has ruled that women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb often around 24 weeks into pregnancy The enforcement of another early limit  a ban at 12 weeks that Arkansas enacted in March  was temporarily blocked last month by a federal judge who said it was likely to be found unconstitutional
"In Texas, a Senatorâ€™s Stand Catches the Spotlight",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/us/politics/texas-abortion-bill.html,AUSTIN Tex  She was a state senator Tuesday morning By Wednesday she was a political celebrity known across the nation But also hoarse hungry and thirsty The legnumbing filibuster by Wendy Davis a Fort Worth Democrat  in which she stood and talked for more than 11 hours at the Capitol here never sitting eating drinking or even using the bathroom to help block passage of an antiabortion bill supported by the states top Republicans  was not the longest such marathon by Texas standards  But it didnt matter  Her feat of stamina and conviction gained thousands of Twitter followers in a matter of hours Pictures of the sneakers she wore beneath her dress zoomed across computer and television screens The press corps demanded to know her shoe brand Mizuno it turned out Hundreds of men women and children waited for hours at the Capitol to sit in an upstairs gallery and watch her in action standing in lines that snaked around the rotunda Even President Obama noticed posting a Twitter message on Tuesday that read Something special is happening in Austin tonight  Ms Davis 50 has known long odds and for Democrats was the perfect symbol in a fight over what a woman can do She was a teenager when her first child was born but managed as a single mother to pull herself from a trailer park to Harvard Law School to a hardfought seat in the Texas Senate a rare liberal representing conservative Tarrant County According to Mark P Jones a political science professor at Rice University in Houston she had the secondmost liberal voting record in the Senate in 2011 We have a State Capitol that is made up of people for the most part who are elected by Anglo communities suburban and rural and they are the majority voice in the Capitol although they arent reflective of the majority of the state of Texas she said in a previous interview On Tuesday night as she stood in her salmoncolored running shoes on the green carpeted floor of the Senate chamber and spoke about the bill from 1118 am to about 10 pm Republicans monitored virtually her every move and word waiting to catch her violating Texas obscure filibuster rules which prohibited her from leaning on her desk or straying off topic At one point they objected when a fellow Democrat tried to help put a back brace around Ms Davis who at that point had been standing for about seven hours straight Im tired but really happy Ms Davis told reporters in the Senate chamber at 320 am Wednesday as she finally made her way out of the building Im pleased to know that a spotlight is shining on Texas a spotlight is shining on the failure of our current leadership She was congratulated by lawmakers and womens rights advocates But the celebration was shortlived Hours later Gov Rick Perry announced that a second special session would begin Monday so lawmakers could take up the abortion bill once more Analysts said the bill would probably pass this time because Democrats in the Republicancontrolled Senate would be unable to delay for an entire 30day session As a lawmaker elected to the Senate in 2008 Ms Davis has shown charisma and guts and her life story has moved voters At the age of 14 she worked afterschool jobs to help support her mother and three siblings  My mother only had a sixthgrade education and it was really a struggle for us she said in a 2011 video for Generation TX She said she fell through the cracks in high school and shortly after she graduated she got married and divorced and was a single mother by age 19 I was living in a mobile home in southeast Fort Worth and I was destined to live the life that I watched my mother live she said in the video A coworker showed her a brochure for Tarrant County College and she took classes to become a paralegal working two jobs at the same time From there she received a scholarship to attend Texas Christian University in Fort Worth  becoming the first person in her family to earn a bachelors degree  and then went on to Harvard When I was accepted into Harvard Law School I remember thinking about who I am and where I came from and where I had been only a few years before she said These days she said her life outside the Capitol is nice and boring  she has two daughters ages 24 and 30 and tries to run regularly She has been dating a former mayor of Austin Will Wynn who put his arm around her shoulder early Wednesday as they walked out of the Senate chamber together It was an exhausting filibuster but it did not break the record The longest filibuster in American history took place 36 years earlier in the same place when Senator Bill Meier filibustered a bill for 43 hours in 1977 Ms Davis pushed her Republican rivals to make an embarrassing and rare public reversal Their attempts to derail her filibuster as the midnight deadline neared caused the gallery to erupt in screams throwing the results of the vote on the bill into disarray Hours after saying that they had passed the bill Republican leaders reversed course and said the vote did not follow legislative procedures rendering the vote moot and killing the bill It was Ms Daviss second star turn In 2011 she filibustered a budget bill that included huge cuts to public education forcing Governor Perry to call a special session in order for it to pass And it cemented her reputation as a Democrat in a Republicandominated state who many hope will run for statewide office Shes carrying every woman in the state of Texas if you will on her shoulders said Cecile Richards president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and a daughter of Ann Richards a former governor  The bill seeks to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers and mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital Opponents say it could lead to the closing of most of Texass 42 abortion clinics Rocking back and forth in her sneakers  to ease the pain in her lower back she said  Ms Davis read from letters sent to her office testimony submitted to committees and an article published in The Austin Chronicle At 10 pm the Senates presiding officer Lt Gov David Dewhurst sustained a violation for straying off the topic which Democrats disputed She had been talking about a law that prohibited abortions without the mother first undergoing a sonogram  As the clock neared midnight Republicans tried to end the debate and to vote causing the crowd to erupt At midnight another senator stood at Ms Daviss papercluttered desk and raised her arm in victory The crowd roared Ms Davis smiled It was not until about 1 am  about 14 hours after she first rose at 1118 am  that she quickly walked to the Senate lounge and for the first time sat down

A Landmark Day for Gay Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/opinion/a-landmark-day-for-gay-marriage.html,To the Editor The Supreme Court perhaps trying to blot the stain of its decision on Tuesday to gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965 struck down the Defense of Marriage Act on Wednesday nytimescom June 26 Now with the courts historic decision I believe that many more states will follow suit and pass legislation making it legal for gays and lesbians to marry While this is a tremendous victory for gay rights it is all the more curious that the same court did not apply 21stcentury logic to the rights of AfricanAmericans Latinos and other minorities with respect to their right to vote In the decision that brought DOMA down Justice Anthony M Kennedy was the swing vote as he was on Tuesday And the grim gang of four  Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr and Justices Antonin Scalia Samuel A Alito Jr and Clarence Thomas  once again sat on the same side this time in dissent We are a divided country with a divided Congress and a divided Supreme Court but at least for today the good guys won HENRY A LOWENSTEIN New York June 26 2013 To the Editor The Defense of Marriage Act and Californias Proposition 8 take their places in the dustbin of bad policies As a country we are at our best when we are inclusive and equitable We must continue to move forward until equality is reached on a broad level STEVEN M CLAYTON Ocean NJ June 26 2013 To the Editor Barack Obama in his second Inaugural Address brought together voting rights gay rights and the legacy of Lyndon B Johnson When Mr Obama said that the most evident of truths  that all of us are created equal  is the star that guides us still just as it guided our forebears through Seneca Falls and Selma and Stonewall he embraced the rhetoric of the gay rights movement as no other president had Fortyeight years earlier LBJ did same for the civil rights movement when he declared in introducing the Voting Rights Act It is not just Negroes but really it is all of us who must overcome the crippling legacy of bigotry and injustice And we shall overcome On Tuesday the Supreme Court extracted the teeth from the Voting Rights Act and on Wednesday it proclaimed that gay Americans are equal to their fellow citizens in the eyes of the law ALEXANDER HARRINGTON New York June 26 2013   The writer is a playwright whose Great Society about Lyndon B Johnson opens in New York in August  To the Editor Over the last two days the Supreme Court has handed down decisions that will affect the social structure of American society for years to come And they are decisions on opposite sides of the political spectrum In what is perceived as a victory for the right the court gutted the Voting Rights Act and undid the hallmark accomplishment of the civil rights movement And in a clear victory for the left the court overturned the Defense of Marriage Act signaling the opening of a new era for gay rights But the truth is that the court did not hand down these decisions Justice Anthony M Kennedy did In this court on any case with political implications there is a guaranteed 4to4 split between what one might call the Roberts group and the Ginsburg group Mediating between them like Solomon sits Justice Kennedy holding in his single vote unprecedented power to shape society It seems to me entirely unacceptable that the Supreme Court has become so politically polarized that every important decision is effectively in the hands of one justice PAUL SCHWARTZ Nyack NY June 26 2013 To the Editor Its interesting to see that the Supreme Courts decision on Tuesday regarding the Voting Rights Act deeply disappointed President Obama but the courts decision on Wednesday striking down the Defense of Marriage Act won his praise A perplexing court indeed Morally speaking the justices were wrong in regard to Dred Scott slavery Roe v Wade abortion and now DOMA gay marriage MATT C ABBOTT Chicago June 26 2013   The writer is a Catholic columnist for RenewAmericacom To the Editor Now that samesex married couples are guaranteed the same federal benefits as oppositesex couples could we please consider equal treatment for unmarried people Under Social Security and Medicare rules married and unmarried people make identical contributions if they have identical incomes But they dont get identical benefits Unless we can offer unmarried people benefits on a par with the spousal benefits that married people get then perhaps its time to reduce the Social Security and Medicare taxes the unmarried are required to pay Privatesector benefit plans dont require unmarried people to subsidize married couples in this way ALICE BRAY New York June 26 2013   The writer is a former benefits lawyer
Joining Together in Justice,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/opinion/blow-joining-together-in-justice.html,Proponents of equality have reason to both cheer and cry this week This week in a series of rulings the Supreme Court laid bare once more a continuing divide in this country about the role and limits of government in ensuring  or denying  equality In the University of Texas at Austin affirmative action case the Voting Rights Act case and the samesex marriage cases the court drew a line between policies that explicitly articulate exclusion and those that implicitly and effectually remedy exclusion  both current and historical Proponents of racial diversity were on the losing end of those rulings and samesex marriage proponents were on the winning end The court set a higher bar for including race as one factor among many in university admissions and struck down a key provision of the Voting Rights Act But it also voided the Defense of Marriage Act and declined to decide the Proposition 8 case effectively allowing samesex marriage in California One movement for equality had its spirits lifted and another had them crushed But the truth is that these movements are not wholly dissimilar All combatants for justice are cousins Jim Crow and Jim Queer are of a kind So given what happened on the racial civil rights front this week the LGBT civil rights movement would be wise to take heed Overcoming blatantly unconstitutional laws is only a first step in the neverending march toward justice It is in the decades that follow that discriminatory policies can become more illusory Thats when even if the net effect of a law is that it is discriminatory the law itself may not be seen as such In this murky period intent can be deemed unknowable and effect can be deemed inadvertent This is when the courts  and the law  can essentially say that if you can throw a rock and hide your hand you can in turn hide your guilt This is when personal discrimination fades into the fog of a more ominous and amorphous structural discrimination This is when legacy injustice which can reverberate for generations through a population is assigned term limits Fatigue grows in the wake of fairness Thats the fight equality movements must mount when they grow up  shadowboxing I sincerely believe that in my lifetime gay marriage will be legal in the whole of the country But it is unlikely that the LGBT community will become more than a minority group I also know that the changing of laws does not work in tandem with the changing of hearts which means that minority groups are always vulnerable When the laws change some things simply become subterfuge In striking down Section 4 of the Voting Rights Act Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr wrote things have changed dramatically But I submit that so have certain tactics Just ask black civil rights leaders still fighting a huge prison industrial complex police policies like stopandfrisk and predatory lending practices Ask womens rights leaders still fighting for equal pay defending a womans right to sovereign authority of her own body  including full access to a wide range of reproductive options Ask proimmigration groups fighting a wave of antiimmigrant sentiment To those celebrating the gay rights victory this is your moment Enjoy it To racial diversity warriors mourn But not for long In the morning we must all rise together and remember what Winston Churchill reportedly said Success is not final failure is not fatal it is the courage to continue that counts Remember also what the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr wrote from the Birmingham jail Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere And remember that it is no coincidence that there is quite a bit of overlap among the states that were covered by the Voting Rights Act those that have constitutional bans on samesex marriage those with some of the most restrictive abortion laws and those that have considered or passed some of the strictest antiimmigrant bills Racial hostility homophobia and misogyny are braided together like strands of the same rope When we fight one we fight them all Engaging in combat as a coalition reinforces and expands everyones power reach and influence We must realize that if everyone can see the sameness in these struggles rather than the differences we will be able to see that America is already a majority minority country
Wendy and the Boys,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/opinion/collins-wendy-and-the-boys.html,There is an old saying that Texas is heaven for men and dogs but hell for women and oxen But the states history is chockfull of stories of female role models Barbara Jordan Ann Richards In downtown Austin theres a statue of Angelina Eberly heroine of the Texas Archives War of 1842 firing a cannon and looking about 7 feet tall I do not have nearly enough time to explain to you about the Archives War although its an extremely interesting story Right now we need to move on to State Senator Wendy Davis whose 11hour filibuster this week turned her into a national name brand It was like a madeforTV movie Ive been around the block but Ive never seen anything like this said Cecile Richards the president of Planned Parenthood and the daughter of the former governor Texas is a state with one of the nations highest teenage motherhood rates where a majority of women who give birth are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid So naturally its political leaders have declared war against the right of women to choose whether or not they want to be pregnant Funding for family planning has been slashed This month Gov Rick Perry tried to pass a new law that would have shut down almost all the abortion clinics in the state under the guise of expanded health and safety requirements  Huge crowds showed up to protest This was pretty remarkable because Texas is not currently known as a place where people pay intense attention to what goes on in its State Capitol A recent study at the University of Texas at Austin found that it has one of the nations lowest political and civic participation rates Also the conventional wisdom is that when things get politically rowdy its because of a visitation from the right Yet there the protesters were filling the Senate gallery and overflow rooms squishing into the halls and the rotunda flowing down the Capitol front steps and into the mall  The bill arrived at the State Senate its final stop on the last day of the legislative session Late in the morning Davis got up to filibuster until midnight when the clock ran out  Like Ann Richards Davis is good on her feet with a spectacular head of hair and a gift for funny speeches But on Tuesday she was angry and ready for a fight In the Texas Capitol she said later in a phone interview theres a complete disregard for womens rights by those without uteruses  The Texas filibuster rules are suitable for a place that regards steer wrestling and bronco busting as the official state sport We made a big fuss when Rand Paul stayed on his feet for 13 hours in the US Senate to filibuster over drones But that was a walk in the park compared with what Davis went through Paul got help from his friends who orated while he rested his voice And US senators can speak about anything when they filibuster Paul read from Alice in Wonderland Davis was supposed to stick to her subject The crowd was reasonably quiet until Lt Gov David Dewhurst ruled that Davis had to sit down because she had gone off topic by referencing a state law requiring that women who want abortions must show up a day earlier for an ultrasound That wouldnt have happened to any other senator said Davis who believes she was treated dismissively because she is a woman  or at least a woman filibustering on womens issues  The people in the gallery began to yell Dewhurst who complained about an unruly mob using Occupy Wall Street tactics could not get control of the room before time ran out Texas is now engaged in a debate over whether it is worse to yell in the State Senate or declare a senator out of order for discussing the state abortion laws during a debate on abortion Meanwhile pictures of the pink sneakers worn by Wendy Davis during her filibuster have resurfaced as posters The antiabortion bill will be back Vowing not to give way to the breakdown of decorum and decency Governor Perry called a special emergency session for July 1 to take it up again  The protesters will undoubtedly be back too Theyve tasted victory  what it means to organize and win predicted Cecile Richards And Texans are wondering if this could be a new era for a state that really hasnt been in the national eye for ages  unless you count the Rick Perry oops moment Politics has been so dormant in Texas said Evan Smith the editor of The Texas Tribune whose livecast of Daviss filibuster was viewed by 182000 people The point is the world is watching now A few years back Davis told me about an incident during a debate when she had asked a veteran Republican a question about a pending bill Dodging her query he said I have trouble hearing womens voices I guess they can hear her now 
What Rick Perry Said About Wendy Davis,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/06/27/what-rick-perry-said-about-wendy-davis/,"Earlier today Governor Rick Perry delivered a speech at the National Right to Life conference in which he argued that Wendy Davis the state senator who filibustered to defeat an antiabortion bill should know better
                                        than to support choice Who are we to say that children born into the worst of circumstances cant grow to live successful lives In fact even the woman who filibustered the Senate the other day was born into difficult circumstances
                                            She was the daughter of a single woman she was a teenage mother herself She managed to eventually graduate from Harvard Law School and serve in the Texas senate It is just unfortunate that she hasnt
                                            learned from her own example that every life must be given a chance to realize its full potential and that every life matters Mr Perrys comments were quickly characterized as a jab at Ms Davis and as a vile
                                        attack Though condescending and clumsy he probably just meant to emphasize that Ms Davis was given a chance presumably a euphemism for not aborted so from Mr Perrys
                                        perspective she of all people should want everyone else to be given a chance too
                                         But he also inadvertently made the case for why Ms Davis of all people is a good spokesperson for the prochoice camp When she became pregnant she could have chosen abortion
                                         but chose instead to become a mother while still a teenager The choice was hers and she wants other women to retain the right to choose as well  hence her filibuster Although its of course true that some children born into the worst of circumstances grow up to lead successful lives Ms Davis isnt typical According to the National Campaign to Prevent Teen Pregnancy
                                        twothirds of families begun by a young unmarried mother are poor and onequarter of teen mothers go on welfare within 3 years of the childs birth The situation in Texas is especially bad As Gail Collins
                                        mentioned in her column today Texas is a state with one of the nations highest teenage motherhood rates
                                        where a majority of women who give birth are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid"
Supreme Court Takes Step Toward Hearing Abortion Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/us/supreme-court-takes-step-toward-hearing-abortion-case.html,The Supreme Court took a tentative step on Thursday toward hearing a case on the regulation of abortioninducing drugs asking the Oklahoma Supreme Court to clarify the meaning of a law that state judges had struck down as an unwarranted curb on medical practice and the right to abortion Depending on the answers the Supreme Court could decide to drop the case Cline v Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice No 121094 or it could intervene in a contentious new battleground of the abortion wars The 2011 law voided in Oklahoma said that the drugs which are widely used in medicinal nonsurgical abortions could be administered only in the dosage and manner specified by the Food and Drug Administration when it first approved their use in 2000 The law was promoted by antiabortion groups in the name of protecting womens health from offlabel uses of the drugs that have become standard practice The procedure has come into wide use accounting for nearly onefifth of the countrys 12 million abortions in 2008 according to the Guttmacher Institute a research group that supports abortion rights Similar laws prohibiting departures from the 2000 labeling have been adopted in Ohio and Arizona and restricting medicinal abortions has become a goal of antiabortion forces Abortion doctors and major medical associations who have refined the dosages and other aspects of medicinal abortions over the years call these laws a transparent attempt to curb a procedure that in the early weeks of pregnancy is often preferable to a surgical abortion More broadly offlabel uses of drugs are common and essential to medical practice they argue The FDA doesnt decide how doctors should prescribe drugs Julie Rikelman litigation director for the Center for Reproductive Rights a nonprofit legal advocacy organization said in an interview on Thursday Doctors decide how to prescribe drugs Her group based in New York has argued against the Oklahoma law in court on behalf of a coalition of womens health advocates in the state An Oklahoma court ruled that the law violated womens bodily integrity and right to abortion and struck it down saying it can serve no purpose other than to prevent women from obtaining abortions The states highest court affirmed that decision and now the state attorney general has appealed to the Supreme Court arguing that the law is a reasonable exercise of state power One of the main drugs used in medicinal abortions mifepristone formerly known as RU486 has been a subject of political strife for decades In the 1990s abortion opponents fearing that it would make abortion too easy and acceptable fought to prevent American approval of the drug which had been widely used abroad In 2000 the FDA approved the combination of mifepristone a steroid that breaks down the lining of the uterus and misoprostol a prostaglandin that induces contractions The agency did so based on clinical trials involving a large dose of mifepristone in the clinic a dose of misoprostol in the clinic two days later then a third clinic visit on the 14th day to verify that the embryo had aborted The procedure was recommended for use through seven weeks of pregnancy Since then studies have shown that mifepristone works as well at onethird the previously used dose that it is safe to take the second medication at home and that the procedure is safe and effective through the ninth week of pregnancy according to the National Abortion Federation the World Health Organization and other medical groups Serious complications are rare most medical experts say But antiabortion groups argue that the offlabel uses are unapproved and more dangerous Those who challenged the Oklahoma law say it has vague provisions that go beyond those in other states barring all medicinal abortions and outlawing use of a drug to end ectopic pregnancies The Supreme Court has asked the Oklahoma justices to clarify whether the law would have such sweeping effects But even if the law simply mandated the treatment regime approved by the FDA in 2000 Ms Rikelman said it would still be medically unjustified and inhibit womens exercise of their constitutional rights

"After a Senate Filibuster, All Over but the Shouting",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/us/after-a-senate-filibuster-all-over-but-the-shouting.html,AUSTIN  Minutes before midnight at the Texas Capitol on Tuesday thousands of protesters stopped a restrictive abortion bill in its tracks by yelling at the top of their lungs  The remarkable moment had not been planned by the established groups like Planned Parenthood Naral ProChoice Texas and the Texas Democratic Party that had organized protests against the Senate vote on the measure Instead it grew with the help of a smaller coalition  including local chapters of the Occupy movement and the International Socialist Organization or ISO  that helped goad the crowd to a level of civil disobedience not seen in the Texas Capitol in decades This was an excellent example of national organizations and grassroots organizations working together and not really stepping on each others toes and really each doing what they do the best said Tiffany Bishop of GetEqual Texas a gay rights grassroots organization that had members at the protest It was really amazing to me to see the people from Naral and Planned Parenthood screaming along with us Abortionrights activists had spent nearly a week coming to the capitol to protest restrictions proposed by Republican lawmakers during a 30day special session called by Gov Rick Perry to address a handful of disparate issues The version of the bill known as SB 5 that reached the Senate on Tuesday  the last day of the special session  included a ban on most abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and a requirement that abortion facilities meet the standards of an ambulatory surgical center Opponents predicted the bill would lead to the closing of nearly all of the states abortion facilities  State Senator Wendy Davis Democrat of Fort Worth filibustered the bill with the goal of speaking on the measure until midnight the time by which the special session was legally required to end Supporters of the bill said it was about improving womens health not restricting it and charged Ms Davis with thwarting the will of lawmakers elected by the majority of Texans Gov Rick Perry has called for a new special session beginning next week For the remaining abortions that do take place safety will be there State Representative Bryan Hughes Republican of Mineola said Were talking in that case about the safety of the woman Ms Davis drew significant national attention by drawing out the filibuster for 11 hours at which point the Senates Republican leadership successfully employed parliamentary maneuvers to end it  Throughout the day the Capitol had slowly filled with protesters the vast majority of whom were opposed to the legislation By the time Ms Davis ended her filibuster after 10 pm thousands were crammed into the rotunda and in the halls near the Senate gallery some of them having traveled from around the state I had just wanted to go support Wendy and her filibuster said Jenny Foster an Austin resident who heard about the rally from news reports I didnt realize it would become an act of civil disobedience I know people who drove up from Houston for it after work added State Representative Jessica Farrar Democrat of Houston who helped lead efforts to delay the bills passage from the House two days earlier  During the ninehour debate before that vote and a drawnout hearing the week before protest leaders frequently squashed periodic outbursts from activists Democratic officials as well as representatives of Naral ProChoice Texas and Planned Parenthood said the goal at earlier demonstrations and throughout most of the day Tuesday was to show strength in numbers but to avoid confrontations that would result in protesters being ejected from the building We were worried about getting cleared out earlier and not being able to be there for Wendy Davis said Heather Busby the executive director of Naral ProChoice Texas The mood shifted late Tuesday as lastditch efforts of Senate Democrats to stall the vote began to falter Several members of Occupy the Austin ISO and other radicals were wanting to be louder said Dave Cortez of Occupy Austin And since last week we had been told be respectful respect decorum Around 11 pm chants of Wendy and Kill the bill gained volume Our job as we saw it was to gauge the crowd and see what the potential was for taking things in the most radical direction possible said Katie Feyh of the Austin ISO chapter Cecile Richards president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America had staked out a spot in the center of the rotunda not far from where a portrait of her mother former Gov Ann Richards hung on the wall She and others including some Democratic lawmakers could be seen occasionally gesturing to the crowd to quiet down Shortly before midnight though those in the Senate gallery erupted in cheers and soon began clapping in unison A larger crowd outside the Senate chambers doors joined in The chain reaction spread to the rotunda where thousands soon began yelling Various activists began urging people to be even louder and to keep at it with the hope of drowning out the Senate  We were losing anyway Ms Bishop said I think that was everyone elses opinion too When you have 3000 people packed at the Capitol it gives everyone a lot of courage and a lot of strength and a lot of unity At first some people working with Ms Richards could be seen making timeout gestures After word spread from the floor that the noise was effectively grinding the Senate to a halt Ms Richards began pumping her arms in the air signaling to all around her to be as loud as possible The noise in the Capitol grew to a roar  Her support really helped put it all together Mr Cortez said With every passing minute activists put fingers in the air to signify the minutes left until midnight  I turned my hearing aids all the way down and I still got deaf from the noise said David Plylar of San Antonio who attended the protests with his wife But it was a happy noise The Senate did not complete a vote on the bill until 1203 am At 3 am Lt Gov David Dewhurst admitted that the bill was dead and put the blame for its failure on the protesters This is the most incredible thing Ive ever seen in my life Mr Dewhurst said An unruly mob using Occupy Wall Street tactics has tried all day to derail legislation that has been intended to protect the lives and the safety of women and babies Ms Farrar disputed that characterization and argued that the protesters were responding in large part to the belief that Ms Daviss filibuster had been inappropriately cut short They didnt feel like the process was fair and it just erupted Ms Farrar said They were determined to finish Wendys filibuster
"Credit Luck, and a Filibuster, For Democratsâ€™ Abortion Win",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/28/us/credit-luck-and-a-filibuster-for-democrats-abortion-win.html,For Democrats the next question is a big one Was that the Alamo The states minority party had been having a bad month A relatively genteel regular legislative session addressing issues like the budget water taxes and education gave way to a special session focused on a couple of deeply contentious political issues redistricting and regulation of abortion  The Democrats knew they would get hammered on redistricting Led by Gov Rick Perry and Attorney General Greg Abbott a mostly Republican Legislature was being asked to ratify legislative and Congressional maps that could protect the Republican majority for a decade  It was all Democrats could do to force a handful of public hearings around the state to try to raise issues that might be useful when the courts resume the long argument over the district lines The votes were lopsided and predictable and in favor of the Republicans The governor quickly signed the maps into law as expected and the next stop will be a federal courthouse But the debates on abortion were different They started late in the session not really getting under way until the last week or so Legislative deadlines enable legislative minorities who know they will eventually lose when an issue comes to a vote but can sometimes delay things long enough to prevent that losing vote from ever taking place  Here is another thing The general public does not take part in stadiumsize rallies on political maps It is rarely difficult to find a good seat at a public hearing on redistricting Abortion is different and the proposed bill had several flash points including a ban on abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and higher standards for abortion clinics that only 5 of the states 42 facilities would have met without expensive upgrades  What was supposed to be a rallying point for antiabortion conservatives instead proved to be a bigger draw for liberals in favor of reproductive rights Demonstrators showed up in growing numbers as the various debates went on in committees in the House and then in the Senate  Because of some combination of good strategy bad strategy and dumb luck the legislation got to the full Senate on the last day of the special session within range of a filibuster Cue the Democrats The political hero State Senator Wendy Davis Democrat of Fort Worth largely carried the debate preventing a vote until the last two hours of the day Other senators picked it up from there arguing methodically and slowly  emphasis on slowly  about rules that were being used to shut down the filibuster about the legislative process and about the conduct of the Senate  A procedural fight is the kind of thing that tempts high school and college students to cut classes and shoot pool But it was made gripping by the deep passions on all sides of the debate by the partisan underpinnings and by the stakes for players like Ms Davis and Lt Gov David Dewhurst  Do not forget to throw in a large crowd packing the Senate gallery and the Capitol itself and the added twist of running news commentary and goading via social media In the hours around midnight the online video audience topped 200000 Twitter hashtags linked to the event became top trends People were energized making latenight promises to take what they had seen and become politically active The conservatives thought the liberals had manipulated the rules to delay the vote until the bitter end When it finally happened forensic work would later show it was three minutes past the midnight deadline That killed the bill and prompted the governor to call another special session starting next week  The Democrats were accusing the Republicans of interpreting the Senates rules in a way most beneficial to their side of trumping up rulings to cut off the filibuster and of favoring their own senators procedural requests  There is some truth to both arguments But it turned out to be the Democrats night punctuated by a question during the final moments of debate that crystallized the proceedings the way that Col William B Traviss line in the sand rallied revolutionaries who went on to win Texas from Mexico At what point asked State Senator Leticia Van de Putte Democrat of San Antonio must a female senator raise her hand or her voice to be recognized over her male colleagues

                                        Gov Rick Perry said it was unfortunate she had not learned that every life matters given that she was the child of a single mother who went on to earn a Harvard law degree In a speech to nearly 1000 delegates at the National Right to Life Conference near Dallas Mr Perry struck

Contraceptives Stay Covered in Health Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/us/politics/final-rule-issued-for-contraceptive-coverage.html,WASHINGTON  Despite strong resistance from religious organizations the Obama administration said Friday that it was moving ahead with a rule requiring most employers to provide free insurance coverage of contraceptives for women a decision that has touched off a legal and political battle likely to rage for another year The final rule issued under the new health care law adopts a simplified version of an approach proposed by the government in February to balance the interests of women with the concerns of the Roman Catholic Church and other employers with religious objections to providing coverage for contraceptives After considering more than 400000 comments administration officials refused to budge on the basic principle The rule they said is very similar to their proposal An exemption is included for churches But many Catholic hospitals schools universities and other religious institutions will have to take steps so that coverage is available to employees and their dependents The issue figured prominently in last years elections as President Obama and other Democrats pressed their advantage with female voters At the same time Catholic bishops waged a national campaign arguing that the federal policy infringed on religious freedom and violated the churchs social and moral teachings on birth control and abortion  Cardinal Timothy M Dolan of New York president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops said the group was reviewing the final rule Democrats describe the mandate for coverage of birth control as one of the chief benefits of the 2010 health care law a boon to women and their health The health care law guarantees millions of women access to recommended preventive services at no cost said Kathleen Sebelius the secretary of health and human services Todays announcement reinforces our commitment to respect the concerns of houses of worship and other nonprofit religious organizations that object to contraceptive coverage while helping to ensure that women get the care they need regardless of where they work Republicans say the requirement shows how intrusive and onerous the law is The rule does not satisfy the concerns of certain religious organizations or businesses whose owners have religious objections to contraceptive coverage The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit in Denver said Thursday that the owners of Hobby Lobby a craft store chain that describes itself as a faithbased company could pursue their case against the rule Eric C Rassbach a deputy general counsel of the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which has represented plaintiffs in that case and others challenging the law said the final rule did nothing to meet the objections of his clients The government tinkered with some mechanisms in the rule but did not really get at the religious conscience questions Mr Rassbach said So there is a fundamental conflict that will have to be resolved in court Under the rule women are to have access to contraceptives without any premium deductible copayment or other fees Some religious employers do not want their employees to have coverage of contraceptives even if someone else pays for it A number of federal judges deferred decisions until the White House issued a final regulation Publication of the rule clears the way for courts to act Under the new health care law employers with more than 50 employees will generally be required to offer health insurance to employees or the employers will be subject to financial penalties Among the essential health benefits that must be provided are preventive services In particular the administration says most health plans must cover sterilization and the full range of contraceptive methods approved by the Food and Drug Administration including emergency contraceptive pills like those known as ella and Plan B OneStep Under the rule issued Friday the government said certain religious employers  primarily houses of worship  may exclude contraceptive coverage from their health plans for employees and their dependents In effect they will be exempt from the federal requirement to provide contraceptive coverage The rule also lays out what it describes as an accommodation for other nonprofit religious and churchaffiliated organizations like hospitals universities and charities that object to contraceptive coverage but do not qualify for the exemption Under the rule these organizations will not have to contract arrange or pay for contraceptive coverage to which they object on religious grounds Instead the administration said such coverage will be separately provided to women enrolled in their health plans at no cost Under this arrangement a nonprofit religious employer must notify its insurer that it objects to contraceptive coverage The insurer must then notify people in the health plan that it will arrange or pay for contraceptive services as long as they remain in the health plan Many employers serve as their own insurers and hire outside companies to administer benefits and pay claims In such cases the administration said the thirdparty administrator must inform people in an employersponsored health plan that it is providing or arranging separate nocost payments for contraceptive services Administration officials said the cost of contraceptive services would for insurers be offset by savings that result from the fact that women would be healthier and will have fewer births To reimburse thirdparty administrators for the cost of contraceptive services the government said it would reduce the fees charged to certain health insurance companies for the privilege of selling insurance in federal marketplaces or exchanges being established in more than 30 states Insurers will then be required to share some of those savings with thirdparty administrators for the selfinsured health plans of religious employers that object to contraceptive coverage The reduction in user fees would reflect the cost of contraceptive services as well as an allowance for administrative costs and margin or profit The government would require thirdparty administrators to provide detailed information about the payments they made or arranged Federal officials had difficulty explaining how these arrangements would work in practice They said they were leaving the details to employers insurers and thirdparty administrators The Labor Department said it had the authority to require thirdparty administrators to provide or arrange for an insurance company or other entity to provide payment for contraceptive services The final rule is the administrations fourth attempt in 20 months to articulate a policy requiring contraceptive coverage Senator Patty Murray Democrat of Washington said Todays ruling strikes a fair balance between religious liberties and the reproductive rights of all women Access to contraception shouldnt be dictated by a womans employer But Patrick J Reilly president of the Cardinal Newman Society which promotes Catholic education said the final rule did not respect the religious freedom of religious employers Now the lawsuits can proceed he said
The Wrenching Story of Her Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/opinion/the-wrenching-story-of-her-abortion.html,To the Editor My Abortion at 23 Weeks by Judy Nicastro OpEd June 21 brought me to tears This is the first time in decades that I have read or even heard such a powerful example of why abortion must continue to be available to women I too decry the easy terms prochoice and antiabortion because they simplify the difficult decisions facing women at junctures like those Ms Nicastro describes Abortion should never take the place of birth control Abortion is appropriately there for moments like these where there is no choice Abortion is never the easy route but sometimes it is the only option MICHELLE NEUMANN Roslyn NY June 21 2013  To the Editor Judy Nicastros essay is a powerful reminder of the ethical and emotional complexity of pregnancy obscured in our vitriolic public debates about abortion But her story is not a compelling ethical argument against reasonable restrictions on abortion The medical counsel Ms Nicastro received seemed to suggest that the choice was either termination or burdensome largely futile postnatal life support But just as at the end of life refusing burdensome life support measures for an infant can be an ethically sound choice and morally preferable to intentionally killing a patient Further nowhere is it suggested that carrying her son to term would have endangered Ms Nicastros life or that of the twin a situation one hopes would be an exception to any legal restrictions In fact the only mention of risk was that posed to the female twin by the abortion itself Discussion of abortion must include the fullest account of such relevant facets of medical decisionmaking SARAH MOSES University Miss June 21 2013 The writer an assistant professor of philosophy and religion at the University of Mississippi teaches a course on medical ethics  To the Editor  I thank Judy Nicastro for bravely telling the story of her abortion As an obstetriciangynecologist I have met many women who are faced with the news that their baby has significant problems Some women decide to have an abortion while some wish to continue their pregnancies My job is to support their decision and help these women through a difficult time in their lives without interference from the government It is time for members of Congress and state governments to listen to women like Ms Nicastro and stop passing legislation that restricts access to abortion As she so clearly demonstrates womens health care choices must be respected DAVID R KATTAN Melrose Mass June 21 2013  To the Editor  The real issue behind Judy Nicastros justification to abort her child with congenital herniated diaphragm is Do the sick and suffering have a right to exist Her answer is no If her son had been born he would have needed surgery and possibly for a time a machine to help him breathe Ms Nicastro says The thought of hearing him gasp for air and linger in pain was our nightmare The suffering was something she could not bear and so abortion became the reasonable option Ms Nicastro failed in ultimate compassion Instead of suffering with her son she philosophically justified turning her womb into a death chamber Ironically the majority of children with congenital herniated diaphragm can be treated and survive Here we have the ethics of Aldous Huxleys Brave New World where human worth is measured by productivity and quality of life and where those who are sick old handicapped and dying are eliminated to create a world without pain Once society forfeits the primary principle that the lives of the innocent are inviolable as has been done in legal abortion any killing may be justified MONICA MIGLIORINO MILLER South Lyon Mich June 24 2013 The writer director of Citizens for a ProLife Society is  an associate professor of theology at Madonna University
Expect the Unexpected,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/29/opinion/collins-expect-the-unexpected.html,Every once in a while something happens that challenges your entire view of the order of the universe For instance this week the US Senate actually passed something Meanwhile in Texas liberal Democrats and the abortion rights movement won a huge political victory If we keep this up soon we will hear that in Africa migrating herds of wildebeests stopped moving and began settling into trailer parks Lets take a look at Texas where the nowfamous 11hour filibuster by State Senator Wendy Davis defeated a major antiabortion bill lifted the longdead spirit of the states Democrats and created many news articles in which the word thrilling was coupled with state senate The next day however Gov Rick Perry announced that he was calling a new special session to take up the bill again We Democrats are strategizing Davis said in a phone interview declining to go into details  Perhaps she can pull out her pink sneakers and filibuster for two or three weeks There actually was a state senator in Texas back in 1977 who stood and talked for 43 hours using what he called an astronaut bag to answer the problem of bathroom breaks I wouldnt count on it But that doesnt mean we didnt see something important happen in Austin  The Texas antiabortion tear has followed the same arc as in many other states First came the assumption that women just needed to have the situation explained to them So the Legislature required them to look at an ultrasound of the fetus before any abortion The law didnt have much impact so the lawmakers moved on to Stage 2 Remove the option The bill that failed to get passed in Austin this week would have banned abortions after 20 weeks Meanwhile the clinics that perform earlyterm abortions would have been subject to new health and safety requirements that would force most of them to close Were really regulated already said Amy Hagstrom Miller who runs five abortion facilities in the state Primarily what were talking about in this bill is the physical plant  the size of the hallways locker rooms closets She estimates that it would cost at minimum 45 million to bring her facilities up to the new unnecessary code The bill also requires that doctors performing abortions have hospitaladmitting privileges within 30 miles of the clinic in question In many places that cant be gotten Most hospitals want you to admit at least 10 patients a year Miller said Over the last 10 years Ive had two emergency transfers from our facility in Austin This has been going on all over the country and if the high drama in the State Senate in Texas does nothing beyond making the story clear itll have done a lot  In Austin as in state capitols from North Dakota to Alabama the bill was described in debates as a simple public safety measure I am trying to look at what can actually improve the quality of care  But there wasnt all that much effort to conceal that the real intent was eliminating the abortion option Americans have conflicted attitudes toward this issue but one thing thats consistently clear is that they dont want a wholesale abortion ban Politicians like Rick Perry will only get their way if the public doesnt get the point  Ditto on family planning As part of a scorchedearth war against Planned Parenthood Texas wiped out funds for contraceptive services for poor women The damage has been wrought and its going to take a long time to undo it said Davis When she brought that up during her filibuster the lieutenant governor ruled she had strayed from the point Texas Democrats who havent won a statewide race in two decades are now eyeing Davis as a possible gubernatorial candidate in 2014 Perry took time out to attack her during a speech in Dallas to the righttolife movement which we will try to resist noting took place the day after Texas conducted its 500th modernera execution Perry claimed that in fighting for abortion rights Davis the daughter of a single mother and herself a single mother at 19 who got herself through college and Harvard Law hasnt learned from her own example  You will not be stunned to hear that Davis takes a different lesson from her story The Planned Parenthood clinic on Henderson Street in Fort Worth was my sole source of health care for four to five years when I was a young adult she said Consider a 19yearold single mom who wants to be smarter about her family planning so she can go to school and move forward with her career Had I not had those services available to me I would not be standing where I am today Let the country tune in on that debate and then well have a real leap forward 
Camping for Feminism,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/nyregion/camping-for-feminism.html,On Thursday morning Courtney Cook a 17yearold art student from Winnetka Ill who was spending the week with her mother at the Jade Hotel downtown sat in the Lexington Avenue offices of the nonprofit group Choices in Childbirth and talked about her maternal fantasies Id like to have a baby like right now Ms Cook explained to a group of peers and educators but I know its not a good time Although she doesnt plan to have a child until she is 30 she had become obsessed with motherhood after hours of watching A Baby Story a reality series on the procreationobsessed cable network TLC Such is the extent of her fascination that she keeps pictures of nurseries on her Pinterest board Ms Cook has ruminated too over the method of delivery she would choose I always thought Id have a Csection because I know the other way messes up your vag she said referring to the element of anatomy essential to vaginal childbirth But now this view seemed subject to reappraisal Ms Cook and a group of other teenage girls had just watched a condensed version of The Business of Being Born a documentary that takes a skeptical look at hospitalized childbirth contrasting the arrogant and stressful world of medicine with images of women having babies at home in shallow pools of water as calmly as if they were placing orders from Fresh Direct  The visit to Choices in Childbirth came toward the end of the sort of quintessentially Manhattan summer experience in which lanyard making is never considered Feminist Camp The initiative of Amy Richards and Jennifer Baumgardner activists in the womens movement in New York and the cofounders of Soapbox Inc a speakers bureau for feminist voices the weeklong camp is in its inaugural season as a program for high school students having begun a few years ago for the college aged  The idea began percolating several years ago Ms Richards told me when she looked around and did not see much in the way of books or classes on contemporary feminist activity There was little in terms of practical applications of feminism she said Beyond believing in equality what did it look like inÂ real time During their week of progressive education Ms Cook and her fellow campers who numbered seven in all received an illuminating talk from a young Hampshire College graduate and doula Lauren Mitchell whose work includes counseling and comforting those undergoing abortions She has also taught women to better understand their bodies in a class called At Your Cervix Additionally the group went to see Ann Holland Taylors play about the former Texas governor Ann Richards the girls had never heard of her visited the Elizabeth A Sackler Center for Feminist Art at the Brooklyn Museum met with SPARK a group of activists seeking to end the sexualized objectification of girls and women in popular culture and talked with Sabrina Shulman the vice president of policy and legislative affairs at Naral ProChoice New York  Although something called Feminist Camp with this particular curriculum would seem designed to cause Bill OReilly to take a fishing spear to his appendix the enterprise hardly needs justification at a time when the Internet fuels fantasies of barbecuing women and eating them when 11hour filibusters are required to attempt to protect abortion access when something as benign as the Womens Equality Act cannot get passed in the liberal state of New York despite broad popular support  Most of the girls in the group were from in or around New York City and not all were privileged Soapbox offers scholarships toward the 1000 tuition for those who cant afford the camp The experiences of misogyny and antichoice rhetoric in some cases was intimate One girl had to call 911 to report a stepfather who was abusing her mother Another girl who attended the Elisabeth Irwin High School here had previously gone to an Anglican school in Australia she said where she had been subjected to a mural of fetuses on the wall  What became clear in talking to the girls is that they seemed to feel alienated in their beliefs a certain view has taken hold among teenagers that privileges gay rights over womens rights To advocate for gay marriage is a fashionable thing to do people are more afraid to be homophobic than they are to be sexist I have friends who are very religious and theyre progay Isbella Starvaggi one of the campers told me but not prochoice The girls talked about the stigma they face if they remain sexually inactive and the inevitable shame theyd encounter if they became pregnant And yet few of their friends are willing to understand these kinds of paradoxes in the context of gender disparity  When you bring up feminism people are like We dont need that anymoreÂ  Ms Cook said of her classmates Reality would obviously argue otherwise
No Letup on the Right to Choose,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/30/opinion/sunday/no-letup-on-the-right-to-choose.html,Wendy Davis a Texas state senator got national attention last week for her marathon filibuster against an extremist package of abortion restrictions Ms Daviss dramatic gesture is unlikely to stop the hardright Texas Legislature from passing the bill and there are many similar measures around the country that are part of a nonstop attack on womens reproductive rights by Republican lawmakers and antiabortion groups But her uprising which shot around the country on Twitter and the rest of the social Web showed that Democrats can fight back against the antiabortionrights campaign It is already showing signs of revitalizing a somnambulant Texas Democratic Party and it should inspire abortionrights advocates everywhere  Last Tuesday talking for more than 11 hours Ms Davis actually blocked passage of the new abortion restrictions by essentially running out the clock on a special legislative session Her victory may prove to be shortlived Texass Republican governor Rick Perry has called another special session beginning on Monday to try to resurrect the bill  The measure a grab bag of constitutionally dubious ideas from other places would give Texas one of the strictest abortion laws in the nation and that is saying a lot these days If enacted it would ban abortions at 20 weeks postfertilization there would be no rape exception and a narrow physical health exception would jeopardize womens lives by requiring risk to a major bodily function before a woman could terminate a pregnancy  Other provisions would require abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers including specifications for parking spaces and janitors closets and mandate that a doctor who performs abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital These medically unnecessary rules could result in the closing of all but 5 of 42 clinics in the state that now provide abortion services In other parts of the country supposedly smallgovernment Republicans are mandating government interference with a womans personal and complex childbearing decisions Some 40 new abortion restrictions have been enacted so far this year in 13 states according to the Guttmacher Institute In New York legislators defeated a measure proposed by the Democratic governor Andrew Cuomo that essentially would have enshrined the reproductive rights guaranteed by Roe v Wade into state law In Ohio an egregious measure tucked into the state budget would bar a public hospital from entering into an agreement to take emergency patients from abortion clinics which are required under state law to have such an agreement In Washington the Republican majority in the House of Representatives voted for a federal 20week abortion ban a present to the partys right flank that fortunately stands to go nowhere in the Democraticled Senate Wendy Daviss filibuster is a reminder of the need for engagement by elected officials and voters to prevent further restrictions that trample on the rights and health of women  With so many damaging restrictions already on the books though much also depends on the courts to do their job and insist on respect for existing constitutional protections That includes the Supreme Court which has tentatively accepted a case for next term testing the validity of Oklahomas effective ban on a safe and common firsttrimester abortion method that uses prescription medication

A Gay Pride March With Added Spring in Its Step,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/nyregion/a-gay-pride-march-with-added-spring-in-its-step.html,Marriage of course was the word of the day this year But marriage was certainly not what the Gay Liberation Front was fighting for in 1970 when its members stepped out  at no small personal peril  to join New Yorks first march commemorating the Stonewall uprising and celebrating gay pride We attacked marriage as a failed heterosexual bourgeois institution said Allen Young of Royalston Mass who turned 72 on Sunday when he and 13 other alumni of the front stepped out once more  this time as veterans  into the line of march Some were graying Some were stooped Drugs were discussed briefly in the marshaling area on East 40th Street specifically Flomax Some are married now Some conceded wistfully that they may never be  And at least one was not so wistful Personally I prefer to be an outlaw said Michela Griffo 63 who lives in the Flatiron district of Manhattan But the group seemed as energized as any other participants by the fact that they were marching only four days after the Supreme Court ruled that married samesex couples were entitled to federal benefits and cleared the way for samesex marriages to be performed again in California Perry Brass 65 of the Riverdale section of the Bronx said he would be marrying his partner Hugh Young in two weeks They have been together 32 years The rulings lent an especially celebratory air to an event that has never been known for restraint Crowd estimates for any parade of this magnitude are unreliable And 200000 people can easily feel like 300000 if they are packed together on a day as steamy as Sunday was  Alan Reiff cochairman of Heritage of Pride which organizes the event said This is one of the most attended marches in the last five years and it has to be attributed to the Supreme Court ruling Edith Windsor the plaintiff in the case that overturned the federal Defense of Marriage Act or DOMA was one of three grand marshals I have marched for years Ms Windsor 84 said before taking off in the back of a red Mustang convertible I never dreamed I would be the grand marshal I dont know how to describe it Its really an experience for this old lady Christine C Quinn the City Council speaker and a Democratic mayoral candidate basked in Ms Windsors reflected glow having won her endorsement days earlier In May 2012 Ms Quinn married her partner Kim M Catullo who joined her at the march Let the record show that DOMA was brought down by two New York City lesbians Ms Quinn said  Ms Windsor and Thea Clara Spyer were wed in Canada in 2007 Ms Spyer died in 2009 Ms Windsor had sued to establish that she was not liable for estate taxes that a surviving spouse in a heterosexual marriage would not have had to pay The understanding of marriage as a legal rights issue and not as an immutable social institution helped make it a palatable cause for most of the 30 to 40 Gay Liberation Front alumni who gathered Saturday night for their first reunion in four years The event a buffet dinner at the SAGE Center in the garment district was organized by Mark Segal 62 the publisher of The Philadelphia Gay News As a young advocate he interrupted a broadcast of the CBS Evening News in 1973 by displaying a handwritten sign Gays Protest CBS Prejudice between the camera and Walter Cronkite in the networks broadcast center in Manhattan Mr Segal spoke of his old comrades fondly as the most loving dysfunctional family that ever existed Had they agreed on one thing in the early 1970s it would not have been marriage If you were feminist you certainly didnt think about it because why in hell would you want to get married said Nancy Myron 69 of Rhinebeck NY Mark Horn 60 who now lives on the Upper West Side of Manhattan recalled of those days I was not really thinking about the state being involved in my relationships More than anything I wanted the state out of my bedroom The state was regulating our sex lives our social lives I wanted it out On reflection however Jim Fouratt 72 of Greenwich Village said the organizers of the front might not have listened closely enough in 1969 when they convened a meeting of several hundred people just days after the uprising at the Stonewall Inn on Christopher Street where patrons had militantly refused to submit to police intimidation We went around the room and asked people what they wanted Mr Fouratt said Feminists and people like me wanted a revolution in our lifetime But what came back from the room was I want to hold my girlfriends handÂ  Rick Landman 61 of TriBeCa remembered a longing even further back expressed in Hebrew school at a Conservative synagogue in Queens The class was discussing marriage blessings or brachot when Mr Landman then 13 said I dont like girls Is there a bracha for boys to get married Martha Shelley 69 of Portland Ore has already married Sylvia Allen twice  once in Canada and again in California during the brief period when it was legal there in 2008 They will be married again in their home state if they can  But Ms Shelley said she did not view marriage or the right to serve openly in the armed forces as the culmination of her work as an advocate for peace racial and economic equality and abortion rights among other causes She currently assists homeowners who have lost their homes to foreclosure Anyone who thinks people like me are going to be mollified by having the right to kill and get blown up or the right to get married is wrong Ms Shelley said We have a huge struggle to fight After a pause she paraphrased an ethical maxim from the Talmud You are not obliged to finish the work she said but neither are you permitted to desist in it
"A Mellower â€˜Mr. Negative,â€™ but Still Passionate About Free Expression",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/nyregion/a-mellower-mr-negative-but-still-passionate-about-free-expression.html,On a July 2 about 10 years ago Norman Siegel had a constitutional crisis all his own In Barcelona on vacation he realized that he had left his copy of the United States Constitution back home in New York This was terrible It is important to understand that ever since 1969 when he was a young civil rights lawyer working in Atlanta Mr Siegel had made it practically a sacrament to sit in a public park on Independence Day and read the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution right down to the last amendment His mentor in civil rights law Charles Morgan Jr was fond of saying The Constitution  we should try it sometime Mr Siegel took that admonition to heart But there he was in Barcelona he recalled the other day over lunch The Fourth of July was at hand and his favorite document was not He said to his wife Saralee Evans then a judge and now one of his partners in a law practice We have to get a copy I cant stop this ritual Was Google not available If it was I didnt know how to use it Mr Siegel said So we went to every bookstore in Barcelona No one had it One store did but it was in Spanish Desperate he phoned a friend in New York asking him to fax copies of both the Declaration and the Constitution to him On July 3 at the hotel desk there it was he said So we preserved the streak His streak remains intact though he no longer reads the documents to himself A woman he once represented persuaded him seven years ago to go public Each Independence Day dozens of people whose politics lean decidedly leftward gather with him to explore the Constitution in Strawberry Fields the Central Park nook dedicated to the memory of John Lennon Mr Siegel 70 this November is probably no stranger to you if only because of his leadership of the New York Civil Liberties Union from 1985 to 2000 He is an ardent defender of free expression no matter how unpopular a particular group and its opinions may be With his assistance for example members of the Ku Klux Klan were able to rally in Foley Square in 1999 overcoming City Halls attempts to block them Why help Klan clucks They have a right to be repugnant Mr Siegel said  But he is also aware that over the years some New Yorkers came to regard him as a public scold a Marxist in the tradition of Groucho who sang in the movie Horse Feathers Whatever it is Im against it One of the reasons I left the civil liberties union he said is I felt I was being pigeonholed as Mr Negative a goto guy for reporters looking for antigovernment criticism I didnt want to do that anymore With another Independence Day approaching we asked Mr Siegel to break bread He suggested Telepan a wellregarded restaurant that he sometimes visits on West 69th Street not far from his apartment Sounds like it could be a TV cooking show it is named for its chefowner Bill Telepan who knew Mr Siegel well enough to emerge from the kitchen to say hello At a quiet corner table Mr Siegel ordered chilled pea soup followed by roast trout and pineapple fritters for dessert His interviewer went for striped bass and at the waiters suggestion sunflower cake Cranberry juice and club soda sufficed as drinks Mr Siegel could not resist asking the waiter if he was a baseball fan Not really the man said For this lawyer baseball looms large These days he is a Mets fan But he grew up in Brooklyn undyingly loyal to the Dodgers the team that pioneered integration Rooting for the Dodgers  the Brooklyn Dodgers he emphasized not the Los Angeles bunch after the owner Walter OMalley moved out West in the late 1950s  prepared him for civil rights work he said When OMalley took the Dodgers out of Brooklyn he said as the food arrived I never recovered Back to Independence Day Its my favorite holiday he said because it celebrates the principles and values that form this country Do any constitutional amendments cry out for special attention this year The Fourth is hot he said It is the amendment forbidding unreasonable searches and seizures and a natural given the controversies over National Security Agency surveillance and the New York Police Departments socalled stopandfrisk policies The First Amendment always looms large for him And how can anyone ignore the Second Amendment which in Mr Siegels view does not preclude reasonable regulation of guns The interviewer expressed his own fondness for the 21st Amendment which in case you forgot repealed Prohibition I cite it on the Bloomberg stuff every once in a while on the soda ban Mr Siegel said He opposes the size limitations that the mayor seeks to impose on certain sugary drinks While the government has every right to educate people on the harmful potential of huge drinks he said let people make their own decision Dont get me wrong he cautioned Mayor Michael R Bloomberg is he said a very substantive person He hardly feels as kindly about former Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani a classmate at New York Universitys law school in the 1960s They were not friends back then and certainly were not during Mr Giulianis time at City Hall Mr Siegel often took the mayor to court on First Amendment issues and usually prevailed Nor is he impressed when it comes to civil liberties with the current lineup of mayoral hopefuls He mentioned no names but said that within their ranks are politicians who used their official power to stifle free expression for instance by applying pressure on businesses to tear down billboards that carried unpopular messages  unpopular in New York anyway  denouncing abortion immigration and gay rights Neutral principles Mr Siegel said It was something else he learned from Charles Morgan Jr who died in 2009 It means that it doesnt matter what the content of the ad or the speech is Some of the mayoral candidates he said are OK with speech only as long as they agree with it That said Mr Siegel acknowledges having evolved  you might even say mellowed  over time Perhaps unsurprisingly he feels that the NSA revelations are very troubling and he asks Why should the government have a database on millions of people if we are innocent But he also says somewhat surprisingly that the stopandfrisk procedure is a valid law enforcement tool and to get rid of it makes absolutely no sense He just wishes the Police Department did a better job of training officers in the niceties of what the Constitution permits The speed with which law enforcement officials tracked down the suspects in the Boston Marathon bombing has made him more accepting of todays allpervasive cameras And then there were the terrorist attacks of 2001 I think 911 made me realize that there are evil people out there and they want to get us and therefore you cant close your eyes based on some abstract principles Mr Siegel said So the balance has to be entered between liberty and security Pre911 I would have put liberty in caps and security in noncaps Now I think theyre both in caps
"From Texas Statehouse to YouTube, a Filibuster Is a Hit",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/business/media/from-texas-statehouse-to-youtube-a-filibuster-is-a-hit.html,Wendy Davis turned into a progressive political hero in the span of about 12 hours last Tuesday as a result of the stand literally that she took against a Texas Senate bill that would have placed strict new limits on abortions in that state By Sunday the twoterm state senator was a guest on the Sunday political talk shows on ABC CBS and NBC But her abortion rights advocacy and her pink sneakers might have never gained national attention had she been in a state without a reliable live stream of the Legislature Ms Daviss 11hour filibuster inadvertently illuminated the stark technological differences that exist from state to state when it comes to broadcasting the publics business In nearly a dozen states there is no live video of legislative proceedings only audio in some other states that purport to provide video the Web streams barely work Even the audio though is of value to reporters activists and ordinary citizens As journalism organizations continue to cut back on the number of reporters stationed at statehouses across the country statelevel equivalents to CSpan on television and online are supplying new ways to bear witness to the machinations of state and local government Some of Ms Daviss supporters and detractors will surely be watching on Monday when the Texas Legislature reconvenes and takes up the bill again In Texas last week The Texas Tribune made up for the state Senates digital shortcomings Months before Ms Daviss vivid protest the nonprofit news organization based a few blocks from the state Capitol building in Austin had gained access to the stream provided by statecontrolled cameras there and set up a live YouTube channel for the legislative session While the same stream was also accessible through the Senates own Web site that site looked almost comically oldfashioned compared with YouTube Thus it was through YouTube that Ms Daviss filibuster was widely seen and shared Its great to see a channel like The Texas Tribune using YouTube to take a local story national  and probably wont be the only time well see this happen said Kevin Allocca a trends manager at YouTube Online videos have been going viral for almost a decade but what came out of the filibuster in Texas was something distinct viral live video Whether from a statehouse balcony or an activists smartphone scenes that were once edited and distilled for television are increasingly being streamed live to an audience that spreads the news or at least the pictures themselves Streams from independent journalists at Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011 sometimes drew tens of thousands of viewers More recently links to live streaming video of mass protests in Turkey Brazil and as late as Sunday Egypt have been popular on social networks like Facebook and Twitter When the Texas Senate stream on YouTube peaked in popularity shortly after midnight Wednesday as the end of the legislative session dissolved into chaos 182000 people were tuned in about the same number watching MSNBC one of the cable news channels that was mercilessly criticized for not broadcasting the Texas debate live People didnt necessarily need MSNBC though because they had YouTube The theatrical aspects of Ms Daviss filibuster and the seriousness of what was at stake all resulted in people saying to their friends You have to look at thisÂ  said Andrew Lih a professor of journalism and director of new media at the University of Southern California Annenberg School of Communication and Journalism Many probably most of the online viewers wanted to see the Senate bill fail They organized around Twitter hashtags like StandWithWendy But some antiabortion campaigners followed the filibuster too along with the politically minded who simply enjoyed watching what The Dallas Morning News called a knifefight within the confines of Roberts Rules of Order The heavy online viewership helped to prompt television networks and other news outlets to follow up the next morning and subsequently On Meet the Press on Sunday Ms Davis said she and other state Democrats would keep battling against the abortion bill and said even if it passes as many analysts expect obviously there will be challenges to it going forward Thanks to the heightened interest in the bill The Texas Tribune Web site had far and away the highest traffic day in our history said Evan Smith its editor in chief Visitors have pledged about 37000 to the nonprofit organization from a total of 37 states reflecting the nationwide scope of the sudden attention Mr Lih said that The Tribune had done something significant by getting the Senate video which existed already into a portal where the people hang out that is YouTube That is pretty simple but powerful he said The Texas Tribune has a partnership with The New York Times to provide expanded coverage of the state Data from the National Conference of State Legislatures indicates that all 50 states stream live audio of floor proceedings Most also stream video but the quality and accessibility varies widely In some states lack of funds has caused hardware and software upgrades to be postponed In Texas and in most other states the productions are handled inhouse raising concerns about potential interference At several points during the abortion bill debate last Tuesday the stream was muted while private discussions took place much to the consternation of viewers who were unaware that this was standard procedure But in eight states there are nonprofit groups that produce gaveltogavel coverage of all three state branches of government according to Paul Giguere the head of the Connecticut Public Affairs Network and a national association of ones like it Ordinary citizens have an inherent right to watch their state government in action if they choose to Mr Giguere said His association is piecing together a national strategy with the hope that it can convert more states to a more independent model We cant replace reporters What reporters do is critical he said But we can be a primary source
The Revolt of the Rising Class,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/opinion/keller-the-revolt-of-the-rising-class.html,ISTANBUL  IN the upscale Istanbul suburb of Bebek at 9 pm sharp the diners began drumming on the tables or tapping their wineglasses with forks The traffic passing along the Bosporus chimed in with honking horns and flashing headlights It was a genteel symphony of solidarity with the protesters who a few days earlier were confronting fire hoses and tear gas in the heart of the city and elsewhere around Turkey Those street battles that caught our attention this summer have mostly been policed into submission and the worlds cameras have moved on but the afterlife is interesting What is happening in Turkey is not Les Miserables or the Arab Spring It is not an uprising born in desperation It is the latest in a series of revolts arising from the middle class  the urban educated haves who are in some ways the principal beneficiaries of the regimes they now reject  We saw early versions of it in China in 1989 Venezuela in 2002 We saw it in Iran in 2009 when the cosmopolitan crowds thronged in protest against theocratic hardliners We saw it in Russia in 2011 when legions of 30somethings spilled out of their office cubicles chanting their scorn for the highhanded rule of Vladimir Putin While Turkey was still percolating the discontent bubbled up in Brazil where yet another ruling party seems to be a victim of its own success  The vanguard in each case is mostly young students or relative newcomers to the whitecollar work force who have outgrown the fearful conformity of their parents generation With their economic wants more or less satisfied they now crave a voice and respect In this socialmedia century they are mobilized largely by Facebook and Twitter networks of tweeps circumventing an intimidated mainstream press The igniting grievances vary Here in Istanbul it was a plan to build a mosque and other developments on a patch of the citys diminishing green space In Brazil it was bus fares By the time the protests hit critical mass they are about something bigger and more inchoate dignity the perquisites of citizenship the obligations of power  Because these protesters are by definition people with something to lose  and because the autocrats know it  the uprisings are eventually beaten into submission at least for the short term The authorities kid themselves that they have solved the problem It reminds me of that old pirate joke the floggings will continue until morale improves  But morale does not improve There is a new alienation a new yearning and eventually this energy will find an outlet In some way different in each country the social contract will be adjusted  The protesters in these middleclass revolts tend to be political orphans leaderless partyless not particularly ideological To reach a new equilibrium either the rising class must get organized or the ruling class must get the message or ideally both In China and Iran and Russia where the regimes are more established in their ruthlessness the discontented may have a longer wait But watch Turkey How Turkey as a partner in NATO and a bridge to the tumultuous Islamic world finds its new balance has both practical and symbolic significance for the rest of the world The United States has long embraced Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan as the model of a modern Muslim reformer The Turkish prime minister during his decade in power has tamed the army of its coup habit raised the standard of living dramatically offered an olive branch to the separatistminded Kurds and demonstrated  alone in the region  that Islam is compatible with both free elections and broad prosperity When civil war sundered neighboring Syria Erdogan braving the disapproval of an electorate that tends to be more isolationist condemned the brutalities of President Bashar alAssad and hosted camps for hundreds of thousands of Syrian refugees Both George W Bush and Barack Obama have doted on Erdogan The Islamist prime minister proudly sent three of his four children to universities in the US By fostering economic growth by keeping the army in its barracks  and by not messing too much with secular lifestyles  Erdogan has won some grudging support from the worldly elite that originally viewed him and his more pious Islamic following as a lurch back to the Ottoman Empire  Those days of urban skirmishing which began at the end of May with a pointless and heavyhanded police crackdown on a sitin at the disputed park have opened many eyes to Erdogans intemperate and intolerant side  his tonedeafness his tendency to regard any criticism as a grave insult his conspiracy theories  The surprise is that Erdogans darker instincts came as a surprise to anyone Human rights organizations have long lamented the fact that Turkey while it has a lively press also has more journalists in jail than any other country on earth If you troll through the American diplomatic cables divulged in the great WikiLeaks flood you find abundant talk of how Erdogan has sometimes used police and courts as instruments of political control But he was a friend in an unfriendly region The American attitude was to paraphrase a line FDR supposedly said of another troubling ally he may be a thug but hes our thug And by regional standards he wasnt even that much of a thug With the important exception of police brutality Erdogans latest affronts have been matters of speech and style rather than action He has talked of outlawing abortion as have some prominent American politicians but he hasnt tried to do it He has described Twitter as the worst menace to society and suggested clamping down on social media but he seems unlikely to have much success there even if he tries He has conjured a dark conspiracy of secular subversives bankers and Western media but that is vintage Erdogan and vintage Turkey  a country of intrigues that exemplifies the old line even paranoids have enemies So the fact that the rising class has chosen this moment to run out of patience seems to be Erdogans bad luck It may also be Turkeys good fortune  One possible outcome is that those unhappy with Erdogan will find an avenue into politics and give Erdogan the challenge he deserves The Turkish system like the American only more so favors incumbency and makes it hard to form viable new parties even if Erdogans foes could agree on what they are for The most visible potential moderate rival to Erdogan Abdullah Gul who occupies the relatively powerless presidency has shown little willingness to take on the prime minister But as Sinan Ulgen the head of an Istanbul think tank points out Erdogan is more vulnerable than the autocrats of Iran or Russia who have oil revenues to float them through a crisis Turkeys prosperity  and in large measure Erdogans popularity  depends on foreign investment and flocks of tourists The crackdown on protesters dented Erdogans approval ratings more threatening to his tenure it spooked investors emptied hotels and sent the Turkish stock market into a tailspin Yes the protesters have something to lose Ulgen told me But so does Erdogan In about a year his third term as prime minister is up and the rules dont allow for a fourth He has been exploring options to prolong his time in power but they require popular support and Erdogans hovers precariously around 50 percent So whether or not he has the ability to temper his intemperance he has the incentive A parliamentarian who is a moderate supporter of Erdogan and was with him during the protests insists He got the message Well see For the longterm stability of Turkey it would be good to have a robust political opposition advocating a pluralism that protects both the devout and the secular In the meantime it may be up to Erdogan to save Turkey from himself
The Media and Wendy Davis,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/01/the-media-and-wendy-davis/,"With a tip of the hat to the Weekly Standards John McCormack who tweeted about the interview over the weekend here are the six questions asked of Texas State
                                        Senator Wendy Davis on ABCs This WeekÂ after her temporarily successful filibuster of a bill that restricted abortion
                                        after 20 weeks of pregnancy and increased regulations on Texan abortion clinics Q Why did you decide to wear your running shoes Lets take a look at those  theyve kind of been rocketing around the internet Q As the filibuster was going on you were receiving support from a lot of people and places far away from Texas from movie stars and the president  Q The front page of the Fort Worth StarTelegram is featuring the back and forth with Governor Perry and you He has made this very personal against you Is that offensive Q Do you believe SB5 will become law Q Will you have to filibuster again Q You gonna put these shoes on again Ive written enough about how the media covers abortion politics                                        that Im not sure theres much thats new to say on the subject But let me briefly raise what I think might be an illuminating comparison The prolife movement has been pushing legislation
                                        along the lines of the bill that David filibusteredÂ for some time
                                        but the sudden energy behindÂ SB5 in Texas or the similar postviability restrictions that passed the House of Representatives has a great deal to do with the recent trial of Kermit Gosnell
                                        and the spotlight that case put on lateterm abortion nationwide In Texas and in Washington
                                        DC in other words abortion opponents have basically tried to do what gun control advocates did after Newtown and use a horror story to make the case for policies that have clear majority support                                        but also face passionate opposition And Davis and other abortion rights supporters have tried to do in Texas what gun rights supporters did in the United States Senate Use countermajoritarian mechanisms to thwart
                                        a legislative push and hope that with time and sufficiently passionate opposition the energy behind the bill will subside Now this analogy doesnt tell us anything about the merits of the respective policy proposals A skeptic of bills like SB5 could certainly make the same arguments that Ive
                                        made in the context of the postNewtown gun control proposalsÂ  that legislation passed in reaction to a particularly awful story is often illdesigned
                                        and that the publics priorities as well as polling on particular issues should
                                        shape the causes that lawmakers take up Still it seems like a genuinely fairminded ideologically disinterested press would at least tend to mention the link between the Gosnell case and the Texas bill as often as it mentions Wendy Daviss footwear
                                        Or at least take note when framing its coverage of her filibuster of the fact that Daviss understanding of womens rights is shared by at best a minority of American women
                                        Or at least ask Davis in a nationallytelevised interview to actually explain her views on lateterm abortion instead of allowing her to skate through the conversation without even using the word abortion

Texas Democrats Try to Keep Their Momentum Going,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/us/texas-democrats-try-to-keep-their-momentum-going.html,AUSTIN Tex  All eyes are on Texas today but the drama at the end of the first special session of the 83rd state legislature is not likely to repeat itself  at least not yet While Gov Rick Perry has brought back the 150 members of the House and the 31 members of the Senate to deal with unfinished business on abortion transportation and criminal justice theyll almost surely gavel in refer bills to committee and gavel out Except for a few serial grandstanders most lawmakers wont be heard from in any meaningful way inside the Capitol Outside is another story Supporters of reproductive rights were planning to rally on the south steps of what Austin denizens commonly call the pink building and a few thousand were expected to attend The political celebrity of the moment State Senator Wendy Davis a Fort Worth Democrat is addressing the crowd along with Cecile Richards the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the daughter of Ann Richards the last woman in elective office to electrify Democrats here and elsewhere Democratic legislators who have something to crow about for the first time in years will be right there alongside them Antiabortion activists after failing to match their opponents in number last week are staging their own rally and promise to be better prepared for the fight this time and Republican legislators will surely join them In reality it wont or shouldnt be much of a fight The contentious abortion legislation in question Senate Bill 5 initially failed to pass because the 30day special session was quickly drawing to a close and Ms Davis assisted by her Democratic colleagues could run out the clock It was her show A second special session is Mr Perrys show He knows well that with 30 days to get his desired ends accomplished both substantive and political the minority party isnt apt to repeat history The Republicans have more than enough votes to pass the very same legislation as the Democrats grudgingly acknowledge though they mean to do everything they can procedurally and otherwise to snatch defeat from the jaws of victory Davids victory over Goliath will be shortlived To hammer home that point this morning State Senator Dan Patrick a Houston Republican announced that he wouldnt stand for any Democratic shenanigans I plan to stop Senator Davis or any Democrat from attempting for the second time to slow down or kill our package of prolife legislation he said in a release to the media Senator Davis and the mob had their say last week its time to pass the bill and I intend to do all I can to do so Should anyone attempt a filibuster Mr Patrick said he plans to call the previous question  a tactic by which supporters of a bill gather enough signatures 16 a simple majority in advance to end debate and permit a vote on a bill In his release Mr Patrick was critical of his boss the presiding officer of the Senate Lt Gov David Dewhurst a fellow Republican for not ending debate and forcing a vote himself within the rules of the chamber This is another narrative strain to be watched during the second special session Mr Patrick wants Mr Dewhursts job Last Wednesday he announced his intention to run for lieutenant governor hes the third challenger to Mr Dewhurst who has said he plans to campaign for a fourth term Mr Patrick a radio talk show host by trade who is no stranger to showmanship is certain to milk the differences in style and substance between himself and Mr Dewhurst for all theyre worth Other lawmakers who are presumed candidates for other 2014 offices are likely to be similarly supercharged  with aggressiveness on behalf on the antiabortion cause rewarded and backbench timidity punished They include State Representative Dan Branch a Dallas Republican who is all but running for attorney general as is State Senator Ken Paxton a McKinney Republican State Senator Glenn Hegar Republican of Katy and State Senator Tommy Williams Republican of The Woodlands who are both looking at a race for comptroller as is State Representative Harvey Hilderbran Republican of Kerrville and State Representative Brandon Creighton a Conroe Republican who is considering a bid for agriculture commissioner Then there is Mr Perry He had promised to reveal his immediate plans  whether he too will run for a fourth full term  by Monday But the second special session call has delayed that big reveal His personal remarks about Ms Davis last week only heightened speculation about what hell do  whether hes playing only for home state Republican votes or those of a national audience He could run for governor again He could run for president again Well know soon enough But first the gavel has to come down
"For Perry, Setback in Texas May Propel Him Nationally",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/02/us/for-perry-setback-in-texas-may-propel-him-nationally.html,AUSTIN Tex  Many Americans remember Rick Perry as the man who could not remember He was the presidential candidate who famously forgot in a nationally televised debate the third federal department he wanted to shut down But this week after Democrats scored a rare legislative victory on his home turf blocking a bill that would have put strict limits on abortions the national spotlight is revisiting the governor of Texas And how he handles this moment could affect Mr Perrys hopes of being a 2016 presidential contender  and his reputation as a leading figure of the Republican far right  as much as the inglorious oops moment from his illfated 2012 run While the Democrats can stage rallies and demand abortion rights it is Mr Perry who may have the power to get abortion measures passed And when his work is done he no doubt will portray himself on the national stage as an unapologetic defender of bedrock Republican principles  the kind voters in those early primary states say are in danger of slipping away The only way to get a second look is to become a champion of the conservative values that the base considers more important than anything else said Larry J Sabato director of the Center for Politics at the University of Virginia Theyre looking for someone who is not going to tiptoe through the tulips And Rick Perry seems to enjoy crushing tulips It is still far too early to predict Mr Perrys future He has not ruled out another run for governor next year Nor has he definitively thrown his cowboy hat into the 2016 ring though he is clearly contemplating it Whatever he does the fight over abortion rights in Texas will figure prominently into his political talking points  The plotline features two twists that were entirely unpredictable 10 days ago the spectacular failure of a restrictive abortion bill in the staunchly conservative Texas Legislature and the meteoric rise of a filibustering Democrat  Senator Wendy Davis of Fort Worth  in the mostly reliably Republican megastate in the country What Mr Perry did next was more predictable at least for those who know him he threw gas on the fire by offering personal criticism of Ms Davis a single mother who rose from humble beginnings in a trailer park to graduate from Harvard Law School with honors Speaking at the National Right to Life convention in Texas on the heels of the chaotic abortion debate in the Legislature Mr Perry said Ms Davis of all people should know that every life matters Its just unfortunate that she has not learned from her own example he said Explaining the comments to reporters afterward Mr Perry noted that Ms Daviss mother a sixthgrade dropout who became a single mother herself might have chosen a different path and not had a baby What if her mom had said I just cant do this I dont want to do this Mr Perry said  The remarks enraged Ms Davis defenders They portrayed Mr Perry as crass and meanspirited and have characterized the abortion legislation he seeks as part of the Republicans socalled war on women  The anger against Mr Perry among liberal activists was on display at a rally that drew as many as 5000 people to the Texas Capitol on Monday They wanted their voices heard on the first day of a special session called by the governor to complete work on the abortion restrictions and a few other matters People waved or displayed placards banners and posters reading Proud of Texas Ashamed of Perry About 400 people put messages on wire coat hangers which organizers planned to deliver to Mr Perrys office One message read Hands off my ovaries Another Youre being replaced bro  This energy has given new hope for Democrats who have not won a statewide office since 1994 But Mr Perry stands to benefit from the liberal outrage as well A day after delivering his remarks about Ms Davis at the righttolife convention Mr Perry pursued his theme on the radio program of Laura Ingraham the conservative host How many young men and women across this country didnt get to accomplish what Wendy Davis just accomplished because they werent born he said  Mr Perrys defenders say the angry response to his remarks is overblown The reaction was cooked up by liberal activists and carried by news media outlets that his conservative base does not trust or rely on for news anyway said Ray Sullivan a consultant and lobbyist who served as chief spokesman for Mr Perrys presidential campaign Regardless of the blowback Mr Perry is expected to win passage of the abortion legislation which would ban abortions after 20 weeks and greatly increase regulations on the facilities that provide them Opponents say it could shut down nearly 90 percent of the states abortion clinics In 2003 Mr Perry had to call three special sessions to pass a redistricting measure that Democrats tried to boycott fleeing the state and temporarily denying a quorum Then as now Mr Sullivan said the governor thrives on the kind of combat the minority party is giving him There are very few politicians who really enjoy the competition and stress of political battles or campaigns he said He loves them and is energized by them and has proved to be highly successful at them  It is not yet clear yet whether Mr Perry can use the abortion battle to redeem himself from his failed presidential run In recent appearances he has continued to demonstrate a predilection for gaffes At a speech in Washington he said Lebanon when he meant Libya And it went unnoticed in the news coverage of his remarks about Senator Davis that Mr Perry erroneously said the Legislature had passed major abortion restrictions over the past 100 years The written copy of the speech said correctly 10 years Matthew Dowd a political strategist for President George W Bush said that Mr Perry was on safe ground arguing for abortion restrictions in a conservative state and that to that extent he had a winning issue  What puzzles him is why Ms Davis and her allies are allying themselves with Hollywood actresses and handing Mr Perry the ideological battle he so desperately needs to revive his standing  at least with the right The best thing to do with Rick Perry is to make people laugh at him Mr Dowd said If you get into a sort of ideological thing and into a back and forth thats how Rick Perry survives
Texas Governor Fuels Speculation About His Next Move,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/03/us/politics/texas-governor-fuels-speculation-about-his-next-move.html,AUSTIN Tex  For Gov Rick Perry the longestserving Texas governor three fouryear terms apparently may be enough Or not Mr Perry has sent an email message to friends that he plans to make an announcement concerning his exciting future plans at an event in San Antonio on Monday He has played his decision on whether to seek a fourth term in 2014 close to the vest and it remained unclear Tuesday among political analysts and Mr Perrys former aides whether he had decided to run for reelection The governor surprised both supporters and opponents with his reelection decision in 2010 and hes capable of surprising everyone again a capacity hes played to the hilt this time around said James Henson the director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin Mr Perrys announcement about his future comes at a crucial moment The governor has long been criticized and even demonized by Texas Democrats but his critics have gained a new momentum as well as a national platform Republican senators sought to pass tough new restrictions on abortion  in a bill Mr Perry championed and supported  but were defeated by a filibuster of at least 11 hours and a raucous crowd of the bills opponents The episode drew attention across the country and turned a Fort Worth Democrat State Senator Wendy Davis into a national political celebrity overnight Many Democrats hope that Ms Davis will run for governor in 2014 At a rally in support of abortion rights on Monday at the Capitol people waved signs reading 2014 Governor Davis If Mr Perry 63 announces on Monday that he is not seeking reelection he would add further momentum to Ms Davis and to other Democrats who have been struggling to break the lock Republicans have on statewide offices In recent weeks and months Mr Perry has suggested to reporters that he has not ruled out running again either for governor or for president Mr Perry has turned his failed presidential bid in 2012 in which he often stumbled on the national stage into a lessonslearned experience that has become part of his public persona In a speech at the state Republican Party convention in Fort Worth in June 2012 Mr Perry seemed to be on the presidential campaign trail months after withdrawing from the race Im not riding off into the sunset Mr Perry told the crowd Im mounting up for the next operation Political observers said it appeared unlikely that Mr Perry would seek another term as governor because his state campaign team has largely been dismantled and because he wants to better prepare for running for president in 2016  I believe he wants to be a candidate for president again and knows an early start is critical to his success in the primaries said Bill Miller a lobbyist who works with Democrats and Republicans He is a confident politician who is never scared out of a race Calvin Jillson a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas added I dont know what he will do but I know what he should do if he wants to be president He should forgo another race for governor as he will have held that office for 14 years by 2014 in favor of systematically preparing himself to run for president Others said the defeat of the filibuster was only a temporary victory for Democrats adding that since the bill was likely to pass the Republicancontrolled Legislature the fight over abortion had helped not hurt the governors political future  It has allowed him to signal to the largely prolife Republican base nationwide that he is staunchly prolife as well as willing to stand up to liberal activists to protect the lives of the unborn said Mark P Jones a political science professor at Rice University in Houston

"Our Bodies, Our Ink",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/books/bodies-of-subversion-explores-womens-tattoos.html,Among the first mainstream American celebrities to openly wear  tattoos was Janis Joplin  On her left wrist she had a Florentine bracelet On her chest she wore a small heart  the size of a candy heart Just a little treat for the boys she told Rolling Stone like icing on the cake  It seems like only yesterday that tattoos were rarities like certain crows They were worth commenting upon either for their beauty or their banality Now tattoos creep like vines along the arms legs and torsos of nearly everyone you meet If print is dead ink is undead  and on the move Theres been some sophisticated fiction about skin and ink Im thinking especially of Sarah Halls novel Electric Michelangelo a finalist for the 2004 Man Booker Prize But its a lacunae in our literature that there hasnt been a definitive nonfiction book on the topic a volume that packs sociology and criticism and history and memoir into a dense sleeve as a tattoo artist might put it of meaning While we await that book we have Margot Mifflins perceptive and moving Bodies of Subversion A Secret History of Women and Tattoo first published in 1997 but reissued now in a heavily updated and resplendently illustrated third edition For most of history tattooing has been a male preoccupation either a onefingered salute or an exercise in swagger Think of Popeye and his twin anchors Ms Mifflin had the good idea to examine tattooing in the Western world from a female perspective Her relatively slim book doesnt provide a truly wideangle view but the insights she brings are insinuating and complex This new edition of Bodies of Subversion arrives at the crest of a wave For the first time according to a 2012 Harris Poll American women are more likely to be tattooed than men Some 23 percent of women have tattoos 19 percent of men do Theyre no longer rebel emblems Ms Mifflin notes Theyre a mainstream fashion choice  She is mostly an admirer of womens tattoo culture Tattoos have been emblems of empowerment in an era of feminist gains she declares Theyre also badges of selfdetermination at a time when controversies about abortion rights date rape and sexual harassment have made women think hard about who controls their bodies Her book includes striking color photographs of the tattoos some women have had embroidered on their chests after mastectomies Thanks to recent legislation tattoo artists can sometimes directly bill insurance companies for this work  If only Joplin had known that it would be possible to have your weed and your tattoos covered by insurance she might have decided to stick around But Ms Mifflin is a flinty observer She notes that tattoos have the ability to degrade as well as to enhance to invoke the sacred and the inane She assesses the work of social critics who posit that tattooing can be a political copout a cover for disengagement These critics argue she writes that tattooing shifts the focus of womens issues from society to the self that tattooed women are empowered only in their minds and that women who find solace in tattoos are no different from women for whom shopping and exercise are substitutes for problemsolving Ouch as the client said to the tattooist Bodies of Subversion is delicious social history Tattooing was an upperclass social fad in Europe in the late 19th century Winston Churchills mother had a tattoo of a snake eating its tail the symbol of eternity on her wrist The fad spread to America In 1897 Ms Mifflin writes The New York World estimated that 75 percent of American society women were tattooed usually in places easily covered by clothing  By the 1920s tattooed women were mostly to be seen in freak shows and in circus acts where they could make more money than tattooed men They offered the author avers a peep show within a freak show  Tattoos lost their appeal for nearly everyone shortly after World War II One reason was because tattoos perpetrated in concentration camps had added a ghastly new chapter to tattoo history  Ms Mifflins story spins forward through the tattoo revival of the 1970s when women with a tattoo or two began to shake the stigma that they were sexually available She moves attentively through the 1980s and 90s the era that gave us Dennis Rodman the lowerback tattoos now known as tramp stamps and a kudzu forest of copycat tribal tats Her final chapter takes us up to the present day with assessments of the tattoo artist Kat Von Ds fame and of cultural moments like the popularity of Stieg Larssons 2005 novel The Girl With the Dragon Tattoo Ms Mifflin appraises the work of famous female tattoists she argues that the world needs tattoo critics I hereby nominate Tim Gunn and Lil Wayne as the genres Siskel and Ebert  She is at her best when considering class and tattoos She quotes an inkedup female doctor who says that its easier for professional women to wear them at work If youre working some crummy little desk job with a dress code its a lot harder to walk around wearing your tattoos in the open Ms Mifflin deals too with the matter of tattoo regret Theres plenty of that going around She cites a survey by the Archives of Dermatology stating that 69 percent of tattoo removal requests come from women Most got stamped at the age of 20 or so Quoting the same survey she says about tattoos Their marks of uniqueness turned into stigmataÂ  But the Harris Poll cited above also noted that 86 percent of tattooed people were content with their ink Those who would shame women with tattoos often utter things like How are those things going to look when youre old and wrinkled On the basis of the photographs of older women with tattoos in this book Id say they hold up pretty well In fact Id say they look sort of awesome
Stricter Rules for Abortion Clinics Are Approved by State Senate in North Carolina ,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/abortion-limits-advance-in-north-carolina.html,The North Carolina Senate approved new limits on abortions Wednesday defying opponents who complained that the Republican majority breached protocol by passing the restrictions less than 24 hours after their surprise introduction The proposed package of rules which has yet to be considered by the House would force abortion clinics to abide by regulations akin to those required of ambulatory surgical centers I would consider it to be a commonsense measure and very rational said John L Rustin president of the North Carolina Family Policy Council which supports the limits If youre going to engage in surgical abortion procedures you need to meet the same standards But critics said the measure which would also prevent health plans participating in the states insurance exchange from covering most abortions threatened the availability of reproductive health services and would drive women toward alternative means to end their pregnancies When we fail to allow access women will find other ways said State Senator Earline W Parmon a Democrat When we overregulate to this extent and make regulations so rigid that medical facilities cant meet those standards thats the choice we leave our women Although North Carolina legislators have considered other abortionrelated proposals this year including a requirement that teachers tell students that abortions could cause premature births in future pregnancies the measure that the Senate approved Wednesday took shape during a committee meeting Tuesday evening about a different topic a proposed bill to limit the ways that foreign court judgments can be applied in certain family court cases During that session supporters of the abortion restrictions amended the bill and attached the restrictions to it The full Senate which has a 3317 Republican edge took its initial vote on the bill within hours They rammed it and snuck it through in the middle of the night said State Senator Martin L Nesbitt Jr the leader of the Democratic minority Opponents vowed an aggressive campaign to keep it from becoming law and the appearance of the restrictions drew hundreds of demonstrators to Raleigh the site of recent protests They werent able to get it done in the course of normal business so they waited until a holiday week when they thought women and the media wouldnt be paying attention said Alison Kiser of Planned Parenthood of Central North Carolina They were completely wrong If the measure passes the House which the Republicans also control 77 to 43 it will go to Gov Pat McCrory a Republican But Mr McCrory said Wednesday that he had misgivings about the Senates handling of the legislation which came amid growing debates in statehouses about abortion rights after the Texas Senate drew national attention for its contentious deliberations over proposed limits When the Democrats were in power this is the way they did business It was not right then and it is not right now Mr McCrory said in a statement Regardless of what party is in charge or what important issue is being discussed the process must be appropriate and thorough Opponents hope that Mr McCrory will stand by his statement during a televised debate last year when he said he would not endorse any new abortion restrictions as governor
You Call That a Filibuster? Texas Still Claims Record,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/04/us/politics/you-call-that-a-filibuster-texas-still-claims-record.html,FORT WORTH Tex  State Senator Wendy Daviss exhausting filibuster of at least 11 hours at the Texas Capitol last week turned her into a national political star Bill Meiers filibuster in the same building  on the same floor at the same desk  36 years earlier left him with a stiff back rubbery legs a ragged voice and a footnotesize place in history though few people outside Texas remember On May 2 1977 Mr Meier rose to speak on the floor of the Senate chamber in Austin at 320 pm He did not relinquish the floor and sit down until 1020 am on May 4 some 43 hours later It remains the longest filibuster by an American politician in a state legislature or in Congress Then a 36yearold Democratic state senator Mr Meier stood and talked nearly continuously for about as long as it would take to drive from Manhattan to San Francisco without stopping He read verbatim from more than 200 legal cases from dozens of law books lined up on the floor He sucked on hard candy ate a few lemon slices and sipped water And he wore an astronaut bag attached to his leg under his pants  like a hot water bottle  so he could answer natures call without interruption The states two most famous filibusters are strangely intertwined Ms Davis is a Democrat who represents a portion of Fort Worth in Tarrant County as was Mr Meier at the time She wore salmoncolored running sneakers he darkblue corduroy house slippers and a plaid coat his wife hated The desk they shared is in the same spot on the Senate floor as it was in 1977 Perhaps theres something in the water in Tarrant County Mr Meier now 72 and a justice on the states Second Court of Appeals said Wednesday in his chambers in Fort Worth Their legislative marathons were the rarest of human endeavors  hours of wasted time that actually made a difference although briefly and perhaps only symbolically Ms Davis helped prevent Republicans from passing some of the toughest abortion restrictions in the country as a midnight deadline approached Mr Meier who had helped write the states Open Records Act opposed a bill that would have made workers compensation claims from industrial accidents private information rather than public  The bill passed the Senate shortly after Mr Meiers filibuster ended and it was eventually signed into law by Gov Dolph Briscoe But Mr Meier said his goal was not to kill the bill but to bring public attention to it just as Ms Daviss filibuster may not ultimately block the Republicancontrolled Legislature from passing the abortion bill but has already succeeded in galvanizing Democrats After Ms Daviss filibuster Gov Rick Perry called lawmakers back in a special legislative session this week to try to get the bill passed Early Wednesday the Republican majority in a House committee voted to send the bill to the full House As Mr Meier flipped through a scrapbook of newspaper clippings from 1977 he said the filibuster had been in use since around 50 BC when Cato the Younger filibustered the Roman Senate Yes I was tired and yes I was hungry and what I wanted to do was to go take a hot bath and eat a big steak and go to sleep and thats what I did said Mr Meier now a Republican He was physically prepared  he jogged and credited his stamina to working at a glass factory in his hometown Waco  but he said the filibuster was more a mental endurance test Straying off topic could violate Senate rules and three violations would effectively end his filibuster He received no violations I admire his iron will Ms Davis said in a statement Although I would never hesitate to stand up for Texas families on matters that impact their lives I hope neither I nor anyone else has to beat his record anytime soon Other Texas senators have conducted filibusters that lasted more than 30 hours over the decades receiving assistance from colleagues who asked wordy questions to give the filibustering lawmaker a break I dont think you can get elected in Texas without knowing how to talk and be outspoken said A R Schwartz 86 a former Democratic state senator known as Babe and a filibustering expert I havent seen any mildmannered folks get elected to the Texas Senate There was at least one other person in 1977 as relieved as Mr Meier was when his filibuster ended  the sponsor of the bill Senator Ray Farabee a Democrat Rules required that a bill under consideration have its sponsor or cosponsor present to answer questions  at all times  Here it would be 3 in the morning Mr Meier said Im droning on and on and Farabee is sitting over at his desk Id watch him and just as he was just about to get to sleep Id get over right close to the desk and say something very loud If you dont have fun with this stuff it really gets tough
"In Race for Texas Governor, Waiting to Be Front-Runner",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/us/in-race-for-texas-governor-waiting-to-be-front-runner.html,By the time Attorney General Greg Abbott came to the podium last week at the National Right to Life Convention in Grapevine Gov Rick Perry had already set the social media networks ablaze with a controversial and fiery speech so reporters were gathered in anticipation Here was Mr Perrys heir apparent after all What would he say about the chaotic mess in the Texas Legislature where a bill heavily restricting abortion lay in tatters and liberal activists were cheering Senator Wendy Davis the filibustering Democrat who had made it possible Nothing as it turned out Not a word in his speech Not a word to the clamoring reporters It was no surprise to those who know Mr Abbott Compared with the swaggering Mr Perry or the smashtalking United States Senator Ted Cruz Mr Abbott comes off as cautious and measured Or to Democratic critics calculating and ruthless He is very methodical in his planning more than the normal politician said Pat Mizell of Houston a longtime friend and fellow lawyer He really has not been a big risk taker politically Mr Abbott declined a request to comment for this article When Mr Abbott was 16 his father died Then a freak accident in 1984 when he was in his late 20s left him paralyzed and using a wheelchair So he learned the value of patience and discipline at an early age  Now he has a chance to apply those lessons again Mr Abbott is within sniffing distance of the governors mansion and he is not about to ruin his chances with a rash move or an unscripted remark  Word leaked out this week that Mr Perry would unveil his exciting future plans on Monday Mr Abbott then announced his own plans for a meetandgreet the following weekend He did not say for what office he was running Given Mr Perrys penchant for unexpected announcements a run for an unprecedented fourth term cannot be ruled out though speculation persists that he will step aside Mr Abbott is taking no chances His campaign is giving Mr Perry a wide berth lest Mr Perry feel backed into a corner  If Mr Perry stays Mr Abbott will have to decide whether to run for something else or wage a fight against a close ally If Mr Perry does move on Mr Abbott who has the biggest war chest in state politics would become the instant frontrunner for the Republican nomination for governor Tom Pauken a former state Republican Party chairman hopes to make the primary competitive but it is an uphill climb And despite the new energy that Democrats are drawing from the abortion battles the odds are stacked against them No Democrat has won statewide office since 1994 and the states last Democratic governor Ann Richards was elected in 1990 The son of an insurance salesman and a homemaker Mr Abbott was born in Wichita Falls moved to East Texas as a youngster and finished high school in Duncanville a Dallas suburb In the faded pages of the 1976 Duncanville Panther Tale yearbook Mr Abbott looks more like an aspiring hippie than the son of a Goldwater Republican He has bushy brown hair down to his shoulders and demonstrates an affinity for bellbottom jeans Mr Abbotts gregariousness developed at an early age He was voted class king in elementary school and his senior class at Duncanville chose him as best all around He was president of the National Honor Society chapter He was a copy editor for the school yearbook and joined a club for aspiring young journalists  He found passion in running winning the 880yard run in the Duncanville Relays as a senior  On July 14 1984 Mr Abbott  by then a graduate of Vanderbilt Law School  used his legs for the last time Taking a break from work at a Houston law firm while studying for the bar exam Mr Abbott went for a run with a friend In a recent campaign video he explains what happened next  Bam A huge explosiontype sound occurred right next to me he says Next thing I know I was down because this huge tree had fallen on me The 75foottall oak tree crushed his lower spine and left him instantly paralyzed In the immediate aftermath friends say Mr Abbott was under the illusion that he might walk again But his injuries were too severe By all accounts he approached his recovery with grit and determination  and to this day humor Retelling a favorite joke at last weeks antiabortion convention Mr Abbott said For those of you who havent heard the story I see you shaking your heads wondering how slow was that guy jogging to get hit by a tree Mr Abbott took the matter very seriously when it happened of course suing the homeowner whose tree fell on him along with a tree service company According to news reports from 2002  during his first race for attorney general  Mr Abbott won a settlement of more than 10 million When Mr Abbott made greedy trial lawyers a target during that campaign Democrats and some of their supporters accused him of hypocrisy Aides to Mr Abbott who has supported Republicanbacked measures restricting lawsuits say current law still allows a person sustaining such an injury to recover the same amounts including money for noneconomic damages like pain and suffering After passing the bar exam and practicing civil defense law Mr Abbott ran successfully for state district judge in 1992 and was then appointed to the State Supreme Court in 1995 by George W Bush who was then governor Now as the longestserving attorney general in state history Mr Abbott likes to say that he wakes up every day sues the federal government and then goes home  a reference to the 27 lawsuits he has filed against the Obama administration  Democrats say Mr Abbott has done little but use his office to promote himself a charge Mr Abbotts campaign calls spurious Matt Angle a Democratic strategist describes Mr Abbott as a fierce partisan who panders to his base and still has not proven he can take a punch Hes never had a competitive

"Disabled People Say They, Too, Want a Sex Life, and Seek Help in Attaining It",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/05/world/europe/disabled-people-say-they-too-want-a-sex-life-and-seek-help-in-attaining-it.html,GRENOBLE France  In her sexual fantasies she is a fit and impetuous blonde who dominates her male partners In real life she is a virgin who relies on an electric wheelchair her body touched only by home care aides and medical personnel A disabled person is seen as a child said the woman in the wheelchair Laetitia Rebord 31 So inevitably child and sex dont go together A translator and teacher she has a genetic spinal muscular atrophy that has left her entirely paralyzed except for her left thumb and her facial muscles Ms Rebord who says she feels physical sensation acutely has looked for sexual relationships through friends of friends and men on dating sites and even with male escorts But her disability has scared many away and she says she is now ready to pay for sex in Switzerland or Germany where socalled sexual surrogates are legal Stories like Ms Rebords are far from unusual in France where behind a facade of sexual freedom disabled people struggle to have a sex life But their desires are often disregarded and while prostitution is legal here soliciting potential clients and serving as an intermediary between prostitutes and clients are not The issue of sexual surrogates came up in March after the National Ethics Committee which advises the government on health issues issued a report criticizing the practice as the unethical use of the human body for commercial purposes The report commissioned in 2011 was approved by government officials including MarieArlette Carlotti a junior minister responsible for issues involving those with disabilities who called sexual assistance for disabled people a form of prostitution But encouraged in part by the publicity around The Sessions a 2012 American movie about the sexual awakening of a disabled man by a sexual surrogate some legislators and associations of disabled people are demanding the legalization of sexual surrogates Prostitution is a fake debate the goals are different said Pascale Ribes who in 2011 founded the Disabilities and Sexualities Group an association defending sexual surrogates in France Sexual assistance is about allowing a disabled person who cant access sexuality in a satisfying way to reconnect with the body Ms Ribes said Her association is lobbying for a change in the law to allow disabled people their parents their friends or directors of approved institutions to arrange meetings with sexual surrogates who typically charge around 130 a session She speaks of the sexual distress of many of Frances 18 million disabled people of working age especially women Some need sexual assistance to recover their sexual drive after an accident Ms Ribes said Others are disabled couples who need help to share intimate moments together Many wish to explore their sexuality to regain selfconfidence she said Most sexual surrogates are women Ms Ribes said adding that it is harder for disabled women rather than men to ask for a sexual surrogate In France the rarity of debate over the subject the laws regulating prostitution and the refusal to legalize sexual surrogates have encouraged illegal practices Aminata Gregory 66 is Dutch She retired as a supervisor in the construction industry and she has been performing sexual assistance illegally in France for more than a year She was trained as a sex therapist in Switzerland and her work mostly involves massages and erotic games without kisses on the mouth or sex If someone is in a wheelchair I start in the wheelchair Ms Gregory said I start playing the game of getting undressed on the wheelchair It becomes a little like a game Ms Gregorys clients find her through word of mouth She has about 10 disabled clients in France and charges them through her company in the Netherlands Her sessions cost about 130 and often take place in her clients houses They begin with background checks and discussions about the clients needs During the session I can be a friend the lover whoever they want Ms Gregory said They can dream they can speak they can ask what they want and I give them as much as possible Ms Gregory finds Frances attitude on sexual assistance intolerant In Holland we have integrity over our body she said In France the law always decides for the individual and not in his favor On a recent Saturday Ms Gregory went to Vedne in southern France to meet one of her clients Daniel Doriguzzi 49 a town hall employee Mr Doriguzzi has a rare genetic disease called Friedreichs ataxia a condition that is making him gradually lose physical coordination and the ability to speak fluently With a prostitute there is sex and its over said Mr Doriguzzi speaking from the veranda of his modest groundfloor apartment It lasts for a limited time and nothing else With Ms Gregory he said we put ourselves in a bubble and become a normal couple We talk to each other We do whatever we want We ask each other whatever we want At the end of the session we break the bubble Sexual surrogates are legal in most countries that allow prostitution like Switzerland Germany and Denmark In Switzerland several associations offer training for sexual surrogates In 2008 Catherine Agthe Diserens a SwissGerman educator started a sixmonth training program with former prostitutes nurses and physiotherapists It included classes about disabilities internships in institutions collaborations with sex workers and practical courses exploring what Mrs Agthe Diserens called body skills It is a totally atypical and extremely specialized training she said in an interview from her home near Geneva It requires a lot of preparation beforehand and it is extremely intense She plans to set up a second training session in the fall and bring more prostitutes to train she said In France offering such training would be unthinkable For many French feminists who associate undesired sex with violence sexual assistance is humiliating both for the woman involved and for disabled people Its like telling disabled people that since they will never have a sex or love life well prescribe them sexual assistance as a palliative said AnneCcile Mailfert a member of Osez le Fminisme Dare to be feminist For Ms Mailfert sexual assistance can also create dangerous emotional dependency between those who practice it and their clients The central question she said is less about sexuality than about teaching medical professionals to understand the sexual needs of disabled people and to help them meet other people But many disabled people including Ms Rebord believe that they have a right to sexual assistance a psychological and physical means to overcome their inhibitions and empower them to find love Marcel Nuss a severely disabled father of two who breathes with an artificial respirator is the author of I Want to Make Love The book describes his personal fulfillment through love with his former wife and a sex life with escorts His experiences he said persuaded him to support the use of sexual surrogates Someone like me cant do anything on his own said Mr Nuss who runs a consulting firm specializing in helping disabled people Sex helps the disabled to reincarnate themselves and recover their human aspect Ms Rebord shares Mr Nusss optimism and openness about sex She lives in a tidy modern apartment has a decent paycheck a Facebook account and a taste for Sons of Anarchy an American television series featuring a group of tattooed bikers She believes that a conservative society like France moves slowly as it did before finally legalizing abortion In time she said France will legalize sexual surrogates too although she was not holding her breath I hope she said with a laugh Ill still be alive to see it
"Pushing for Change, Within the Bounds of Orthodoxy",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/06/us/pushing-for-change-but-within-the-bounds-of-orthodoxy.html,For Blu Greenberg of the Bronx  mother of 5 grandmother of 23 founder of Orthodox Jewish feminism  June was a very good month Ms Greenberg has long predicted that there would be female Orthodox rabbis and on June 16 a seminary in the Bronx bestowed on three Orthodox women the title maharat meant to be a female counterpart to rabbi Two of the three already have congregational jobs On June 24 New York University hosted an Agunah Summit where dozens of rabbis and scholars discussed one of Ms Greenbergs other obsessions the agunah or chained wife whose husband refuses to grant her a divorce And last weekend the agunah problem was on the agenda of the annual meeting of the Rabbinical Council of America the largest organization of Modern Orthodox rabbis For nearly 40 years Ms Greenberg 77 has been writing about such issues In 1997 she founded the Jewish Orthodox Feminist Alliance a prominent voice for womens equality in Orthodoxy Mention her name to traditional rabbis and you may get the Greenberg Trifecta an eyeroll a benevolent smile and a vague condescending declaration like Of course I love Blu shes great even if   But more than ever these rabbis are listening Ms Greenbergs parents were relatively progressive and when she was 10 the family left Seattle for Queens so that she and her sisters could continue in Jewish schools Her mother in particular always said what she was thinking She could not help herself even if it meant putting her in a bad light or losing friends Ms Greenberg said on Monday speaking from her home in the Riverdale section of the Bronx But Ms Greenberg never expected to be an activist She married and had children she was happy In 1963 I read Betty Friedans The Feminine Mystique  Ms Greenberg wrote in her 1981 book On Women and Judaism A View From Tradition Womens equality was exciting mindboggling and very just Still correct or not it didnt mean me nor did it apply to women in Judaism On that score I was defensive resistant and probably just plain frightened From then on however she brought a feminist eye to scenes in Jewish life Her father she realized had discussed Talmud with her dates never with her Her sons planned a surprise presentation for her husband that involved synagogue prayers and her 10yearold son mocked his little sister by saying Well so what you cant even do anything in the synagogue These slights began to seem unfair and as Ms Greenberg thought about them she decided to write about them in magazines for Jewish women like Hadassah and Lilith Ms Greenberg is best known for one line from her 1981 book in which she avers that in Jewish history where there was a rabbinic will there was a halakhic way Halakhic refers to the code of Jewish law Ms Greenberg was arguing that when rabbis have wanted to change Jewish practice they have found some precedent to justify it She was saying of Jewish law what many say of the Constitution it must change with the times it has and it was designed to So for example rabbis could find  and in the past have found  legal justification to free women from failed marriages even if their husbands do not consent In Orthodoxy only men can enact a divorce so in contested divorces husbands can extort money or favorable custody arrangements Her view of Halakha was a lightning rod for her critics said Marc D Angel an Orthodox rabbi and longtime friend In his view her real greatness will be more fully appreciated in coming generations Even if one can quibble with this point or that Rabbi Angel said she has been a phenomenal personality within Orthodoxy courageous articulate and clearthinking Many Orthodox like to behave as if the Halakha were completely objective said Rachel Adler a Reform rabbi who teaches at Hebrew Union College in Los Angeles Blu was pointing out that anybody who reasons Halakhically has an investment in how it comes out and that rabbis were responsible for how the Halakha that they wielded treated women Ms Greenberg admits that she gets a respectful hearing in part because of her yikhes  lineage family stature Her husband Irving an Orthodox rabbi founded the Jewish studies department at City College of New York She seems to know everybody Did Shmuel Goldin the past president of the Rabbinical Council of America word his criticism so carefully  Her famous statement where theres a rabbinic will theres a halakhic way we consider to be simplistic and populist in nature  in part because his mother was once Ms Greenbergs baby sitter Ms Greenberg is careful to state and restate her commitment to Orthodoxy She wrote a classic homemakers guide How to Run a Traditional Jewish Household And in her early writing she could be very critical of secular feminism as if trying to protect Orthodoxy from it Feminism Ms Greenberg told me had a  I cant say antifamily it was so long ago that those words sound very harsh  but it had less tolerance for some of the constructs in Orthodoxy that were perfectly in order as far as I was concerned Being Jewish and a feminist does not mean for Ms Greenberg that the two identities are of equal importance My priority is my community my people Ms Greenberg told an audience at Harvard Divinity School in 2002 I see much less danger in whether the rights to abortion will be withdrawn than I do to Israels viability or to antiSemitism the specter of antiSemitism that is rising in the world and how that will impact on my children and grandchildren I was there and I remember the gasps Jewish survival more important than abortionrights politics Her audience was shocked But no matter I have always found its better to plunge in with whatever you think is the truth and dont think about politics Ms Greenberg said You may have to pick up the pieces afterward
Chile: Rape Ignites Abortion Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/06/world/americas/chile-rape-ignites-abortion-debate.html, The case of a pregnant 11yearold girl who was raped has set off a national debate about abortion in one of the most socially conservative countries in Latin America State television reported that the girl known only as Belen is 14 weeks pregnant Police arrested her mothers partner who confessed to abusing the fifth grader Doctors say her life and that of the fetus are at high risk But ending the pregnancy is not an option Chile allowed abortions for medical reasons until they were outlawed in 1973 by the Pinochet dictatorship The current government of President Sebastin Piera has opposed any loosening of the prohibition Many Chileans were venting outrage about the case on social media on Friday AP
Texas Transportation Department Hits Hurdles in Seeking Financing,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/texas-transportation-department-hits-hurdles-in-seeking-financing.html,When this years first special session concluded dramatically in the Texas Senate last month with an energized crowd shouting to block the passage of a contentious abortion bill proponents of the measure were not the only ones who were upset Among the other bills that died in the intense parliamentary battle was legislation to increase financing for the strapped Texas Department of Transportation  Gov Rick Perry has included abortion and transportation financing on the agenda of a second special session But the leading transportation proposal would only reduce the agencys financing shortfall not erase it Whether or not it passes the agencys financial woes are likely to loom larger than ever when lawmakers convene for their next regular legislative session in 2015  This is part of that solution its not the whole solution said State Senator Robert Nichols the chairman of the Senate Transportation Committee and the author of Senate Joint Resolution 1 The legislation would require voters to approve amending the State Constitution to allow half the oil and gas severance taxes that traditionally fill the coffers of the Rainy Day Fund to be sent to the states highway fund Thanks to the current shaledrilling boom in Texas the measure is estimated to steer about 900 million more to the agency a year Im hoping that we can get this passed this special session so that the citizens can vote on it in November and when we come back next session well work on other revenue streams said Mr Nichols Republican of Jacksonville Finding other revenue streams to finance road construction and maintenance was a top legislative goal this year Yet many lawmakers refused to support proposals that raised taxes or fees or increased public debt  State Senator Kevin P Eltife Republican of Tyler said he supported Mr Nicholss proposal but worried that the piecemeal approach would make it tougher to find a more sustainable revenue source in 2015 I almost believe a crisis in transportation would force us to a better solution Mr Eltife said Most of the states transportation financing comes from vehicle registration fees and a 20cent gas tax Neither revenue source has kept up with inflation Over the last decade Texas has increasingly relied on debt financing and tolls to expand its highway system Citing strong population growth and rising costs officials told lawmakers in January that their agency needed an additional 4 billion a year to maintain current traffic levels Budget writers found an additional 200 million a year that the agency could use to narrow that gap A lack of urgency on the issue stemmed from the major road construction projects under way across the state Those signs of health will dim after the agencys bond proceeds dry up in about two years said James M Bass its chief financial officer Drivers would still see some road construction work in 2016 but the signing of contracts for new projects would slow considerably Nonetheless some lawmakers are already laying the groundwork to address the issue more vigorously in 2015 On Tuesday the House Appropriations Committee will meet to hear testimony on several transportation financing proposals The hearing is expected to help promote revenue options that will be on the table in two years according to people involved  In the meantime should Mr Nicholss plan draw the support of enough lawmakers this month voters will be asked to approve it in November State Representative Joe C Pickett an El Paso Democrat predicted that lawmakers and business groups campaigning for the proposal would promote it without giving the impression that it represented a complete fix I think theyll do what they can to put a positive spin on it to get it passed but leave the door open to doing more he said
Onetime Dewhurst Ally Turns Rival in Race for Lieutenant Governorship,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/07/us/onetime-dewhurst-ally-turns-rival-in-race-for-lieutenant-governorship.html,A year before State Senator Dan Patrick announced he would challenge Lt Gov David Dewhurst in the 2014 primary the Houston Republican who is also a radio host vigorously defended Mr Dewhursts record on the airwaves and on his Facebook page In the last months of Mr Dewhursts unsuccessful 2012 United States Senate race against Ted Cruz Mr Patrick the founder of the Texas Legislatures Tea Party Caucus repeatedly vouched for the lieutenant governors conservative credentials as he desperately tried to buoy support among grassroots Republicans who had flocked to Mr Cruz The move which came despite a strained history between the two men helped turn Mr Patrick and Mr Dewhurst from rivals into allies Before the most recent legislative session Mr Dewhurst named Mr Patrick as the chairman of the Senates Education Committee and they worked together to advance a number of school reforms Now Mr Patrick who began his campaign in late June has quickly become Mr Dewhursts fiercest critic among the field of candidates hoping to unseat him in next years primary But his work in the United States Senate race on Mr Dewhursts behalf could hurt his appeal to the conservative primary voters he will now have to court in the crowded race that includes two other elected state officials Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples I think that Senator Patrick will have some tough questions that he will have to answer in that regard because the people who supported Ted Cruz during the campaign their support for him has done nothing but grow since hes been in office said JoAnn Fleming a conservative activist who is the executive director of the political advocacy group Grassroots America We the People  Mr Patrick has based his campaign on the need for what he calls authentic conservative leadership in the State Senate  I think its clear to a lot of people that the lieutenant governor has lost focus this session and there have been lapses of judgment and leadership that no one can deny he said in an interview with The Texas Tribune In response to a request for comment for this article Travis Considine a Dewhurst spokesman said the lieutenant governor was focused on completing the current special session  When the Texas Senate finishes the business that Texans sent them to Austin to complete Lt Gov Dewhurst looks forward to meeting with grassroots voters across the state to discuss his vision for making Texas even stronger in terms of freedom opportunity and economic strength Mr Considine said When Mr Patrick officially endorsed Mr Dewhurst with the rest of his Republican Senate colleagues in the days before the runoff election he joined a group of statewide officeholders that ultimately included Gov Rick Perry Mr Patterson and Mr Staples Mr Patricks decision to back Mr Dewhurst in the United States Senate race was noteworthy in ways that the others endorsements were not On the Texas Senate floor during the 2011 session he had accused Mr Dewhurst of holding up his bill that would have prohibited invasive searches by Transportation Security Administration officials The situation prompted a forceful clarification from Ms Fleming the chairwoman of the Legislatures Tea Party Caucus at the time who issued a statement saying that while Mr Patrick was the founder and leader of the caucus he did not speak on its behalf  And before his official endorsement in 2012 Mr Patrick had already publicly tipped his hat in Mr Dewhursts direction In late May that year Mr Patrick posted a message on his Facebook page declaring that over the course of his three terms in the Legislature Mr Dewhurst had supported his conservative agenda 98 percent of the time  Voters will make their own final decision but the facts are facts Mr Patrick wrote In this case the facts simply dont support the charge that he is a moderate no matter how many times they are made Mr Patrick also conducted an interview with Mr Cruz on his radio show later widely circulated by the Dewhurst campaign in which Mr Patrick lobbed several criticisms at the candidate suggesting that Mr Cruz was overly combative and ignorant of the Legislatures inner workings  After Mr Cruz during a tense exchange with Mr Patrick accused Mr Dewhurst of obstructing a 2011 bill supported by many conservatives that would have banned socalled sanctuary cities Mr Patrick responded with a fiery defense of Mr Dewhursts actions Mr Cruz asked whether the ban would have passed into law if Mr Patrick had been lieutenant governor If I had been lieutenant governor I would have done the exact same thing that happened Mr Patrick said More recently Mr Patrick told the Tribune he thought Mr Cruz had done a fantastic job since he went to Washington but he declined to say whether he would make the same choice again That was then this is a difference race  and a lot of things have changed since then Mr Patrick said of his onetime support for Mr Dewhurst  He pointed to what he called Mr Dewhursts mishandling of a Republican effort in the first special session to pass an omnibus bill restricting abortions in the state Senator Wendy Davis a Fort Worth Democrat filibustered for about 11 hours and the ensuing debate and boisterous gallery prevented senators from approving the legislation before a midnight deadline  Speaking to reporters that night Mr Dewhurst blamed an unruly mob in the Senate gallery for the failure The events led Mr Perry to call lawmakers back the next day to get the job done in a second special session  and Mr Patrick promptly issued a statement saying he would immediately use a procedural tactic to force a vote on the measure if Democrats attempted another delay  What direction the race will take as Mr Patterson and Mr Staples begin engaging and as candidates file their initial fundraising reports is uncertain  But there are signs that Mr Patrick could soothe lingering ill will among primary voters Though all four Republican candidates currently hold elected office 61 percent of Texas Republican primary voters surveyed had yet to form an opinion of them according to a University of TexasTexas Tribune poll conducted in June  And Ms Fleming said that what she viewed as Mr Patricks otherwise strong record on conservative issues could overcome what she called a single error in judgment if he proved responsive to voters concerns Senator Patrick believed he did what he needed to do at that time she said But I will tell you that I absolutely believe in forgiving people and moving forward When people have their feelings bruised theyve got to have their woodshed moment with that candidate to move on

Tolerance Takes the High Road,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/us/08iht-letter08.html,WASHINGTON  Looking at the news from Washington a little more than a week ago Americanophiles in Turkey were confused Was the United States moving more toward openness and tolerance or back to more fundamentalism Were Americans following Kemal Ataturk or Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan The Supreme Court ruled barely for gay marriage with limits The Senate cleared immigration reform amid warnings the measure would die in the House Across the country states were close to banning abortions The picture isnt as mixed as it appeared from Istanbul The move to greater inclusiveness for gays including acceptance of samesex marriage and a more liberal immigration policy are on a continuum the only questions concern timing Abortion is different But the swing to the right on this issue is deceptive reflecting temporary political realities and apt to produce a backlash A divided Supreme Court in a 5to4 decision overturned the Defense of Marriage Act which denied federal benefits to gay married couples The states still sanction or prohibit the unions To date 13 states and the District of Columbia allow gay marriages There remain thorny questions like what to do about federal spousal benefits for gay and lesbian couples living in states where samesex marriage isnt legal Opponents claim that gay marriage proponents only have support in liberal states Conservatives say they have the upper hand in most of the rest in what promise to be ferocious battles over the next few years Oklahoma and Mississippi arent fertile ground for samesex marriages True and misleading First there are a number of states including Illinois Hawaii and Oregon where approval should be relatively easy in the near term Public opinion continues to move in the direction of more tolerance A recent Princeton Survey Research Associates poll for USA Today found that 55 percent of Americans said samesex marriage should be accorded the same recognition as traditional marriage a record high compared with 40 percent who said it should not The only groups opposed were Republicans and older Americans With the Supreme Court victory says Chad Griffin the president of the Human Rights Campaign gay rights organizations are intensifying grassroots efforts in many states with an eye to victories in state legislatures or voter initiatives Thats the focus but he doesnt rule out other modes of pressure like calling for convention boycotts in states that outlaw samesex marriages Everything is on the table And he says the legal battles will continue in search of a more sweeping Supreme Court ruling making this a constitutional right Within five years well have equality in all states he predicts On immigration its instructive to talk to strategists of the two parties Republicans are squirming over the House leadership threat to kill the Senatepassed bill and Democrats are unified and exuberant Senate Democrats unanimously supported the bill as did 30 percent of Republicans including some conservatives like Jeff Flake of Arizona Orrin G Hatch of Utah and Marco Rubio of Florida A majority of the House almost certainly supports a measure that would resemble the Senate legislation The rationale of the Republican leadership is that it needs a majority of the majority party Try selling that to voters especially in the Hispanic community The Senate bill which probably involved more political concessions than necessary is a step forward and commands support from an impressive coalition the business community especially the hightech industry labor Hispanic and civil rights groups top current and former Republican governors many evangelicals and even a few rightwingers House Republicans will feel the heat from this diverse crowd This isnt a reprise of 2007 immigration reform wont die Abortion is different Both proponents and opponents sincerely believe their position is the most humanitarian Remarkably over the past 40 years public opinion on abortion has basically not changed and it isnt likely to for the foreseeable future Most voters few of whom decide principally on that single issue believe abortion should be available and relatively rare When either side stretches beyond that uncomfortable consensus there usually is a counterreaction The dozens of Republicandominated state legislatures that are cracking down on abortion run the risk of a backlash The restrictions proposed in places like Texas would close most abortion clinics Ohio offers an interesting case study The Republican governor John R Kasich who is brimming with national ambitions just signed a bill that makes it hard for familyplanning groups to receive funding for preventive care it also requires ultrasounds for anyone seeking an abortion among other restrictions Mr Kasich is pretty popular and a favorite to win reelection next year Still Democrats who like to point out that Mr Kasich signed the bill surrounded by a bunch of male politicians claim that as a national candidate he would face the same heat for being insensitive to womens concerns that the Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney encountered last year Politically the United States remains a centrist country on economic and national security matters sometimes tilting centerright Health care these days favors conservatives the decision by the administration of President Barack Obama last week to postpone the employer mandate a centerpiece of the Affordable Care Act plays into Republican charges that the whole measure is a mess Abortion is sui generis Yet when it comes to issues of tolerance like gay rights and immigration the United States continues a progressive march
"In Nassau County, an Influx of Democrats Threatens a G.O.P. Stronghold",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/nyregion/in-nassau-county-a-deluge-of-democrats-threatens-a-gop-stronghold.html,HEMPSTEAD NY  With a pivotal local election looming in the fall the Republicancontrolled Nassau County Legislature recently approved new district lines that could help the party secure at least two more seats A local Republican club has increased its campaign chest tenfold over the last two years bringing in individual contributions of tens of thousands of dollars from a family paving company a real estate developer and other donors with business before the county according to disclosure records And if past elections are any guide the party can also turn for campaign help to workers from the countys special tax districts which handle services like water and sewage Most are run by loyal commissioners The party is marshaling its forces because it is facing an unprecedented challenge in the postwar era a deluge of Democrats In a county that has long symbolized Republican dominance of the American suburbs Democrats now make up a majority of partyaffiliated voters Last year county residents registered to vote at a rate of two to one in favor of Democrats according to the countys Board of Elections The changes reflect a liberal swing in some suburbs around the country as more young people immigrants and minorities move in  For the Republicans the demographic shift is truly existential said Lawrence C Levy an expert on Long Island politics at Hofstra University Its the difference between life as they know it and the death of the party as it is Mr Levy said There will be so many more Democrats crowding into formerly Republican precincts that the GOPs ability to gerrymander its way out of trouble will become more and more remote Republicans in Nassau had a preview of this challenge in 1999 when they lost control of the County Legislature after a series of scandals and then the county executives office two years later But they recovered The county executive now is a Republican and the party controls the County Legislature 10 to 9 as well as all five State Senate seats in Nassau The county executive Edward P Mangano declined to be interviewed but his office and other Republican leaders said the party had regained control because its message and policies transcended partisan divisions In fact traditionally Democratic populations have received improved services under this administration than the last Mr Manganos office said in a statement Democratic leaders accused Republicans of maintaining power through gerrymandering intimidation of Democratic voters at polling places and campaign finance improprieties There was a time when the Republican Party in Nassau County was a nearly indomitable force a political machine with influence that extended to Washington Ronald Reagan is said to have likened the county to heaven on earth for his ideological brethren The partys power was embodied by Alfonse M DAmato who was a local official in Hempstead before becoming a United States senator He is now a lobbyist Only two Democratic county executives have been elected since the position was created in 1938  But about two decades ago the demographics began to shift The proportion of minorities in Nassau County has grown to 22 percent from 14 percent since 1990 according to census figures Many of the newcomers are from Brooklyn and Queens with a Democratic bent Compared with a decade ago there are nearly 82000 more registered Democrats in Nassau County while there are more than 16000 fewer Republicans according to the State Board of Elections  As of April there were 371557 registered Democrats in the county and 332036 registered Republicans  Political analysts said the question now is whether the Republican Party is so entrenched that Democrats will have difficulty dislodging it With the lines redrawn Republicans have gained a significant edge in two districts in the County Legislature where Democrats previously were the majority The new map also bolsters the Republican advantage in a third district  The will of the people can overcome any particular map said Kevan M Abrahams the Democratic leader in the Legislature At the same time when you stack the deck it becomes more difficult Republicans responded that they would win seats because they were reaching out to independent voters There are no guarantees in any of these districts said Francis X Moroney a Republican who was chairman of a committee that oversaw the redistricting Republicans have also done well in fundraising Mr Mangano the county executive who is up for reelection in November has raised more than 2 million Thomas R Suozzi his probable Democratic opponent has raised half that  In 2009 Mr Mangano defeated Mr Suozzi the incumbent by 386 votes Mr Suozzi had been the first Democrat to hold the job since the early 1970s  The fundraising strength extends to political clubs The treasury at the one in Hicksville grew to well over 300000 much of that coming from single donations that exceeded 10000 Among the donors were Keith and Aly Lizza who each gave 45000 according to disclosure

leaders of the Hicksville club Rob Walker is Mr Manganos chief deputy  Democrats said the party was using the club to circumvent campaign finance rules Republicans have denied wrongdoing  Republicans also maintain a system of patronage through control of many of the 140 or so special tax districts in the county Around election time employees of Hempsteads sanitation districts for instance usually campaign for Republican candidates political analysts said Democrats have accused such workers of gathering around polling places on Election Day to intimidate voters Two years ago one sanitation worker employed by the campaign of a Republican legislator in Elmont was caught on video making racially tinged comments to the sister of the legislators Democratic opponent Carri Solages who is HaitianAmerican  The sanitation districts of the town of Hempstead are an arm of the Republican Party hands down said Laura K Mallay executive director of Residents for Efficient Special Districts a nonprofit group that has sought to reform such practices Still there is a sense in some places that the political dynamic is changing In Elmont a workingclass community in Hempstead on the border with Queens Haitian and Indian cafes now compete with spaghetti restaurants In 2011 residents unseated their longstanding Republican county legislator and replaced him with Mr Solages who benefited from publicity surrounding the incident involving his sister  The Republican committee realizes that due to the increasing population and the changing demographics they will lose power Mr Solages said So theyre trying to monopolize the power or exploit the power  Republican leaders acknowledged the numbers but said they did not represent a crisis They pointed out that independent voters could tip elections one way or another And some said they saw opportunities in the demographic changes Francis X Becker Jr a Republican county legislator said Republicans and some minority groups align on some social issues including abortion and samesex marriage but have been slow to forge ties Unfortunately the Republicans on a national level have not done a good job establishing who and what we are he

"In Congress, Gridlock and Harsh Consequences",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/us/politics/in-congress-gridlock-and-harsh-consequences.html,WASHINGTON  Despite fingerpointing news conferences and radio addresses by both parties on Capitol Hill Congress let interest rates double last week on federally subsidized student loans Eleven days earlier a coalition of Democrats and conservative Republicans in the House scuttled the latest attempt at a farm bill dooming for now disaster assistance for livestock producers still affected by last years drought Congress returns on Monday with a major overhaul of immigration pending in the House the farm bill lying in a heap and new fiscal deadlines looming when the government runs out of spending authority on Sept 30 and reaches its borrowing limit shortly thereafter The Postal Service meanwhile continues to lose millions of dollars every day as a measure to rescue the agency founders in the House  There is no guarantee that any of these issues will be dealt with Even in some of the worst years of partisan gridlock a deadline has meant something to Congress  until 2013 Dropdead dates have come and gone this year causing realworld consequences On Jan 1 tax rates went up not only for affluent families but also for virtually all workers when lawmakers looked the other way and let a payroll tax cut expire On March 1 after leaders from both parties declared that automatic acrosstheboard spending cuts would never happen they happened anyway because of inaction One hundred percent of Congress opposed it and were doing it said Representative Peter Welch Democrat of Vermont Thats a sign of a dysfunctional institution At this time in 2011 Congress had passed 23 laws on the way toward the lowest total since those numbers began being tracked in 1948 This year 15 have been passed so far  Legislation favored by the left like new gunsafety measures has started in the Senate and has often foundered before it reached the House Bills pushed by conservatives to restrict abortion and relax regulations to encourage oil and gas production have passed the House but have gone nowhere in the Senate  Legislation that has reached President Obamas desk this year has often been small bore and ceremonial like the authorization of a commemorative coin bill Congress has always had this habit of going to the brink and then passing something but in the last months something has changed said Justin Draeger the president of the National Association of Student Financial Aid Administrators which has been pressing for compromise on student loans Recent examples of Congressional inaction have left us pessimistic Im not saying its impossible but its not looking good The 113th Congress still has a chance to pass the most significant overhaul of the nations immigration laws since 1986 but for now at least it appears deadlocked Even saying that lawmakers have passed 15 laws may be overstating it The first two  raising the Federal Emergency Management Agencys borrowing authority after Hurricane Sandy and approving a broader hurricanerelief bill  were supposed to be one bill but they had to be split in two because House Republican leaders refused to put the full package up for a vote for fear of party divisions  The third law raised the governments statutory borrowing limit and helped prod the Senate to pass a broad budget blueprint But since the Senate passed its budget more than 100 days ago Republicans have refused to allow House and Senate negotiators to try to reach a compromise budget for the coming fiscal year  Another bill was signed into law on May 1 to keep air traffic control operations working because on March 1 Congress failed to stop acrosstheboard spending cuts from hitting the Federal Aviation Administration One of the 15 laws of 2013 specifies the size of the preciousmetal blank that will be used in the production of the National Baseball Hall of Fame commemorative coins Sarah Binder a George Washington University political scientist who tracks Congress said If I had a measure in front of me  what do they do relative to whats on the nations big agenda  Id have to say Wow this is a remarkably dysfunctional placeÂ   The upside of inaction is its impact on deficit spending Total discretionary spending in the fiscal year that ends Sept 30 will be about 70 billion below the previous years  the first such drop since fiscal 1996 another year of sharply divided government In June the federal government shed 5000 jobs according to jobs data released on Friday  If Congress does not change course nondefense spending at its annual discretion will reach 3 percent of the economy by 2018 a diminutive level not seen since 1962 when records began being tracked Congressional budget aides said House leaders blame the Senate House Republicans did pass a student loan bill that would have at least ameliorated the rise in interest rates Conversely Senate Democrats blame the House The Senate has twice passed major farm legislation with broad bipartisan support along with a postal overhaul bill and at least it wants to go into formal negotiations on a budget  At the same time lawmakers in both parties fault the Obama administration for leaving Congress to its own devices I wish we had a president who didnt make news when he just talks to a member of Congress said Representative Tim Griffin Republican of Arkansas The secretary of agriculture Tom Vilsack pushed back hard on that line With all due respect to those who want to shift responsibility he said the responsibility here is clear How significant these failures have been is a matter of debate in Washington Many of Mr Obamas dire warnings about the acrosstheboard spending cuts known as sequestration have failed to materialize But more than 125000 federal workers have been sent home without pay since March Most of them were off work on Friday a White House budget official said Sunday And beginning this week rolling furloughs will hit 650000 civilian employees of the Defense Department Marla Levenson a civilian worker at Hanscom Air Force Base in Bedford Mass said 2000 employees at the base will be furloughed on Friday Laurie Vroman 31 a single mother with three children in Latham NY is preparing for her furlough from the Armys Watervliet Arsenal in upstate New York which will mean a 1600 pay cut from her 37000 salary To be honest I still have that glimmer of hope that things might turn around that at the last minute they will come to their senses Ms Vroman said I just wish there was a way around this instead of punishing us for the errors they made on Capitol Hill After last months unexpected collapse of the farm bill in the House lawmakers were left with a new deadline Sept 30 to reach a deal before a series of farm programs go out of business dairy prices skyrocket and direct payments to commodity farmers disappear But Mr Vilsack said the consequences of Congresss failure to pass a farm bill last year and this year were already real A disasterassistance program for livestock producers expired in October 2011 Since then livestock producers hit by drought and rising feed costs have been liquidating and reducing herds to the point where American cattle stocks are at their lowest level since 1952  In addition dairy production is diminishing in the face of price and policy volatility And in August Brazil will get the green light to impose retaliatory tariffs on an array of American goods and services because Congress has not made the United States cotton program compliant with international trade law The key here is for rural folks to say weve had enough of this Mr Vilsack said Rural America deserves better than this
My Motherâ€™s Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/opinion/my-mothers-abortion.html,BOULDER Colo  ON June 25 I sat with my mother and sister in the gallery of the Texas State Senate to support Wendy Davis a Democratic senator in her filibuster against legislation that would limit abortions after 20 weeks and impose new regulations that would leave just a few abortion clinics open We were part of the crowd who raised our voices in anger as the Republicans who control the Legislature tried to shut down Ms Davis who spoke continuously for about 11 hours  unable to eat drink sit lean or use the bathroom  to run out the clock on the session We remained in the gallery until 130 am on June 26 when state troopers finally made us leave An hour and a half later celebration erupted when we learned that the filibuster had succeeded  Sadly the victory was fleeting as Gov Rick Perry a Republican has summoned the Legislature back into special session to take up the issue again this week  The legislation comes on top of Texas sonogram law which Mr Perry signed in 2011 It requires a doctor to conduct a sonogram at least 24 hours before an abortion and to give the woman the opportunity to see the results and hear the heartbeat of the fetus Though she can choose not to view the images and hear the heartbeat the doctor must describe what the sonogram shows My mother Sherry Matusoff Merfish sat and yelled in indignation beside my sister and me in the Senate gallery She has two graduate degrees and has built an immensely satisfying career as a political fundraiser devoted to the election of women who support abortion rights She also embodies maternal warmth My mother chose to abort her first pregnancy in 1972 She and my father who celebrated 40 years of marriage on Jan 6 this year met as undergraduates at the University of Texas Austin They got engaged Then my mother became pregnant She was 20 and he was 21  They knew they were thoroughly unprepared to be parents but abortion was illegal in Texas at the time unless a womans life was at risk This was the year before the United States Supreme Court in Roe v Wade a case originating in Texas affirmed a womans right to have an abortion until the fetus was viable Fearing the stigma that would result if their families knew they had engaged in premarital sex and not used contraception my parents did not tell their parents when they traveled to Albuquerque to end the pregnancy My mother remembers vividly that the doctor who performed the procedure treated her as though she was a criminal A few months later they were married in San Antonio Until recently fear of shame has kept her quiet about her experience even as she passionately publicly supported reproductive freedom This is the first time weve discussed her abortion in public  My mother waited until the evening before I began my first year at Wellesley College in 2001 to tell me about her abortion Her voice shook but never broke as she described her fear and her decision She ended by reiterating that her choice was the right one and that her love for my sister and me was unequivocal She had told my sister who is two years older before she began college  I was shocked at 18 I navely believed that only other women  not my family and certainly not my mother  needed this right that our family had long supported We had volunteered at Planned Parenthood and canvassed for candidates who supported abortion rights My mother said she wanted to reassure me that I had no reason to doubt her support in any situation I might face in my own life Although it took a few years for the shock to wear off knowing made me even more proud of her and more determined to defend reproductive rights  Recently I heard my mother reveal her experience to four friends who are devoted to protecting womens right to choose Strikingly two of them revealed that they had had an abortion and the other two had close friends whod had an abortion None had told my mother before  What the movement for reproductive rights needs is for the faces of freedom to emerge from the captivity of shame To my mothers generation I ask Speak openly about the choices you have made To all women ask your mothers grandmothers godmothers aunts sisters daughters and partners about their reproductive histories Show that abortion has myriad faces those of women we love respect and cherish You have the power to cement in the minds of your communities and families the importance of reproductive freedom You have made decisions that are private even anguishing but the weight of this political moment demands that you shed light on those decisions  The opposition is frightening as more states try to restrict abortion but there is tremendous power and safety in numbers You are part of a society of women who have been incredibly courageous I ask humbly for yet another show of that bravery 
Perry Says He Wonâ€™t Seek Governorship Again in Texas,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/09/us/perry-will-not-seek-re-election-as-texas-governor.html,SAN ANTONIO  Rick Perry the longestserving governor of Texas and an unsuccessful Republican presidential candidate last year announced on Monday that he would not seek another term but would instead pray and reflect and work to determine my own future path The time has come to pass on the mantle of leadership Mr Perry told a crowd of supporters in a cavernous heavy equipment dealership here Today I am announcing I will not seek reelection as governor of Texas As for what happens after his term is over in 18 months he said he would announce any future considerations in due time almost certainly an allusion to the possibility of a White House bid in 2016 though he made no direct reference to it Mr Perry has indicated regret over entering the presidential race relatively late in the process and has said that back trouble and a lack of sleep contributed to his gaffeplagued campaign But it is an open question whether an earlier start and better health would make a difference for Mr Perry should he try to run again Mr Perry faces some daunting challenges First he would have to convince Republican primary voters that he is not the lightweight who could not recite the third of three federal agencies he would eliminate and blurted out Oops Beyond rehabilitating his image from the debates Mr Perry must also demonstrate to everdemanding earlystate voters that he will pursue their votes in the fashion to which they have grown accustomed one at a time Mr Perry faced criticism during the campaign last year that his entourage of aides and security officers made him seem detached from the traditional retailstyle politics of a place like Iowa Most challenging of all for Mr Perry is whether there is even space for him in a 2016 primary field that is sure to look very different from the last campaign With nextgeneration Republicans like Senator Marco Rubio of Florida Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky and Mr Perrys fellow Texan Senator Ted Cruz eager to test the presidential waters the primary could be far tougher than last years when Republican activists seemed to examine and discard a shifting group of candidates in searching for an alternative to Mitt Romney the weak frontrunner On Monday Mr Perry stood on a temporary dais against a backdrop of American and Texas flags and heavy machinery intended to underscore his focus on jobs and the states economy and faced a friendly crowd of longtime supporters and employees of Holt Cat a Caterpillar dealership Its chief executive Peter Holt also owns the San Antonio Spurs and is a major contributor to Mr Perrys campaigns We have created the strongest economy in the nation Mr Perry told the crowd through encouraging growth balanced budgets and an overhaul the tort system We have stood strong against unwise policies from Washington that would bust the bank he said We have better protected the right to life for Texas children And we have protected the sanctity of marriage Mr Perry said he was proudest of the jobs created in the state while he was governor citing 16 million new positions Mr Perry assumed the governorship in late 2000 after George W Bush left office to become president he was then elected to three full terms He withdrew from the last years presidential race and quietly returned to Texas But he recently regained national attention when he squared off with Democrats in the State Senate who opposed a stringent antiabortion bill which seems headed for easy passage in the Republicancontrolled Legislature In particular he took on State Senator Wendy Davis a Fort Worth Democrat after her 11hour filibuster halted the bills progress at least temporarily He also spoke out against her directly at a National Right to Life convention in Texas suggesting that Ms Davis especially should understand that every life matters He later explained to reporters that Ms Davis had been a teenage mother and that her own mother had also been a single mother and might have considered abortion What if her mom had said I just cant do this I dont want to do this Mr Perry said The comments angered fans of Ms Davis who saw the attack as unstatesmanlike and offensive Mr Perry later said that his comments were meant to be a compliment for what shes accomplished in her life The antiabortion bill is almost certain to pass during a special legislative session called by Mr Perry Ms Davis has said she will not filibuster again and with weeks before the end of the session a filibuster would not be possible The antiabortion bill is already making its way through the Legislature Last week a House of Representatives committee passed the bill on to the full House after an eighthour hearing in which about 100 witnesses were heard out of the thousands who had signed up The Senate Health and Human Services Committee considered the bill on Monday Both houses are scheduled to reconvene Tuesday the House has already scheduled debate and a vote on the bill for that day In his speech on Monday Mr Perry was fluid and passionate though a longtime observer of Texas politics noted that it did not say much It wasnt even bait and switch there was no bait said Paul Burka senior executive editor of Texas Monthly magazine He just bragged about Texas and bragged and bragged and gave no information whatsoever except what everybody already knew  that he wasnt going to run again though he never said so directly For Mr Perrys supporters it was an event of powerful emotion and hope Ray Sullivan a former Perry staff member called the announcement typically big and bold adding I believe he will run for president again To run in 2016 Mr Perry 63 will have to return to Iowa And officials there suggest the road will be uphill His poor showing in the debates gave me pause said Mark Lundberg chairman of the Sioux County Republican Party in Iowa adding If he gets his act together he could be a viable candidate But he said Mr Perry was still not my No 1 or 2 choice at this point Mr Perry would at least have a chance at a second hearing said Lisa Van Riper president of South Carolina Citizens for Life After the embarrassments of the primaries last year He just went back home and pulled his boots back up she said Hes proven hes got a lot of mettle Mark McKinnon a Republican media strategist who worked with Mr Bushs campaigns said Mr Perry could perhaps have won another term as governor but he would have become a pariah among the GOP leadership in Texas who are all anxious for new generation of statewide elected officials  And if he does run in 2016 Mr McKinnon said Mr Perry has two years to prepare Plenty of time to remember the third agency of government hell cut
Rick Perry Wonâ€™t Run,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/08/rick-perry-wont-run-for-governor/,"Its not shocking that Gov Rick Perry of Texas has decided against seeking a fourth term in office Even three  as Dorothy Parker said about martinis  can be too many Your constituents get pretty

                                        said theyd vote for Mr Perry a third said they would vote against him and another third said it depended on his opponent But its melancholy news nonetheless at least in the sense that he was a consistent source of comic relief
                                         When Mr Perry dropped out of the presidential race in 2012 we paid homage to his greatest moments as a candidate
                                        The Houston Chronicle also had a good list of Mr Perrys more entertaining gags like his boyswillbeboys
                                        defense of the Marines who urinated on the corpse of a Taliban fighter in Afghanistan All kidding aside its important to remember that Mr Perry the longestserving governor in Texas history did more than say oops at a presidential debate For instance he waged a systematic assault on reproductive health services for poor and rural women in his state He starved Planned Parenthood of money including Medicaid funds that covered more than 130000 women
                                        and closed more than a dozen Planned Parenthood clinics  none of which provided the abortion services that Mr Perry claimed were the object of his political wrath Mr Perry was one of a gang of Republican governors who refused to open a health care exchange in accordance with the Affordable
                                        Care Act thus giving more power to the federal government which will now have direct control over the health insurance marketplace in his state More recently he showed incredible ignorance about the reality of unmarried motherhood when he wondered out loud why Wendy
                                        Davis the state legislator who filibustered an antiabortion bill and who became a parent while still a teenager would support the right to choose He did not see fit to mention that in his state a majority
                                        of new mothers are poor enough to qualify for Medicaid Mr Perry vetoed scores of laws like a ban on executing mentally disabled inmates Possibly Texas voters will elect a more moderate politician to replace Mr Perry More likely theyll choose someone just as reactionary"

The Decline of North Carolina,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/opinion/the-decline-of-north-carolina.html,Every Monday since April thousands of North Carolina residents have gathered at the State Capitol to protest the grotesque damage that a new Republican majority has been doing to a tradition of caring for the least fortunate Nearly 700 people have been arrested in the Moral Monday demonstrations as they are known But the bad news keeps on coming from the Legislature and pretty soon a single day of the week may not be enough to contain the outrage In January after the election of Pat McCrory as governor Republicans took control of both the executive and legislative branches for the first time since Reconstruction Since then state government has become a demolition derby tearing down years of progress in public education tax policy racial equality in the courtroom and access to the ballot The cruelest decision by lawmakers went into effect last week ending federal unemployment benefits for 70000 residents Another 100000 will lose their checks in a few months Those still receiving benefits will find that they have been cut by a third to a maximum of 350 weekly from 535 and the length of time they can receive benefits has been slashed from 26 weeks to as few as 12 weeks The state has the fifthhighest unemployment rate in the country and many Republicans insulted workers by blaming their joblessness on generous benefits In fact though North Carolina is the only state that has lost longterm federal benefits because it did not want to pay back 25 billion it owed to Washington for the program The State Chamber of Commerce argued that cutting weekly benefits would be better than forcing businesses to pay more in taxes to pay off the debt and lawmakers blindly went along dropping out of the federal program At the same time the state is also making it harder for future generations of workers to get jobs cutting back sharply on spending for public schools Though North Carolina has been growing rapidly it is spending less on schools now than it did in 2007 ranking 46th in the nation in percapita education dollars Teacher pay is falling 10000 prekindergarten slots are scheduled to be removed and even services to disabled children are being chopped We are losing ground Superintendent June Atkinson said recently warning of a teacher exodus after lawmakers proposed ending extra pay for teachers with masters degrees cutting teacher assistants and removing limits on class sizes Republicans repealed the Racial Justice Act a 2009 law that was the first in the country to give deathrow inmates a chance to prove they were victims of discrimination They have refused to expand Medicaid and want to cut income taxes for the rich while raising sales taxes on everyone else The Senate passed a bill that would close most of the states abortion clinics And naturally the Legislature is rushing to impose voter ID requirements and cut back on early voting and Sunday voting which have been popular among Democratic voters One particularly transparent move would end a tax deduction for dependents if students vote at college instead of their hometowns a blatant effort to reduce Democratic voting strength in college towns like Chapel Hill and Durham North Carolina was once considered a beacon of farsightedness in the South an exception in a region of poor education intolerance and tightfistedness In a few short months Republicans have begun to dismantle a reputation that took years to build
Texas Resumes Efforts at Abortion Restrictions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/10/us/texas-resumes-efforts-at-abortion-restrictions.html,AUSTIN Tex  The restrictive abortion bill that has stirred up Texas politics in the past few weeks is once again moving its way through the Legislature during a second special session called by Gov Rick Perry The bill was initially stalled last month by the 11hour filibuster of State Senator Wendy Davis Democrat of Fort Worth A new version was drafted restarting the process in the Republicancontrolled Texas House with a hearing on Monday and an oftenangry debate on the floor on Tuesday  The bill like its predecessor would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and hold abortion clinics to the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers Its stringent requirements for the clinics are described by the bills supporters as a means to improve safety but denounced by opponents as a way to burden the clinics with expenses that will not improve the health of patients and would force many that cannot afford the changes to close At an early point in Tuesdays debate Representative Senfronia Thompson Democrat of Houston spoke at the chambers front microphone surrounded by allies holding coat hangers  an allusion to the kinds of dangerous procedures that opponents of the bill say women will resort to if clinics are closed and access to legal abortion is narrowed Her proposed amendment to create an exception to the ban on abortions after 20 weeks was shelved by votes along party lines as were other proposed changes Much of the pointed questioning of the bill by Democratic House members seemed to anticipate later court challenges should the bill become law  Meanwhile competing rallies have taken place around the Capitol complex Contingents supporting the bill dressed in blue and those opposed in orange could be seen throughout the Capitol and in the House gallery On Monday evening former Gov Mike Huckabee of Arkansas spoke to a crowd supporting the bill that group was later confronted by opponents who followed with a rally of their own While voices were raised and slogans exchanged the evening passed peacefully  On Tuesday morning the Planned Parenthood Action Fund announced a Stand with Texas Women bus tour across the state with events to be held in various cities to draw attention to the issues being debated  Its time to get the Texas Legislature out of our examination rooms said Cecile Richards president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and daughter of former Gov Ann Richards who died in 2006 In an interview Ms Richards said that she was heartened to see the thousands of protesters many of them young coming to Austin to voice their opposition to the bill Recalling her mothers campaign for governor she said It was on a platform that we need to open up government to the people of Texas and boy Ive never seen that more than the last few weeks  Noting that Lt Gov David Dewhurst had called opponents in the Senate gallery during the final hours of the previous session an unruly mob she said I call it participatory democracy  thats what democracy is about Mr Dewhurst a Republican issued a statement on Monday strongly supporting the bill and telling opponents We love you  He added We love you because as a Christian as Christians we love you just as much as we love that unborn baby And that as an American I respect your First Amendment rights to free speech As a Texan I respect your toughness But as a leader were going to pass this bill When that might happen is still something of an open question complicated by the rules of the Texas House and Senate The House is unlikely to vote final passage of the bill before Wednesday the Senate committee that would consider the House measure Health and Human Services has scheduled a hearing for Thursday to do so After that the bill would go to the full Senate for a vote  My guess is Monday said Senator Rodney Ellis Democrat of Houston Its possible Friday but theres a whole lot of hoops to go through  Mr Dewhurst who presides over the Senate expressed some of that uncertainty in a brief Senate session on Tuesday saying he would be talking with the members about whether we want to come back in on Friday or Saturday or whether we want to come back in Monday Tuesday Wednesday to consider the bill
Texas House Passes Measure Tightening Clinic Rules and Restricting Access to Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/us/texas-house-passes-measure-restricting-abortion.html,AUSTIN Tex  The Texas House of Representatives passed a vigorously contested bill on Wednesday restricting access to abortion The vote was called shortly after 11 am As the votes were counted one spectator in the gallery stood up and shouted As a queer woman of color I object to these proceedings Security guards approached her and others who began to shout as the vote came in 96 to 49 House members and supporters in the gallery applauded as officers led some protesters out and carried others from the chamber The bill closely resembles one that the House passed last month and which was stalled at the end of a special session of the Legislature by an 11hour filibuster by State Senator Wendy Davis a Democrat from Fort Worth But her victory proved temporary Gov Rick Perry a Republican called a second special session of the Legislature to take up the abortion bill once again The bill like its predecessor would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and hold abortion clinics to the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers among other requirements Its supporters argue that the heightened requirements will protect womens health opponents counter that the restrictions are intended solely as a burden on the clinics that perform abortions and will impose expenses that will force many of them to close The House held a preliminary vote on Tuesday evening and approved the measure largely along party lines with 98 members for and 49 against Now the bill moves to the Texas Senate where a committee has already scheduled a hearing for Thursday to consider it and probably to pass it along to the full Senate for final approval That vote could come by the end of the week With the Senate largely inactive until then opponents of the bill took to the road Senator Davis whose political profile has been raised to national recognition by her filibuster joined Cecile Richards the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America for a rally in Houston as part of a Stand With Texas Women bus tour that will hit the states major cities through the weekend The fight over the abortion issue has led to an outpouring of political activism on both sides of the issue that has startled lawmakers and swelled the presence of Capitol security forces Thousands of demonstrators  the bills supporters wearing blue and the opponents orange  thronged the hallways of the Capitol and jammed the House spectator gallery After the Tuesday night vote opponents of the bill chanted Shame on you at lawmakers Upon hearing of the provisional passage of the bill on Tuesday night Ms Richards the daughter of former Gov Ann Richards sent out a Twitter message that stated Tonight the TX House passed a bill that will take women back decades  and were not going
"After Epic Escape From China, Exile Is Mired in Partisan U.S.",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/world/asia/after-epic-escape-from-china-exile-is-mired-in-partisan-us.html,Chen Guangcheng the blind legal advocate who challenged the Chinese government over its harsh family planning policies is nothing if not a politically astute survivor He outsmarted the phalanx of guards who kept him under house arrest and then made his way into the American Embassy setting off a diplomatic crisis that was resolved only after Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton intervened and negotiated his freedom But Mr Chens political savvy has not translated well in the complex and fiercely partisan terrain he has encountered in the United States Even before he could recover from jet lag in May 2012 Mr Chen was besieged by human rights activists opponents of abortion and an array of politicians from both parties eager to harness the celebrity wattage of the man who stood up to the Chinese Communist Party His sponsors at New York University cautioned Mr Chen to stay clear of a partisan minefield he did not understand I told Chen there was a presidential election coming up and he should spend a year studying the American political landscape before wading in said Jerome A Cohen a law professor and close confidant That advice friends say never really sank in and Mr Chen 41 has found himself enmeshed in controversy Backed by a coterie of conservative figures Mr Chen has publicly accused NYU of bowing to Chinese government pressure and prematurely ending his fellowship this summer The university says the fellowship was intended to be for only one year Some of those around Mr Chen also accuse the university of trying to shield him from conservative activists The sparring has grown fierce with NYU officials accusing one of those conservative activists Bob Fu the president of a Texasbased Christian group that seeks to pressure China over its religious restrictions of trying to track Mr Chen surreptitiously through a cellphone and a tablet computer  that Mr Fus organization donated to him The controversy kicked up by Mr Chens accusations against NYU has dismayed some of his supporters so much that a wealthy donor who had pledged to finance a threeyear visiting scholar position for him at Fordham University recently withdrew the offer That means Mr Chen who declined to be interviewed for this article and who returns to New York from a visit to Taiwan on Thursday has to line up another source of financing If that does not pan out he will be left with a single job offer from the Witherspoon Institute a conservative research organization in New Jersey that is perhaps best known for its opposition to samesex marriage and stem cell research The sniping has become a distraction from Mr Chens work pressuring Beijing but he is by no means the first Chinese activist to find his voice muted after arriving on American shores Since the late 1980s a long list of highprofile Chinese exiles who were granted refuge in the United States have found their work diminished or their reputations compromised Some like Chai Ling a student organizer during the Tiananmen Square protests who later embraced evangelical Christianity alienated many of her supporters by repeatedly suing the creators of a documentary that she says defamed her Wei Jingsheng who spent 18 years in Chinese prisons for his prodemocracy activism was feted by Congress and human rights groups after his arrival in 1997 but later became far less prominent after feuding with other activists You have to be a tough nut to be a dissident but those same qualities dont always serve them well outside China said Perry Link a professor at the University of California Riverside who has helped many Chinese exiles adapt to life in the United States Friends of Mr Chen say that he has been eager to solicit others advice but that he has often been swayed by the last person with whom he spoke Although they describe him as fiercely principled they say he may have overestimated his ability to navigate the partisan shoals of American domestic politics Chen often told me he had no interest in siding with the Democratic or Republican Party but that he was on the side of democracy and freedom said Hu Jia a Chinese dissident who frequently speaks with him on Skype I think that maybe he got in over his head Even before he landed at Newark Liberty International Airport last year veteran human rights advocates predicted a tug of war over Mr Chen and his superhero lan both among elected officials and the tangle of Chinese exile groups that often vie for attention and scarce financing John Kamm the director of the Dui Hua Foundation a San Franciscobased organization that advocates for Chinese political prisoners said at the time that the prospect of someone with Mr Chens profile coming to the United States was electrifying In the dissident community someone with his kind of stature doesnt come along every day Mr Kamm said shortly before Mr Chen arrived His face with those sunglasses is the kind of Che Guevaralike image you can stick on a Tshirt Among those most eager to stake a claim on Mr Chens celebrity was Mr Fu whose organization China Aid played a highprofile role in publicizing his long persecution at the hands of the local officials in Shandong Province which included nearly six years of jail and house arrest Most dramatically it was Mr Fu during a Congressional hearing convened by Representative Christopher H Smith Republican of New Jersey who held aloft the cellphone that allowed Mr Chen to plead for refuge in the United States as he recovered in a Beijing hospital from the injuries sustained during his escape Critics say Mr Fu overstated his own role in the audacious escape and then made use of Mr Chens story in fundraising appeals to his evangelical Christian supporters Those appeals sometimes cast Mr Chen as an opponent of abortion Despite his opposition to forced sterilizations and abortions Mr Chen has said he has no position on the divisive issue In an interview Mr Fu a former Chinese dissident who was granted asylum in the United States in 1997 waved off suggestions that he manipulated Mr Chen and turned him against his hosts at NYU To accuse me of brainwashing him with religious extremism totally underestimates Chens intelligence he said To be honest I think the NYU folks efforts to feed him information about how dangerous religious people are backfired and in the end he got fed up with them He saw we were not monsters Several people who worked closely with Mr Chen over the past year described an awkward pushandpull over Mr Chens affections that often pitted his advisers at NYU against Mr Fu and Mr Smith Shortly after Mr Chen arrived Mr Smith began pressing him to testify at a Congressional hearing that would have explored whether the Obama administration had nearly bungled Mr Chens bid to leave China for the United States Mr Chen eventually declined to participate in the hearing which never took place In those first few months friends say Mr Chen took the advice of Professor Cohen and others by turning down a number of appearances in Washington that could have suggested a partisan affiliation including an event sponsored by the Lantos Foundation for Human Rights and Justice named for Representative Tom Lantos a California Democrat who died in 2008 Mr Smith who did not respond to interview requests has sought to portray the interference by NYU as more aggressive In one instance last January Mr Smith told Reuters that his effort to meet alone with Mr Chen in his Washington office was interrupted by a translator he presumes was employed by NYU and who barged in and led Mr Chen away One of Mr Chens supporters has been Mark Corallo a Republican public relations consultant who was a spokesman for Attorney General John Ashcroft Mr Corallo who handled Mr Chens public accusations against NYU waved off accusations that his role in helping Mr Chen risked tainting the rights advocates nonpartisan bona fides This is a courageous man who has been the victim of oppression and frankly I think its incumbent upon every American to assist someone like him he said Mattie J Bekink a former NYU consultant who spent several months as Mr Chens translator and adviser disputed the accusations that NYU was pressured into abandoning him She also rejected the notion that the university sought to control him or limit his advocacy work Mr Chen was freely able to communicate and associate with whomever he chose she said In recent weeks as he traveled through Taiwan Mr Chen has parried questions from reporters who have asked him to elaborate on his accusations against NYU and whether he was worried the controversy might diminish his influence as an advocate for human rights in China But Mr Fu who said he continued to speak to him almost daily said Mr Chen was actively planning his next move after he vacates his NYU apartment in the coming weeks In an interview Mr Fu recounted a conversation the two had after Mr Chen met a Witherspoon Institute founder Robert P George a conservative Christian thinker Mr Chen he recalled said he was unbothered by the groups attacks on abortion and samesex parenting He told me Dont call them conservative They are principled And if they are willing to support the struggle for freedom then thats good enough for meÂ 
Marylandâ€™s Path to an Accord in Abortion Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/11/us/marylands-path-to-an-accord-in-abortion-fight.html,BALTIMORE  The 18yearold woman arrived at Johns Hopkins Hospital by medevac helicopter in critical condition Her uterus and bowel had been pierced during a lateterm abortion that had started in New Jersey and ended at an unmarked unregulated clinic in Elkton in northeastern Maryland The surgeons were able to repair the damage but they were appalled by the womans tale of a procedure that spanned two states a switch to an unfamiliar doctor who seemed to be learning on the job and a clinic unprepared for an emergency They reported the case to the state medical board That young womans ordeal in late 2010 led to new scrutiny that continues today for the clinic owner and doctor who had directed her abortion Steven C Brigham From a base in New Jersey Maryland officials learned Dr Brigham operated abortion clinics in several states and for two decades he had faced complaints of substandard care He had been barred from medical practice in Pennsylvania and New York  The near disaster in an Elkton mall led to something rare in this era of polarized abortion politics  sharply tightened oversight of Maryland abortion clinics that came into full force this year and won praise from both sides of the political divide The states first system of licensing and inspecting the clinics has already improved patient safeguards without imposing costly burdens defenders and opponents of abortion rights agree We were shocked with the findings in the Brigham case and we saw an important gap said Frances B Phillips who recently retired as Marylands deputy secretary for public health Onceobscure issues of clinic regulation are a new flash point in the abortion wars exemplified by the restrictive bill now moving through the Republicancontrolled Legislature in Texas on Wednesday passing in the House In addition to banning abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy the Texas bill in the name of safety would require all abortion clinics to meet the costly standards of ambulatory surgical centers which could force dozens of clinics to close  The bill which would also mandate that abortion doctors obtain admitting privileges at local hospitals is part of a wave of stringent rules on abortion facilities equipment and staffing in 29 states promoted by antiabortion groups that often cite the squalid practices of Dr Kermit Gosnell in Philadelphia who was convicted of murder this year If the goal is to make abortions as safe as possible the new Maryland rules  which were negotiated not by politicians but by health officials in consultation with medical groups clinic managers and antiabortion leaders  may offer a different path Dr Brigham who was not licensed to practice in Maryland had not even been required to notify the state health department when he set up the Elkton center to complete lateterm abortions after about the 14th week of pregnancy He initiated the procedures in New Jersey where he was not authorized to perform them then led his startled patients to Maryland where the abortions were completed Both sides realized we needed new rules Ms Phillips said But we kept the focus on patient safety The Maryland regulations are not as rigid as those in some states they do not dictate the width of hallways the size of janitors closets or the number of parking spaces outside Rather they look at the goal Is there a sound plan for example for rapid evacuation if a patient has a medical emergency The state also did not require abortion doctors to have local hospital admitting privileges a measure that threatens to shut down clinics in several states Officials concluded that in emergencies hospitals are best equipped to provide care anyway and the clinic doctor can advise the hospital staff without holding admitting privileges Under the new rules Dr Brigham would have been required to seek a clinic license before operating his center in Elkton and his procedures would have been scrutinized Maryland took a thoughtful approach that reflects a balance between ensuring access to service but also protecting public health said Heather Howard a former commissioner of the New Jersey Department of Health and Senior Services and now a lecturer at Princeton University A Safe Procedure Over All While the existence of abortion doctors with illegal or haphazard methods can never be ruled out the medical record for abortions in the United States indicates the procedure is quite safe over all Ten women died of abortionrelated causes out of 12 million procedures in 2010 according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention the number of deaths in 2009 was 12 For many years the death rate has hovered around one per 100000 procedures according to Dr David A Grimes a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of North Carolina School of Medicine and a former chief of abortion surveillance at the CDC Today having an abortion is safer than an injection of penicillin he said Risks rise with the length of a pregnancy with one death occurring for every one million abortions in the first 8 weeks one per 29000 at 16 to 20 weeks and one per 11000 in the small fraction of abortions performed at 21 weeks or more according to the Guttmacher Institute a research group that supports abortion rights Abortion opponents say complications and deaths are underreported They also list numerous examples of clinics and doctors who have been censured for poor emergency procedures or sanitation including Dr Brigham and they publicize patient deaths The Gosnell trial has pulled back the cloak of secrecy about what abortion clinics are really like said Charmaine Yoest the president of Americans United for Life which offers model laws for stringent clinic regulation Dr Gosnell was sentenced this year to life in prison for snipping the spines of babies born alive in illegal lateterm abortions in Pennsylvania But any suggestion that the doctors practices  live delivery in a filthy room  are widespread is not supported by evidence For at least the past two decades experts say it has been standard for doctors to make sure the fetus in the womb has no heartbeat before completing a lateterm abortion Former employees of an abortion doctor in Houston recently claimed that he too had killed babies when they emerged alive in lateterm abortions State officials are investigating Apart from any state rules that may exist about 400 medical facilities accounting for a majority of the countrys abortions are accredited by the National Abortion Federation a private group that has guidelines for equipment procedures and training It says it inspects its members every three to five years  Dr Gosnell was not caught earlier other clinic directors say because Pennsylvania did not enforce its existing rules failing to inspect his West Philadelphia clinic for more than 17 years Since his indictment in early 2011 the Pennsylvania Health Department has fired some officials and restarted inspections of clinics in the state But later that year the state legislature also adopted stringent rules requiring all surgical abortion clinics to meet the standards of ambulatory surgery centers There was a compelling public interest to make these clinics safe said State Representative Matthew E Baker a Republican Three clinics have closed and others have spent large sums to comply Elizabeth Barnes the executive director of the Philadelphia Womens Center called the 500000 that her clinic had to spend on new air systems ceilings and floors medically pointless As for the lessons of the Gosnell and Brigham cases Ms Barnes drew an opposite conclusion to Ms Yoests The more expensive and inaccessible that abortion becomes Ms Barnes said the more it creates a space for a Gosnell or a Brigham to operate Flouting Regulations Maryland officials are still trying to understand Dr Brighams role and legacy in the states abortion care In a recent email Dr Brigham 56 said It has always been my goal and desire to provide women with safe and appropriate medical care He blamed his tangles with the authorities in several states over the years on antiabortion bias and efforts by competing abortion providers to drive him out of business The continuing case of Dr Brigham is a cautionary one showing that a determined person working behind the anonymity of private corporations and moving among states can flout even strong medical regulations In 1992 facing an investigation for issues that have not been disclosed Dr Brigham signed an agreement with Pennsylvania that he would never practice medicine in the state In 1994 New York revoked his license concluding that he had been poorly trained had been duplicitous and had exhibited gross negligence in the care of lateterm abortion patients Dr Brigham works through a multistate network American Womens Services which since the 1990s has offered abortions in New Jersey Virginia Pennsylvania and Maryland where he had established four conventional openly advertised clinics apart from the nowvacant space in Elkton When Pennsylvania barred him from operating clinics in the state corporate ownership was transferred to his mother in Ohio But the issue that has landed Dr Brigham in trouble most often has been his repeated involvement in the far less common but more complicated second and thirdtrimester abortions Firsttrimester abortions which account for the large majority of procedures can be induced with drugs or completed quickly using a vacuum method But after about the 14th or 15th week of pregnancy as the fetus grows larger the procedures might take two or more days and require extracting the fetus with forceps or inducing delivery and they often require more anesthesia A few states including New Jersey have special rules governing abortions after 14 weeks limiting them to ambulatory surgery centers Texas already has similar limits for abortions after 16 weeks While Dr Brigham himself is no longer licensed to practice in any state several clinics he established in New Jersey and Virginia still operate and others in Pennsylvania and Maryland though now suspended by the state authorities are also listed on the American Womens Services Web site In New Jersey he had a license to practice in 2010 but neither he nor his clinics were authorized to perform second or thirdtrimester abortions Yet he offered them to New Jersey residents on his Web site The crisis at the Elkton clinic revealed New Jersey officials said how he tried to evade the law As he had with dozens of other patients over the previous months Dr Brigham began the young womans procedure at his clinic in Voorhees Township NJ initiating the cervical dilation of the woman who was 215 weeks pregnant and using a standard injection to kill the fetus The next morning he led the puzzled patient her mother and boyfriend along with two other patients in a car caravan 60 miles south across Delaware to the clinic in an unlabeled suite in Elkton There Dr Brigham advised Dr Nicola I Riley who had a Maryland license but limited experience in lateterm abortions as she administered anesthesia and began extracting the fetus It seemed like he was training her the patient later testified Soon Dr Riley testified she realized that she was tugging not on the fetus but on intestinal tissue indicating a potentially lifethreatening perforation of the patients uterus and damaged bowel After debating whether to call an ambulance she and Dr Brigham drove the ailing young woman to a nearby emergency room where doctors quickly determined that a medevac was necessary Once the Johns Hopkins doctors reported the case to the Maryland medical board Dr Rileys license was quickly suspended and later revoked for unprofessional conduct and concealing a felony conviction for fraud and larceny Evidence gathered in Elkton showed that Dr Brigham had over previous months completed abortions on fetuses past the 24week point of viability and in 2011 state prosecutors indicted him and Dr Riley on charges of murdering viable fetuses based on an untested legal theory But they dropped the charges when it appeared most likely that the fetal deaths had occurred inside the womb in New Jersey Dr Brigham defending himself before the New Jersey medical board said he believed he had not been violating state rules because he had not completed the abortions in the state The board disagreed and in late 2010 suspended his license to practice Dr Brigham has appealed Step in the Right Direction Maryland officials have determined that most abortion clinics in the state are safe and professionally run Nevertheless they have tried to devise a licensing regime to detect and prevent violations The idea is to take action before theres a problem said Dr Joshua M Sharfstein the states secretary of health and mental hygiene Maryland officials of Planned Parenthood a group leery of new regulations because in its view they are too often driven by politics called the states licensing rules reasonable and helpful Jeffrey D Meister the legislative director of Maryland Right to Life said that while his group supported even stronger surgicalcenter standards the new rules had brought important gains After 20 years of not having any regulations whatsoever it is a step in the right direction he said In their inspections so far this year Maryland officials found easily correctable sanitary and records violations in several clinics But after finding deficiencies in medical management that posed a serious and immediate danger to patients they suspended four clinics on May 9 that are now run by a company called Associates in ObGyn Care which was incorporated in 2010 The inspectors found poor emergency procedures the use of untrained staff members and other violations and the medical board suspended the licenses of two doctors with the company State health officials also found that the four suspended clinics had been established in the same locations years earlier by Dr Brigham and remained listed on the American Womens Services Web site The new regulations bar doctors who run afoul of state licensing rules as Dr Brigham had from operating abortion clinics Dr Brigham said in an email that Associates in ObGyn Care took control of the clinics in 2010 Neither he nor any family member shares in their ownership he said adding that the Web site of American Womens Services merely serves to advertise or provide referrals for clinics that might be owned by others Yet he appears to maintain ties with the four clinics Online real estate records examined by The New York Times indicate that corporations associated with Dr Brigham still own two of the clinic office spaces And Dr Brigham appears to have provided the doctors In a letter to legislators on June 25 Dr Sharfstein said an official of Associates in ObGyn Care after previously denying ties to Dr Brigham had admitted that Dr Brigham owns an entity that provides physician services to the facilities It has been a concern for us to learn that Dr Brigham is so involved with these centers especially after he denied it Dr Sharfstein said in an interview This is leading us to take another look at the regulations

Ready Access to Plan B Pills in City Schools,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/nyregion/in-new-york-schools-students-find-access-to-morning-after-pill.html,She was only 16 with big dreams  too young she thought to have a baby Yet she had had sex without protection and she could see those dreams evaporating Terrified she found her way to the basement of her school Abraham Lincoln High School in Brooklyn where the nurses office was tucked away First the nurse weighed her and checked her blood pressure Then she relayed the information to a doctor and made sure it was all right to give the girl Plan B OneStep the morningafter pill The nurse checked to see if the girls parents had returned the optout form that was supposed to have gone home at the beginning of the year They had not so she was free to take the pill Taking a pill out of a locked cabinet the nurse handed it over with a cup of water and waited for her to swallow it the girl recalled After that first time the girl took Plan B at school two or three more times She said her mother had not signed the optout form because she had wanted to have sex and so had never given it to her My mom she doesnt even know they have this stuff the girl a junior from Coney Island said Last month the Obama administration seemingly changed the landscape of access to emergency contraception across the country when in a reversal it agreed to allow the bestknown pill Plan B OneStep to become available to all ages without a prescription Until recently only those 17 and older could buy it over the counter But New York City had long ago come to an accommodation with the idea that girls as young as 13 or 14 should have easy access to the pill Through a patchwork of nurses offices and independent clinics operating in schools students can now get free emergency contraceptives like Plan B OneStep in more than 50 high school buildings generally in neighborhoods with high teenage pregnancy rates Girls needing the drug have been able to get it immediately under the supervision of doctors or nurse practitioners with prescribing ability School clinics began dispensing the pills several years ago and in the 201112 academic year alone about 5500 girls received them at school at least once according to the citys Department of Health and Mental Hygiene Most teens go to school Deborah Kaplan the departments assistant commissioner for maternal infant and reproductive health said explaining the citys decision to make Plan B available in schools as part of a bigger sex education campaign New York is not the only city to take Plan B right to teenagers similar schoolbased health centers either prescribe or administer the contraceptives in Baltimore Chicago Oakland Calif and all over Colorado among other places But New Yorks ambitious push on Plan B is striking in light of its history with contraceptives in schools Two decades ago a decision to distribute condoms in schools without parental consent was one of several controversial moves that ultimately cost Schools Chancellor Joseph P Fernandez his job Now Mayor Michael R Bloomberg has power over schools and his administration can make such decisions without public debate Even today however providing Plan B to minors remains a sensitive issue In the 13 schools where the contraceptives are handed out by a school nurse after phone consultation with a doctor parents must be notified of the program and given a chance to opt out a provision that originated with a court ruling related to the condom protests in the early 1990s In 40 schools where an independent provider which is typically a hospital or local health clinic provides the pills no parental consent is required Across the United States half of all schoolbased health clinics are prohibited from handing out any contraception including condoms by school district or state regulations or laws according to a survey by the SchoolBased Health Alliance based in Washington Critics of the use of the pill have argued that it encourages sexual activity among teenagers and that parents ought to thus have a strong say in whether their children should have access to it Teens who are otherwise going to think twice about sex are going to say This is always going to be available to meÂ  said Anna Higgins director of the Center for Human Dignity of the Family Research Council The moral and physical consequences to this premature sexual behavior are very real Ms Higgins added and they need to be addressed by the person who knows the child and who loves the child best which is the parent Only 3 percent of parents in the 13 schools sign the optout form according to the health department Dr Angela Diaz director of the Mount Sinai Adolescent Health Center which runs clinics in three Manhattan high schools where optout forms are not needed said some parents tacitly condoned the program because it was so hard to talk to their children about sex They wish that their kids would talk to them but given the reality theyre happy there is a place where they can be helped Dr Diaz said The student at Lincoln where optout forms are required was one of several who said in interviews that they had not given their parents the form because they wanted access to the pill Veronica Lewin a spokeswoman for the health department said the city gave parents several opportunities to decline participation We made a major effort to inform parents through mail student backpacks freshman orientation and parentteacher meetings she said The department did not respond when asked whether any students had needed or received treatment for side effects of Plan B like heavier menstrual bleeding nausea and abdominal pain It also would not give out more uptodate or detailed statistics on the Plan B program without a Freedom of Information Law request which is pending Citing privacy the health department would not allow a reporter to visit a school clinic In interviews outside some schools that offered Plan B many students described a sort of dont ask dont tell dtente with their parents and those who said they had received Plan B or other birth control at school asked for anonymity because they did not want their parents to know The Lincoln student from Coney Island said she had tried to get birth control from Coney Island Hospital before getting Plan B at school She saw the gynecologist then the hospital told her that she needed to come back again before getting a prescription I felt like they were stringing me along she said So she gave up She did not have money to get Plan B at the pharmacy and it was free and confidential at school After you have unprotected sex youre thinking about your future I wont be able to go to college What am I going to do the girl said A 17yearold from Fort Greene Brooklyn called the school nurse at Lincoln my new grandma She said she had taken Plan B less than five times this year She did not give her parents the optout form She said she had become pregnant twice after her mother had taken her birth control away Shes the reason I got pregnant the girl said She said the school nurse had helped her find abortions at a clinic and had set up an appointment for her to have an intrauterine device implanted The new federal rule will not change procedures in school nurses offices Under state regulation they cannot give out any medication even an aspirin without a physicians order The health department said it did not yet have statistics showing the effect of Plan B on local teenage pregnancy rates which have been declining in the city and across the country for more than a decade Based on her observations the Lincoln student from Fort Greene said she believed the program had reduced pregnancy at her school but had also made students more likely to have sex Most of the scientific evidence however suggests that making the morningafter pill available does not increase sexual activity according to a review of studies by James Trussell a professor of economics at Princeton and Dr Elizabeth G Raymond senior medical associate with Gynuity Health Projects a research organization that supports access to contraception and abortion But the pill also does not reduce pregnancy rates they concluded mainly because women who take it will often have unprotected sex a short while later and not take the pill They give a lot of reasons Dr Raymond said They say I forgot They say I just didnt think I would get pregnant Thats a big one At Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn a 17yearold junior from Crown Heights said she had taken Plan B at school three times this year Despite the threat of disease which is drilled into students during sex education courses she was less likely to use condoms because she knew she could get the morningafter pill she said Several girls at the school which has about 1100 students were pregnant during this school year  the most commonly cited number in interviews was four One junior from Brownsville said fear of pregnancy motivated her to ask for longterm contraception rather than relying on condoms and Plan B Besides she said school is not all yearround She said she had gotten Plan B once from the school nurse For her the best part of the program was the confidentiality Asked what her parents would do if they knew she was sexually active she said I cant even imagine to be honest I wont say rebellious teens but for teens who decide to do what they want to do they have this help she said Without it she added the consequences are very extreme
Stardust Memories,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/books/review/my-lunches-with-orson-and-ava-gardner-the-secret-conversations.html,The amateur magician and the magical beauty Their first names alone conjure a time when the words Hollywood and glamour still held hands Ava Gardner was essential to the Hollywood myth about itself as her friend Dirk Bogarde observed and so was Orson Welles Orson was his own greatest production as the Hollywood chronicler Peter Biskind writes and so was Ava Two new books  My Lunches With Orson and Ava Gardner The Secret Conversations  unearth vintage conversations with the stars in their final years when they were broke in bad health unable to get work and mourning their lost grandeur But oh what gorgeous wrecks they were and what mesmerizing stories they told these Sunset Boulevard Scheherazades Even washed up and so heavy and arthritic he had to use a wheelchair the 68yearold Welles knew he was more interesting than anyone else in Hollywood So he asked his pal Henry Jaglom an indie filmmaker to tape their lunch conversations at Ma Maison  with his illtempered toy poodle Kiki at the table  discussions that indolently roamed from chicken salad capers to chic romantic capers The tapes span 1983 to 1985 when Welles died of a heart attack with a typewriter in his lap writing a script they languished in a shoe box for years until Biskind learned about them in the 1990s and started bugging Jaglom to transcribe and publish them In 1988 living on her own in London recovering from a couple of strokes and fearing she had pulmonary emphysema Gardner asked the British journalist Peter Evans to ghostwrite her memoir She had no money and didnt want to sell the jewels that Frank Sinatra Howard Hughes and other famous men had lavished on her Pretty damn soon she frets to Evans theres gonna be no corn in Egypt baby Both books make you feel as if youre eavesdropping the one about Ava in a more invasive way Unlike the chummy rambling chats between Welles and Jaglom Gardner was in a constant tug of war with Evans agonizing in vinous 3 am phone calls as he surreptitiously took notes about whether she really wanted strangers digging around in my panties drawer Watching this Venus ply her mind games sensuality and stubborn will on Evans its easy to imagine what it was like to be a love object jerked on her marionette strings in her prime You wouldnt have a chance You can sum up my life in a sentence honey she tells Evans in her throaty voice She made movies she made out and she made a [expletive] mess of her life But she never made jam Some of the colorful stories Welles tells have appeared elsewhere with sharper aperus But what makes Lunches With Orson appealing is the piquancy of the much younger skinnier actor and director taking on the Sisyphean job of reviving the Falstaffian outcast  a mitzvah another Welles interviewer and acolyte Peter Bogdanovich didnt bother with Welles thought when Bogdanovich was on top Even maudlin Welles and Gardner are magnificent A lot of booze has flowed under the bridgework Ava says Both hit the big time as teenagers Boy Genius and Girl Vamp landing Time covers in their 20s They had in common a bawdy honesty a desire to shock and a lust for living extravagantly The lion and lioness in winter are poignant The cosmopolitan man who made Citizen Kane could not get financing to make a movie The greeneyed woman who dazzled in Technicolor in The Barefoot Contessa was drinking smoking coughing and listening to old SinatraTommy Dorsey recordings that Sinatra sent her after her strokes Whod have thought the highlight of my day is walking the dog dryly notes Gardner who once danced all night and then began drinking Dom Prignon in the studio makeup room at 5 am I miss Frank she says even the fights She knows he will outlive her Bastards are always the best survivors When Richard Burton walks up to Welless table at Ma Maison to humbly ask if Elizabeth Taylor can come over and say hi Orson brusquely brushes them off even though he had been entranced by Taylor as a child when they were both in Jane Eyre Pointing to his pug nose  which he elongated with fake noses in Citizen Kane and Jane Eyre  Welles explains to Jaglom You have to do something to let them know that youre not just a little creature You have to be the ruler of the forest People want me to be Orson Welles They want the dancing bear show If hes that insecure Jaglom asks why does he seem so sure of himself Yes Im sure of myself Welles replies but Im not sure of anybody else Avas dancing bear shows have a tinge of Norma Desmond When the 65yearold first met Evans at her apartment she appeared clad only in a towel At another point unable to trust any man she couldnt seduce she kissed the married writer and then told a friend he put the moves on her She was a vamp with ire devouring and brawling with lovers and coming alive at dusk when she was drinking If anyone tried to possess me  oh boy I was outta there she says The woman once promoted as the worlds most beautiful animal mulls euthanasia Actors get older she sighs Actresses get old But she was proud of being a survivor Life doesnt stop because youre no longer a beauty or desirable she muses You just have to make adjustments Although Id be lying to you if I told you that losing my looks is no big deal It hurts goddamn it it hurts like a sonofabitch Partially paralyzed on her left side she was nervous about meeting a suit as she called Dick Snyder the head of Simon  Schuster who was interested in buying the memoir Ive got more lines on my face than Lana Turner she worried the day before Snyder was set to visit her Knightbridge flat She instructed Evans to call Jack Cardiff the British cinematographer who had worked with Ava at her most delectable in Pandora and the Flying Dutchman and The Barefoot Contessa That afternoon Evans writes the worlds finest cinematographer rearranged the lamps in her drawing room  and placed a key light above the chair on which shed sit for her meeting with Snyder The next day Gardner sat under her key light which cast the frozen side of her face into shadow and beguiled Elizabeth Taylor is not beautiful she is pretty Ava informs Snyder I was beautiful Evanss agent wanted him to verify with Ava a ribald line attributed to her about Frank Sinatras being a bantamweight but not where it counted Asked about it she dismisses the line as vile and smut But its hard to know what is a true reflection and what is theatrical As Jaglom notes of Welles the selfmythologizing is reminiscent of the funhouse mirrors in the climactic scene of the film noir The Lady From Shanghai which Welles made with his wife at the time Rita Hayworth Ava the daughter of a sharecropper recalled a charmed childhood in a house in Grabtown NC with no electricity running water or indoor bathroom She tells Evans that madness booze and depression ran in her family Her older sister Bappie moved to Hollywood with her to look after MGMs 18yearold hillbilly starlet as Evans calls her and chaperoned her first dates with Mickey Rooney Although the RooneyGardner romance always seemed incongruous Ava speaks of the 5foot2 Rooney fondly noting that he went through the ladies like a hot knife through fudge Andy Hardy wined and dined the shy gauche starlet with the thick Tarheel accent at Chasens Ciros the Coconut Grove and Don the Beachcomber He stood up to Louis B Mayer to marry her and taught his virgin bride how much she liked sex In bed she says Ive always known I was on safe ground They laughed a lot in bed and she kept up a dalliance while they were getting a divorce Mickey held on to his little black book and Ava punished him by mocking him as a midget but as soon as they split Howard Hughes was ringing her doorbell Or rather the guy who checked out his dates was She called the owner of TWA a lowkey guy sexually yet an insanely jealous control freak She said he was bigoted and never really aware of his personal hygiene even then but she thought he had plenty of guts He lavished her with jewels furs limos planes and a Caddie The relationship was of course volatile One night Howard dislocated Avas jaw and Ava nearly put a lily in his hand by throwing an onyx ashtray at his head There was blood everywhere Ava recalls even real blood in the Bloody Marys Following her friend Lana Turner again as she did by getting involved with Rooney and Hughes she married Lanas ex Artie Shaw an autocratic autodidact who constantly put her down I lost complete confidence in myself she said adding I got drunk because I was so insecure In a year he dumped her for the author of Forever Amber which she had been reading to improve her mind Then she went to what a friend called the University of Sinatra where the pair were kissing the bottle drinking martinis in big Champagne glasses with Scotch and bourbon chasers making woopoo and scrapping and making up They shot up a California town with 38s She had an abortion He got fired by MGM and had cryforhelp feints with suicide including overdoses and firing a gun into a pillow to scare her while she was in the next room As they waited for his divorce to Nancy to come through she punished him by telling him about a fling with a bullfighter which drove him nuts Sinatra always said that when people looked at them as a couple every guy wanted to be him and every girl wanted to be her But it doesnt sound so great from the inside She visited Frank when he was playing to halfempty houses in Italy I had to have been in love with him to sit through those performances she recalls Lets say he was not at his best She adds He did a record with Harry James that was so bad I cried when I heard it I couldnt listen to it with him Frank was in a downward spiral as Mr Gardner Poor baby I was the star in the ascendancy and he was on his ass No matter what I did his having to rely on a woman to foot some of the bills  most of them actually  made it all so much worse Ava disputes stories that the Mafia was taking care of Frank The socalled Family was nowhere to be seen when he needed them she says She says they were too much alike Bappie told her she was Frank in drag Lana warned Ava not to marry him but Ava explains that you dont pay much attention to what other people tell you when a guys good in the feathers She says the song he helped write the year they were married epitomized their relationship  Im a Fool to Want You I tried to be a good wife she tells Evans I tried to be any kind of wife the plain fact is I just wasnt meant to ride off into the sunset and live happily ever after Asked if she regretted not having kids she replies wearily How many people do you know who havent made mistakes in their lives whove lived completely without vices baby She may have missed fighting with Frank but not with George C Scott When he was loaded he would beat her and the next morning Id be lying next to him blackandblue and bleeding and he couldnt remember a thing She dropped Evans as a collaborator when she learned that he hadnt told her that Sinatra sued and won a settlement and apology for a statement Evans made on a BBC show repeating speculation that Frank got the Maggio role in From Here to Eternity thanks to the Mafia Evans conjectures that Frank who made a pact with Ava when they were together not to write their memoirs must have given her the amount she would have earned from the book She later produced a bowdlerized version of her life with another writer After she was pushing clouds around to use her phrase Evans got permission from her former manager now in charge of her estate to print their conversations although you can imagine Ava turning the air blue with a savage diatribe at that reversal of her wishes Evans himself died last year as he was finishing the book Welles born in Kenosha Wis to an inventor and a pianist got off to a fast start forsaking a chance to go to Harvard for the theater Then came War of the Worlds his radio simulation of a Martian invasion in New Jersey that panicked millions of Americans Citizen Kane which lost RKO 150000 after William Randolph Hearst forced the movie into smaller independent venues and The Magnificent Ambersons which got butchered by RKO after Welles abruptly left for Brazil before he finished editing the picture The movie flopped and as Biskind notes in the introduction to My Lunches With Orson Welles never entirely recovered his footing He used his rolling thunder voice to find acting work Welles was pretty much washed up The Third Man had become the Forgotten Man He was making ends meet with ads roasts and talk shows  reading Shakespeare on Johnny Carson  when the new wave of hot 70s filmmakers came along They venerated him Biskind writes as the avatar of an auteur Jaglom showed up at the Plaza Hotel in New York to ask Welles to be in his first movie A Safe Place which didnt even have a script Welles answered the door in purple silk pjs looking Jaglom recalled like this huge grape Jaglom won over the imperious grape by asking him to play a magician Can I wear a cape Welles asked Welles generously helped Jaglom with his films and Jaglom sweetly became Welless de facto agent and ego fluffer Ive lost my girlish enthusiasm Welles told Jaglom wearily noting at another point that they always want earthshattering from me Welles who had made films of Macbeth and Othello and Chimes at Midnight about Falstaff and Prince Hal talks a lot about his struggle to get financing from Europeans to make a movie of King Lear Shakespeare was clearly tremendously feminine he says Every man who is any kind of artist has a great deal of female in him They all want to have dinner with me but when it comes time to fork over the money they disappear Welles says Its always the same thing Im unmanageable I walk away from films before theyre finished et cetera et cetera et cetera So boring Jaglom fields an offer for Welles to do a guest shot on Love Boat and gets him a contract to play the voice of God in a John TravoltaOlivia NewtonJohn movie Welles whinges that John Gielgud and his old partnerturnednemesis John Houseman are getting rich off commercials Meanwhile he has lost his gig with Paul Masson rumbling We will sell no wine before its time after mentioning on a talk show that he had slimmed down by giving up wine If Wesson Oil would let me say that Wesson Oil is good instead of Houseman Id be delighted he complains but nobody will take me for a commercial not even for radio Welles wrote a script for a political movie called The Big Brass Ring about an older gay Roosevelt political adviser who mentors a young Kennedyesque senator The tireless Jaglom finally got the producer Arnon Milchan to agree to give Welles 8 million and final cut if he could get one of seven Alist actors to play the senator Welles and Jaglom break open some Cristal because Orson knows that many of the top actors revere him But one by one they all turn him down even his friend Warren Beatty who was exhausted from Reds and Jack Nicholson who refused to reduce his salary Every no hurts me more than I let on Welles admits He wasnt interested in Dustin Hoffman no dwarfs or Robert De Niro I really dont see De Niro carrying Kansas He says little about his ex Rita Hayworth except that she didnt like to go out He dishes about how he cant stand Woody Allens therapeutic movies how he loved his old girlfriend Dolores Del Rios underwear how Thalberg was Satan how he enjoyed John Wayne and other Hollywood rightwingers because they were nicer than leftwingers how Kate Hepburn talked candidly about having sex with Howard Hughes how Bogie told him while filming Casablanca that it was the worst movie hed ever been in how the Hollywood moguls ignored a girl he was dating named Marilyn Monroe until she hit it big and how much he admired Carole Lombard a beauty who behaved like a waitress in a hash house Both Welles and Gardner pushed racial boundaries in Hollywood Ava posed with Sammy Davis Jr for what she recalls was an Ebony Christmas cover making Sinatra jealous Welles dated Lena Horne and told Hedda Hopper to go boil her head when she advised him to stop Welles cheerfully admits to being a hypocrite sellout and racist offering impishly outlandish views Sardinians for example have stubby little fingers he says Bosnians have short necks He loves Hungarians to the point of sex but considers the Irish mean citing Spencer Tracy as an example He thought of running for the Senate in 1952 because he said I have all the equipment to be a politician Total shamelessness He confesses that he believes everything bad he reads about himself and that he has no faith in posterity I dont think whats good he says is necessarily recognized in the long run Yet Citizen Kane abides And so does Orson Welles

North Carolina House Passes New Restrictions on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/us/north-carolina-house-passes-new-restrictions-on-abortion.html,Legislation that would impose new restrictions on abortion clinics moved out of the North Carolina House of Representatives on Thursday in a form that would give wide power to Gov Pat McCrorys administration The bill became the focus of battling factions in the Republican Party this week with a series of public legislative debates and backroom maneuvering over how to create new limits that would appeal to the governor who is a Republican Mr McCrory threatened to veto a Senate measure that would have required doctors to be present for all doses of abortion drugs and force clinics that perform abortions to meet standards similar to those of an ambulatory surgical center Opponents said such restrictions would force most of North Carolinas abortion clinics to close Under the House proposal which has yet to be considered by the Senate the states Department of Health and Human Services would have the authority to apply any requirement imposed on ambulatory surgical centers to abortion clinics if the regulations do not impede access to abortion care  The bill also requires a doctor to be present during the first dose of a drug to induce abortion Mr McCrory took office in January after promising he would not support any new curbs on abortion access After he expressed his displeasure with the Senate plan his administration helped House lawmakers craft one he would support members of the House said Thursday North Carolina is the latest state to try to tighten abortion rules by adding new mandates for practitioners  Wisconsins governor last week signed into law a measure forcing abortion doctors to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals a requirement similar to those Alabama Mississippi and Tennessee have tried to implement since 2012 Alabamas Mississippis and Wisconsins laws have been suspended by judges The Texas Senate will consider a similar bill Friday In North Carolina Representative Ruth Samuelson a Republican said her proposal was about safeguarding women not stemming access This is really all about protecting the health and safety of women Ms Samuelson said We are not out here trying to shut down every abortion clinic in North Carolina But Democrats hamstrung by Republican control of both legislative chambers and the governors office worried that by ceding regulatory power to an executive department Mr McCrorys administration would enjoy broad authority over the rules that govern abortions This can still close clinics in North Carolina depending on what the department decides to do said Representative Jean FarmerButterfield  Although the legislature has supported other bills about abortion this year the debate intensified July 2 when Senate Republicans made a surprise move and amended an unrelated bill to include their recommended restrictions and passed the measure all within 24 hours The Senates conduct drew widespread condemnation Mr McCrory criticized the body and House Republicans ultimately chose to pursue their own proposal  The vote on Thursday came after an emotional public hearing this week part of a procedure that Ms Samuelson said yielded more debate and more opportunity for change and discussion and correction than if we had followed the normal process But Representative Rick Glazier a Democrat decried the Houses version as a rewrite by moonlight and said it was symbolic of the legislatures rightward tilt since Republicans took complete control of North Carolinas government To an extreme legislative majority bent on eliminating the right to choice everything looks like a health regulation ready to be used and abused to dismantle access to that choice Mr Glazier said
"Texas Democrats, Seeking Resurgence, May Struggle for Footing in 2014",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/12/us/texas-democrats-seeking-resurgence-may-struggle-for-footing-in-2014.html,When Gov Rick Perry a Republican announced this week that he would retire from statewide politics after more than a dozen years at the helm a cheer went up in the office of the Dallas County Democratic Party Somebody said Lets have a partyÂ  said Darlene Ewing the chairwoman of the group When youve got 12 of the worst years in the history of Texas its time to celebrate the ending of it  So a soiree was planned complete with party hats cake and drinks But when the last piece of cake is polished off and the final toasts are made Texas Democrats may not be much better off politically than they were before the invitations went out Some political observers argue that the Democrats could be worse off now that they have lost their favorite piata  The leading contender to succeed Mr Perry Attorney General Greg Abbott also a Republican is every bit as conservative as the governor But Mr Abbott who is expected to declare his candidacy on Sunday does not carry the baggage that Mr Perry accumulated during an often tumultuous tenure in the governors office  not to mention Mr Perrys gaffeplagued presidential run last year Mark P Jones a political scientist at Rice University said that 2014 is looking like yet another blowout year for Republicans which means more dashed Democratic hopes of turning Texas blue or even gaining a statewide toehold Democrats have not won a statewide office since 1994  Democrats were going to lose every statewide race in 2014 with Rick Perry running and they are going to lose in 2014 without him running Mr Jones said If a Democrat does poorly this sends a signal to the national Democratic Party that the blue food in Texas isnt ready to pick Rice University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune  Hopes of a Democratic resurgence in Texas soared after this years first special session when State Senator Wendy Davis Democrat of Fort Worth helped stop an abortion bill with a filibuster and an assist from protesters who disrupted the proceedings with their screams  It was a temporary victory the Republicanled Legislature is on the verge of passing the same legislation in a second special session  But the fight energized the moribund Democrats and activists are urging Ms Davis to run for governor next year She would face long odds against Mr Abbott who has a huge war chest and support from the same Republican grassroots machinery that propelled Mr Perry to one victory after another Democrats might also lose Ms Daviss hardfought Senate seat the only one seen as competitive under the current district maps if she were to give it up to run for governor In an interview in her office at the Capitol this week Ms Davis said it was a privilege to be mentioned as a possible candidate for governor Wearing a bright orange dress the unofficial color of the abortionrights protesters Ms Davis said she would be very disappointed if Democrats did not field a serious candidate for governor I dont know whether its me but I do think its terribly important that we have a general election dialogue and debate she said I really do particularly because this is an open seat now and it just brings a new opportunity for those sorts of conversations She said she would decide in the next few weeks whether to run If she does not run it is hard to imagine another Texas Democrat with the same stardom and fundraising potential who could step up Texas has ambitious Democrats like Mayor Julin Castro of San Antonio his twin brother United States Representative Joaquin Castro of San Antonio State Senator Kirk Watson of Austin and United States Representative Marc Veasey of Fort Worth But none of them has signaled a desire to run statewide in 2014  Given the beating that Democrats have taken over the last two decades it is no surprise that they are staying out of the ring Still if no serious Democratic contender jumps in next year the party will have given a pass to Republicans at a time of upheaval up and down the ballot For the first time in several years most of the major statewide offices will have no incumbent Texas voters last saw an open contest for governor in 1990 when Ann Richards beat Clayton Williams a Republican in a race the party had been favored to win The last open contest before that was in 1968 when two Democratic titans President Lyndon Johnson and Gov John Connally stepped aside Tanene Allison a spokeswoman for the Texas Democratic Party said that right now the party was focused on the current special session  The crucial thing to be paying attention to right now is standing up for womens rights Ms Allison said As we move beyond a legislative focus we will pivot more so onto the campaign and making public announcements for candidates in the coming months In the meantime a group of former organizers for President Obama has started Battleground Texas a highprofile effort to make the state competitive again On paper Texas is ripe for a Democratic challenge It is the only reliably Republican state where minorities outnumber whites and a recent study found it had the lowest voter turnout in the country in 2010 Estimates have also shown that 40 percent or more of the growing Hispanic population which has traditionally favored Democrats is not registered to vote  Many longtime Democratic operatives are urging candidates and voters to look past the conventional wisdom Last year in Missouri Representative Todd Akin a Republican was considered a safe bet as he challenged Senator Claire McCaskill a Democrat who was seen as endangered But after Mr Akins comments about legitimate rape he lost in by a healthy margin Texas history is littered with upsets In 1978 the states popular attorney general John Hill beat the incumbent governor Dolph Briscoe in the Democratic primary The election came at a time when Democrats dominated Texas politics in the way that Republicans do now and Mr Hill seemed such a shooin for the general election that people began calling him Governor Hill But the wealthy oilman Bill Clements beat him and became the first Republicanelected Texas governor since Reconstruction Glenn W Smith a Democratic consultant and former aide to Ms Richards said it would be folly for Democrats to sit on the sidelines at a time when so many opportunities have opened up  If Democrats sit and wait for a safe bet at some date in the future that date will never come Mr Smith said Theyve got to make it happen
Bright Young Things,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/books/review/adelle-waldmans-love-affairs-of-nathaniel-p.html,The data are in All precincts have reported Its official men suck At least when it comes to relationships they do Men are sexobsessed and selfabsorbed shallow callow capricious and cruel I wouldnt date us if we were one of the last two genders on earth Consider Exhibit A The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P a smart engaging 21stcentury comedy of manners in which the debut novelist Adelle Waldman crawls convincingly around inside the head of one Nathaniel Nate Piven Nate is like a jigsaw puzzle you find in the closet at a rented beach house no matter how nice the picture on the box at some point after youve invested way too much time you are going to realize that key pieces are missing Empathy Selfawareness Part of that vast herd of young writers roaming the Brooklyn bars and coffee shops Nate is in his element talking smart to some woman on a Christmaslighted fire escape In this familiar Girls world Waldman would seem to suggest most of the sexual power still resides with the boys A journalist by training Waldman may not be breaking news here but she does show herself to be a promising novelist and a savvy observer of human nature Compared with his boorish friends Nate isnt a bad guy In fact to borrow from Dashiell Hammett he might just be worse than bad hes half good The product of a postfeminist 1980s childhood and politically correct 1990s college education Nate has we are told a functional and frankly rather clamorous conscience Yet we meet him at a particularly telling moment Late for an exgirlfriends party he bumps into another ex one he hasnt seen since the day of her abortion  Waldman employing that classic literary device the unreliable narrators condom It was no ones fault he thinks in the first of many impressive displays of generosity toward himself Nates ability to pat his own back is such that you worry about his clavicles Not only did he pay for the abortion he accompanied her there and took her home in a taxi Clearly he had done everything that could have been expected of him Still twinged with guilt for not calling Nate touches his thick hair  It always reassured him a little He tells the woman It was great to see you And you do look great But Ive really got to go Mind you this happens on Page 2 The case against Nate feels settled maybe even ginned up Its to Waldmans credit then that she uses this strawman setup to go deeper and pose an interesting question Is it fair to expect better from an intelligent evolved man The variable in this thought experiment arrives in the form of Hannah a thin pertbreasted writer Nate meets at his exs party After some dinner chatter about the essay on outsourcing guilt that Nate is writing Hannah continues their conversation via email which Nate sees as an overt invitation Dickens this child labor that Even if she werent offering outright sexual favors she was in a sense doing just that This is the pattern of dialogue in The Love Affairs of Nathaniel P with its long comically earnest discussions both internal and external of the commodification of conscience followed by an assessment of some womans nice rack You will cringe like a middleschool teacher whenever two boys are alone You got there first and Go for it and Id do her Such fratchat makes Waldmans point  perhaps the point of all comedies of manners  that behind even the most complex malefemale interactions are the same old boygirl banalities The book is fairly quiet about boyboy and girlgirl

"Texas Democrats, Energized, Face Hurdles in Turning a Red State Blue",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/politics/texas-democrats-energized-by-abortion-fight-face-hurdles-trying-to-turn-a-red-state-blue.html,AUSTIN Tex  State Senator Wendy Daviss marathon filibuster against new abortion restrictions in Texas ended two weeks ago but the enthusiasm she has ignited among Democrats was still going strong on a steamy morning here this week Ms Davis the Fort Worth teenage mother turned Harvard Law graduate won rapturous applause at a news conference this week in support of abortion rights that quickly took on the feel of a rally outside the Texas Capitol StandWithWendy and StandWithTXWomen read the signs of some of the 150 attendees using the Twitter hashtags that rocketed across the Internet when she stood on the floor of the Senate for 11 hours during a special session and in the weeks since Its going to fastforward political change Cecile Richards the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America predicted of the impact of abortion legislation But in the short term women are going to suffer The bill Ms Davis sought to block will soon be passed but that is not the only comedown liberals here will have to contend with in the months to come Texas Democrats moribund for a generation look at the response to the senator and the inexorable changing face of the state on the horizon and find reasons for optimism Yet for all the energy that Ms Davis 50 has injected into her party and before that all the chatter about the impact of Texas shifted demographics on the states politics Democrats face a daunting challenge in trying to win the governorship next year The problem Texas is still a very conservative state Ask Democrats in Austin if they can win the governors race next fall and the answers betray that reality Euphemisms like longterm process and nothing happens overnight are uttered as standins for a simple affirmative reply Democrats have not won the governorship for nearly a quartercentury not since Ms Richardss mother Ann was elected in 1990 They have not captured any statewide office since 1994 Next year they will most likely face Attorney General Greg Abbott a Republican who already has more than 20 million in the bank And as they always do when there is a Democrat in the White House they will have to walk a tightrope between distancing themselves from an unpopular president and not angering their proObama base What makes 2014 even trickier for Democrats is that the woman who has become the mosttalkedabout new figure on the national political scene may not even want to run for governor Ms Davis faces a difficult decision harness the enthusiasm she has won and make a bid for the states top job or stand for reelection and bide her time until the demographics are more favorable and the White House is no longer home to a liberal unpopular in her state The broader challenge for Democrats here is how to keep the spirits of local activists high and the wallets of national donors open without setting them up for a letdown Theres an opportunity that didnt exist before Ms Davis said in an interview She was referring to what she sees as the opening for Democrats but she could have been talking about her own prospects  Ms Davis is enjoying not only a burst of national attention but also a renewed pride among female activists who see her as a potential heir to Ann Richards who died in 2006 Annies List a state group dedicated to electing Democratic women announced this week that they were giving Ms Davis 50000 ostensibly for her reelection  The senator declined to say what her plans are for next year if she runs for governor or another statewide office she would need to relinquish her Senate seat A debate has already begun among Democrats about whether she and the party would be better served with her running for governor pursuing a statewide office downballot or running for reelection I think Wendy might could run for lieutenant governor said Ben Barnes a former lieutenant governor himself I know people are calling to say Wendy should run for governor But I dont think Wendy would get many more votes than Tony Sanchez or Bill White got Mr Sanchez and Mr White were both were defeated by Gov Rick Perry Mr Sanchez received 40 percent in 2002 and Mr White won 42 percent in 2010 Texas is still a Republican state Mr Barnes said But Mr Barnes now a lobbyist who splits his time between Washington and Austin predicts Ms Davis will face intense pressure to run for governor noting that he has already received emails from Democratic donors in money hubs like New York Washington and San Francisco eager to hold fundraisers for the partys new star That is music to the ears of Texas Republicans Im sure they have some slick presentations that resonate with donors in California and New York but this is Texas and their message doesnt match the values of an overwhelming majority of Texas voters said Rob Johnson an Austinbased Republican strategist and a former top aide to Mr Perry If Ms Davis were to run for a lowerticket race the race might not be as easily turned into a referendum on the Obama administration The most recent statewide poll has the presidents job approval rating among independents at 37 percent Mr Abbott has spent much of his time in recent years tangling with the Obama administration and Republicans here are already highlighting those legal battles  Given the prevailing political winds nationally and in Texas hes positioned himself perfectly for 2014 a resolute conservative and fearless fighter of perceived DC overreach Justice Don R Willett of the Texas Supreme Court a former Abbott aide said of the attorney general  Any Democrat running in Texas has to overcome the national Democrat label said Matt Angle a longtime Democratic operative and former chief of staff to a Texas congressman A key to Democratic growth party leaders say is bolstering the political power of the states Latinos who make up 38 percent of the states 251 million people There are 21 million eligible Hispanics not registered to vote and another 13 million Hispanics who didnt participate in 2010 said State Representative Trey Martinez Fischer a San Antonio Democrat who is widely seen as eyeing statewide office So Id like to see those 34 million voters get in the discussion like weve done with women and then I think Texas becomes a more aggressive proposition Jeremy Bird aims to help that cause Mr Bird was Mr Obamas national field director last year and has spent much of his time devoted to an organization called Battleground Texas which is trying to build the Democratic infrastructure to make the state competitive from the presidency on down the ballot  eventually The immediate challenge of course is recruiting solid candidates to maintain momentum Its about bringing fundamental change here and that means starting in 2014  but its not all about 2014 said State Senator Kirk Watson of Austin the chairman of the Senate Democratic Caucus Asked directly if a Democrat could win the governors race Mr Watson who lost the attorney general race to Mr Abbott in 2002 started and stopped his sentence before settling on We have the ability to win next years governors race But then he offered an addendum I cant predict for certain a Democrat will win in 2014
Lawmakers in Ireland Pass Limited Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/world/europe/lawmakers-in-ireland-pass-limited-abortion-bill.html,DUBLIN  Abortion will be allowed in the Republic of Ireland for the first time following a parliamentary vote to legalize the termination of pregnancies in cases where there is a real and substantial risk to the life of the mother including the threat of suicide The highly contentious Protection of Life During Pregnancy Bill 2013 was passed by 127 votes to 31 early on Friday morning but only after its expected passage was delayed by almost two days of intense debate The outcome has failed to satisfy either side of this divisive issue I am filled with a deep sadness Maria Steen a representative of the Iona Institute a Catholic lobby group said after the vote I find it very distressing that our political representatives have created a regime that allows for the direct killing of babies  Advocates of more liberal rules on abortion argued that the law does not go far enough Richard Boyd Barrett of the Independent Socialist party described the bill as a sham We are going to be back here again because you have not vindicated the rights of women he said during the parliamentary debate on the issue The new law does not allow abortion in cases of incest rape fetal abnormality or where there is no prospect of survival outside the womb Prochoice supporters argue that thousands of Irish women will continue to travel to England every year for abortions Under the restrictive legislation one doctor will be required to sanction an abortion in the case of a medical emergency two in cases where there is a physical threat to the life of the pregnant woman and three  including either an obstetrician or gynecologist and two psychiatrists  where there may be a risk of suicide In championing the legislation Enda Kenny Irelands prime minister was careful to walk the tightrope between the factions insisting it merely brought legal clarity for doctors and medical practitioners rather than change He faced down the Catholic Church and a vigorous campaign by prolife groups  including letters written in blood  but also refused pleas to broaden the criteria for terminations in Ireland During a parliamentary address on the issue he separated his personal faith from his duty as a legislator Mr Kenny made support for the bill mandatory among his party members warning that anyone who opposed it would not have the organizations support at the next general election  a virtual kiss of death for any political career In the event only five members voted against The legislation codifies a 1992 Supreme Court ruling that allows abortion in certain limited circumstances something successive governments had avoided despite repeated demands for action from the European Court of Human Rights among others The impetus for the bill followed the tragic death last October of Savita Halappanavar a young Indian dentist who was resident in Ireland She died of septicemia after she was repeatedly denied an abortion during miscarriage while she was 17 weeks pregnant because Irish medical guidelines did not allow a termination while there was a fetal heartbeat Her death infuriated the public and damaged Irelands reputation abroad emboldening the Government to finally bring the law into line with the Supreme Court ruling The bill will now go to a vote in the upper house but its passage is regarded as a formality because the government has a large majority It must then be signed by President Michael D Higgins before being passed into law  In theory he could refer it to the Supreme Court but this is considered highly unlikely
Texas Senate Debates Bill Restricting Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/13/us/politics/texas-senate-begins-debate-on-bill-restricting-abortions.html,AUSTIN  The Texas Senate on Friday afternoon began discussion of a bill championed by Gov Rick Perry that has become a focus of the nations battle over abortion rights The bill which is expected to get a vote for final passage after todays deliberations would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and hold abortion clinics to the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers and also require doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at local hospitals Supporters of the bill say that the strengthened requirements for the clinics and doctors would protect womens health opponents argue that the restrictions are actually intended to put financial pressure on the clinics and will force many of them to shut their doors The bang of Lt Gov David Dewhursts gavel sounded against a background of jeers and chants from outside the chamber Proponents of the bill dressed in blue and opponents wearing orange crowded into every level of the Capitol building including the basement An earlier version of the bill made it to the Senate at the end of June when an 11hour filibuster by State Senator Wendy Davis a Democrat from Fort Worth stalled it past the mandatory deadline of the special legislative session Governor Perry called for a second special session and told lawmakers to get back to work on the bill It passed the House this week and so will land on the governors desk if the Senate passes it After House passage Mr Perry said the Senate continues its important work in support of womens health and protecting the lives of our most vulnerable Texans A filibuster or other parliamentary maneuver to sidetrack the bill is highly unlikely this time the mandatory end of the session is weeks away making a filibuster physically impossible Senator Davis has said that she does not intend to filibuster it again Although the debate could continue into Saturday and even beyond many observers here expect the Senate to come to a vote sometime today perhaps late in the evening A legal challenge to the new law is expected
Texas Senate Approves Strict Abortion Measure,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/us/texas-abortion-bill.html,AUSTIN Tex  The Texas Senate gave final passage on Friday to one of the strictest antiabortion measures in the country legislation championed by Gov Rick Perry who rallied the Republicancontrolled Legislature late last month after a Democratic filibuster blocked the bill and intensified already passionate resistance by abortionrights supporters The bill would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and hold abortion clinics to the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers among other requirements Its supporters say that the strengthened regulations for the structures and doctors will protect womens health opponents argue that the restrictions are actually intended to put financial pressure on the clinics that perform abortions and will force most of them to shut their doors Mr Perry applauded lawmakers for passing the bill saying Today the Texas Legislature took its final step in our historic effort to protect life Legislators and antiabortion activists he said tirelessly defended our smallest and most vulnerable Texans and future Texans Debate over the bill has ignited fierce exchanges between lawmakers and tense confrontations between opponents of the bill who have worn orange and supporters of the bill wearing blue Signs and slogans have been everywhere bearing long impassioned arguments or the simple scrawl on a young mans orange shirt a Twitteresque TXLEGE U R dumb The bill had come nearly this far before a version had been brought to the Senate in the previous session of the Legislature in June and was killed by State Senator Wendy Davis a Democrat from Fort Worth with an 11hour filibuster that stalled the bill until after the deadline for ending the session The filibuster became a sensation on Twitter and other forms of social media with more than 180000 people viewing the filibuster live online Almost immediately however Mr Perry called for another special session to reconsider the bill resulting in Friday nights vote The fight has been heavy with symbols The House bills author Representative Jodie Laubenberg a Republican from Parker dangled a pair of baby shoes before her as she spoke on Tuesday Representative Senfronia Thompson who offered an early amendment to the bill was flanked by colleagues holding wire hangers representing the brutal abortion methods they said would return if legitimate clinics were run out of business Ms Laubenberg has said that the bill would close no abortion clinics adding It is time these clinics put patients ahead of profits Supporters of the bill in the Legislature have been angered by the language of their opponents During floor debate on Tuesday Representative Jason Villalba a Republican of Dallas said I shall stand with Texas women but I shall stand here no longer and be accused of conducting a war on womenÂ  He said We care for and we fight for human baby lives and showed a sonogram of his own child at 13 weeks I will fight and I will fight and I will fight to protect my baby During the Senate debate the dean of the Senate John Whitmire who is a Democrat angrily told Senator Dan Patrick a Republican I cant sit here and let you question my faith The bill was opposed by many doctors including leaders of the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists and the Texas Medical Association the gynecologists group has run advertisements locally that question the scientific underpinnings of the legislation and tell legislators to Get out of our exam rooms The Senate took up the bill Friday afternoon and people had begun lining up for seats in the thirdfloor Senate gallery early in the morning Department of Public Safety officers their numbers swelled in anticipation of crowds and tumult searched every bag and confiscated anything that could be thrown  including for part of the day and until the practice became an object of derision online tampons Department officials said the searches had turned up jars suspected to contain urine feces and paint along with glitter and confetti but offered no proof Senators worked through the evening surrounded by commotion and ruckus Shouts chants and singing could be heard outside the chamber and as the final amendment was voted down protesters tried to chain themselves to the railing of the Senate gallery and were removed Emotions were high within the Senate chamber as well Senator Kirk Watson a Democrat who represents Austin said that Republicans who do not like the phrase war on women should consider the fact that women dont understand why you keep coming after them Mr Patrick retorted in his own speech I suggest babies are thinking the same thing The passage of the bill by a vote of 19 to 11 just before midnight was no surprise Hours earlier Senator Royce West a Democrat who represents Dallas asked lawmakers to add one of the 20 proposed amendments but said The die is cast We know the bill is going to pass To explain why he and his colleagues continued to fight when the outcome was certain Mr Watson the chairman of the Senate Democratic caucus earlier in the week posted a Facebook photo showing an orange Tshirt bearing a statement A foregone conclusion has never stopped a group of citizens committed to ideals of democracy and liberty from taking a stand and fighting with everything theyve got This is Texas baby Remember the Alamo The next step will be a court challenge to the new law almost before Mr Perrys signature has time to dry the many proposed amendments and discussion of them were clearly intended to build a record that could eventually be reviewed by the courts In closing her own speech late Friday Ms Davis told the groggy lawmakers those in the gallery and beyond The fight for the future of Texas is just beginning
Why Abortion Is Not Like Other Issues,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/sunday-review/why-abortion-is-not-like-other-issues.html,WASHINGTON  ITS no secret that the Republican Party differs with public opinion on some of the days biggest issues Be it on gun control immigration samesex marriage or highend taxes the party has advocated a position at odds with the beliefs of most Americans polls show This disconnect has helped Democrats win the popular vote in five of the last six presidential elections The recent acrimony in the Texas Legislature with Republicans pushing a restrictive abortion bill seems to provide a new example It has allowed Democrats to cast Republicans once again as out of the mainstream  Yet abortion is not quite like those other issues On abortion rights both parties have a claim on public opinion Maybe more to the point both can make a strong case that the other party has an extreme view Abortion is the relatively rare issue in which the clich is true public opinion does actually rest about midway between the parties platforms As a result abortion occupies a different place in the Republicans continuing struggle about whether and how to modernize their party On a set of other social issues related to the increasingly diverse American population the party clearly faces big challenges The two fastestgrowing ethnic groups  Latinos and AsianAmericans  are decidedly liberal Younger white adults also lean left My colleague Nate Silver estimates that in the year 2020 ballot initiatives on samesex marriage would pass in 44 states based on the direction of public opinion The only six states where the initiatives would likely fail are solidly Republican Southern states  Anyone following the Texas abortion debate through social media could easily imagine that the issue belongs in the same category During her filibuster against the bill State Senator Wendy Davis inspired a hashtag  StandWithWendy  and a Twitter explosion An often overlooked aspect of social media however is that it still skews slightly liberal  Nationwide polls consistently show that people are no more pro choice than pro life when asked to choose a label More detailed questions yield similar results And women are no more in favor of abortion rights than men Abortion is not heading in either partys direction says Andrew Kohut of the Pew Research Center  About 60 percent of Americans favor access to abortion in the first trimester or first 12 weeks of pregnancy but close to 70 percent think it should be illegal in the second trimester according to Gallup Likewise a recent National Journal poll found 48 percent of respondents favoring and only 44 percent opposing a House of Representatives bill that would ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy except in cases of rape and incest  About 8 in 10 Americans believe abortion is taking a life said Ed Goeas president of the Tarrance Group a Republican polling firm What you then have is a discussion about when it is acceptable Perhaps the best weapon of abortion rights advocates is their opponents extremism The Texas bill for instance would close most of the states abortion providers and ban the procedure after 20 weeks without exceptions for rape or incest A clear majority of Americans support such exceptions as well as those for the health of the mother polls show Ilyse Hogue president of Naral ProChoice America says that while she is distressed by the recent spate of state laws she thinks her side will ultimately benefit from the new focus on the issue Not only do many abortion opponents favor tough restrictions on the practice they also oppose in vitro fertilization some forms of contraception and stemcell research Ms Hogue argues that many Americans will find these arguments wingnutty But supporters of abortion access have their own challenges The issues on which its easiest to predict the future of public opinion generally involve individual rights Over time rights  suffrage for women and blacks job opportunities for Irish Jews Latinos and other ethnic minorities marriage for interracial and samesex couples  tend to expand in the United States In the debate over abortion unlike the debates over immigration and marriage both sides can easily claim the mantle of individual rights Supporters can maintain that women deserve the right to make decisions about their bodies at any point in a pregnancy  and that many abortion opponents change their position when facing a reallife decision Opponents can counter with increasingly clear images from sonograms often showing decidedly human forms on the cusp of viability Opponents can also point to the specter of eugenics one study has foundÂ that prenatal screening caused births of children with Down syndrome to be 49 percent lower than they otherwise would have been even as medical advances have sharply extended the lives of people with the disorder When fetuses with Down syndrome are aborted it is typically after the first trimester Those dueling claims probably mean that the debate over abortion is here to stay As Mr Kohut notes polls show that young people  despite their general liberalism  are divided much as their parents and grandparents have been  If the issue presents either Republicans or Democrats with a political opportunity it is one they will both struggle to exploit given the passionate feelings of their bases But the opportunity does exist Most Americans are uncomfortable with abortion yet believe there are circumstances  and not just a narrow few  when it should be legal They believe that women should have control over their bodies and also that an abortion is akin to a death Where they struggle is in deciding when each principle deserves to take priority
Making Sense of a Sensational Case,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/public-editor/making-sense-of-a-sensational-case.html,IN the 1930s H L Mencken declared the kidnapping of the Lindbergh baby and the trial of Bruno Hauptmann to be the greatest story since the Resurrection The nation was hungry for details and the press was happy to feed the insatiable beast These days the beast has been ravenous for the murder trial of George Zimmerman the Florida neighborhood watch volunteer who shot and killed Trayvon Martin an unarmed black teenager The case was swollen with confusing evidence Floridas liberal selfdefense laws and deepseated racial tension Cable coverage has been round the clock While hardly going the way of CNNs near total obsession The Times gave the Zimmerman trial a great deal of daily attention including frequently updated courtroom coverage on the Web Decisions about the amount of coverage to give a highprofile trial are always subjective But it is notable  and it opens The Times to criticism  that this one got the kind of dayin dayout attention that The Times did not deem worthwhile in a pair of other important cases this year the trial of the abortion doctor Kermit Gosnell and the courtmartial of Pfc Bradley Manning who leaked vast amounts of classified government documents Although the Gosnell trial did seem to get short shrift at first I felt it was given adequate coverage by the end But I have thought all along that the Manning matter deserves more sustained evidence of The Timess interest The Zimmerman trial coverage was solid But foremost The Times has showed its trademark strength with indepth enterprising pieces exploring the broader issues of this shooting and its aftermath Last week for example Lizette Alvarez wrote skillfully about the racial issues that had emerged noting that race lingers awkwardly on the sidelines scarcely mentioned but impossible to ignore That article appeared on the front page the first during the trial to do so In the first weeks after Mr Martin was killed on Feb 26 2012 The Times lagged behind seeming not to recognize the broader implications and the way the teenagers death had captured public interest But on April 2 it published an exhaustive and wellwritten account by four reporters that started on the front page and filled two full pages inside It explored the polarizing effect of the shooting Soon after that a frontpage piece by Serge Kovaleski investigated the police missteps after the shooting Some critics of The Times believe its motto should not be All the News Thats Fit to Print but rather More Later Given the enormous overload of coverage elsewhere The Times tried to provide something distinctive Charles Strum the deputy national editor handling the story told me that his aim had been to bring more light than heat because over all this is a situation with more heat than light While editing articles in the New York office  most of them written by Ms Alvarez the Miami bureau chief  he spent his days wearing headphones so that he could listen to live streaming of the trial There are a lot of accusations a lot of misinformation and a lot of conspiracy theorizing he said The smallest points were scrutinized Why for example did The Times use so many descriptions of Mr Zimmermans ethnicity Michael G Brautigam of Brooklyn is one of many readers who commented on how The Times described Mr Zimmerman He wrote to me If memory serves George Zimmerman has been described in a significantly different way each day of the week A week ago Monday he was labeled half Hispanic the next day as half Peruvian a day later as selfdescribed Hispanic Earlier he was described as a white Hispanic I asked Ms Alvarez to explain Its been a struggle all along she said If he were black or if his name was Rodriguez instead of Zimmerman this would have been a completely different situation The case would not have had its racial flash point she said In a nation where a blend of race and ethnicity are more and more the norm the labeling struggle is an effort to note that Mr Zimmerman shares in that mixture more than his name alone indicates Separately from news coverage some readers complained about several OpEd columns by Charles Blow finding them onesided with a particular complaint about one that appeared on July 3 comparing Mr Zimmermans videotaped reenactment with his written and spoken statements Richard Murphy of Fairfield Conn wrote I realize that Mr Blow is an opinion columnist but does The Times really want to put Mr Zimmerman on trial in its pages Mr Blow isnt reporting he is deliberately attempting to discredit Zimmerman to convince people of his guilt I sent this complaint to Mr Blow and asked him to respond I simply raised questions about inconsistencies in George Zimmermans accounts of his struggle with Trayvon Martin he said Looking back over the columns that Mr Blow has written on the case since last year I found them generally thoughtful if clearly sympathetic to the Martin family The column that Mr Murphy cited may have come close to the limits of fair comment taking on a prosecutorial tone If you believed the medical examiner the columnist wrote the struggle simply couldnt have happened as Zimmerman described it Those kinds of judgments might have been best left to the jury But columnists are allowed wide leeway and even in this instance I found Mr Blow within his rights The Times was slow off the mark on this story and on some early developments it let the local media break the news But over all it has done its job satisfying interest without sensationalizing covering the trial with a measured tone and providing depth and perspective  valuable commodities on a story all too capable of creating hysteria Mr Strum however knows there are ways in which any coverage no matter how thoughtful must be found wanting This trial brings up all the old pain of every violent racial crime thats ever happened  with questions of whos the aggressor whether a fair trial is possible whether there is such a thing as equal justice in America he told me The questions are out there and unfortunately they wont be answered
A Pill Available in Mexico Is a Texas Option for Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/us/in-mexican-pill-a-texas-option-for-an-abortion.html,McALLEN Tex  At the Whole Womans Health center here a young woman predicted what others would do if the states stringent new abortion bill approved late Friday forces clinics like this one to close cross the border to Mexico to seek an abortion pill  This law will lead a lot more women to try selfabortion said Jackie F a 24yearold food server and student who was in the health center last week for a followup medical examination after getting a legal abortion  The woman who requested that her last name not be used to avoid stigma was referring to a drug that can induce miscarriages and is openly available in Mexico and covertly at some flea markets in Texas In Nuevo Progreso only yards past the Mexican border pharmacists respond to requests for a pill to bring back a womans period by offering the drug misoprostol at discount prices generic at 35 for a box of 28 pills or the branded Cytotec for 175  When asked how women should use the pills some of the pharmacists said they did not know and others recommended wildly different regimes that doctors say could be unsafe  The women see it as a pill to make my period come said Andrea Ferrigno a vice president of Whole Womans Health which runs a network of abortion clinics Often in their minds its not abortion On Friday the Texas Senate gave final passage to one of the strictest antiabortion measures in the country legislation championed by Gov Rick Perry who rallied the Republicancontrolled Legislature after a Democratic filibuster last month blocked the bill and intensified already passionate resistance by abortionrights supporters  The law would ban most abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy and hold abortion clinics to the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers among other requirements Its supporters say that the strengthened requirements for clinics and doctors will protect womens health State Senator Glenn Hegar a Republican and the chief sponsor of the bill in the Senate said it was not his intent to close abortion clinics but to increase the quality of the care Opponents argue that the restrictions are actually intended to put financial pressure on the clinics that perform abortions and will force most of them to shut their doors If the new law survives legal challenges both Whole Womans Health in McAllen and the only other abortion clinic in the Rio Grande Valley in nearby Harlingen which together perform more than 3500 abortions a year will have to shut down their owners say  The greatest impact is likely to be among lowincome women who will be less able to make the needed two trips to the nearest clinic that meets the new surgicalcenter standards in San Antonio four hours north In the United States legal medication abortions involve the use in the first nine weeks of pregnancy of misoprostol together with a steroid that breaks down the uterine lining The success rate is more than 95 percent In addition to requiring many clinics to close the new Texas law would curb such medication abortions by requiring that the drugs be administered at surgery centers and at what doctors call an outdated dosage  Misoprostol taken alone is less effective but the drug is more readily available because it is prescribed to prevent gastric ulcers  But health experts worry about its unmonitored use Lacking health insurance or fearing the stigma of being seen at an abortion clinic thousands of Texas residents every year are already making covert use of this pill or trying other methods to induce abortions on their own according to Dr Dan Grossman an obstetrician in the San Francisco Bay Area and vice president of Ibis Reproductive Health a nonprofit research group  When used properly in the early weeks of pregnancy misoprostol which causes uterine contractions and cervical dilation induces a miscarriage about 85 percent of the time according to Dr Grossman But many women receive incorrect advice on dosage and especially later in pregnancy the drug can cause serious bleeding or a partial abortion he said The looming limits on legal abortion follow deep cuts in state support for family planning Planned Parenthood clinics here in Hidalgo County do not perform abortions but in 2010 provided subsidized contraception to 23000 men and women at eight centers as financing dried up four of them have been closed This year the group will serve only 12000 clients and other organizations have not taken up the slack said Patricio Gonzales chief executive of the Hidalgo County chapter of Planned Parenthood If legal abortions become inaccessible in this part of the state Mr Gonzales said Planned Parenthood may have to step up and try to raise 15 million or more to build a new surgery center that meets the requirements of the new law  Lucy Felix a community educator here with the National Latina Institute for Reproductive Health said that many of the women she works with do not have legal residency and cannot drive north in Texas through Border Patrol checkpoints or even cross the southern border to buy the pill directly for fear that they may not be able to return to their families in Texas  The only option left for many women will be to go get those pills at a flea market Ms Felix said Some of them will end up in the ER The two abortion clinics in the Rio Grande Valley say that the cost of meeting ambulatory surgical center standards would be prohibitive They also doubt that they could find nearby hospitals that would grant admitting privileges to the abortion doctors another element of the new law  They will close us down said Dr Lester Minto who owns the Reproductive Services clinic in Harlingen which performs 1500 to 2000 abortions each year for a price of about 400  In a tour of the Whole Womans Health clinic here Ms Ferrigno noted some of the design and equipment requirements in the new law that would force the clinic to shut down The clinic part of a chain in Texas and other states performs about 1900 abortions a year using doctors that fly in from other states  The clinic like most in Texas performs abortions only through the first 15 weeks of pregnancy using medications or a suction method that takes 10 to 15 minutes and involves no incisions The center uses donations to offer subsidies to many women Ms Ferrigno said  The suite does not have the wide hallways required of a surgery center to facilitate the movement of stretchers in an emergency In nine years and thousands of abortions she said the McAllen clinic has sent only two patients to the hospital both for readilytreated bleeding  With plush recliners a Georgia OKeeffe flower print on the wall and herbal tea the centers recovery room resembles a small firstclass lounge  Ambulatory surgery centers in contrast must have large hospitalstyle recovery rooms with medical equipment on the walls Patients must rest on gurneys separated by ceilingmounted curtains The herbal tea would not be allowed To enter the McAllen clinic women must cross a gantlet

Former Montana Governor Wonâ€™t Run for Senate in 2014,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/us/politics/brian-schweitzer-former-montana-governor-wont-run-for-senate-in-2014.html,WASHINGTON  Brian Schweitzer the former governor of Montana announced Saturday that he would not run for the states open Senate seat in 2014 a decision that further impedes Democratic efforts to retain their majority in the midterm elections The announcement by Mr Schweitzer a popular twoterm governor came as a surprise to many Democrats who viewed him as their best hope to fill the seat being vacated by Senator Max Baucus the Montana Democrat who earlier this year announced he would not seek reelection In an interview with The Associated Press Mr Schweitzer 57 said that while he had considered a race people need to know I am not running for the United States Senate He said that he did not want to leave Montana for Washington In order to retake the Senate Republicans would need to gain six seats They welcomed Mr Schweitzers decision This news is a pivotal seachange moment in our efforts to earn back the majority in the Senate said Brad Dayspring a spokesman for the National Republican Senatorial Committee Democrats have failed to recruit their topchoice candidates in several states including South Dakota Republicans are hoping to pick off four Democratic incumbents in Republicanleaning states  Senators Mark Begich of Alaska Kay Hagan of North Carolina Mary L Landrieu of Louisiana and Mark Pryor of Arkansas  Mr Schweitzers decision not to run opened up yet another seat that Republicans say is within their grasp The National Republican Senatorial Committee began an intensive oppositionresearch effort against him over the last two months and Mr Schweitzer recently weathered a series of unflattering news stories linking him to a nonprofit group tied to political activities Just two days ago Senate Democrats were quoted promising Brian Schweitzer tremendous resources to get in the race Mr Dayspring said We did our homework and there was a lot of rust under Schweitzers hood  a lot of rust In addition Schweitzer looked at the race and realized he couldnt win in light of how unpopular the Democratic agenda of higher taxes bankrupting spending and the Obamacare train wreck is in Montana these days But Democrats said they were optimistic about their chances of retaining Mr Baucuss seat We remain confident that Democrats can hold the Montana seat and the overall math still favors Democrats next year said Guy Cecil the executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee Only three Democratic incumbents have lost reelection in the last decade Our incumbents are positioned to win weve already recruited a strong challenger to Mitch McConnell and Republicans have failed to expand the Senate map into blue and purple states Senator Jon Tester Democrat of Montana said he understood Mr Schweitzers decision and looked forward to other talented Democrats stepping up Running for the US Senate is a big decision for a potential candidate and their family Mr Tester said Just because this year wasnt the right time for Brian to run doesnt mean we dont have great Montana Democrats who are willing to run and capable of winning the seat The list of potential Democratic candidates in Montana includes Denise Juneau the state public schools superintendent Monica Lindeen Montanas securities and insurance commissioner Brian Morris a Montana Supreme Court justice Stephanie Schriock president of Emilys List the influential political action committee that backs Democratic women who support abortion rights and State Senator Kendall Van Dyk
The Policy and the Politics of the Abortion Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/14/us/the-policy-and-the-politics-of-the-abortion-debate.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor of The Texas Tribune writes a regular column for the Tribune Activists on both sides of the abortion fight put the most amazing things in the hands of children Maybe we should be passing parenting laws The Texas Capitol quiet for most of the year has been full of protesters and demonstrators off and on for the last month as lawmakers consider abortion legislation Like all activists and partisans they bring their props with them including in some cases props who are related to them kids Some have learned the lessons about pictures saying more than words and how the cameras always seem to find the strangest and most outlandish people and signs and sights in crowds that are otherwise as unremarkable as the people at the neighborhood grocery store Children show up at all sorts of functions even political ones But even after all the years and all the fights they can be an uncomfortable presence at a rally on this subject Its like seeing a second grader sitting next to an adult at an Rrated movie Its the thing that made some people squeamish when the governor wanted HPV vaccines for sixth graders to guard against sexually transmitted disease The subject itself is arguably for mature audiences though its obvious that many parents think this is a proper introduction to civics for their own children  a translation of values into action that children need to learn And its up to them probably to decide whether the kids ought to be holding up signs and what is in and out of bounds Several children have held up signs saying in a more profane way than this that if they wanted the government in their business they would have sex with government officials On the other side were signs also in small hands with pictures of aborted fetuses and the slogan abortion is murder Golly There are topics just as political as abortion like redistricting Lawmakers get wrapped around the axle about it but most people dont care enough to pack up the kids jump in the car drive to Austin stand in the heat and hold signs about the federal Voting Rights Act And there are issues that are just as emotional as the states politicians found out on the 2012 campaign trail when they talked to parents about highstakes standardized testing in schools One wrong word on that can raise the voices of a town hall full of Texans Abortion periodically becomes a legislative issue and then slips into the background almost long enough for everyone to forget how potent it is It combines politics and emotion in a way few issues do putting lawmakers on the spot with their constituents and their colleagues  there is intense debate without changing minds but with the knowledge that the votes they take will be scrutinized and consequential in the next elections It makes politicians nervous But it also energizes supporters on both sides  the rare thing that raises the political fortunes of people as different as Representative Jodie Laubenberg Republican of Parker and Senator Wendy Davis Democrat of Fort Worth at the same time Detractors snarl supporters purr Politically it works if youre talking about the partisans who groove on political fireworks The factions are like the Legislature itself an institution with a split personality that toggles between sometimes difficult but policycentered debates on things like water and the state budget and testing in schools and politically driven wrangles on some of those same issues The abortion debate has a policy side  whether and when a fetus feels pain whether and how abortion clinics are regulated whether and how the state ought to regulate the doctors involved and how all of those things affect the prevalence and availability of the procedure Its got an emotional side too  thats the most visible part Blue and orange Tshirts Demonstrators inside and outside the Capitol And all those signs and slogans Thats a way to get attention to push the boundaries enough to attract notice without crossing the line so that what youre trying to say is undone by how youre saying it Like when a conversation about whether to become a parent turns to one about what kind of parent you have become
Virginia Campaign Could Lift Strategist to Stardom,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/us/politics/virginia-campaign-could-lift-strategist-to-stardom.html,WASHINGTON  In 1991 Zell Miller then governor of Georgia and a Democrat advised his colleague Bill Clinton of Arkansas that there were two guys he needed to run his likely presidential campaign James Carville and Paul Begala Who are they asked Mr Clinton a man well versed in Democratic politics Even though they had had successes including Mr Millers election Mr Carville and Mr Begala did not become a big deal until they ran Harris Woffords campaign in a special Pennsylvania Senate election in 1991 It was the signature contest of that offyear election cycle A month later Mr Clinton hired the two young politicos for his successful presidential run This year the signature race is the Virginia gubernatorial contest The campaign manager of the Democratic candidate Terry McAuliffe is Robby Mook a 33yearold political wunderkind For those who believe history repeats itself there is chatter that another Clinton  Hillary  might turn to him as the architect of the years most visible Democratic campaign to direct her next presidential quest Mr Mook worked for her in 2008 but is the sort of fresh new age technologysavvy strategist that she lacked at the top of her 2008 campaign First he has to win in Virginia a race that pits Mr McAuliffe a prolific Democratic fundraiser successful former national party chairman and intimate of the Clintons against the states attorney general Ken Cuccinelli one the most prominent Republican social conservatives and a Tea Party favorite The competing strategies in this close contest are clear They are trading ethical charges which is probably a wash with voters Mr Cuccinelli is counting on his passionate base among social conservatives The Virginia electorate that will turn out in November will be older more white and more evangelical than the voters who helped President Barack Obama carry the once reliable Republican stronghold by four points last year If the voter profile had replicated that of the last governors race in 2009 Mr Obama would have lost There are a lot more committed voters who will turn out for Ken than there are committed voters wholl turn out for Terry said Chris LaCivita a leading Cuccinelli adviser The Republicans are trying to tie Mr Obamas record around the Democratic candidates neck especially the Affordable Care Act Obamacare is the biggest impediment to job growth in the state Mr Cuccinelli said in an impromptu interview last week He was the first to bring a lawsuit against the health care measure without success The attorney general comfortable his base will turn out is focusing on jobs and the economy and deemphasizing his social positions He has declared that abortion is as bad as slavery and that samesex relationships violate the laws of nature and could be prosecuted He is really moving away from EW Jackson the minister chosen by the conservativedominated Republican state convention to be the partys lieutenant governor nominee Mr Jackson has accused Mr Obama of being a Muslim and an atheist  a tough trick  and suggested that yoga could lead to Satanism and that Planned Parenthood had been more harmful to blacks than the Ku Klux Klan The Democrats are quick to remind voters of Mr Cuccinellis social views At the same time Mr McAuliffe is warming to the debate over jobs and the economy He is more comfortable than his opponent in talking to business types hes been shaking them down for campaign funds for decades He has won the endorsements of leading Republican business figures and prominent former office holders In Virginia there is a centrist electorate including the business community which does turn out Mr Mook said He links Mr McAuliffe to two popular former Democratic governors and the states current senators Mark Warner and Tim Kaine as well as to the current Republican governor Bob McDonnell We are capturing the more moderate brand of Warner Kaine and McDonnell Mr Mook said The Democratic candidate supported and the attorney general opposed Mr McDonnells key domestic initiative last year a huge transportation measure with tax increases The governors popularity is dropping however amid serious ethical allegations  Mr McAuliffe strongly associated with the Clintons is not running away from Mr Obama Michelle Obama campaigned for him last month And Mr Mook is making extensive use of the vaunted Obama campaign machine drawing on personnel data software and social media  Robby understands modern campaigns the value of data and technology said David Plouffe who directed the Obama campaign and is now a Bloomberg Television contributor Although they met in person for the first time only last year Mr Plouffe has vivid recollections of Mr Mook He beat us three times his footprint was on our back he said When he was only 28 Mr Mook ran Mrs Clintons 2008 campaigns in Nevada Ohio and Indiana all of which Mr Plouffe painfully remembers were victories Our sense was he did the best job of anyone over there Mr Plouffe said This is a guy with limitless potential After the failed Clinton quest he ran Jeanne Shaheens successful campaign to unseat John E Sununu the incumbent Republican senator in New Hampshire Hes a very smart guy and I dont think he has any enemies which is hard in this state said Mike Vlacich a longtime Shaheen adviser  Last year Mr Mook directed the House Democrats campaign gaining eight seats but not control of the chamber The young operative is a workaholic who hires top talent empowers them understands cuttingedge changes in politics and revels in his craft I love being thrown into a situation putting together a team getting a strategy and achieving something Mr Mook said He also works unusually well with candidates The garrulous and freewheeling Mr McAuliffe has been more disciplined this time staying on message Invariably he brings any discussion back to jobs If it seems incongruous that a young guy named Robby Mook from Vermont might be the hottest US political strategist remember that a little over two decades ago even Mr Clinton was not familiar with a Ragin Cajun named Carville

"Welfare Reform Then, Immigration Reform Now?",https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/15/is-immigration-reform-the-g-o-p-s-welfare-reform/,"Since my Sunday column considered the paths that House Republicans might take on immigration
                                        if they dont want to just embrace the Senates approach its worth saying something about whyÂ  purely as a political question with the policy merits to one sideÂ 
                                        its difficult for the GOP to simply take a dive on the issue go along with the elite consensus their
                                        own elite included and accept RubioSchumer and move on Here let me quote The New Republics Nate Cohn offering what I think is generally
                                        sensible advice to Republicans trying to rebrand their party without splintering it  the best option is to spread the pain around Dont castrate the party smooth out the many sharp edges of the GOPs platform and messageÂ  Keep supporting tax cuts and less regulation
                                            but add an agenda and message aimed at the middle and working class Remain prolife but dont appear opposed to Planned Parenthood or contraceptives and return to supporting exceptions in instances
                                            of rape or the health of the mother as President Bush did Stay committed to religion but dont reflexively doubt the science of evolution and global warming or the promise of stem cell research or
                                            renewable energy Oppose gun control but why force yourself to oppose background checks Oppose gay marriage if Republicans must but could Republicans at least support civil unions On all of these issues
                                            the GOP need not compromise on its core policy objectives but cant afford to consistently stake out ground so far from the center  This prescription is informed by Bill Clintons revitalization of the Democratic Party in 1992 He was ostensibly a New Democrat even though he was prochoice supported higher taxes a universal
                                            health care system gun control and expanded rights for gays in the military Rather than abandon core elements of the Democratic agenda Clinton softened the edges on unreformed welfare crime middle class
                                            taxes and said abortion should be rare even if it should remain legal First a quick digression This history is part of why the frequent liberal critiques of wouldbe conservative reformers                                        as too conservative actually make me relatively optimistic which Im not usually about the reform projects chances Like the Clintonian Third Way before it any effective attempt
                                        to revitalize the GOP would have to look pretty conservative from the vantage point of the leftÂ  like a smooththeroughedges movement ultimately rather than a complete ideological renovation But back to the main point immigration Suppose the Cohn thesis is right If so the problem here is that for many conservative skeptics of the bill conceding on comprehensive reform doesnt
                                        feel like a smoothouttheedges policy concession  the way say conceding on the DREAM Act or some other more limited measure might It feels instead like an outright surrender in which liberals achieve
                                        their central policy objectives  legalization today higher rates of both highskilled and lowskilled immigration tomorrowÂ Â and conservatives get the consolation of border security
                                        measures that may never even really take effect Its rather different in this sense from some of the other examples Cohn cites Concessions on background checks would be at most a modest setback for the NRA and its hard at least for this prolifer
                                        to see support for a rapeandincest exception as devastating to the antiabortion cause But from the vantage point of National Review or the Heritage Foundation or the Center for Immigration Studies to cite a
                                        few places that take a restrictionist line on immigration the RubioSchumer bill looks less like a modest setback and more like a onceinadecade or even onceinageneration defeat Whats more the fact that so many analysts Cohn included describe a vote for RubioSchumer as a vote to take the immigration issue off the table indicates that restrictionists are probably
                                        right to see it this way Issues can go off the table because external circumstances changes Cohn cites the example of the Cold Wars end but when they are pushed off the table legislatively its
                                        usually a sign that one set of activists has basically won most of what they wanted and their rivals have mostly lost Thats what happened for instance with the 1996 welfare reform which was notably the one New Democrat move that didnt really fit Cohns smooththeedges paradigm In that case Clinton basically
                                        gave welfares conservative critics enough of what they wanted to allbuteliminate the issues role in national politicsÂ and dealt his liberal base what they saw at the time as a significant even devastating policy defeat Now maybe immigration reform is the 2010s equivalent of welfare reform with the parties reversedÂ  the issue where the base needs to lose more or less outright so that the party can survive But thats
                                        different than saying its an example of a place where the conservative wing of the GOP just needs to moderate its stance eversoslightly or concede a little bit of ground And there are also a few reasons House Republicans might be inclined to doubt that historical parallel First welfare reform didnt promise to have longterm transformative impact on the electorate itself
                                        which is the anxiety driving at least some conservative doubts about the wisdom of going along with RubioSchumer SecondÂ while GOP opposition to comprehensive reform may be toxic among Hispanic voters
                                        the country as a whole 1 doesnt put a high priority on the issue and 2 probablyÂ opposes the kind of major increase in immigrationÂ that
                                        would be the most significant longterm consequence of the Senate billÂ Third the kind of voters and activists who opposed welfare reform were almost uniformly liberal and so it wasnt likely the
                                        Nader run notwithstanding that the Democrats would really lose them in the long run by surrendering on the issue the kind of Americans most skeptical of mass immigration on the other hand include a lot of
                                        disaffected Perotista swing voters who might vote Democratic or stay home in future election cycles if the GOP just
                                        stiffarms themÂ And then finally because Clinton was the president when welfare reform passed it was easier for him to take ownership of the issue and claim some of the credit with swing voters than it
                                        will be for Republicans to claim credit for an immigration bill that will be swiftly added to President Obamas list of transformative liberal accomplishments One can imagine counterarguments to these counterarguments of course starting with the points about Floridian presidential politics that Cohn raised in his very next piece
                                        But they help explain why opponents of the immigration bill might see themselves as unfairly singled out among the many GOP interest groups that champion notentirelypopular causes in the kind of defeat theyre
                                        being asked to accept and the amount of political pain theyre being asked to bear"

                                         Enacted in 2002 the program set a laudable national example by allowing candidates for the bench to reduce their reliance on the special interest campaign money that now dominates

"In Public Opinion on Abortion, Few Absolutes",https://fivethirtyeight.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/17/in-public-opinion-on-abortion-few-absolutes/,"For decades both sides in the abortion debate have tried to say that public opinion was already on their side and only
                                        becoming more so Advocates for abortion rights have pointed to polls showing that a majority of Americans support Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion Abortion opponents have
                                        cited polls showing that a majority considers life to begin at conception  and opposes abortion access in many cases As with so many other areas this blog covers abortion is one in which selective readings of
                                        the polls can seem to prove opposite conclusions After writing about abortion and public opinion in Sundays Times  arguing that                                        the issue does not benefit Democrats as much as other highprofile subjects like immigration guns taxes and samesex marriage  I wanted to dig more deeply into the polls and their trend lines For all
                                        the assertions that advocates make about public opinion I think that a few consistent messages emerge  The main one is that most Americans support abortion access with some significant restrictions If you were going to craft a law based strictly on public opinion it would permit abortion in the first trimester first
                                        12 weeks of pregnancy and in cases involving rape incest or threats to the mothers health The law however would substantially restrict abortion after the first trimester in many other cases Intriguingly such a policy would be similar to the laws in several European countries like France where abortions
                                        are widely available in the first trimester and restricted afterward It would also be consistent with much of Roe v Wade In perhaps its most famous decision of the last 50 years the court overturned a Texas law criminalizing abortion by a 72 vote The justices found that                                        the right to privacy required women to have access to abortions but that the state also had an interest in restricting abortion to protect both the pregnant womans health and the potentiality of
                                        human life The decision tried to balance these interests by allowing different restrictions depending on trimester A later Supreme Court decision changed the standard to emphasize viability When arguing that public opinion supports broad abortion rights advocates often point to polls showing strong support for Roe And they are right about that polling A January 2013 poll                                        by Gallup was typical 53 percent of respondents said they did not want the court to overturn its 1973 Roe versus Wade decision concerning abortion and only 29 percent did want it overturned I dont imagine that most people who receive a phone call asking their opinion about Roe know the fine details of the decision when they answer the question But it is worth noting that the strong support for
                                        Roe does not necessarily conflict with the strong reservations Americans express about unrestricted abortion access Roe distinguished among the different stages of pregnancy and different developmental stages of
                                        fetuses
                                     About one in four Americans says they support abortion without restrictions most polls show Somewhat fewer Americans  typically about one in five though it ranges from one in four to one in eight depending
                                        on the poll  oppose abortion in nearly all cases The rest of the country  roughly 50 percent of it  supports abortion in some circumstances and not others Pews polls PDF including this one from October 2012 show this pattern The New York TimesCBS Poll uses a different framework but the results are consistent These results are from February 2013 The Gallup results are also consistent As Gallups historical chart shows opinion on abortion has not shifted in a major way over the years It also does not vary much by sex with women as divided as men on the issue But if one side has any slight
                                        sway on the trends it is the antiabortion campaigners side Twenty years ago the share of Americans saying abortion should always be legal was more than twice as high as the share saying it should never
                                        be legal Since the mid1990s the share of Americans who consider themselves as abortion rights advocates or prochoice in the polls available answers has also declined On abortion as with almost any issue short poll questions and answers do not capture the full complexity of peoples views The standard Gallup questions about trimesters do not mention exceptions for instance
                                        And although a recent National Journal poll may seem on the surface to suggest that a plurality of Americans support the restrictions that
                                        the Texas Legislature passed last weekend the bill includes details  no exceptions for rape or incest the effective closing of most of the states clinics  that most Americans
                                        would quite likely oppose On the flip side some people who oppose a broad abortion ban after 20 weeks of pregnancy also oppose abortion access in some instances like for example for economic reasons or in cases
                                        when prenatal screening shows the fetus to have a nonfatal condition But be wary of analysts who try to take this complexity argument too far Its true that any snapshot of public opinion from a poll is imperfect It is not true that if you scratch only under poll results deeply
                                        enough you will discover the American people actually take a clear side on abortion By any objective measure the country is conflicted"
"Politicians Are Slowed by Scandal, but Many Still Win the Race",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/18/us/politics/politicians-are-slowed-by-scandal-but-many-still-win-the-race.html,NEW ORLEANS  For those who thought Anthony D Weiner and Eliot Spitzer were finished in electoral politics after their scandals who were surprised when they decided to run for office again who were stunned when they took leads in the polls who after all that still cannot quite imagine the thought of them winning meet Charlie Melancon Mr Melancon a former Democratic congressman ran for the Senate in 2010 against David Vitter a skilled politician champion of conservative causes and also as he acknowledged to the world in 2007 someone who had committed a very serious sin involving prostitutes Mr Melancon knew the scandal was not by itself enough to win on but his campaign included it as part of a broader effort to instill doubt about Mr Vitter particularly among women Three years on Mr Melancon is driving around South Louisiana drumming up consulting business Mr Vitter is working away in the Senate and is widely considered a favorite should he run for governor in 2015 According to exit polls he beat Mr Melancon among white women by a 54point margin As one intimately familiar with the limits of public reproach Mr Melancon pronounced mehLAWsawn is not alone All across the country politicians have faced opponents tainted by scandal some of them seemingly muddied beyond saving and have gone on to lose Some like Mr Melancon believe that when it comes down to it partisanship trumps all Others suggested that voters particularly religious voters love a good redemption story Still others said their opponents spent so much time deflecting questions about scandals they never had to face more substantive criticism And some said most voters just did not really care all that much Voters talk a lot about hypocrisy but they dont vote based on it said Eric Stewart who ran last year against Scott DesJarlais a doctor turned Republican congressman in a conservative district in rural Tennessee While a few sordid details of Dr DesJarlaiss past sprouted up in his first election in 2010 last years election was a veritable springtime of salacious disclosures court filings and news articles described multiple affairs with former patients with one saying Dr DesJarlais had pressured her to have an abortion In polls Mr Stewarts campaign found that voters considered the behavior hypocritical and shocking Then you ask them Does it change your mind about voting for him and still a big majority said no said Mr Stewart who is now working as an assistant development director for a private school Political scientists have found that politicians mired in scandal are indeed in worse shape than their colleagues but that is a relative measurement A study of postWatergate Congressional scandals by Scott J Basinger of the University of Houston found that while scandaltarred incumbents were far more likely to retire or resign nearly threequarters of those who decided to run again survived their primaries and 81 percent of those who made it to the general election retained their seats Various elements have been found to favor survival including the passage of time which seemed to help Senator Vitter whose scandal was three years old by the time of his reelection and reassurances from third parties which coming in the form of late endorsements by the South Carolina Republican establishment may have helped the adulterous former governor Mark Sanford win his Congressional race in May Some studies conclude that denial tends to be the best survival strategy but this is not really an option when a candidate has sent anatomical photos over Twitter like Mr Weiner or popped up in a federal investigation like Mr Spitzer or say had a stripper jump out of his car Such was the case with Wilbur Mills a powerful Democratic congressman from Arkansas who a month before the 1974 elections was stopped by the police in Washington for driving without his lights on He was found to be drunk and scratched up while his passenger a striptease artist known as Fanne Foxe the Argentine Firecracker jumped out of his car and into the Tidal Basin beside the Jefferson Memorial Mr Millss Republican opponent in that election was a political rookie named Judy C Petty who had been running a scrappy but effective campaign focused on taxes and a less colorful scandal involving illegal contributions from dairy interests When she heard about the stripper incident Ms Petty  now she is Judy Petty Wolf  had a bad feeling Mr Mills soon appeared before the Little Rock Junior Chamber of Commerce admitted his guilt and advised the crowd never to go out with foreigners who drink Champagne He just sort of got away with it said Ms Wolf who went on to serve in the Arkansas legislature The whole thing probably even helped him win she said A common observation among those who have been in Ms Wolfs position is that scandaltainted candidates tend to fare better among evangelical voters According to recent Wall Street JournalNBC New YorkMarist polls Mr Spitzer and Mr Weiner are supported most strongly by Protestants Where there is a large Christian voting bloc they believe in redemption said John L Ray who lost the 1994 Democratic mayoral primary in Washington to Marion Barry four years after Mr Barrys arrest for crack possession When Barry ran here it was God this and God that and God is not finished with me yet said Mr Ray who concluded that he was not cut out for electoral politics and is now a lawyer He would go in these Baptist churches and frankly the ministers would also be able to save a few souls that day Yet it seems the nation as a whole has become more forgiving Raymond Strother a veteran political adviser said that donations to Gary Harts 1988 presidential campaign dried up overnight when proof surfaced of Mr Harts affair with a 29yearold model Just a few years later Bill Clinton won the presidency despite multiple allegationsÂ of extramarital affairs and Mr Strother said prudishness has never been the same When he did it it was like Roger Bannister breaking the fourminute mile he said But few know the sting of losing to candidates with significant personal liabilities better than one of Mr Strothers past clients the former governor of Louisiana Buddy Roemer In 1991 Mr Roemer the incumbent came in third place in a primary behind Edwin Edwards known for his ethical flexibility in public and private matters and David Duke a former grand wizard of the Ku Klux Klan What followed was one of the most notorious runoffs in American political history Now involved in running banks after an attempt at a presidential run last year on the Reform Party ticket Mr Roemer says that the publics thought process in choosing a candidate is extremely complicated even magical and that trying to isolate one variable is a waste of time One of the secrets of winning an election is determining what the priorities of the people are he said Its not as easy as I once thought But still a man whose own supporters described him as a crook and a Klansman Its very complex he said
"Abortion Restrictions Become Law in Texas, but Opponents Will Press Fight",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/us/perry-signs-texas-abortion-restrictions-into-law.html,MIDLAND Tex  Six months after declaring his goal to make abortion at any stage a thing of the past Gov Rick Perry signed a bill into law Thursday giving Texas some of the toughest restrictions on abortion in the country even as womens rights advocates vowed to challenge the laws legality in court Surrounded by Republican legislators and abortion opponents in an auditorium at the Texas Capitol in Austin Mr Perry said they were celebrating and cementing the foundation on which the culture of life in Texas is built upon As he spoke the chants and shouts of Shame Shame by the bills opponents gathered outside the auditorium could be heard The measure House Bill 2 bans abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy requires abortion clinics to meet the same standards as hospitalstyle surgical centers and mandates that a doctor have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where he or she performs abortions Abortion rights advocates and Democrats said the law could force a majority of the states 42 abortion clinics to close The new provision that clinics be licensed as ambulatory surgery centers would require costly renovations or relocations to meet the architectural and equipment standards  Only five abortion clinics  in Austin San Antonio Dallas and Houston  meet those standards The requirement that doctors performing abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals could force the closing of some clinics that use visiting doctors or that are located where local hospitals refuse to provide such privileges Mr Perry and other Republicans said the law would improve patient safety and hold abortion clinics to safer standards Opponents said that it amounted to an unconstitutional attack on legal abortion in Texas and that many of the restrictions were found to be medically unnecessary by physicians groups The fight over this law will move to the courts while the bigger fight for womens access to health care in Texas gains steam said Cecile Richards the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the Planned Parenthood Action Fund and a daughter of Ann Richards the former Texas governor People are enraged by this law and it has created a whole new generation of activists who are in it for the long run to elect leaders who will protect womens health The law does not take effect immediately The admitting privileges restriction and the ban on abortions after 20 weeks take effect 90 days after a special legislative session ends later this month Abortion clinics have until September 2014 to comply with the surgicalcenter standards Opponents of the law said they were evaluating their litigation options and it appeared likely that lawsuits would be filed before any of the restrictions take effect Similar restrictions that have been enacted in other states have been tied up in legal challenges Bans on abortions after 20 weeks have been adopted by 11 other states but in three of those states  Arizona Georgia and Idaho  courts have blocked the laws from taking effect The requirement that doctors have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital has been blocked by courts in Mississippi Alabama and North Dakota The United States Supreme Court has ruled that states can regulate abortions so long as the rules do not pose an undue burden on a womans right to an abortion Opponents of the law are likely to argue that the surgicalcenter standards and their effect on women seeking abortions across the state pose an undue burden and are thus unconstitutional The ACLU is involved in litigation in 5 of the 10 states where similar abortion restrictions have been enacted and we are evaluating our options in Texas said Terri Burke the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas What makes Texas different is our size House Bill 2 leaves 35 percent of the population without access to abortion care and those are rural and often poor women  The provision banning abortions at 20 weeks after fertilization and later is based on a medically disputed theory that a fetus can feel pain at that stage The Supreme Court has ruled that women have a right to an abortion until the point at which the fetus is viable outside the womb  usually around 24 weeks after a womans last menstrual period or 22 weeks after fertilization  Mr Perry addressed the issue of fetal pain at the billsigning ceremony on Thursday At five months many studies indicate that these children feel pain he said adding that it was Texans responsibility to give voice to the unborn individuals whose survival is at stake The ceremony was a procedural coda to the heated battle over abortion that has played out at the Capitol Thousands of men and women  on the both sides of the debate though opponents of the bill largely outnumbered supporters  have testified rallied and protested there since June when Mr Perry added the bill to the Legislatures agenda  The bill failed to pass during the regular session which ended May 27 so Mr Perry added it on June 11 to a special session in an effort to get it passed But at the end of the special session on June 25 an 11hour filibuster by State Senator Wendy Davis Democrat of Fort Worth helped kill the bill turning her into a national political celebrity Mr Perry responded by calling a second special session and the Republicandominated Legislature quickly passed the restrictions last week Though their efforts to block the bill had ultimately failed Democrats have been emboldened by the filibuster and the battle over abortion In June Ms Davis received nearly 1 million in campaign contributions in two weeks She received more than 15000 individual contributions many from people who gave her 50 or less
Wendy Davis and the Odds Sheâ€™s Facing,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/19/us/politics/wendy-davis-and-the-odds-shes-facing.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor of The Texas Tribune writes a regular column for the Tribune Democrats are coming up with all sorts of reasons for State Senator Wendy Davis to run for governor but that would be the toughest race on the ballot Not that there is an easy race for a Democrat on the statewide ballot But as Ms Davis told Texas Monthly Somebody has to step up on the Democratic side She is the it politician among Texas Democrats right now which is why her partisans are allowing themselves to dream about 2014 the way West Texans dream of rain The problem with the top race has a name Greg Abbott Mr Abbott the Republican attorney general is his partys favored candidate at the moment in spite of the presence of Tom Pauken a former state party chairman in the race Mr Abbott has scads of money in his political account and seems for now to be in the spot Arthur was in when he pulled Excalibur out of that legendary boulder everything is in place but the crown That has some insiders talking about the next race down  the one for lieutenant governor Instead of taking on Mr Abbott the bestfinanced Republican candidate in years Ms Davis of Fort Worth would face one of a quartet of Republican candidates for lieutenant governor a group that includes a politically vulnerable incumbent and a conservative state senator who might give moderate Republican voters pause That race does not have a preemptive favorite and two of the candidates could be attractive foils for Ms Davis David Dewhurst the incumbent has been looking for his mojo since his loss a year ago to Ted Cruz in a Republican runoff for the United States Senate One of his three challengers is that conservative senator Dan Patrick Republican of Houston Back up a step Ms Daviss current celebrity is based on last months filibuster of legislation to tighten restrictions on abortion She helped temporarily kill the bill  later passed in another special session  and she did it in front of a large audience that hadnt seen a Democratic win in Texas in a long time Mr Dewhurst and Mr Patrick were on the other side Running against one or the other would make it easy to remind voters of that battle Ms Davis is a social liberal Mr Patrick is a social conservative So is Mr Dewhurst though his last race raised doubts among some voters The other two Republicans in the race  Land Commissioner Jerry Patterson and Agriculture Commissioner Todd Staples  are former senators They werent on hand for the filibuster so thats not in the mix And in some ways either might be a tougher opponent in November if they can get out of that crowded primary Republican voters rejected Mr Dewhurst a year ago Mr Patrick has never run statewide But in early polling those two lead the field unless you count a large undecided vote that looks like a result from a race without an incumbent in it However the Republicans decide the contrast between general election candidates would be simple to make The contrast would be simple to make in almost every race on the ballot But a statewide race at or near the top of the ticket  even a losing one  could build a foundation for future campaigns And if Mr Abbott doesnt have a tough challenge voters looking for a debate will go to the next race Its not like Ms Davis has a cakewalk waiting at home If she runs for reelection to her Tarrant County Senate seat in 2014 shell face a headwind Her district was drawn to favor a Republican candidate But she defied that in 2008 and 2012 years when the ballot was headed by a Democratic presidential candidate who helped draw her voters to the polls Her team is surprisingly confident she will do it again next year if thats the route she goes The headwind could be stronger now however and it is the candidates fault Ms Davis got the attention of the Republicans too and they will come after her whether she runs for reelection or for something higher on the ballot The lieutenant governors race might be the one to run It will almost certainly go to the Republicans but almost is a big word in politics Losing a reelection bid could put her out of circulation Might as well go big
"California Republicans, All but Endangered, See Hope in Local Race",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/us/politics/california-republicans-all-but-endangered-see-hope-in-local-race.html,HANFORD Calif  California Republicans hold no statewide office They are ignored in the Legislature where Democrats enjoy overwhelming majorities Hispanic voters who are expected to outnumber whites in California within the next several months strongly back Democrats So Republican officials are seizing on the strong performance of a Republican candidate for a special election in the State Senate here in the Central Valley  in a district where Hispanics make up the majority of voters and registered Republicans trail Democrats by 22 percentage points  as a road map to a turnaround in their partys fortunes Andy Vidak a 47yearold farmer came close to capturing the 16th Senate Districts vacant seat in May  so close that he was declared the winner until a final tally of the votes showed that he was about 150 votes short of the simple majority required to avoid a runoff On Tuesday he will face the Democrat who came in second Leticia Perez a 36yearold lawyer and city supervisor in Bakersfield Analysts say it will be difficult to draw lessons from the outcome of a single race particularly a special election But Republicans who had been facing a relentless stream of bad news until this contest do not see it that way Its a big shot in the arm said Bob Huff a Republican and the Senate minority leader It shows our ideas are not stale We are not dead In the months since last falls elections which emphasized the growing importance of the Hispanic vote across the nation state Republican leaders have redoubled efforts to reach out to them Mr Huff said This month he said he visited a large evangelical Hispanic church in San Diego along with Connie Conway the Assembly minority leader and Jim Brulte the Republican Party chairman We have to show up to people and help them realize that we dont have three eyes and five hands or whatever that scares them he said Its a long time to rebuild this party and this brand but I think were on that road Andy Vidak is the first step in that long path for us A thirdgeneration resident of the Central Valley Mr Vidak grows cherries and raises cattle He emphasizes his business background describing himself as a nonpolitician He gained name recognition by mounting a strong though ultimately unsuccessful challenge in 2010 to Jim Costa the Democratic congressman here He talks about creating jobs and his opposition to big government projects like the planned highspeed rail system between San Francisco and Los Angeles He favors immigration change that would open a path to citizenship for those who came here illegally On a recent morning Mr Vidak met with black ministers in Bakersfield A few hours later wearing a cowboy hat he checked in with volunteers at his campaign headquarters here his hometown A small city west of Highway 99 with a drivein movie theater and an oldfashioned ice cream parlor downtown that was packed late in the afternoon Hanford reminded Mr Vidak of his upbringing in Visalia a larger city about 20 miles east he said The 16th Senate District which was gerrymandered as a safe Democratic seat in 2000 became vacant this year when the former occupant Michael Rubio resigned abruptly for a government relations job with Chevron Mr Vidak said he decided to run despite what most people considered unfavorable demographics I dont see it that way because I live here he said Everybodys the same to me This district is a very very conservative district Go to church They like their guns Family is No 1 They all work hard Im no different than anyone else here Asked how Republicans can win over Hispanic voters he said simply Be yourself On a recent afternoon his opponent Ms Perez accompanied by her husband Fernando Jara 37 knocked on doors of registered Democrats in the poor heavily Hispanic part of Bakersfield where both grew up Ms Perez describes herself as a moderate Democrat who strongly supports the highspeed rail project but also Californias oil industry which is based in Bakersfield Its really really important that we get people in office who come from our communities understand what our struggles are and are going to fight for families Ms Perez told one voter Juan Hidalgo 34 a freelance computer consultant If she wins she will be the first Latina in the Central Valley to get to the State Senate her husband added Later Mr Hidalgo who had not been following the race said he would vote for Ms Perez Like she said shell be the first one to be in there and start making changes hopefully he said Another resident Lupe Jacquez 75 also embraced the candidate though she said she was troubled by the Democratic Partys position on samesex marriage and abortion rights Ms Perezs father Victor Perez 65 is a socially conservative voter who remains a registered Republican despite his growing unease over the partys stance on immigration The Democratic Party has not won him over because of its positions on social issues and he said he voted independent in last falls presidential election Nevertheless he was making phone calls for his daughter at her campaign headquarters in Bakersfield He reached out in Spanish to Hispanic voters Theres an immediate

W Monroe a political scientist at the University of California Merced To tilt the balance Republicans have to embrace immigration change said Blodgie Rodriguez a longtime Republican and supporter of Mr Vidaks Andys been very open about his position on the pathway to citizenship said Mr Rodriguez a real estate agent in Bakersfield The Republican Party has a lot to learn from him on taking a stance on the importance of immigration reform Hispanics are traditionally Catholic and conservative and that goes hand in hand with the Republican Party There is no reason why there shouldnt be more Hispanic Republicans Mr Brulte the Republican Party chairman attributed Mr Vidaks strong showing to his deep roots in the Central Valley Theres nothing difficult about winning an election he said

The Texas Abortion Experiment,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/21/opinion/sunday/douthat-the-texas-abortion-experiment.html,WHAT happens to a modern society when abortion is restricted This question is at the heart of the debate over Texass new abortion law which bans abortions after 20 weeks and issues health regulations that could thin the ranks of state abortion clinics making even firsttrimester abortions harder to obtain The laws actual impact may be less sweeping than critics argue But suppose for the sake of argument that theyre right and that the legislation will dramatically curtail legal abortion Then further suppose that it somehow survives the inevitable court challenge What consequences are likely to ensue One possible answer is that Texas will make a forced march into squalor misery and patriarchal oppression Womens lives will be endangered their health threatened their economic opportunities substantially foreclosed To the extent that this case rests on facts rather than fear its based on crosscountry comparisons Around the globe countries with abortion bans often do have worse outcomes  more poverty fewer opportunities for women and yes often more abortions as well But theres a problem with these comparisons They dont compare like to like or control for the host of variables that separate say subSaharan Africa from the United States and Europe They tell us that underdeveloped countries are more likely to ban abortion but they dont tell us whether those bans actually hold back progress and development To prove that case you would need to look at how abortion restrictions play out in a wealthy liberal and egalitarian society Here two examples are instructive Europe in general and Ireland in particular In the first case many European countries already have versions of Texass lateterm abortion ban on the books France Germany and Italy all ban abortions after the first trimester and impose waiting periods as well Notably these nations tend to have lower abortion rates than the United States and none of them are exactly reactionary dystopias in the style of Margaret Atwoods Handmaids Tale So the European experience suggests that at least some abortion restrictions are compatible with equality and female advancement Then there is the specific case of Ireland which has maintained a nearabsolute abortion ban throughout its history This ban does not mean that no Irish women obtain legal abortions some go abroad for them to Britain or Continental Europe But that actually makes the comparison to Texas more apt  because even if abortion were somehow banned outright in Texas tomorrow it would still be available to women with the resources to travel out of state So if liberal fears about the Texas legislations impact are correct one would expect the Irish ban to have produced obvious disastrous side effects At the very least one would expect Ireland to lag in female mortality health and economic advancement Maternal health is indeed a fraught topic in Ireland The abortion debate there has mostly revolved around how to interpret the life of the mother exception and the highprofile case of Savita Halappanavar an Indian immigrant who died unnecessarily during a miscarriage recently prompted the Irish Parliament to widen that exception But there is little evidence that the Halappanavar tragedy reflects a larger trend Irelands maternal health outcomes have long looked much better than those of its neighbors and even a recent report that produced a higher estimate for maternal mortality still placed the country well within the European norm Meanwhile international rankings offer few indications that Irelands abortion laws are holding Irish women back The country ranks first for gender parity in health care in a recent European Union index It was in the middle of the pack in The Economists recent glassceiling index for working women It came in fifth out of 135 countries in the World Economic Forums Global Gender Gap report The United States was 22nd Now its also true that Ireland like most of Europe is to the left of Texas on many economic issues All the abortion restrictions described above coexist with universal health care which Rick Perrys state conspicuously lacks So perhaps it might be argued abortion can be safely limited only when the government does more to cover womens costs in other ways  in which case Texas might still be flirting with disaster But note that this is a better argument for liberalism than for abortion It suggests for instance that liberal donors and activists should be spending more time rallying against Perrys refusal to take federal Medicaid financing than around Wendy Daviss famous filibuster It implies that the quest to turn Texas blue should make economic policy rather than lateterm abortion its defining issue And it raises the possibility that a prolife liberalism  that oncecommonplace nowmythical persuasion  would actually have a stronger argument to make than the one Texass critics are making now
First Debate in Virginia Governorâ€™s Race Adds Some Drama,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/20/first-debate-in-virginia-governors-race-adds-some-drama/,"Attorney General Kenneth T Cuccinelli II of Virginia said Saturday that Gov Bob McDonnell                                        should consider resigning over the lavish gifts he and his family took from a political benefactor Mr Cuccinelli who is running to succeed Mr McDonnell went further than he has gone before in criticizing his fellow Republican His remarks came during a debate with his Democratic opponent Terry McAuliffe The governor is the target of state and federal investigations into influence peddling by Jonnie R Williams Sr on behalf of his company Star Scientific Mr Cuccinelli also accepted gifts from Mr Williams and
                                        the attorney general has strenuously sought to distance himself from the governor lest the scandal harm his campaign The subject came up late in the 90minute debate which was held in Hot Springs Va and streamed online but it added some drama Asked if Mr McDonnell should resign Mr Cuccinelli said It is appropriate
                                        to ask him to think about it Mr McAuliffe accused the attorney general of failing in his fiduciary responsibility to Virginians because of his friendship with Mr Williams and ownership of stock in Star Scientific Mr Cuccinelli responded that an independent prosecutor cleared him of criminal wrongdoing last week He tried to turn the tables by contrasting his transparency in asking for the investigation with Mr McAuliffes

                                        shifted the topic to Mr Cuccinellis record on social issues saying he would drive away potential businesses from the state because of his conservative views on abortion and gay rights Mr Cuccinelli said that as governor social issues would not be his priority My focus in this race is in growing jobs in the middle class he said Polls show the candidates closely tied Although Virginia has twice sent Barack Obama                                        to the White House the electorate in nonpresidential years has been older whiter and more conservative which favors Mr Cuccinelli Mr McAuliffe is trying to lift Democratic turnout by highlighting his opponents

                                        between Mr Cuccinelli and Mr Williams one of quid pro quo a conclusion that goes further than anything made public so far He mocked Mr Cuccinelli for staying at a lake house owned by the executive over Thanksgiving in 2010 a trip Mr Cuccinelli valued at 1500 in a financial disclosure report Thats a lot of turkey

Judge Blocks North Dakota Abortion Restrictions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/23/us/judge-blocks-north-dakota-abortion-restrictions.html,A federal judge on Monday blocked enforcement of North Dakotas recently enacted ban on most abortions calling it invalid and unconstitutional The law under challenge which was set to take effect Aug 1 would have imposed by far the countrys most stringent limit on abortions With few exceptions it would bar the procedure once a fetal heartbeat is detected often about six weeks into pregnancy  a point when many women are not aware they are pregnant From the moment in March when it was adopted most legal experts said that the law would not survive because it posed a direct challenge to Supreme Court guidelines which state that a woman has a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb Viability must be determined by a physician and often occurs around 24 weeks into pregnancy Some antiabortion leaders and politicians argued that the presence of a heartbeat is in itself a form of viability They expressed hope that the Supreme Court would revisit the issue When he signed the bill Gov Jack Dalrymple a Republican called it a legitimate attempt by a state legislature to discover the boundaries of Roe v Wade In a withering opinion issued on Monday Judge Daniel L Hovland of Federal District Court in North Dakota said he had no choice but to block the law He described it as in direct contradiction to a litany of United States Supreme Court cases addressing restraints on abortion The State has extended an invitation to an expensive court battle over a law restricting abortions that is a blatant violation of the constitutional guarantees afforded to all women Judge Hovland wrote His decision on Monday imposed a temporary injunction until the issue is decided at a trial The Center for Reproductive Rights a group based in New York brought the suit to block the law on behalf of the Red River Womens Clinic in Fargo the states only abortion clinic North Dakotas law is the most farreaching among scores of restrictive abortion statutes many of them under court challenge that have been passed by state governments in recent years An Arkansas law to bar abortions at 12 weeks of pregnancy which like North Dakotas was tied to detection of a fetal heartbeat was blocked in May by a federal judge in Little Rock A dozen states most recently Texas have adopted laws barring abortions at 20 weeks after conception on the theory that the fetus can feel pain at that point This approach too is inconsistent with Supreme Court doctrine and in the three states where it has been challenged in court so far  Arizona Idaho and Georgia  it has been blocked In a different line of attack antiabortion groups have promoted stricter rules for abortion facilities requiring clinics in certain states to meet costly building standards and requiring that abortion doctors have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals Medical groups call these measures unnecessary for patient safety The Red River clinic which relies on a doctor who flies in weekly says it will be forced to close if the states admitting privileges law takes effect The clinics court challenge to the rule is pending
"After Filibuster, a Star Rises in Texas",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/us/24iht-letter24.html,NEW YORK  She comes from a key district in North Texas has a slow twang battle scars and ferocity of spirit and after one dramafilled day in the bitter abortion fight in the Texas Legislature Wendy Davis has become a national political star and charismatic new face of womens rights For 11 hours in a middaytomidnight filibuster Ms Davis a Fort Worth Democrat held forth on the floor of the State Senate last month against a Republican bill severely limiting abortion Cheered on by a packed gallery and hundreds of other supporters in the halls of the Capitol in Austin and thousands watching a live stream of the proceedings the telegenic 50yearold single mother of two was able to stop the bill  if only as it turned out for three weeks She was an overnight sensation In short order she pumped life into the moribund Texas Democratic Party recharged the states womens movement raised nearly 1 million in two weeks for her reelection campaign and not least was beseeched by supporters and some in her party to run for governor in 2014 which might be a quixotic quest in a state that has not elected a Democrat to that office in 20 years Now while she thinks about all that Ms Davis is going to Washington She will be the host of two fundraisers on Thursday One a 500ahead breakfast at Johnnys Half Shell a restaurant on Capitol Hill will feature House and Senate Democrats including Senators Kirsten E Gillibrand of New York and Barbara Boxer of California Later she will be the host of a happyhour fundraiser at 25 to 250 a person at Local 16 in the hip U Street neighborhood Ms Davis already has the support of major players in the capital Emilys List the twomillionmember organization focused on electing prochoice Democratic women included the senator on a recent list of potential female presidential candidates and has declared a stake in her success saying Emilys List helped elect Wendy Davis to the Texas State Legislature in 2008 and supported her competitive reelection campaign in 2012 Behind her ascent in the political arena is this network of powerful women organizations and advocates principally Annies List a 10yearold Austinbased organization that with about 6000 donors and 26000 supporters recruits trains and finances female Democratic candidates in Texas Senator Davis has a stellar record Annies Lists executive director Grace Garcia a 58yearold native of San Antonio Texas said by phone from Austin We have been standing strong behind her since 2008 when we recruited her to run for the Texas Senate in a swing district seat held by a 20year incumbent At that time Ms Davis who had put herself through junior college Texas Christian University and Harvard Law School was serving in the Fort Worth City Council and practicing law She won an uphill battle then and won another tough fight for reelection last year This month Annies List handed the senator 50000 to help kick off her campaign for reelection next year It wont be a cakewalk said Ms Garcia a former deputy in the Clinton White House and a senior adviser in the State Department under former Secretary of State Hillary Rodham Clinton As to all the talk about Ms Daviss possible candidacy for governor Ms Garcia seemed cautious I believe that Texas will be a better state if she were our governor she said But the important question is is Texas ready Texas political experts suggest that Ms Davis has little chance of winning the governors race pointing to the Republicans strong record in the Lone Star State their millionaire contributors and the fundraising ability of the frontrunning Republican candidate Attorney General Greg Abbott The Texas Tribune said that 2014 is looking like yet another blowout for the Republicans which means more dashed Democratic hopes of turning Texas blue or even gaining a toehold The Tribune was alluding to Battleground Texas a spinoff of the Obama 2012 campaign aimed at turning Texas the secondlargest state in the country with a big haul of electoral votes from Republican red to Democratic blue Over the past few weeks Ms Davis has said that it was an honor to be mentioned as a possible candidate for governor but that she would be disappointed if Democrats did not field a serious candidate for that office prompting some people to believe she might run despite the odds She will be very strategic about looking at the landscape Ms Garcia told me It may not be 2014 Ms Daviss most powerful political benefactor Amber Anderson Mostyn a 42yearold trial lawyer who is the board chair of Annies List said in an email last week When she was recruited by Annies List in 2008 to challenge a 20year incumbent senator I knew that Wendy had the strength and tenacity to win with Annies Lists support Notably she did not mention a possible Davis candidacy for governor This is relevant because Ms Mostyn and Annies List have been Ms Daviss biggest contributors I have always wanted Wendy to be my governor Ms Mostyn said in an article in The New Republic magazine this month But I dont want everyone to get carried away with the events of the day without the mathematics having changed Ms Mostyn and her husband Steve Mostyn run a lucrative law practice in Houston They have made millions on insurance litigation and rank among the biggest Democratic financial backers They contributed 52 million in the 2012 cycle to super PACs the independent political action committees ranking 17 among top donors nationally according to the Center for Public Integrity Their contribution to super PACs is modest compared with donations from fellow Texans like Harold Simmons 309 million and the late Bob Perry 235 million both Republican patrons The Mostyns also seeded Battleground Texas with a 250000 check according to Texas Monthly Battleground Texas got its footing early this year and is said to be searching for viable Democratic candidates to run for statewide office Ms Davis seems a likely candidate for a statewide run But without the fullthroated political and financial support of Ms Mostyn she could hardly make it Whatever Ms Davis decides to do next her rise nationally could not have happened at a better time for womens rights groups which are facing hardline conservatives in Congress and in state legislatures a legacy of the 2010 midterm elections which swept Tea Party candidates into office The 2010 election really changed the composition of many of the state legislatures creating an environment where antichoice restrictions are getting more traction said Julie Rikelman the litigation director of the US program of the New Yorkbased Center for Reproductive Rights Her organization along with Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union of Texas is considering a court challenge of the Texas abortion law which bans abortions after 20 weeks and imposes strict health regulations on state abortion clinics For Annies List Wendy Davis has been a boon to its campaign to elect more women like Annise Parker the mayor of Houston and Mary Gonzalez of El Paso the second openly gay State House representative Weve been ruled by Tea Party Republicans Ms Garcia said Weve been battling in red Texas for 10 years For us its a battle district by district Im very hopeful we have reached a turning point
"Pro-Baby, but Stingy With Money to Support Them",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/24/business/economy/pro-baby-but-not-in-an-economic-sense.html,Conservatives have a particularly soft spot for babies They tend to have more children than liberals and they are much more likely to oppose abortion rights They also appreciate babies power In December Ross Douthat wrote an OpEd column for The New York Times titled More Babies Please which noted that the United States relatively high birthrates would give it an edge against aging rivals around the world But there is an odd inconsistency in conservatives stance on procreation many also support some of the harshest cuts in memory to government benefit programs for families and children First Focus an advocacy group for childfriendly policies will release on Wednesday its latest Childrens Budget which shows how federal spending on children has declined more than 15 percent in real terms from its high in 2010 when the fiscal stimulus law raised spending on programs like Head Start and K12 education Some school districts have been forced to fire teachers cut services and even shorten the school week Head Start has cut its rolls Families have lost housing support And the 2014 budget passed by Republicans in the House cuts investments in children further  sharply reducing money for the Departments of Education Labor and Health and Human Services Birth rates have dropped precipitously since the onset of the recession six years ago  to 632 per 1000 women of childbearing age in 2011 the lowest at least since 1920 The total fertility rate of American women  the number of children they will bear in a lifetime  fell to 19 the lowest in a quartercentury well below the 21 children per woman needed to maintain a stable population The abrupt decline has multiple causes including less immigration from Latin America where women tend to have more children Bruce Sacerdote an economist at Dartmouth College who has studied fertility surmises that the deep recession and weak recovery produced enormous pessimism about the future prompting many families to postpone plans to have children But perhaps the biggest factor affecting families decisions to delay childbearing cut back on their numbers of children or even forgo having babies entirely is the cost of rearing them either in money or the value of womens time It is all about the costs and the opportunity costs for women notes Professor Sacerdote After more than a decade of stagnant incomes many families stressed by the rising cost of providing an education to their children appear to have concluded they are too costly Fertility can rebound It has done so before Birthrates plummeted in the 1960s and 1970s as women by the tens of millions opted out of their traditional role as housewives and mothers went to college and got jobs  postponing and often forgoing what until then had been the classical American family of a single male breadwinner and a stayathome mother In economists terms womens opportunity cost of children rose By the middle of the 1970s the fertility rate of American women fell to just over 17 children from 27 a decade earlier But fertility didnt continue to fall By 1990 it had bounced back to around 21 the rate needed to stabilize the population In an important study Professor Sacerdote and his Dartmouth colleagues James Feyrer and Ariel Dora Stern noted that families worked out a way for women to accommodate children and a job In 1975 women performed threequarters of the family hours devoted to child care according to the Multinational Time Use Study By 1995 they performed 60 percent In 2012 men in families with children under 6 spent 59 percent as much time as women performing primary child care duties compared with 45 percent in 2003 This shift in cultural norms within American families can explain why fertility in the United States is higher than in many other advanced nations  places like Japan Germany Spain and Hong Kong where women still shoulder an overwhelming share of child care But though American families may have adapted better than others to womens march into the labor force the United States lags far behind in providing the government support that makes it easier for many couples to start a family There is widespread evidence that government assistance to families increases fertility Frances generous child subsidies for instance have been credited with lifting that nations fertility rate above 2 from about 175 in the mid1990s A study in Quebec found that increasing benefits to new parents by 1000 Canadian dollars increased the probability of having a child by 169 percent One study in Sweden traced its higher fertility compared to other Scandinavian countries to government programs like paid leave and subsidized day care which made it easier for mothers to work None of this comes cheap But even conservative thinkers like Gary S Becker the Nobel laureate from the University of Chicago readily acknowledge that government can combat low fertility by subsidizing education or other costs of children Since children are expensive over their first 20 years or so subsidies have to be big per child to have a sizable effect he told me in a recent interview at his office Mr Douthat too has consistently argued for more familyfriendly government policies There are some troubling trends that suggest that fertility rates will not simply rebound as the economy recovers Womens participation in the labor force has stagnated over the last 13 years after growing by leaps and bounds for decades In 1990 the United States had the sixthhighest share of women in the labor force among 22 advanced countries in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development By 2010 its rank had fallen to 17th This suggests increasing tension between womens responsibilities at work and at home In a study this year Francine D Blau and Lawrence M Kahn of Cornell found that the labor supply of American women fell compared to those of other rich countries partly because the United States does not provide the generous family benefits common in the rest of the industrial world  like direct subsidies for children mandatory paid maternity leave and free child care Helping children particularly those from families with modest means provides a real payoff for society A study in the journal Demography found that families dedicated spending on children roughly doubled between the 1970s and the middle of last decade  to 2217 on average in 2005 and 2006 driven mainly by spending on education Parents appear to know that children require more investment in the form of time and money than even in the recent past if only because changes in the labor market provide a greater premium for education and training wrote the authors Sabino Kornrich of the University of Sydney and Frank Furstenberg of the University of Pennsylvania The richest families increased spending the most The top 10 percent of families trebled their investments in their children The poor couldnt keep up By mid2005 the poorest 10 percent of families were spending nearly 14 percent of their income on specific investments in children  on top of basics like food and shelter The future of fertility may hinge on whether something can be done to ease the burden If conservatives truly believe that the United States needs more babies they might temper their hostility to programs that help families afford them

One of You Will Be the Next Mayor of New York,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/magazine/smile-one-of-you-is-going-to-be-the-next-mayor-of-new-york.html,The last honesttoGod election in New York City began on the day the World Trade Center towers fell 911 was Primary Day till the voting booths shuttered that morning And in the dozen years since New Yorkers have witnessed a great buckling of the political landscape three terms of Michael Bloomberg coming after eight years of Rudolph Giuliani Even if you stipulate as the GOP kingmakers know that Rudy and Mike are not real Republicans the fact remains the most progressive city west of Amsterdam and east of San Francisco has not elected a Democrat since 1989 New York City stands at a crossroads Things are good for many but not for all The balance between the positives and the hazards could swing either way In the first couple of years after the Great Recession the economys growth nearly 3 percent per year outpaced the rise in national GDP In 2011 66 percent of the citys households had income greater than 200000 a year while a third of the citys population survives on Medicaid Manhattan has become a tech rival to Silicon Valley and bike lanes have come to Brownsville  a Brooklyn neighborhood where 4 out of 10 residents live below the poverty line Wall Street Midtown and the NYPD are happy Crime continues to decline only one precinct in East New York has more violent crime than the Upper East Side faced two decades ago And the population is growing For all the fears of jihad the end of capitalism and the advent of superstorms the years since 911 have witnessed the arrival of a new generation Perhaps as many as a third of the citys residents did not live here a decade ago And all those newcomers have contributed to the prize of this electoral season the minority majority I followed the campaign for eight months as the pack running for City Hall grew to a dozen In pain and sympathy I watched the marathon of mayoral forums  there have been more than a hundred this year alone And Ive seen each of the candidates up close I watched them on the stump listened to them go off the record observed them endure tales of complaint They heard about the rise in racial profiling publicschool field tests utility rates pushcartvendor fees and fatal subway pushings Theyve debated the wisdom of punishing johns deploying police drones and massacring rats And theyve vowed to wage war on postSandy mold the inequality of garbageremoval services and the sufferings of Central Park carriage horses Witnessed up

is set to break over the city Voters must choose not only the mayor but also the comptroller public advocate the borough presidents and nearly half of the City Council come this fall The campaign is a carnival and yet in rare bright moments it can seem a hopeful ennobling pluralistic spectacle For all the pandering and patronage you also see flickers of unfashionable civic spirit of New Yorkers devoted to their city As much as he loved to be the engineer in charge Bloomberg also took the twostepsforwardoneandahalfstepsback gains of the Giuliani years and recast the citys image from ungovernable to improvable The worry that hangs over the longest race for City Hall in New York history is whether any of these 11 men and 1 woman can keep that prospect alive A NEW DAWN FOR THE DEMOCRATS On the frigid night of Martin Luther King Jrs actual birthday in January the Rev Al Sharpton was presiding over the years first major Democratic mayoral forum The House of Justice the headquarters of his National Action Network is no more than a storefront its walls covered with outsize mirrors and enlarged portraits of Sharpton  cover shots from the glory days Nearly 400 men and women sat in coats on hard chairs listening intently and when spurred by a catch word or cue heckling Outside on the snowy sidewalk of 145th Street loudspeakers blasted the goingson and young men

as the noname who came within 46 percentage points of defeating Bloomberg the last time around Bill de Blasio the public advocate holds an elected office few could define and whose position he admits is largely a bully pulpit In the far corner in a chair angled slightly askew sat Christine C Quinn speaker of the City Council for seven years and the politician who has been depending on your vantage either the mayors most loyal partner or most powerful critic and who had not coincidentally since she assumed the job the best odds to succeed him in City Hall Sharpton has long since shed the bulk and anger that accompanied his rise in the political arena in the days when he too once dreamed of the mayoralty On this occasion he played the urbane host He asked the candidates to address the distinct problems of the black and Latino communities We live in the Big Apple he said and we cant get a bite The candidates delivered their set pieces but they formed an anxious chorus They cherrypicked from one another recycling glib hits on Bloomberg his demonizing of teachers union busting and subversion of democracy They refrained though from lateral attacks When Thompson stood his left hand dipped into a trouser pocket The message was clear The race is long folks Im in no rush At 60 Billy Thompson possesses a courtly bearing and a calm voice The knock as he knows well is that hes too soft to win Soon after this gathering I would hear Thompson defend himself before a group of business and civic leaders in Midtown Its New York City he said If you dont scream and if you dont holler youre mildmannered If you dont try and throw someone down the stairs you lack fire in the belly In Harlem Thompson asked What is it that distinguishes me from my colleagues Then he answered My

thrust a fist into the air before speaking The comptroller possesses the bearing and subtlety of a linebacker His square head is buzzed at the sides He is a rival strategist tells me with envy the Energizer Bunny of the campaign With a madcap populism Liu is prone to disquisitions so extensive that a listener grows fearful of their destination He likes to warn of the coming feudalism for instance when the serfs and peasants are held hostage to the lords and barons hoping and praying that they dont leave the city His Flushing staccato can come rapidfire but he can also downshift in a moment his voice slowing as if freighted with compassion In Harlem the amplitude worked Liu connected He gave thanks to Reverend Sharpton and the legacy of Dr King for giving me this level playing field His incredible colleagues he said nodding to the cast on stage have spent entire careers in politics and government Their families he added gaining speed have been in government Me Im an immigrant The line unexpected and revelatory scored the nights high note Brother Liu the shouts came You tell it Brother Liu On a later occasion he would go further My neck Liu would say is still stamped Made in Taiwan  When de Blasio rose it was hard at first to track his words At 6foot5 he towered over the crowd De Blasio may not be a graceful presence but he is at home on the soapbox As public advocate he has posted 220 videos to date on his YouTube channel with its 58 subscribers He held the cord of the microphone in his left hand  la Sinatra as he unspooled a string of oneliners He bemoaned that were living a tale of two cities denounced the mayors illgotten gains the third term and insisted that he had stood up to Bloomberg I have never hesitated to take him on de Blasio thundered I dont care how many billions he has As her rivals took their turns Quinn sat placidly in the corner Yet when she spoke of Ray Kelly the police commissioner and said any mayor would be lucky to have him the boos poured forth She stood her ground and by the evenings close comporting herself as always more with the air of a hostess than coequal the speaker bussed each of her rivals The House of Justice emptied Except for Liu who stayed on grinning eager to shake the last hand WHY THE ONES WITH THE LEAST ARE SOUGHT AFTER THE MOST Since winter the Democrats have been fixated on the first finish line the runoff To win the primary on Sept 10 a candidate must gain at least 40 percent of the vote Among the Democrats given the number of contestants a runoff between the top two finishers  to take place on Oct 1  is all but assured Despite the recent electoral history registered Democrats still outnumber Republicans six to one in the city As a result its tough to find any observer  even among the real estate finance or legal elites  who does not expect the Democratic primary to signal the eventual winner on Nov 5 Historians though may look back at this election as the minority majority watershed  when nonwhite voters made up as much as 58 percent of the Democratic primary and a bit less of the general election The 2010 census pegged the citys nonwhite population at 67 percent In large part the minority majority is immigrant But it is by no means unified Political scientists talk less about Catholics and Jews and Latinos and blacks now and more about a raft of surging forces Orthodox Jews and Spanishspeaking Pentecostals new arrivals from the Caribbean and South Asia This race will bring the trend lines long coursing out of view to the surface the citys diversity is becoming ever more diverse Manhattan is getting whiter as the ethnic and religious mix of Brooklyn Queens the Bronx and even Staten Island deepens The Asian community as Liu told me is growing rapidly  everywhere Asians Liu insists will make up 15 percent of the primary vote while Stephen Levin the City Council member whose district includes Williamsburg predicts a 30 percent jump in turnout among the Satmar Hasidim The candidates will swear to the need to build coalitions Racebased politics they insist are a thing of the past  like the bosses who ruled Tammany or a billionaire willing to spend at least 174 on every vote as Bloomberg did in 2009 But in practice they resort to the tactics of old pitting the outer boroughs against Manhattan and playing to a perceived ethnic religious or racial base The demographics though foretell another reckoning The realities of the minority majority have not yet been internalized according to Bruce Gyory a veteran political consultant If a mayoral candidate starts with a white base he wrote in an email to win a runoff or a twoperson general election they would have to carry 40 percent of the aggregate minority vote to win On the other hand Gyory continued if a mayoral candidate begins with a unified minority base  no easy feat he noted  they would need onethird of the white vote to win When we first spoke Gyory was without a horse in the race By spring he was advising the Thompson campaign TURNING GARBAGE INTO POLITICAL THEATER On East 93rd Street at a senior center in Yorkville Gardens the smell of disinfectant floated up from the carpet and the candidates came one by one to stand in the firstfloor rec room before a baby grand to address another overflowing swarm It was early on a cold soggy Saturday in February Liu Thompson and de Blasio trooped through before Quinn After her Albanese would find the room nearly empty The attendees devoured Quinn It was an ugly sight a confluence of seniors and wellheeled professionals shouting her down At issue was the citys plan to build a garbage facility on East 91st Street inaptly named a marine transfer station The dump on the edge of the East River was a sore point for the crowd Garbage trucks would ascend to it along an access ramp cutting through Asphalt Green home to the neighborhoods littleleague and soccer fields Hang on Quinn yelled If you want an answer you have to listen You can scream and yell You could throw soft things after but you have got to let me answer The shouts only gained force Not getting my vote one woman near me cried Not my vote either another said Afterward riding with her in her city Suburban I marveled at the cool Quinn displayed in enemy territory She knew she told me the reception would be chilly Why then did she come  Cause you gotta go she shot back before going into a soliloquy on respect But many in the crowd I ventured would seem to be her constituents women working and white True she said but you cant always get everyone to agree I reminded her of a phrase Id heard her deploy often We may not always agree but if we sit at the table long enough we can find a solution She cut me short There isnt a creative solution to everything Days later I noticed a headline in The Post Posh East Side Trash Talkers Boo Quinn then a glowing editorial titled Quinns Trash Talk Good for her The Post gushed for having the guts to speak the truth while standing in the lions den Id been played Quinns team suggested I come They wanted me to see the angry crowd and the candidate with strength and principles who could stand up to it It was a performance I realized intended to capture the spirit of the man Quinn reveres and who had recently died Ed Koch The speaker is a tangle of incongruities a study in selfcontrol and unfettered impulse She can crack a knuckle in my presence and apologize at once I know Kim hates it too she says referring to Kim Catullo the corporate lawyer she married last year She can massage backtrack and selfreveal all in one breath She alone among the candidates picks me out of a crowd hastens to say hello She is known too for a lack of polish The tongue to be sure is salty BlackRock is focused on veterans [expletive] she said when I noted a writing pad bearing the logo of the worlds largest asset manager on her conference table Stuff she added with a smile once again correcting herself Quinn can walk me through the brambles of the city budget and the successive scandals over the byzantine City Council earmarks the socalled slushfund investigation  a probe of the City Councils hidden use of money accounts with fictitious names  and a separate inquiry into members financial fraud that put three of her Council colleagues in prison She can shed her porcelain veneer turn testy admit it and inspire sympathy But for a candidate who has spent much of the race apparently preferring to see herself in the mayors company than her competitors Quinn bristles at comparisons with Bloomberg The mayor and I have a great working relationship she told me We dont agree on everything but we recognize that were both two smart competent people who have focused on where we could find agreement and commonality THE NEW URBAN FEAR MOLD On a clear night in winter the circus set up in East New York Beneath hulking projects in the darkness beyond the St Paul Community Baptist Church glowed in a wash of klieg lights A NY1 TV truck about a dozen cops and a line of young whites marked the spot St Pauls is cavernous its vaulted wooden ceiling lends it the feel of a barn Six candidates sat below Two were Republicans Joe Lhota the newest entrant and Tom Allon at the time a communitynewspaper and magazine executive On a stage that has hosted every mayor since Koch the six took on a single topic housing We expect all the candidates to say theyre for affordable housing and for more senior housing and lowincome housing said the Rev David Brawley speaking into a headset microphone But that aint good enough The facts he said tell an epic story replete with highs and lows The pastor raised the specter of 1977  the last time the city faced a race as wide open and diverse  and what has been called the death spiral that threatened the city But even Koch the unlikely winner of that election he hastened to add built 190000 units of affordable housing The candidates made their own vows  at least 60000 units over four years was the figure they settled on Once again they rushed to outdo one another and again revealed more similarities than differences Lhota was strangely mute  not uttering a word for the first 31 minutes When at last he spoke he fell quiet again within three minutes Liu talked of unscrupulous landlords echoing Quinn De Blasio again lamented the tale of two cities Remember the numbers he roared One percent of our pensionfund money goes into investments like affordable housing Thompson reprised a favored line We are being squeezed and priced out of the City of New York before Quinn retold a keynote of what aides call her story My parents were able to rent a rentcontrolled twobedroom in Inwood Thats how she said they managed on a firefighters salary to send their daughters to college On it went until a white man from South Brooklyn with cropped gray hair and a goatee spoke about life after Sandy about sewage and seawater mold and a FEMA trailer His neighborhood he said might lose more homes after Sandy than during Red pen in hand de Blasio leapt to respond offering a fourpoint plan to address the mold problem  before Liu threw a jab Its quite possible that Bloomberg he said does not know what mold is Laughter filled the pews but the night soon threatened to turn maudlin Rossana from Brownsville spoke of more mold her two daughters and son and asthma De Blasio said he could sympathize pulling an inhaler from inside his suit coat His family too suffers from asthma Sandy was a disaster he said But the grim state of public housing in New York City goes back to its birth he said Because Robert Moses didnt like people of color and didnt like poor people Allon though might have scored the most oneliners Early on de Blasio turned to him and whispered Jesus and asked how he came up with them Brevity Allon replied is the soul of wit Months later when I asked why hed entered the race Allon said I thought a Jewish guy son of Holocaust survivors former publicschool teacher business entrepreneur a reasonably articulate and thoughtful person could do well By then however he had dropped out TOO MANY REPUBLICANS One Sunday in late winter I went to the Clearview Golf Course clubhouse in Bayside Queens to spend the afternoon with the Northeast Queens Republican Club For years the Republican Party has cleared the field getting the man or woman its leaders want to run The state leadership has a pretty good handle on their people says Bill Cunningham a consultant who once worked for Pat Moynihan and served as Mayor Bloombergs first spokesman And they usually do as told Not this time By March four men were in the race on the Republican side Lhota Allon George T McDonald an advocate for the homeless and head of the Doe Fund and John A Catsimatidis a billionaire known as the Gristedes guy but whose portfolio resembles an oligarchs supermarkets condo towers airplanes and oil and gas Catsimatidis wanted to run in 2009 He even had the nomination he told me But the mayor he said called him to his townhouse and declared that he wanted to run This time Catsimatidis told me there will be no retreat In Queens after the Pledge of Allegiance and a moment of silence for the troops Lhota unfurled a brief story of his life Behind him a string of helium balloons formed a rainbow of red white and blue Before him three dozen of the faithful sat in tight rows New York City is in my blood Lhota said Im one of the few candidates running who was actually born here One grandfather was a firefighter the other drove a cab Lhota dresses smart as it used to be said fitted blue blazer four brass buttons on the sleeves striped tie coralblue shirt trim coppergray beard A cue card tucked in his hands names of locals to thank he searched for connections to Queens I was born in the Bronx son of a New York City cop a lieutenant who came to the 105th Precinct when promoted to sergeant in Queens Lhota is known as a tough guy famous for flipping off a Times reporter but when he speaks his pursed lips betray an endearing lisp I never did live in Queens he said but I took my freshman year at St Johns in Jamaica  so I did travel to Queens all the time Lhota was here only to introduce himself A former investment banker he served Giuliani for eight years ultimately as deputy mayor of operations  basically he said the COO of the city Lhota stood his progressive ground Im really at odds with the national party he said I never called myself a militant libertarian  he assured one questioner He was not proabortion he added but prochoice When a questioner bit hard dragging him through his stance on everything from the 1999 Brooklyn Museum show that featured a painting of the Virgin Mary that incorporated elephant dung to Kendras Law to expansions of the rights of the transgendered Lhota delivered a calm reply teeth clenched without the hint of a smile One of the young Republicans seated up front asked about cutting red tape on the Second Amendment I have always been known to be someone who can cut red tape Lhota said But when it comes to having firearms in New York City I am one of the people who believe as the son of a cop we need to be certain if youre going to own a firearm you need to get a background check With a halfshake of the head he added I dont find that a violation of the Second Amendment Im sorry Lhota had silenced not only the young Republican but the whole room The afternoon ended as it opened The club members repaired to the bar where amid views of the halffrozen greens they aired the question posed by the club chairman who had introduced Lhota Are Republicans relevant Daniel Halloran was Lhotas host in Queens A ruddyfaced gingerhaired Republican one of 4 in the 51seat City Council Halloran ran for Congress in 2012 He gained fame when it was revealed he was a Theodist a follower of a neopagan faith that worships Norse gods but he lost to Grace Meng the first Asian in the city elected to Congress  a triumph spoken of in fear or delight and plied as proof of the Asian muscle Halloran winced recalling how Mengs father was indicted days after her election for a bribery scheme In March Jimmy Meng was sentenced to a month in jail after pleading guilty to wire fraud The problem isnt Grace per se Halloran told me as Lhota waited his turn at the podium The problem is the machine around the Asian candidates It has he added been willing to cut corners Within weeks Halloran himself was arrested awakened by FBI agents at his home in Queens The preposterous scheme filled the tabloids Malcolm Smith a powerful state senator from Queens who was also arrested had been angling to buy a legal exemption to run in the Republican mayoral primary Two days before Lhota appeared at the golf club Halloran prosecutors claim accepted 5000 in cash from an undercover agent He took the money the prosecutors said for brokering meetings with Queens party bosses Halloran was caught on tape with an acknowledgment more honest than any I would hear in nearly 90 interviews Thats politics he said Its all about how much Not about whether or will its about how much and thats our politicians in New York theyre all like that all like that And they get like that because of the drive that the money does for everything else You cant do anything without the [expletive] money A NEW ATTRACTION AT THE CARNIVAL At 6 am on a muggy morning in late May at the intersection of 125th Street and Malcolm X Boulevard the first TV truck pulled up By 730 the number had grown to 10 There were videographers from Japan and reporters from Scandinavia Anthony Weiner stood across from an empty lot One of the first hands he shook belonged to a toddler His new communications director Barbara Morgan hovered close after a first nearsleepless night on the job A scattering of volunteers scurried around her trying to look busy Come on guys she pleaded Were doing the avail in five Weiners public debut in a campaign long deemed impossible lured a press scrum not seen since the NYPD pulled Dominique StraussKahn off an Air France plane at JFK Passersby could not come close to Weiner Certainly not Wallace Smallwood Smallwood who was 48 was born in the South and raised in the South Bronx He said he used to work in a parking garage in Midtown For the last seven years though hed been homeless He had not come to see Weiner Hed been on the street that morning kicked out early from the shelter around the corner Smallwood spoke softly He had no interest in Weiners use and abuse of social media He had one simple question about shelters services Would he do a little more to help the coalition of single men than just a runin and runout A reporter displayed the mornings Daily News holding up the mock cover buried inside The headline screamed a reminder of the sexting scandal Weiner leapt to volley Actually they did not put that on their front page he said Did they What I learned today here he went on is that people are going to make their determination based on the interests that they think are important If citizens want to talk to me about my personal failings thats their right and Im going to do everything I can to answer them Weiner a young black man shouted you got my vote brother After half an hour Weiner was on the No 2 downtown en route to his first radio interview as a candidate The subway car filled with reporters eager to tweet his every word and movement A woman wearing a black hijab tried to avert her eyes Its too early for this a white man in a suit grunted Photographers stood on seats one took to the floor Through it all Weiner tried to crack wise Its kind of like being on injured reserve for two years he said  a refrain he would deploy often in the days to come By Penn Station few commuters remained and the Muslim woman sneaked a peek At 844 am back aboveground the flood of drama the highwater mark in the campaign to date receded What remained was a sad diminished spectacle that revealed the atrophied state of our press corps and candidate pool Weiner and a halfdozen young men and women digital recorders aloft marching down Seventh Avenue South The wide sidewalks downtown were near empty gray under grayer skies The freakish buoyancy of the morning had given way to normalcy a presummer morning in the late Bloomberg era cyclists in suits strollers two abreast en route to preK In the campaigns first hour Weiner had grabbed the hands of a few dozen citizens been ribbed by commuters and construction workers and delivered minimonologues on favored themes a singlepayer health care system for all New Yorkers and protecting the middle class On the subway platform a poster advertised a new horror film The Purge And no matter how long I watched the candidate on his redemption tour one of his frequent declarations lingered the longest I heard it first on the No 2 downtown As the reporters poured out and the commuters filled their wake Weiner bid his fellow passengers goodbye It seemed a nice gesture but one that accidentally gave voice to the silent echo of his campaign My apologies he said for the inconvenience WHAT IS THIS RACE ABOUT Quinn walked out at 1 pm on a Wednesday in late May wearing a steely blue jacket and gray slacks It was a routine news conference  nothing exciting Twice a month every year since she became speaker Quinn has stood behind this lectern in the red room a municipal imitation of the White House press room its brass seal stamped with the year 1625 and emblazoned with a sailor clothed an Indian naked but for a loincloth and a wreath of Latin Sigillum Civitatis Novi Eboraci The Seal of the City of New York to face the press But this was Quinns first time in public since Weiner joined the fray  and almost immediately dispelled the idea that she had a lock on the race By May Quinn had dropped in the polls from a high of 37 percent who supported her to 25 percent The tableau of the Council members onstage  an ItalianAmerican a Haitianborn American a ChineseAmerican an AfricanAmerican with Caribbean roots and a Jewish Brooklynite  was an undeniable reflection of the city itself diversity ego and inevitable imperfections As they took turns at the lectern enumerating the needs of constituents and thanking partners Quinn measured out their allotted time with the affected ease of a talkshow host The members got their cameos but the stage as always was Quinns At 123 pm she sounded the bell Any questions on the legislation City Hall reporters know the drill They can pose questions pertaining only to the issues the speaker has voiced Anything else  anything offtopic  must come at the end in the final throes of the news conference By 126 pm the rainbow of Council members was gone Im gonna have to go offtopic here Quinn said A camerawoman in the back of the room shouted from behind her tripod Do you have a comment about Weiner On cue Quinn uncorked a cackle What a welldeveloped and you know a surprising question She went on Anthony Weiner has joined the race for mayor as is his right to do But that really doesnt change my perspective or plan in this race at all She seemed to hold every facial muscle in check Look this is a race about the future of New York City Her body stiffened jaw tightened and arms locked onto the lectern And from my perspective the job of the next mayor is to make New York City a greater place for opportunity for all of those hardworking folks and hardworking families out there whore trying so hard to get to the middle class or stay in the middle class Quinn flipped through her record of preventing the layoff of teachers of fighting for the rights of tenants of expanding manufacturing jobs in Brooklyn during the recession of tangible results that have made peoples lives better But the air had changed Those present witnessed a rare moment the transformation of a politician A speaker in cruise control had become a candidate in defensivedriver mode Weiner was the catalyst but the rumblings had been there for months  the drag on her ability to take flight as one strategist on the sidelines put it For those who dislike Quinn its a wealth of negatives blunt edges a perceived coziness with developers subservience to the mayor above all the Faustian entanglement on term limits She gets things done many argue but at what cost Thats the record Im running on Quinn said And regardless of who enters the race theres no one in the race or no one on the horizon who quite frankly has a record as detailed and long as mine of delivering for New Yorkers So thats what Im gonna talk about Except she was confronted by a stream of questions about Weiner Could she rate the job he did in Washington She balked Its not my job to analyze Anthony Weiners record What did she think of his asking for a second chance She shot back Thats a question for voters and for New Yorkers to answer And when a reporter persisted  You shared your own experiences during your own difficulties Do you think he deserves the second chance  she ended the show You know thats a question hes asked and you know New Yorkers are gonna have to answer it You know Im proud about what Ive been able to overcome in my life by asking for help and getting help But thats a question that happened with former Congressman Weiner that hes going to have to go out there and talk to New Yorkers about  that very different situation Thank you thank you    WAITING FOR A YUSUF Two clocks hang over the race One marks time in the race for the mayoralty the other in the battle to define the Bloomberg legacy An actual countdown clock as the mayor calls it hangs in City Hall in the Bullpen the warren of carrels where Bloomberg holds court The clock a redlight digital reminder on the wall in the snack corner above the highgrain cereals and freshcut fruit marks the mayors remaining days in office and implores the staff to Make Every Day Count The third term the mayors aides say may end up as Bloombergs most ambitious The East Midtown rezoning is scheduled for a vote by years end The rush is on Liu says to squeeze the money out of New Yorks air But Bloomberg the candidates note with more envy than dismay has defied the politics of old This mayor is a oneoff is how Lou Harris the father of American political polling now 92 put it to me Bloombergs destroyed whatever was still standing of machine politics Harris added Hes broken all the rules for a long time to come Yet the mayor has also bequeathed a contradiction the man who has everything cannot find a loyal heir Many of the candidates have been campaigning as Thompson admitted since Mike Bloomberg appeared on the scene Act 1 was Quinns coronation waltz This is your year Mickey Carroll the veteran political reporter who runs the Quinnipiac polls told her at Kochs funeral in February Act 2 was the return of the prodigal son Weiner a performance that began in this magazine Today as the curtain rises on Act 3 it may be easy to predict wholl lose but not who will win As the numbers shift each campaign fears a Yusuf political shorthand for the shooting in the summer of 1989 of Yusuf Hawkins the 16yearold AfricanAmerican killed by white youths in Bensonhurst Things always happen to change the equation Bill Cunningham told me Something comes up that scrambles the race The list is campaign lore John Lindsay buried by the snowstorm of 69 Koch verging on a fourth term until Hawkinss murder tipped the nomination to David Dinkins and the unprecedented a Wall Street entrepreneur better known in Davos than the Bronx who was doubledigits behind the Democrats when the twin towers collapsed and spent 70 million to win the election Three candidates  Quinn Weiner and Thompson  lead the Democratic polls In a rare moment near winters end a strategist for one of them came clean There is one thing that keeps me up at night he said Its the Big Question I could hear the capital letters rise as his pitch dropped What is that thing thats going to happen Because you know it anything can happen And it always does Its New York
"Economics, and Humanity, of Abortion Bill",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/us/economics-and-humanity-of-abortion-bill.html,Six years ago a major antiabortion bill stalled in the Texas House after a 1 billion price tag was attached  There were major differences in that bill and the one that passed this year The 2007 legislation was a trigger bill that would have outlawed abortions in Texas if the United States Supreme Court had overturned its Roe v Wade ruling  The Legislative Budget Board estimated that ending abortions would result in the births of nearly 65000 more babies a year At the time about 55 percent of births in Texas were paid for with Medicaid it rose to 56 percent by 2009 the most recent year available and the agencys estimate was that the cost to the state and federal governments would start at just over 1 billion in every twoyear budget The author of that bill former Representative Warren Chisum Republican of Pampa still thinks that price tag was inflated for political reasons Theres more than one way to kill a bill he said Back in those days a fiscal note was the way to do it  Even though Mr Chisum chaired the House Appropriations Committee and was a member of the budget board his legislation never made it to the floor for a vote And even if the logic of that budget board analysis was correct this years legislation signed this month by Gov Rick Perry doesnt ban all abortions in the state It outlaws most abortions after 20 weeks requires abortion clinics to meet higher medical standards than current law dictates requires doctors to be present to administer abortioninducing drugs and requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals The 2007 bill would have ended all abortions and its relatively easy to put a number to that In 2011 the most recent year for which figures are available 70003 pregnancies were terminated in Texas according to the Department of State Health Services The new Texas law will make it more difficult for women in some parts of the state to obtain abortions and might close some of the clinics that now provide abortions but it is much more difficult to say how many babies might be born that would not have been  Without that number it is difficult to estimate a cost to the state  if there is one and if people want to talk about it  Sometimes you scratch your head at the logic Senator Glenn Hegar Republican of Katy one of the sponsors of this years legislation said when asked about that earlier fiscal note and why no cost was attached to his bill These debates slide back and forth between economic and human costs  sometimes about the money sometimes about the people who would be helped  And sometimes as in the backandforth this year over Medicaid expansion both sides invoke money and lives Opponents argued that the expansion would lock the state into an unaffordable health care plan theres your money argument that would result in a dangerous disruption of the states health care system the health argument Proponents said it would be silly to turn down a program that would cover much of the largest uninsured population in the country the health argument and pump big bucks into the states medical economy the money thing The state didnt expand its Medicaid program and youll still find legislators across the spectrum talking about the consequences good or bad This summers debate on abortion restrictions turned entirely on politics It wasnt about the money  Close watchers of the Legislature will tell you that all of the testimony debate passion and eloquence served only to solidify positions that were already in place Not a single legislator voted in a way that surprised other legislators The vote count was never in question and it never changed  The fiscal note on the bill did not attempt to estimate the number of babies that will be born  or that would not have been born if any without the bill  and what it will cost taxpayers to deliver them It concludes that no significant fiscal implication to the state is anticipated The answer will be evident within a year as public health officials watch changes in the birth and abortion rates in the state That will be just in time for the next conversation about the budget and about Medicaid expansion
"Abortion Laws, in Texas and Ireland",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/26/opinion/abortion-laws-in-texas-and-ireland.html,To the Editor  Re The Texas Abortion Experiment column July 21 Ross Douthats analysis of the means by which Irish women obtain abortions does not represent the realities of their situation In addition to the considerable struggles of meeting the cost of travel accommodation and time off from work there is no guarantee that passage abroad will be unimpeded by the state a partner or even the medical profession Numerous cases exist in which Irish women were prevented from leaving the country and forced to endure legal proceedings prolonging psychological distress and seriously compromising medical safety by delaying care The issue is not whether these cases occur in large numbers but that they occur at all The new Texas legislation will deplete abortion clinics to the point where most women will have no option but to leave the state to get care If Ireland is the best example of what we can expect to see happen in Texas the future is bleak ABIGAIL AIKEN Cambridge England July 21 2013   The writer a doctor from Northern Ireland is a PhD candidate in reproductive health and demography at the University of Texas at Austin  To the Editor Ross Douthat ignores the reality facing Texas women Studies show that the best way to reduce unintended pregnancy and the need for abortion is through access to information and affordable birth control which is what many of the European countries highlighted by Mr Douthat offer their citizens Gov Rick Perry has done the opposite at every turn opposing sex education programs and restricting womens access to birth control and other basic care Texas has the highest rate of uninsured women in the country and to compound that Mr Perry and his allies slashed the budget for womens health closing more than 60 health centers In the Rio Grande Valley Planned Parenthood was forced to close centers that provided preventive care like birth control and cancer screenings to women in the poorest areas of the state Dozens more health centers will likely close because of the bill signed by Governor Perry last week leaving women in rural areas with nowhere to go for a safe legal abortion The alarming reality is that years of bad public policy mean that most will be left with no real options for getting the health care they need CECILE RICHARDS President Planned Parenthood Federation of America New York July 23 2013 To the Editor Ross Douthat asks What happens to a modern society when abortion is restricted Examining the case of Ireland he concludes that abortion restrictions have not harmed Irish women I suggest that he look at the experience of women in preRoe v Wade America Women had illegal abortions and were injured as a result After my illegal abortion in 1965 I was hospitalized with an infection because nonsterile instruments had been used I know other women whose illegal abortions resulted in hemorrhages We wouldnt have chosen to have abortions but unwanted pregnancies occur Reliable numbers in Ireland are probably hard to come by since most women wouldnt wish to publicize their abortions But undoubtedly some brave Irish women might talk to Mr Douthat He would learn what happens when women have no recourse to abortion services that are local legal and safe JULIE DIAMOND New York July 21 2013 To the Editor Ross Douthats column includes some important facts He says Irelands maternal health outcomes have long looked much better than those of its neighbors  maternal mortality still placed the country well within the European norm Irelands restrictions on abortion have long been known if not applauded so the consequence of better or at least status quo maternal health rates should not be surprising We should take a lesson The country by and large predominantly Catholic has a history of traditional values where each life is respected and has inviolable rights We should look to our Constitution and see how similar these ideas were at the time it was written Lets take a history lesson and learn from our own beginnings as well as from a country like Ireland JEANNE HENNESSEY Closter NJ July 21 2013

It Takes the Village,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/fin-lady-by-cathleen-schine.html,A boy in a world of selfish crazy violent colorful adults  thats how precocious Fin Hadley describes Treasure Island and Manchild in the Promised Land two books he happens to be reading in Fin  Lady Cathleen Schines bittersweet elegy for Greenwich Village in the 1960s Its also a pretty good characterization of Schines vivid comic novel itself and of the unconventional adventures that Fin no relation we are specifically told to Huck finds himself living Fin was named on a whim for the three bright white letters at the end of the movie Les Enfants du Paradis His father Hugo an irascible lawyer was hoping rightly as it turned out that Fin would be the last of his children Hugo has a beautiful daughter named Lady by a previous wife and hes convinced that shes no lady but rather decidedly a tramp Like a runaway bride in a 30s screwball comedy Lady jilts a respectable lawyer at the altar and bolts for Capri where Hugo drags his reluctant family including 5yearold Fin to retrieve her Shortly thereafter Hugo that enormous growling reality and Fins kindly mother Lydia die in grim succession Gone too are Fins grandparents proprietors of a dairy farm in Connecticut where fatherless Fin spends some pastoral years amid the ruminative cows At age 11  too old for a nap too young for a drink  hes left in the notsoreliable hands of his 24yearold half sister his guardian for better or worse The brilliant first sentence of the novel packs his sense of abandonment into 13 poignant words Fins funeral suit was a year old worn three times already too small Lady stuck in her gilded cage of material comfort finds her own life too small You can tell shes a free spirit by the car she drives way too fast a turquoise convertible Karmann Ghia and by the writers she quotes like Whitman And a mouse is miracle enough to stagger sextillions of infidels She thinks the best place to raise a child in 1964 is not in the cool cushioned ease of the uptown apartment she has inherited from her mother I really thought shed leave it all to the Whitney but rather in freakedout Greenwich Village And so it is that Fin Lady her mothers feisty AfricanAmerican maid Mabel and Fins loyal collie Gus squeeze into a halffinished and halffurnished townhouse on Charles Street  where the beatniks live Mabel says disgustedly Soon enough three suitors referred to as the Three Musketeers move in as well drinking up Ladys liquor and munching on anything in sight Biffi drinks Jack is tripping Tylers doing speed Fin remarks Its biblical    Like a cloud of locusts Schine author of the bestselling comic novel The Three Weissmanns of Westport is aware of how much of this terrain  the available heiress the domineering father the three suitors the orphaned boy the enchanted island even the disgruntled maid  is familiar But like comic writers before her from Shakespeare to Jane Austen and Evelyn Waugh she skillfully plays with the conventions and the readers expectations  for example that the charming Hungarian refugee and art dealer Biffi whose father died in classic Nabokovian fashion via picnic lightning will win out over the other two suitors the ascotwearing Tyler and the Yaleeducated Jack There are few surprises in Schines rendition of Greenwich Village 50 years ago with its Nehru jackets and desert boots pillows on the floor and rugs on the walls the reefer and the rock n roll At Fins progressive school New Flower the kids discussed the liner notes of Bob Dylan albums for Language Arts and for math arranged colored blocks But a darker note something menacing enters as the decade draws to a close Not just the war though that was there always an accompaniment like a soft drumbeat but also the police on horseback high above you with shining black boots digging into frothing sides Always everywhere there are the runaway kids on the street dirty and strung out and homeless a nightmare version of Ladys own penchant for running away from trouble Trailing smoke and scent and confusion Lady is apparently meant to embody both sides of the 60s the groovy debutante and the melancholy seeker but shes also out of sync with her times Shes too much of an individualist for example to tolerate a commune Why would she live with other people hell was other people everyone knew that In the end Lady did not take to the 60s at all Ladys attitude toward families is resolutely unconventional She has an abortion early on raises her own half brother Were a family now she tells Fin and becomes an unwed mother at a time when such a thing wasnt done When a fourth suitor an Italian photographer called Michelangelo joins her entourage he updates Tolstoy on happy families with his eloquently fractured English Families have many complicateds If such complicateds prefigure the world of samesex parents and international adoptions theyre also a hallmark of the comic genre Schine most values the nontraditional attachments of Huck and Jim floating down the Mississippi Kiplings Kim also invoked in this novel and his wandering lama in the Himalayas Jim and Long John Silver on their enchanted island and so on The slyly deceptive narration Schine has adopted for telling her story is also unconventional The reader is kept guessing until almost the end about the identity of the narrator who has heard most of the tale were reading from a much older Fin This latterday Fin has progressed beyond his cramped personal teenage misery and his big apocalyptic 60s teenage misery to become in his turn a guardian of yet another lost child For all its fixation on New York in the 60s Fin  Lady turns out to have another emotional center  Capri Homers island of the Sirens The town was full of steps and alleys Enormous lemons hung from vines The beach was tiny the harbor full of brightly painted boats There were dolphins one day The sun was high and hot Children kicked a ball in the piazzetta A bell rang    Everything seemed enchanted Every moment And Lady seemed somehow to belong on Capri    she was so at home She knew everyones name Life she seems to think is simpler in Capri because on Capri no one needed chains After all it was an island There was no place to run and so no fetters to undo Freedom of sorts Freedom for Lady anyway Freedom from all that freedom If she turns out to be wrong its because the complicateds of life as Cathleen Schines wise and wistful comic novel not so comically reminds us catch up with all of us in the end

La Lucha ContinÃºa,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/books/review/children-of-the-days-by-eduardo-galeano.html,One would think that Latin Americans after all theyve suffered from the tortures and terrors of the Spanish Inquisition to the death squads and disappearances of the cold war would have given up on the idea that history is redeemable But it seems that centuries of repression and struggle have had the opposite effect searing into their political culture a kind of irrepressible Hegelianism an ability both to recognize the dialectic lurking behind the brutality and to answer every bloody body with ever more adamant affirmations of humanity Eduardo Galeano is among the best executors of this tradition Driven first out of his own country Uruguay in 1973 after a military coup and then from Argentina after yet another coup he found refuge in postFranco Spain where he began to pioneer a new literary genre In such books as Open Veins of Latin America and the trilogy Memory of Fire Galeano wove together fact preColumbian myth and snippets from everyday life into not so much peoples histories but sprawling peoples epics Think of Pablo Neruda crossed with Howard Zinn Galeanos new Children of the Days is for those who feel that history has become too much of a burden to bear  a collection of inspirational wisdom its 366 entries one for each calendar date in the leap year keeping alive the memory of courage and beauty amid the carnage Wellknown horrors born of the conquest of America slavery the Holocaust and European colonialism take their place alongside lesserknown events and people the founding of a Brazilian community by escaped slave women for example or Simeon Stylites a Syrian Christian saint who apparently lived for 37 years atop a column a feat that for Galeano functions as a symbol for the more than one billion people who today live without decent housing Galeanos best entries reconcile opposites like the one titled The Left Is the University of the Right which notes that Rupert Murdochs youthful admiration of Karl Marx helped him master the inner workings of capitalism Galeano is no Pollyanna History tends not to move in the direction he would like in 1837 Nicaraguas Conservative Party partially legalized abortion 170 years later the leftist Sandinistas outlawed the practice  in any circumstance and thus condemned poor women to prison or the cemetery But sometimes defeat creates the possibility for future victories having lost their country to Franco Spanish Republican exiles were there among the first liberators of Nazioccupied Paris For all of Galeanos appreciation of historys absurdities he has chosen a format that leads to an ahistoric almost medieval experience of time a liturgical calendar in which the days dont move forward into the future but rather pile up into an eternal present He celebrates nonWestern peoples who experience history as repetition In the Quechua language he writes naupa means was but it also means will be  while reminding readers that moderns are stuck in their own kind of regression genocide in the 16th century looks a lot like genocide in the 20th Thus Children of the Days commemorates insurgents so audacious they thought they could stop time like the Parisian revolutionaries who on July 29 1830 took stones to the citys clocks or the Mayan peons in Mexico who on July 31 1847 rose up and seized both the plantations and the local archives eventually burning the documents that legalized their enslavement and the enslavement of their children and the enslavement of their childrens children Mostly though Galeano simply wants the word progress to live up to its hype as the title of his May 15 entry on the enormous 2011 antiausterity protest in Spain suggests May Tomorrow Be More Than Just Another Name for Today
"Moves to Restrict Abortion, in Texas and Ireland",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/opinion/moves-to-restrict-abortion-in-texas-and-ireland.html,To the Editor Re The Texas Abortion Experiment column July 21 Ross Douthats effort to explore what would happen if abortion became largely restricted by comparing the United States to European countries is yet another example of how ideological differences about a medical procedure have clouded the real issues for women that result in the need for abortion It is not the legality of abortion or the presence or absence of restrictions that drives our abortion rates It is the lack of accurate sex education for adolescents limited access to effective birth control absence of educational opportunities and indiscernible support for lowincome families As a gynecologist I am not interested in a better argument for liberalism or turning Texas blue I am interested in finding solutions to the real problems my patients experience But to do this we must move past the singularity of abortion and remove the patriarchal lenses in which women are too often viewed COLLEEN McNICHOLAS St Louis July 22 2013 Â  To the Editor Ross Douthat for all his reasonableness still comes down on the side of allowing the state to make reproductive choices for women He doesnt mention that the majority of the people making these laws mostly men are also opposed to the social safety net including food stamps for the women and children most affected by these laws Either women can make their own decisions in consultation with a medical provider or they cant If they cant and are forced to bend to the will of lawmakers who often seem to hold women in contempt then women are not really equal under the law BEVERLY FRIEDENBERG Huntington Woods Mich July 21 2013 Â  To the Editor Ross Douthat glosses over the fact that Irish women must travel to Britain or Continental Europe for legal abortions as if this is no big deal What of women who cant afford such trips who are left without options This will surely be an issue in Texas with its new restrictions on abortion And what happens if surrounding countries or in this case states follow suit Where should these women travel then This argument depends entirely on others not adopting the same prohibitive laws NORA ZELEVANSKY Sag Harbor NY July 21 2013 Â  To the Editor In 1984 Anne Lovett 15 gave birth beneath a statue of the Virgin Mary in Longford Ireland She and her child died Almost 30 years later Savita Halappanavar 31 a dentist died when doctors in Galway denied her an abortion We do not know how many others have suffered similar fates We do know that in 2011 more than 5000 women from both parts of Ireland left the country for terminations abroad How many others resort to backstreet abortions or persist in unwanted pregnancies The new Irish law leaves the ban on abortion intact so women still face life imprisonment It is the experience of real women like these that helps us understand why Irelands abortion history falls so tragically short of the needs of women in Ireland or Texas JOAN McKIERNAN Windsor NY July 22 2013 The writer is a former director of research for the Equal Opportunities Commission for Northern Ireland 
Carving Up the Country,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/27/opinion/blow-carving-up-the-country.html,Our 50 states seem to be united in name only In fact we seem to be increasingly becoming two countries under one flag Liberal Land  coastal urban and multicultural  separated by Conservative Country  Southern and Western rural and racially homogeneous Other parts of the country are a bit of a mixed bag This has led to incredible and disturbing concentrations of power As The New York Times reported after the election in November more than twothirds of the states are now under singleparty control meaning that one party has control of the governors office and has majorities in both legislative chambers This is the highest level of such control since 1952 And Republicans have singleparty control in nearly twice as many states as Democrats This is having very real consequences on the ground nowhere more clearly than on the subjects of voting rights and womens reproductive rights Almost all jurisdictions covered by Section 5 of the Voting Rights Act of 1965  the section that requires federal approval for any change in voting procedures and that the Supreme Court effectively voided last month  are in Republicancontrolled states So many of those states have wasted no time following the court ruling to institute efforts to suppress the vote in the next election and beyond Within two hours of the Supreme Court ruling Texas announced that a voter identification law that the Department of Justice had blocked for two years because Hispanic registered voters are more than twice as likely as nonHispanic registered voters to lack such identification would go into effect along with a redistricting map passed in 2011 but blocked by a federal court The department is trying to prevent those actions in Texas but its unclear whether the state or the feds will prevail Alabama Mississippi and South Carolina have also moved forward with voter ID bills that had already passed but were being held up by the Justice Department Virginia has passed a bill thats scheduled to go into effect next year And on Wednesday a federal court gave Florida the goahead to resume its controversial voter purge by dismissing a case filed against the state that had been rendered moot by the Supreme Court decision Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg is not surprised by this flurry She voted with the minority on the Voting Rights Act case and she wrote in a strongly worded dissent The sad irony of todays decision lies in its utter failure to grasp why the VRA has proved effective The Court appears to believe that the VRAs success in eliminating the specific devices extant in 1965 means that preclearance is no longer needed  She continued With that belief and the argument derived from it history repeats itself  History does appear to be doing just that In an interview this week with The Associated Press Ginsburg reiterated her displeasure with the courts decision and her lack of surprise at what it has wrought saying And one really could have predicted what was going to happen She added I didnt want to be right but sadly I am  While Republicans may claim that voter ID laws are about the sanctity of the vote Republican power brokers know theyre about much more suppressing the votes of people likely to vote Democratic Last week Rob Gleason the Pennsylvania Republican Party chairman discussed the effects of his states voter ID laws on last years presidential election acknowledging to the Pennsylvania Cable Network We probably had a better election Think about this we cut Obama by 5 percent which was big A lot of people lost sight of that He won  he beat McCain by 10 percent he only beat Romney by 5 percent I think that probably voter ID helped a bit in that And on womens reproductive rights as the Guttmacher Institute reported earlier this month In the first six months of 2013 states enacted 106 provisions related to reproductive health and rights The report continued Although initial momentum behind banning abortion early in pregnancy appears to have waned states nonetheless adopted 43 restrictions on access to abortion the secondhighest number ever at the midyear mark and is as many as were enacted in all of 2012 A substantial majority of the new restrictive measures  which include bans on abortion outside incredibly restrictive time frames at six weeks after the womans last period in North Dakota burdensome regulations on abortion clinics and providers and forced ultrasounds  were enacted in states with Republicancontrolled legislatures These are just two issues among many in which the cleaving of this country is becoming an incontrovertible fact as we drift back toward bifurcation 
"Lindy Boggs, Longtime Representative and Champion of Women, Is Dead at 97",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/us/politics/lindy-boggs-longtime-representative-from-louisiana-dies-at-97.html,Lindy Boggs who succeeded her husband in the House of Representatives after his plane crashed in Alaska and who went on to serve nine terms on Capitol Hill notably as a champion of womens rights died on Saturday at her home in Chevy Chase Md She was 97 Her daughter the ABC News commentator Cokie Roberts confirmed the death In 1976 Mrs Boggs became the first woman to preside over a Democratic National Convention Three years earlier she had become the first woman from Louisiana elected to the House Her victory came in a special election in which she campaigned to succeed her husband Hale a powerful member of the House who had served there for 28 years the last two as majority leader He was presumed dead when a plane in which he was a passenger disappeared while he was campaigning with Representative Nick Begich in Alaska in the fall of 1972 Mrs Boggs gained her husbands seat in no small part on the strength of his name The special election was held in March 1973 Mr Boggs had been reelected the previous November even though he was presumed dead But Mrs Boggss own experience did not hurt She knew the ways of the capital as an astute political wife from a family whose political lineage reached back to George Washingtons time and included governors of Louisiana and Mississippi Her own children found public renown in their own right her daughter Ms Roberts as a Washington journalist for ABC and National Public Radio her son Thomas Hale Boggs Jr as an influential Washington lawyer and lobbyist and another daughter Barbara Boggs Sigmund who died in office as the mayor of Princeton NJ In her 1994 memoir Washington Through a Purple Veil Memoirs of a Southern Woman written with Katherine Hatch Mrs Boggs wrote that she had learned an important lesson as a political wife and as a politician herself You played the Washington game with confidence and authority and graciousness The velvet Southern charm she had absorbed growing up on two Louisiana plantations was her notsosecret weapon She displayed it early in her first term when the House banking committee was composing an amendment to a lending bill banning discrimination on the basis of race age or veteran status She added the words sex or marital status ran to a copying machine and made a copy for each member In her memoir she recalled saying Knowing the members composing this committee as well as I do Im sure it was just an oversight that we didnt have sex or marital status included Ive taken care of that and I trust it meets with the committees approval Thus was sex discrimination prohibited by the Equal Credit Opportunity Act of 1974 Mrs Boggs used her membership on the Appropriations Committee to push for other womens economic concerns like equal pay for government jobs and equal access to government business contracts She became a champion of historic preservation and port development flood control and housing in her New Orleans district She also fought for higher pay for senators and representatives a politically unpopular cause because she thought it would raise the quality of legislators and reduce turnover Mrs Boggs hated offending anyone she wrote in her memoir and so taking strong stands did not come easily But maybe was not a voting option she added only aye or nay Mrs Boggs championed racial justice at a time when doing so invited the resentment if not hostility of most Southern whites She saw the growing civil rights movement as necessary to the political reform movement of the 1940s and 50s You couldnt want to reverse the injustices of the political system and not include the blacks and the poor it was just obvious she said in 1990 While her husband was in office she supported civil rights legislation as well as Head Start and antipoverty programs As the president of two organizations of Congressional wives she saw to it that each group was racially integrated After her district was redrawn in 1983 giving blacks a majority Mrs Boggs was reelected three times In the first of these victories in 1984 she captured more than a third of the black vote in defeating a popular black politician Israel M Augustine Jr a former state judge who was backed by black political organizations When she announced her retirement from Congress in 1990 she was the only white member of Congress representing a blackmajority district Her national profile was raised in 1976 when Robert S Strauss the chairman of the Democratic Party chose her to preside over the partys 1976 national convention in Manhattan where Jimmy Carter became the presidential nominee In 1984 she was often mentioned as a possible vicepresidential candidate but she was ultimately passed over by the presidential nominee former Vice President Walter F Mondale in favor of Representative Geraldine A Ferraro Mrs Boggs believed that her strong stand against abortion had hurt her chances In 1991 a room that had been used as the House speakers office in the 19th century was named the Lindy Claiborne Boggs Congressional Womens Reading Room Marie Corinne Morrison Claiborne was born on March 13 1916 on a sugar plantation in Pointe Coupee Parish La the only child of Roland Philemon Claiborne a lawyer and the former Corinne Morrison The name Lindy was a shortening of Rolindy the nickname she was given by a nurse who thought she looked more like her father than her mother Beginning with Thomas Claiborne a Virginia congressman when George Washington was president every generation of Mrs Boggss family had at least one public officeholder Lindys father died when she was 2 Her mother remarried when Lindy was 7 and the newly constituted family moved to a prosperous cotton plantation After attending Roman Catholic schools Lindy Claiborne entered Sophie Newcomb College the womens branch of Tulane University at 15 At a dance in 1934 she once said in an interview a young man cut in while she was dancing As they made their way around the floor Thomas Hale Boggs said Im going to marry you someday She and Mr Boggs both worked on the Tulane newspaper The Hullabaloo she as the womens editor and he as the editor in chief After graduation he went to Tulane Law School and she taught history and English in Romeville La They married in New Roads on Jan 22 1938 in a ceremony with 15 bridesmaids and 15 groomsmen In 1940 Mr Boggs at 26 was elected to Congress as a reform candidate He lost a reelection effort in 1942 but regained the seat in 1946 the beginning of 22 consecutive victories by him or his wife Mrs Boggs quickly learned to navigate Washington She managed her husbands campaigns and oversaw his Capitol Hill office She also organized voter registration efforts and various events for President Lyndon B Johnsons 1964 campaign She was the first woman to manage two inaugural balls  for John F Kennedy in 1961 and for Mr Johnson four years later She was also known for hosting more than 1000 guests at Washington garden parties and remarkably doing the cooking herself Mrs Boggs left Congress in 1990 to help her daughter Barbara Boggs Sigmund the Princeton mayor deal with eye cancer an ocular melanoma which had spread to other parts of her body Mrs Sigmund died that year Besides her son and Ms Roberts Mrs Boggs is survived by eight grandchildren and 18 greatgrandchildren In 1997 President Bill Clinton appointed Mrs Boggs ambassador to the Vatican The post was known for its sober decorum but Mrs Boggs would have none of that The morning after she arrived to take up the job she was informed that she was to be seated that night at a table filled with nothing but cardinals She mulled that over and said I think Ill wear red At another point she exchanged three phone calls in one day with an Italian archbishop on a minor piece of Vatican

G.O.P. Senators See an Upside in a Problematic Issue: Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/28/us/politics/gop-senators-see-an-upside-in-a-problematic-issue-abortion.html,WASHINGTON  It reads like a whos who of the next generation of Republican Party leaders Marco Rubio Ted Cruz Rob Portman But what is bringing all these marquee political names together is not the Iowa State Fair or a Tea Party rally on the National Mall Rather they are all talking discreetly about how to advance a bill in the Senate to ban abortion at 20 weeks after fertilization A similar ban passed the House last month and Senate Democrats quickly pronounced it doomed to fail in their chamber It is almost certain to be defeated there and even if it were not President Obama would veto it But backers of the ban are eager to bring to the floor of the Senate the same impassioned debate over abortion that has been taking place in state legislatures around the country Plans under discussion among the staff members of a handful of Republican senators and antiabortion groups would involve bringing the measure up for a vote probably as part of debate over a spending measure sometime after Congress returns from its August recess Because of the Senates porous rules for introducing amendments people on both sides of the issue say they believe a vote is more than likely if the legislation comes together I think theres significant support across the country for the idea that after 20 weeks abortion should be significantly limited said Mr Rubio who has taken a leading role in trying to generate support for the bill Irrespective of how people may feel about the issue he added were talking about five months into a pregnancy People certainly feel there should be significant restrictions on that Republicans are hardly unanimous about the wisdom of entangling themselves in a national battle over abortion rights many believe that the party should remain focused on addressing economic issues and fighting Mr Obamas health care overhaul Im focused on energy the economy and whats happening with the presidents health care law said Senator John Barrasso of Wyoming a member of the Republican leadership Asked whether he thought abortion was a distraction for his party he stuck to a popular Republican refrain Im completely focused on jobs the economy the health care law Democrats meanwhile are wary of the damage that a no vote on secondtrimester abortion restrictions could inflict on some of their more vulnerable senators up for reelection in 2014 particularly in Arkansas Louisiana and North Carolina where legislatures have recently imposed strict limits On Friday the governor of North Carolina said he would sign into law new regulations on abortion clinics Look Ive taken a lot of tough votes said Senator Mary L Landrieu Democrat of Louisiana who added that she doubted she could support a ban at 20 weeks Thats what Im here for to take votes And if we have to take it we take it The success of new limits on when how and where abortions can be done has invigorated the Republican base like few other issues this year Because of such intensity antiabortion groups say they have found interest among the newer generation of Republican senators especially those seeking to build up or in some cases repair their standing with conservative voters Some see even broader appeal Though the issue of reproductive rights has been problematic for Republicans  who have been embarrassed by comments like those of Todd Akin the Missouri Senate candidate who said that womens bodies blocked pregnancy in cases of rape  those supporting 20week bans say the dynamics of this debate are less alienating to swing voters than fights over contraception And some conservatives see this as the only winning social issue they have left in their political arsenal Unlike samesex marriage which has steadily gained support recent polls have shown that the public believes that abortions later in pregnancy should be restricted A Washington PostABC News poll last week found that 56 percent of Americans said they would prefer to impose limits on abortions after 20 weeks rather than the 24week standard established by the Supreme Court in Roe v Wade Antiabortion activists said that after the recently approved House measure and success in states like Texas which approved a 20week ban this month they saw an opportunity they could not pass up We really thought it was a moment to be very ambitious said Marjorie Dannenfelser the president of the Susan B Anthony List one of the groups pushing for the Senate to take up the 20week ban Abortion rights groups say the real goal of these laws all of which challenge Supreme Court precedent is to get another case before the court in the hopes that the justices will further restrict abortion rights These bills are not happenstance said Donna Crane policy director of Naral ProChoice America These bills are a calculated cold strategy Mr Cruz of Texas for his part is trying to build a larger following among Republicans beyond his home state He visited Iowa last weekend to meet with evangelical pastors and other members of the states conservative establishment Joining him was Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky who has also expressed interest in signing onto a 20week bill according to Ms Dannenfelser and a spokeswoman for the senator Mr Rubio of Florida who has been discussing for months how to introduce this issue into the Senate is also eager to raise his national profile But he must first overcome some of the doubts conservatives have about him for his pivotal role in helping the Senate pass an immigration bill with a provision to eventually grant citizenship to immigrants here illegally Mr Portman of Ohio who was on Mitt Romneys short list to become the Republican vicepresidential nominee last year and who has told his colleagues that he would like to be deeply involved in the 20week legislation is trying to rebuild conservative support that he lost back home in March after he spoke out in favor of samesex marriage One Republican who saw internal poll numbers after Mr Portmans announcement said the senators unfavorable ratings jumped by double digits and were especially high in the southern part of Ohio where his core support is Drafting a bill however will require conservatives to resolve a fundamental disagreement how to find constitutional justification for a nationwide ban despite their reservations about giving the government broad regulatory powers This has been especially challenging for Senator Mike Lee of Utah one of the Senates leading antiabortion voices He strongly opposes a bill that uses as its legal rationale the commerce clause of the Constitution which many conservatives consider a violation of their principles Some in the Republican leadership express similar doubts including Senator John Cornyn of Texas the No 2 leader He said he supported the 20week ban that passed in his home state this month but added I think that this can adequately be taken care of at the state level And so there may not be a need for the federal government to get involved Then there is the issue of how new abortion regulations might be perceived among women So far none of the four Republican women in the Senate have stepped forward to get involved Senator Deb Fischer of Nebraska who has a solidly antiabortion voting record said Im focused on a lot of other issues now Senator Lisa Murkowski of Alaska said Its not something that is really on my priority list
Popeâ€™s Trip to Brazil Seen as â€˜Strong Startâ€™ in Revitalizing Church,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/07/29/world/americas/vibrant-display-at-popes-last-mass-in-brazil.html,RIO DE JANEIRO  Pope Francis celebrated the last Mass of his trip to Brazil on Sunday before more than a million people gathered on the beach in this city the national flags of Catholics from around the world hoisted in the air as a chorus of Brazilian priests belted out songs before the multitude It was a vibrant display of the Vaticans ambition of halting the losses of worshipers to evangelical churches and the rising appeal of secularism By various measures Franciss first international trip since he was named pope this year was a success The 76yearold Argentine a Jesuit who is the first pope from the Americas was greeted like a rock star by attendees to a conference of Catholic youth He urged people to combat corruption a top grievance in the protests shaking Brazil and called on bishops to focus on the pragmatic needs of congregants shifting emphasis from the abuse scandals that have plagued the Vatican for years If this trip is any indication hes off to a strong start at revitalizing the church said Andrew Chesnut an expert on Latin American religions at Virginia Commonwealth University who came here to see the popes visit up close Hes been very astute on focusing on the everyday afflictions of the poor taking a page from the evangelicals themselves Before scolding Brazilian clergy at one point during the weeklong visit for losing touch with their own worshipers by appearing too distant from their needs Francis offered the example of visiting a medical center where drug addicts receive treatment Still he hewed to the Roman Catholic Churchs prevailing view on drugs criticizing supporters of decriminalizing drug use showing how a pope can seem at the same time to be caring and resistant to a profound shift under way in parts of the world Francis is more simpatico than John Paul II certainly more likable than Benedict but transforming the church requires more than public relations gestures appealing as they might be said Peter McDonough a scholar of religion who has written widely on the Jesuits comparing Francis with his predecessors Its doubtful aside from a positive bump in applications to the priesthood and perhaps a groundswell in confessions that Pope Franciss visit to Brazil will stem the loss of congregants to evangelical and other denominations or reverse the tide of secularization Still if there is any place to forge ahead with strategies aimed at fortifying the Roman Catholic Church it is Latin America Just three countries in the region  Brazil Mexico and Colombia  account for about a quarter of all Catholics in the world according to a study of the global Catholic population by the Pew Forum on Religion and Public Life Brazil has more Catholics an estimated 123 million than any other country Yet Brazil also showcases the threats to Catholicism Just 65 percent of Brazilians identify as Catholics compared with 85 percent of Mexicans Almost 25 percent of Brazilians are now evangelical up from singledigit levels in the 1970s and a growing number of people reject religious doctrine completely opting for a thoroughly secular lifestyle Illustrating Brazils diversity of beliefs various protests coalesced around the popes visit One of them a Marcha das Vadias or SlutWalk involved scantily clad women questioning the Catholic Churchs opposition to legalized abortion women as priests and samesex marriage At one point a man reportedly spit on of the face of one of the protesters only to have several women in the protest show him their breasts and shake their behinds at him in defiance But while a Carnivalesque atmosphere prevailed in some Rio neighborhoods a more relaxed vibe was evident in many parts of the city during the popes visit Pilgrims from around the world roamed through the streets Some strummed guitars singing religious hymns from their homelands Thousands camped on the beach shrugging at the blunders by local organizers like an accidental shutdown one day of the subway system I will never forget this moment in all of my life Wael Sami 22 an Iraqi Catholic who traveled here from Baghdad said on Sunday I have been to many countries but I think this is the coolest said Mr Sami a student of computer programming When they see our flag and know there are Christian people in Iraq they are so excited While shifting attention to Latin America and other parts of the developing world Francis notably welcomed the participation during Mass of the Charismatic Catholic Renovation a movement of singing priests some of them heartthrobs with hit CDs seeking to appeal to congregants with upbeat lively strategies similar to those employed by fastgrowing evangelical churches I think this pope is breaking protocol said Saulo Palacio 35 a computer technician who attended a religious service on Sunday at his evangelical church here Nova Vida or New Life We dont agree on everything but I recognize hes different maybe since hes South American he said He could change things in the Catholic Church but Im not switching back to Catholic rites not when my church is a happier place with more emotion Getting some evangelicals to even consider a return to Catholicism may be the start of a shift in the churchs fortunes in Latin America But some scholars warn that the Vatican remains far from undergoing a broader transformation with Francis who returned to the Vatican on Sunday night opposed to allowing women a more prominent role in carrying out religious services or allowing priests to marry The gestures have changed but the dogma has not said Fortunato Mallimaci a sociologist at the University of Buenos Aires who specializes in the relationship between culture and religion pointing to the example of the popes stance against legalizing drugs On social issues Francis will be a continuation of his predecessors Still it was undeniable that Franciss easygoing and ascetic style aroused optimism among many here that the Catholic Church could be on the cusp of a longawaited revival Leonardo Boff a prominent liberation theologian who was reprimanded in the 1980s by Cardinal Joseph Ratzinger the future Benedict XVI  said Francis was repositioning the Catholic Church from a fortress to an open house Were exiting two papacies characterized by the return to great discipline and the control of doctrines Mr Boff 74 a former Franciscan priest wrote during the popes visit With Pope Francis coming from outside old European Christianity he brings hope and enjoyment of life
A Rainbow Over Catholic Colleges,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/education/edlife/how-georgetown-became-a-gay-friendly-campus.html,COME out of the closet in style read the poster and on a crisp fall day dozens of students on Georgetowns Red Square did metaphorically at least They formed a winding conga line and sashayed through a lifesize closet door That afternoon they gathered for samesex smooching in a campus kissin The days events were part of OUTober a month jampacked with celebrations related to all things LGBTQ or lesbian gay bisexual transgender questioning Every month is a good month to be gay at Georgetown said Thomas Lloyd president of the campus pride group Indeed theres a Gender Liberation Week Gay Pride Month a popular drag ball called Genderfunk and a Lavender graduation ceremony attended by the university president Not so long ago relations between the university and its gay students were strained In 1980 the students had to sue for equal privileges for their organizations In 2007 they stormed the steps of Healy Hall protesting what they saw as an inadequate response to antigay incidents And a 2008 survey found that 61 percent of students thought homophobia was an issue That year the administration began to address the problem opening an LGBTQ resource center with a fulltime staff Further honing its current image as a gayfriendly campus in March Nate Tisa became Georgetowns first openly gay student body president Mr Tisa who clocked numerous hours at church retreats and religious summer camps as a boy in Rochester NY has called on the university to lead the church toward a new interpretation of homosexuality Society is changing Mr Tisa  wrote in The Hoya Georgetowns student newspaper and God is in that change  do not reject it As the national gay rights movement touches down in state legislatures the Supreme Court and even the Boy Scouts it is also being felt at many of the nations 267 Roman Catholic colleges and universities where students and administrators are grappling with what it means to be young gay and Catholic in 2013 Perhaps nowhere has the movement been more visible than at the countrys oldest Catholic university Georgetown has made a huge commitment to its LGBTQ community said Shane Windmeyer executive director of Campus Pride a national nonprofit group It has a history It has a past But today it is pushing the needle forward The support for gay students has elicited nods of approval from many alumni but it has agitated others Some say that Georgetown is losing sight of its Catholic mission and has become a hotbed for viewpoints that conflict with church teachings The Catechism of the Catholic Church says to respect homosexuals  an attitude suggested by Pope Francis in his remarks this week regarding gay priests But it denounces homosexual sex as contrary to the natural law homosexuality is thus some argue not part of Gods plan Shortly after Mr Tisas victory William Peter Blatty the octogenarian author of The Exorcist and Manuel A Miranda a fellow alumnus circulated a petition and 198page memorandum condemning Georgetown for promoting a culture of moral relativism and an ideology of radical autonomy More than 2000 alumni have signed the petition which was sent in May to Cardinal Donald W Wuerl archbishop of Washington The petition calls on the archbishop to better regulate the university or strip it of its Catholic identity an unlikely but technically possible outcome The petitions primary aim is very much akin to pressuring someone that you love very much into going into rehab Mr Blatty wrote me in an email He has deep roots at Georgetown He attended on full scholarship set his blockbuster horror story on campus and named his new watchdog group the Father King Society to Make Georgetown Honest Catholic and Better after the late Thomas M King a beloved theology professor Other groups too have made it their business to monitor Catholic colleges The Fellowship of Catholic Scholars was critical of Notre Dame for inviting President Obama who supports abortion rights to give a commencement address The Cardinal Newman Society founded in 1993 by a Fordham University alumnus has attacked Boston College for turning a blind eye when students distribute condoms and DePaul University for allowing a production of The Vagina Monologues The Cardinal Newman Society has also taken aim at Georgetown for Genderfunk This year a male student went as a highheeled Mary and danced to Madonnas Like a Virgin while Jesus a woman looked on Several pages of the Georgetown memorandum are dedicated to Mr Tisa his irrepressible and welltrained gay agenda and his attempts at cleverly redefining what Catholic means Cardinal Wuerl declined to comment but Rachel Pugh a Georgetown spokeswoman pointed to the universitys two required theology classes and up to seven Sunday Masses at the main chapel as evidence that it is deeply connected to its Catholic identity The university also organizes church retreats and regular Eucharistic adoration ceremonies Dozens of priests live on campus and serve as spiritual mentors Our Catholic and Jesuit identity on campus has never been stronger Ms Pugh said Academically we remain committed to the Catholic intellectual tradition Many students have an entirely secular experience at Georgetown Sitting on a knoll overlooking the Potomac River the university is a magnet for political junkies wanting access to the Capitol But the obsession with politics is only part of the Georgetown story Half of undergraduates identify as Catholic The universitys religious underpinnings are embedded in its philosophy and so too is what some students refer to as the God conversation a dialogue about Jesuit values that regularly arises inside and outside of class The Jesuit educational model created by St Ignatius of Loyola has a distinctly humanist bent Todd A Olson Georgetowns dean of students says he is confident that providing gay students support freedom of expression and a place to celebrate who they are does not conflict with the universitys Jesuit heritage He cites cura personalis the Jesuit tenet that loosely translates into care of the whole person saying that Georgetown has an obligation to concern itself with the wellbeing of all its students What is important and what is behind that is that each person has individual needs Dr Olson said Its not a onesizefitsall approach The university he said is careful not to take positions or advocate behavior that contradicts church teachings The resource center for example does not distribute condoms or provide safesex counseling Its guides are Pope John Paul IIs 1990 document outlining administrators roles and responsibilities and a sister report released in 1999 by the United States  Conference of Catholic Bishops exploring how the Popes words ought to be applied The latter document urges administrators to enjoy institutional autonomy and foster academic debate but to consistently uphold teachings about homosexuality abortion family planning and premarital sex These seemingly contradictory missions have caused tension in recent years particularly as Catholic institutions seek to educate and protect the health of their students many of whom are sexually active LAST year Ryan Fecteau became the first openly gay speaker of the General Assembly at the Catholic University of America which is run by the church Mr Fecteau spent much of his term urging the administration to recognize the universitys gayalliance group Ultimately administrators denied the request counterarguing that a gay advocacy group really wasnt part of the Catholic mission He says he achieved a partial victory a universitywide debate on the issue Mr Fecteau is one of a growing band of student leaders who are Catholic gay and seeking institutional changes through a mix of political maneuvering and theological debate In 2011 students at DePaul the largest Catholic university in the country elected Anthony Alfano as its first openly gay student body president Mr Alfano lobbied successfully for a resource center and also worked to raise awareness about high suicide rates among young gay Catholics Gay leaders at Our Lady of the Lake University in San Antonio last year persuaded administrators to alter the code of conduct to include language condemning violence stemming from sexual orientation During his sophomore year as vice speaker of the student senate and his junior year as speaker Mr Tisa helped produce a report on the challenges that incoming gay students face when they arrive While students found a welcoming environment in the LGBTQ Resource Center with its beanbags Diet Cokes and lots of students to share thoughts with Georgetown was still a scary place to come out Some complained of intolerant sometimes verbally abusive roommates and resident assistants unskilled at addressing altercations The report proposed several initiatives  a genderneutral dorm and a Safe Spaces program that would designate rooms on every dorm floor where gay and minority students could retreat if needed Last spring Mr Tisa began vigorously pushing for both There are other issues on his agenda At the last student government meeting of the school year Mr Tisa and his cabinet members gathered in their usual conference room decorated with a basketball net ratty couch and long wood table on which sat a copy of The Politics of the Presidency Mr Tisa polished off a slice of cold pizza before launching into a discussion on several green initiatives and a report outlining ways to make the campus friendlier for students with disabilities One cabinet member suggested that a neighborhood cleanup drive intended to soothe perennially tense community relations had gone so well they might do them more often Mr Tisa shook his head an emphatic no adding dryly of the neighbors I dont want them to get too dependent Later I asked Mr Tisa about the petition sitting on the archbishops desk Had he been offended by the remarks about him No he said dispassionately They just dont get it Many of Georgetowns straight students say they are proud of the universitys work on behalf of gay students largely because they see it as a civil rights issue Maggie Cleary a senior and former head of the Georgetown University College Republicans said she thought it was important for gay students to feel welcome on campus and for those who might not have a lot of experience with openly gay people to be exposed to them According to a recent Quinnipiac poll 62 percent of 18 to 34yearold Catholics favor legalizing samesex marriage compared with 48 percent of those 35 to 54 and 39 percent 55 and over But in a muchtalkedabout opinion piece in April in The Hoya titled Marriage an Institution Defined by Procreation Andrew Schilling a government major from Iowa argued in support of the churchs stance on homosexuality True compassion for our LGBT friends he wrote did not mean turning marriage into a legal tool for social inclusion Mr Schilling said he was chastised for his opinions I can feel like my voice is being silenced he said Asked about this Mr Tisa said he thought it was crucial that all students express themselves on these issues Still he said for gay students certain viewpoints can be difficult to hear For a lot of people these are not abstract debates he said Theyre personal At a Formica table in his splitlevel dorm suite wearing khakis and a Georgetown sweatshirt Mr Tisa was eager to discuss his own coming out He attended a Jesuit high school where tall and broadshouldered he played football Early on he began to suspect he was gay It was as tortuous internally as it was externally Would he have to choose between God and a happy life His faith had brought him strength as a child dealing with his parents divorce Once again he found solace in prayer and in conversations with other Catholics The first person he shared his story with was a layperson he had grown close to during weekend youth retreats She said I love you God loves you And Im here for you  he recalled Then we cried That encounter he said reminded him that Catholic teachings were based on love not condemnation I really wanted to be part of that he said During Thanksgiving break his freshman year Mr Tisa broke the news to his parents This past year he wrote an opinion piece telling the entire campus Baby we were born this way he proclaimed calling on Georgetown to become a voice for a new Catholicism one that supports the entirety of a gay persons life Diane Butler Bass author of Christianity After Religion says many gay students find it too painful to stay in the church Those who do she said remain because there is something about the church they find beautiful and soothing And they end up determining for themselves the things that they believe are central to being Catholic Kimberly Blair a gay junior from Atlanta remembers the discomfort she felt at a Bible study group freshman year Club members were reading from the Book of Leviticus and discussing the morality of homosexuality If a man lies with a man as one lies with a woman both of them have done what is detestable They must be put to death their blood will be on their own heads I was sitting in the front row and I honestly started crying she said Mr Lloyd the pride group president says he is often tempted to join the more tolerant Episcopal Church But for many young Catholics particularly of Irish or Italian descent Catholicism is interchangeable with identity You stay Catholic because you have a love of the institution and you want to change it he said It has taken Mr Tisa years of reflection to work through how his sexual orientation and his Catholic faith can coexist He refuses to accept that his relationship with another man is intrinsically disordered as described in church catechism And he is quite sure of this God is not a child in a sandbox making sculptures and throwing them away It is a message he is intent on spreading across campus with evangelical verve As he often tells students We need to bring the Catholic identity into the 21st century Can he do that from his perch at Georgetown Yes Mr Tisa said I have a lot of faith
Poll Shows Republican Voters at Odds on Party Leadership and Direction,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/07/31/poll-shows-republican-voters-at-odds-on-party-leadership-and-direction/,"As a number of prominent Republicans trade barbs and jostle to become the partys standardbearer
                                        after a disappointing showing in the 2012 election a new poll finds a majority of Republican voters support significant changes in the partys direction but there is no consensus on what direction the party
                                        should take Twothirds of Republican voters said their party needed to address major problems to do better in future presidential elections according to a Pew Research Center survey released Wednesday
                                        and nearly 6 in 10 said the party needed to reconsider some of its policy positions No single Republican stood out as the face or voice of the party 22 percent of respondents volunteered the answer nobody when asked who led their party The most mentioned name House Speaker John A
                                        Boehner garnered only 9 percent Asked about several party leaders all elicited stronger favorable than unfavorable responses Representative Paul D Ryan the 2012 Republican candidate for vice president had the highest favorability rating at 65
                                        percent followed by Senators Rand Paul of Kentucky at 55 percent and Marco Rubio of Florida at 50 percent Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey was not far behind with 47 percent favorability but had higher unfavorable

                                        they did not think that would help  Among those who said changes in policy standpoints were necessary the most commonly cited issues were immigration and abortion followed by gay marriage Regarding specific policies the general sentiment for Republicans was to move further right particularly on government spending On immigration about 4 in 10 Republicans said the partys position was about
                                        right while the same number said Republicans were not conservative enough On gun policy most Republicans agreed with their partys stance However on gay marriage Republicans were almost evenly scattered with 33 percent saying the position was about right 31 percent saying the partys stand was too conservative 27 percent saying it was not
                                        conservative enough On abortion 4 in 10 Republicans said their partys position was about right but half of Republicans were divided on whether it should be more moderate or more conservative Asking
                                        voters whether about their partys approach to an issue is conservative enough or too conservative has two drawbacks First theres a level of subjectivity  each persons definition

                                        as Republican a steady decline from the 30 percent who identified as Republican a decade ago When those who said they were independent but leaned Republican are included the total Republicans grow to 37 percent
                                        just slightly down from 42 percent in 2003 Pews recent poll found 29 percent of Americans identified as Democrats roughly the same as the 32 percent who said so in 2003 However when including leaners

Republicans: Blinded by Self-Righteousness,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/opinion/blow-republicans-blinded-by-self-righteousness.html,Twothirds of Republicans recognize that the party needs to change in order to do better in future presidential elections but theyre torn over what that change should be Thats the conclusion of a Pew Research Center poll released Wednesday And its encouraging right  Nearly 6 in 10 Republicans believe that they need to reconsider some positions while just over a third believe that the party mainly needs to make a stronger case for its current positions Still good But thats where things get tricky Fiftyfour percent believe that party leaders need to move in a more conservative direction while only 40 percent believe that they need to move in a more moderate direction Theres the deflator I knew this was too good to be true The poll specifically asked Republicans whether the partys position was too conservative not conservative enough or about right on five issues gay marriage immigration abortion government spending and gun policy In all cases except one a plurality thought that the partys position was about right The lone exception was government spending on which a plurality thought that the party was not conservative enough In fact not conservative enough beat too conservative on every issue but gay marriage Pointing to the true split in the party  between the moderate and the extreme  Tea Party supporters were significantly more likely than Republicans who dont support the Tea Party to say that the party was not conservative enough on these issues These Tea Party supporters were twice as likely to say that Congressional Republicans compromised too much when dealing with their Democratic counterparts notwithstanding the fact that as it stands any level of compromise is incredibly hard to come by in this Congress which is essentially broken because of Republican intransigence And the problem the Republicans still have but many dont seem to recognize is that the extreme arm of the party has an outsize role in selecting a nominee and they dont like anyone who smells of moderation Of the Republicans who say that they always vote in primaries 42 percent say that Congressional Republicans compromise too much as opposed to 28 percent of those who say they vote in primaries less often And while large majorities of Tea Party supporters have favorable opinions of possible Republican presidential candidates like Paul Ryan Rand Paul and to a lesser degree Marco Rubio most dont have a favorable opinion of Chris Christie In fact among Tea Party supporters Christie had the highest unfavorable rating of the seven Republican leaders mentioned in the poll But among Republicans who dont support the Tea Party Chris Christie is second only to Paul Ryan in favorability This is the perpetual Republican Party conundrum moderate or go harder right And many still seem to believe that going harder right is the best way to go They have learned nothing They can see no other way They are so convinced that their way is the right way but its just misunderstood not clearly explained not persuasively advocated Thats what can happen in political echo chambers  faltering positions are reinforced rather than rightfully abandoned Voices for moderation are maligned as agents of moral erosion Giving a little feels like giving up It is in this environment that 15 Kentucky Tea Party groups released a letter last week blasting two national Tea Party groups for endorsing Senator Mitch McConnell complaining of McConnells Progressive Liberal voting record and his willingness to roll over and cede power to President Obama and the Liberals in Washington In what twisted rightisleft upisdown world do these people live In this world few leaders particularly ones that could win a national election  which would require the winning of moderates and possibly the sloughing off of some conservative Democrats  would ever be sufficiently conservative to pass the purity test Instead of acknowledging that they have put up weak presidential nominees and had them front for extreme platforms many Republicans believe that their problem is simply that their recent candidates have not been conservative enough Rick Perry the Texas governor and failed presidential candidate said in March  The popular media narrative is that this country has shifted away from conservative ideals as evidenced by the last two presidential elections  He continued Thats what they think thats what say That might be true if Republicans had actually nominated conservative candidates in 2008 and 2012 Rush Limbaugh during an hourlong interview with Fox News Greta Van Susteren this week went even further saying The Republican leadership isnt conservative Theyre not particularly crazy about conservatives  And lamenting what he viewed as too much compromise by Republicans he continued So much of it on the surface intellectually doesnt make any sense There has to be a reason These Republicans are not stupid They have to know that agreeing with the Democrats on issue after issue after issue is going to equal Democrat victory after victory

Women as a Force for Change,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/opinion/kristof-women-as-a-force-for-change.html,As womens empowerment has become a buzz phrase in the last few years some people are pushing back They resent this as the latest fad in political correctness a liberal mission to troll for support from woollyminded female voters But a few recent incidents have underscored why a push on gender equity isnt just a mindless fad and why its not primarily about political correctness Consider Marte Dalelv the 24yearold Norwegian woman who reported a rape in Dubai  and then was sentenced to 16 months in prison on charges that included extramarital sex That was she said three months longer than the alleged rapists prison sentence After an outcry the authorities pardoned Dalelv and also according to newsmedia reports her alleged rapist Thats the first reason empowerment isnt just a feelgood slogan profound gender injustices persist not just in Dubai but also albeit to a lesser extent in the United States The United States military has a deplorable record of sexual violence within its ranks with an estimated 26000 service members experiencing unwanted sexual contact annually Yet President Obama has so far declined to back the sensible bipartisan and broadly supported proposal of Senator Kirsten Gillibrand to improve investigations of rape in the military and reduce conflicts of interest  Add to the toxic brew of sexual violence the Steubenville rape case widespread sex trafficking and laws in many states that give rapists custody rights to children they father Ariel Castro the Cleveland man who held three women in his house for about a decade has already requested visitation with a child he fathered by rape  although a judge declined the request The political backdrop is frustration that women arent fully represented in decisions that affect them and thats a second reason this issue reverberates Thats why State Senator Wendy Davis of Texas electrified the social media when she filibustered restrictive abortion legislation Its not that men favor tougher abortion laws than women thats an issue with a negligible gender gap but that plenty of women feel bullied by outoftouch male lawmakers Anyone thinking that womens empowerment is a side issue also wasnt paying attention when Malala Yousafzai shot in the head by the Pakistani Taliban for advocating girls education spoke to the United Nations in July on her 16th birthday Malala highlighted the third reason to focus on empowering women and girls Its perhaps the best leverage we have to fight social ills As Malala noted a powerful force for change in the world is education especially girls education The United States has invested thousands of lives and hundreds of billions of dollars in Afghanistan and Pakistan since 911 and accomplished little maybe we should have invested more in the education toolbox Drones and military patrols sometimes reinforce extremism while girls education tends to undermine it Change can come not only from a bomb but also from a girl with a schoolbook studying under a tree or in a mosque She will on average have fewer children be more likely to hold a job and exercise more influence her brothers and her children will be less likely to join the Taliban Likewise womens health programs arent a chivalrous handout but a costeffective step toward a healthier society The Guttmacher Institute reported this week that without publicly financed contraception programs in 2010 the unintended pregnancy rate among teenagers would have been 73 percent higher And lawmakers want to cut such programs A final insight into women as leverage for change came during my annual winatrip journey in which I take a student with me on a reporting trip The winner Erin Luhmann of the University of Wisconsin and I delved into the malnutrition that contributes to 45 percent of all child deaths around the world So how do we save those millions of lives Its not just about transporting more food to the hungry or about improving agricultural yields in Africa Its also about  yes  empowering women In rural Chad we accompanied World Vision and chatted with local women about why children were malnourished One factor there as in much of the world Men eat first and women and children take whats left We know about malnutrition one said but if the meat doesnt go mostly to the man she added there is trouble in the house Researchers have found that giving women land titles inheritance rights and bank accounts arent just symbolic gestures Rather they are strategies to increase womens influence in household decisions and save childrens lives So to those of you who chafe at womens rights as political correctness run amok think again This isnt a womens issue or a mans issue for Malala is exactly right We cannot all succeed if half of us are held back 
Lawmakers in Uruguay Vote to Legalize Marijuana,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/world/americas/uruguay-lawmakers-to-vote-on-legalizing-marijuana.html,RIO DE JANEIRO  Uruguays lower house late Wednesday night approved a sweeping bill to legalize marijuana opening the way for the authorities to create one of Latin Americas most ambitious nationwide endeavors in overhauling drug policy  Following hours of debate legislators in Uruguays capital Montevideo voted 50 to 46 in favor of the legislation which now goes to the Senate where lawmakers have assured President Jos Mujica that they have a comfortable majority to approve it Mr Mujica supports the bill arguing that it is needed to redirect police resources toward fighting street crime and smugglers involved in trafficking other types of drugs  This is a very innovative bill with the state deciding to regulate the entire chain of production distribution and access to the substance said Laura Blanco president of Uruguays Cannabis Studies Association She said the bill sent an encouraging sign to other Latin American nations as political leaders in parts of the region debate whether to follow Uruguays example  Under Mr Mujica 78 an outspoken former guerrilla Uruguay has emerged as a laboratory for socially liberal policies A small nation of 33 million people the country has also enacted a groundbreaking abortion rights law moved to legalize samesex marriage and is seeking to become a center for renewable energy ventures  The marijuana bill has been under consideration for more than a year with Mr Mujica urging legislators last year to postpone voting on it after polls showed a majority of Uruguayans were opposed  A majority in Uruguay is still thought to be against the legalization but lawmakers moved ahead with the vote after nonprofit groups banded together in an educational campaign to explain the medicinal uses of marijuana and the economic benefits of cultivating the plant in Uruguay where criminal networks now smuggle marijuana largely from Paraguay  Under the bill which could become law as early as this month people would be allowed to grow marijuana in their homes limited to six plants per household They would also be permitted to form cooperatives allowed to cultivate 99 plants In addition private companies could grow marijuana under the bill though their harvests could be bought only by the government which would market the drug in licensed pharmacies  To buy marijuana in pharmacies Uruguayans would be required to enter their names into a federal registry which is intended to remain confidential and would be limited to buying 40 grams per month And in a move to prevent foreign tourists from flocking to Uruguay to smoke marijuana the legislation would restrict legal purchases to Uruguayans Marijuana use is already largely tolerated by the Uruguayan authorities Some people in Uruguay remain opposed to the bill contending that it would increase marijuana use among the young This is an adventure which may end up endangering an entire generation said Gerardo Amarilla an opposition legislator with Uruguays National Party  But in Latin America and beyond supporters of relaxing drug laws say the Uruguayan measure along with similar legislation in parts of the United States could embolden efforts to legalize marijuana in other countries  This vote is destined to have a big impact with regional and even global repercussions for drug policy said John Walsh an analyst at the Washington Office on Latin America a human rights group Uruguays timing is right Because of last years Colorado and Washington State votes to legalize the US government is in no position to browbeat Uruguay or others who may follow  Legislators in the governing coalition the Broad Front have argued that the legislation forms part of a tradition in Uruguay of asserting state control over certain areas of the economy and searching for progressive solutions to social problems This bill doesnt promote consumption said Sebastin Sabini the legislator sponsoring the bill It regulates it 
Abortion Law Is Blocked in North Dakota,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/01/us/north-dakota-abortion-law-is-blocked.html,A state judge on Wednesday temporarily blocked enforcement of a law requiring doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals The law is similar to measures promoted by antiabortion groups and blocked by courts in other states including Mississippi and Alabama It would have forced North Dakotas only abortion center the Red River Clinic in Fargo to close because it uses outofstate doctors who have been refused admitting privileges at local hospitals Medical experts say such requirements do not improve patient safety since hospitals will accept and treat emergency patients regardless The North Dakota lawsuit that resulted in Wednesdays temporary injunction was brought on behalf of the clinic by the Center for Reproductive Rights based in New York
Theory on Pain Is Driving Rules for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/02/us/theory-on-pain-is-driving-rules-for-abortions.html,It challenges four decades of constitutional doctrine and is based on disputed scientific theories Yet a push to ban abortion at 20 weeks after conception on the theory that the fetus can feel pain at that point has emerged as a potent new tactic of the antiabortion movement Advocates saw the potential of such a measure because it taps into public concern about latestage abortions appears to alter the rules only incrementally and claims to be rooted in science Any time we talk about developmental landmarks of the unborn child anything showing that the unborn child is a member of the human family  that gets the public to take a closer look at abortion said Mary Spaulding Balch the state policy director of the National Right to Life Committee who is widely seen as the architect of 20week legislation The 20week ban was first adopted in 2010 in Nebraska where conservatives aimed to rein in one wellknown abortion doctor A painbased abortion limit has now been enacted in a dozen states most recently in Texas and a bill to impose one nationally passed the Republicancontrolled House in June One recent poll while affirming public support for legal abortion over all suggested that a majority of people would draw the line at 20 weeks of pregnancy Abortion rights advocates call the pain argument duplicitous and say the laws will be declared unconstitutional arguing that they are a reflection of Republican gains in state legislatures and not a shift in public opinion But they have also been forced to mobilize against 20week bills in state after state and they credit their opponents with effective marketing These laws are cloaked in the language of twoweek increments rather than banning abortion at conception or other more radical measures said Suzanne B Goldberg the director of the Center for Gender and Sexuality Law at Columbia University They are cutting back on womens constitutional rights but less dramatically so they trigger less alarm across society In the three states where the bans have been legally challenged the courts blocked them In the standard laid out by the Supreme Court in Roe v Wade in 1973 and elaborated on in later decisions women have a right to an abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb around 24 weeks into pregnancy But proponents of 20week bans hope that one of the cases will be accepted by the Supreme Court Reading into opinions by Justice Anthony M Kennedy the likely swing voter they are hoping for a legal upheaval With these bills the antiabortion movement is tapping into a powerful strand in the complex tangle of public opinion on abortion Support for legal abortion drops when people are asked about the later stages of pregnancy In a Gallup poll last December 61 percent of Americans said abortion should be legal in the first three months of pregnancy but 27 percent said it should be legal in the second three months and 14 percent in the final three Since then other pollsters have started asking about a 20week limit  evidence that opponents of abortion have injected the proposed cutoff into the public discourse said Michael Dimock the director of the Pew Research Center for the People and the Press By any measure the practical impact of a 20week ban is small compared with the potential legal and symbolic effects In all cases but one in Arizona the laws ban abortions at the 20th week after fertilization which is the 22nd week after the last menstrual period the most common way of describing pregnancy The estimate of fetal viability at around 24 weeks is also timed from the last menstrual period so the actual gap between the two approaches is about two weeks involving several thousand abortions at most out of an estimated 12 million performed every year It may be a small number of women in those weeks but for each of them it matters a great deal said Nancy Northup the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights in New York She noted that the discovery of birth defects which often occurs in the second trimester was a common reason for later abortions For groups like Ms Northups which is involved in lawsuits to fend off abortion restrictions across the country keeping fetal viability as the dividing line is essential The Supreme Court including Justice Kennedy has repeatedly affirmed viability as the point at which the states interest in protecting life outweighs a womans right to control her body Ms Northup noted There is no other line that is workable she said It is an appropriate line to draw Ms Balch the Right to Life official who is also a lawyer said she had been considering fetal pain as a way to draw attention to the humanity of the unborn child since she heard President Ronald Reagan speak about it stirringly in 1984 In a speech to religious broadcasters that year he said Medical science doctors confirm that when the lives of the unborn are snuffed out they often feel pain  pain that is long and agonizing Ms Balch started collecting journal articles by a small minority of scientists who asserted that pain may be sensed earlier in fetal and brain development than commonly assumed Most scientists and medical associations say that perception of pain is impossible without brain developments that occur well after 20 weeks Even as new theories about pain were emerging antiabortion groups were dissecting abortionrelated opinions by Justice Kennedy especially his 2007 opinion upholding a federal ban on a particular procedure that critics call partialbirth abortion In that decision in the interpretation of Ms Balch and others the court showed that it was open to restricting abortion before fetal viability if there was a compelling moral reason But other legal experts like Ms Goldberg and Ms Northup call this a misinterpretation In upholding the partialbirth ban they note the court emphasized that it would not significantly impinge on abortion rights since other methods were still available By contrast a 20week law would prevent all abortions in the weeks preceding fetal viability The theories about fetal pain and possible chinks in Roe v Wade came together in Nebraska in late 2009 Earlier that year Dr George R Tiller who was known for performing lateterm abortions at his clinic in Kansas was killed by an antiabortion activist Dr Leroy H Carhart in suburban Omaha said he would try to fill the gap Nebraska conservatives wanted to find a way to prevent Dr Carhart from making Nebraska the abortion capital of the Midwest recalled Julie SchmitAlbin the executive director of Nebraska Right to Life It was Ms Balch Ms SchmitAlbin said who saw an opening there and molded the new legal tactic and Republican legislators made it a priority Dr Carhart still has a clinic in Nebraska but he had to open a new one in Maryland to perform abortions at later than 20 weeks Ms SchmitAlbin and other abortion opponents readily admit that a 20week ban is a step toward their ultimate goal Our mission is to restore legal protection to unborn life from the moment of conception she said This is a marathon

New Statesman,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/books/review/philip-bobbitts-garments-of-court-and-palace.html,One expects a book by Philip Bobbitt to be over 900 pages The Shield of Achilles 2002 or just under 700 pages Terror and Consent 2008 Then how can he diet himself down to a mere 200 or so pages of text on Machiavelli Bobbitt is a great systematizer in the Toynbee mold  Shield gave us six different state systems since 1500 princely kingly territorial imperial national market  Terror focused on one condition the market state but that state is still in formation so Bobbitt argued its case more and more and more extensively Then how does he deal with Machiavelli so compactly in The Garments of Court and Palace Very easily as one can tell by the frequency of his selfcitations in the new book He just shows us how wonderfully Machiavelli agreed with Bobbitts longer works  as if Niccol had read them half a millennium ago Machiavelli is often viewed as surprisingly modern but does that have to mean he must be surprisingly Bobbitt  Machiavelli fits into Bobbitts scheme because he is the expounder of the first of the six state systems in The Shield of Achilles the princely one Machiavelli even graced the form with its Bobbittian name Bobbitt believes that legal systems are changed by military strategies often by military technology So in 1494 when Charles VIII brought bronze cannon into Italy threatening fortress walls and smashing the governments that relied on them Machiavelli had to propose new walls along with new states to defend them This must mean that Machiavelli was interested in new technologies for war  though in fact he was not very interested in forts he thought they were less vulnerable to siege than to inner rebellion In the encyclopedic Art of War he suggests an improved design for forts but he is still concerned with inner rebellion he forbids an inner keep where the residents can hole up and tells us starvation is more effectual than siege Nor did he invest his time or energy in the technological innovations of Leonardo their one collaboration diverting a river was an ancient concept and it failed What Machiavelli was interested in was old systems and especially old military systems  Roman ones in fact These were powerful not because they relied on new weapons but because they were based on virt an expression of their manly religion Unlike Christianity which makes people humble and otherworldly Romes religion instilled a thirst for glory and freedom in this world In Christianity the ritual is more mincing delicata than grand without fierce or manly gagliarda energy Roman ritual was as grandly ceremonious but it added the energy of a sacrifice deep in blood and fierceness slaughtering hordes of animals By being terrifying in this way it made men just as terrifying Bobbitt thinks that Machiavellis prince could be ruthless like the Romans because he invented that new thing the princely state which must be preserved for the benefit of all Thus crimes done for the state are no crimes They are in fact rather altruistic The prince must subordinate all other indicia of right behavior to the one parameter of serving the state Those murdered are rightly murdered for being enemies of the state  a convenient rule for the prince who is the state He sacrifices himself to himself Machiavelli is even made to endorse Bobbitts concept of the market state on the rather broad ground that he was the philosopher of Bobbitts first state so he would buy into the sixth one as our sublime predecessor The new book is more vague than was Terror and Consent about the military obstetrics of the market state Here Bobbitt just says it is coming into being as a response to changes in the strategic context There he told us terrorism is at least the partial cause of the market state which mirrors it If Al Qaeda can operate freely across national entities relying on modern communications computer funding and ideological inventiveness then we must do so too calling on creative minds free of many of the legal and political restraints that bind government officials  This means continual outsourcing of previously governmental acts and omnidirectional deregulation The right must stop regulating abortion and pornography the left must stop regulating hate speech and through affirmative action hiring  such acts promote national values in defiance of the market Terrorists are entrepreneurial so our market state must be an entrepreneurial state Terrorists use the media so we must use them the media we are told are nimbler than bureaucrats If they use Visa to finance strikes so should we We can abandon our own state limits to engage in state building around the world to cope with the terrorist state  Bobbitt says the market state has been in process of formation for a while In Shield one of its prophets would seem to be Oliver North The entrepreneurial Irancontra arms for hostages transaction anticipated the new market state and was a natural market response to the problem of overregulation by overregulation he means the Boland Amendment against funding the contras in Nicaragua Old nationstate rules should not hamper new marketstate solutions That is what Bobbitt says happened in the Iraq war The open nationstate strategy was a quick decapitation of the Iraqi government But since the war was with the mobile virtual state of terrorism what was needed was a market state mirroring its tactics Blackwater and all the other private contractors were too hampered by the nation state not yet acting as the market state But the best entrepreneur of the new counterterrorist terrorism was Dick Cheney with his enhanced interrogations of captured terrorists Bobbitt says torture may not be used just to score a political point or secure a judicial conviction But the new state has to have new rules In former wars captives were forced to surrender their arms In the new wars they must be forced to surrender their information There cannot be a ban on the collection of strategic information  information from terrorist leaders and senior managers  by whatever means are absolutely necessary short of inflicting severe pain when that information is likely to preclude attacks That is just the legal guidance Cheney got from John Yoo a deputy assistant attorney general in the Office of Legal Counsel Neither Yoo nor Cheney thought waterboarding inflicted severe pain The new prince like Machiavellis old one can commit crimes if they are in service to the state The aim after all is to escape those legal and political restraints that bind government officials It has often been noticed that war makes adversaries end up resembling each other but Bobbitt would have us start out resembling our foe Terrorists he says are not just criminals They have created a virtual state and we have to create an entirely new kind of state to cope with it This reminds me of the people who denounced democracy in the 1930s as too slow and stumbling to respond to the rise of dictators Some would have had Roosevelt and Churchill create a new kind of state baffling dictators with good guy dictatorships  Not even Bobbitt thinks a new state was born of that crisis  his nation state runs unbroken from 1914 to 1990 and was able to survive World War II and the cold war Only Al Qaeda and its ilk are enough to make us create an entirely new political order Those who have seen the efficiency and lack of corruption in unregulated medicine and banks and Blackwatertype operations will have a little trouble hailing Machiavelli as a sponsor of the Higher Cheneyism 
Signs of Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/04/books/review/the-dark-road-and-for-a-song-and-a-hundred-songs.html,In exploring the darker aspects of Chinese life Ma Jian and Liao Yiwu speak mostly to the outside world The work of both writers has been banned in China and neither lives in his native land Ma Jian is a longtime resident of London Liao crossed the border into Vietnam in 2011 and fled to Berlin where he remains today Ma Jians previous books include the Tiananmenera novel Beijing Coma and Stick Out Your Tongue a collection of stories about Tibet His latest The Dark Road uses a fictional narrative to depict the tragic reallife effects of Chinas onechild policy initiated in 1979 to control population growth Having traveled extensively in rural China he claims to have learned of hundreds of victims of forced abortions or sterilizations Meili and Kongzi the married couple at the center of his novel become family planning fugitives when they try to have a second child After local officials begin a crackdown in their village Meili and Kongzi take their first child a daughter named Nannan and find refuge on a houseboat on the Yangtze River But this is only a temporary stop Meilis dream destination is a place called Heaven Township where the pollution is said to be so great that its impossible to become pregnant Meili wants a life in which she can earn enough money to display redpainted toenails under elegant leather sandals Her husband is determined to have a male heir regardless of the suffering another pregnancy will inflict on his wife Chinas onechild policy often discussed in the rather dry terms of population or abortion statistics is a ripe subject for a novel What better way to enable readers to see its personal consequences than through another individuals eyes Unfortunately too much of The Dark Road reads like an oped column The Family Planning policy is a protracted war waged against women and children Kongzi informs his daughter not the most naturalsounding remark to make to a child The problem isnt simply the translation by Ma Jians British partner Flora Drew but the authors apparent conviction that only unrelentingly straightforward prose will get his point across  Even so some of the novels scenes are horrific Meilis pregnancy is aborted at the order of family planning officers and she is forced to watch as her baby boy who enters the world still alive is strangled and put into a plastic bag Undeterred Kongzi persists in trying to impregnate his wife When she finally gives birth again to another girl he takes the baby away most likely to put her up for sale Meilis body is constantly being invaded if not by her husband then by the state Yet rather than let this powerful theme unfold naturally Ma Jian insists on spelling it out You force me to get pregnant Meili tells Kongzi then you take my baby from me Youre worse than the Communist Party On the next page Meili notes that women dont own their bodies their wombs and genitals are battle zones over which their husband and the state fight for control The Dark Road is a passionate book about an important topic but it would work more effectively if it veered offmessage long enough to let readers lose themselves in the story The poet Liao Yiwus memoir For a Song and a Hundred Songs reads more novelistically An earlier book The Corpse Walker gathered portraits from the lower rungs of Chinese society his new one is based on the four years he was imprisoned after writing a poem Massacre inspired by the events at Tiananmen Square and helping to make a film Requiem The memoir which has already won a major award in Germany is likely to be applauded by human rights groups as a fierce indictment of the Chinese government In many ways it is But to cast Liaos work in such simple terms is to overlook the way it also portrays the cruelties ordinary Chinese inflict upon one another  To his credit Liao doesnt paint himself as a martyr or an angel He slaps his wife and cheats on her When she breaks her leg he leaves her alone and goes off to seek adventure He was largely indifferent to the Tiananmen protests until the point of the violent confrontation in early June 1989 when he decided to go down the heroic path by writing and recording himself reading Massacre The poem is a rather bluntedged depiction of evil soldiers One line reads Open fire All barrels Blast away It feels so good But Liao later realizes that brutality isnt confined to soldiers He watches as a young woman who has stolen a peach is sexually assaulted by several men encouraged by onlookers A few months before Liao writes we were under the collective illusion that the Chinese people were brave and fearless yet to witness the malice of this smalltown mob showed that these same protesters were also capable of cruelly violating their fellow citizens  In prison the officers are hardly blameless  the books title refers to an episode in which Liao is forced to sing a hundred songs as an officer prods him with an electric baton  but some of the most harrowing descriptions are of prisoners torturing one another An inmate gives Liao a menu of physical torments to choose from ranging from the disgusting to the excruciating When Liao first arrives at the Song Mountain Investigation Center he discovers a system that resembles modern slavery The officer in charge appoints a notorious robber to be the chief of the cell which is divided into upper middle and lower classes Members of this last group known as slave thieves are made to empty toilets and perform sexual favors for higherranking prisoners Much as in outside society Liao observes the chief could use scented napkins to wipe his butt but slave thieves had to resort to using wrapping paper or old newspapers Considering how well I manage our cell the chief tells him ruling the country would be no problem for me The translation by Wenguang Huang includes dialogue that often succeeds in capturing the rhythm and flavor of spoken Chinese Liaos writings were concealed from the authorities before being smuggled out of the country After his release from prison he became even more disillusioned with his countrymen concluding they were more concerned with money than with dissent Many Chinese people including members of my family have long since lost interest in whether my case is reevaluated or not It seems that all they wanted was for me to get a real job Liao offers neither a diagnosis of Chinas ills nor prescriptions for their cure He simply wants to describe the world as he sees it The resulting work includes so many scatological references that he felt the need to explain Unfortunately I am not capable of elevating human feces to a higher level and imbuing it with political historical and religious meaning    I keep mentioning it because I almost drowned in it
"At Christian Companies, Religious Principles Complement Business Practices",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/03/us/at-christian-companies-religious-principles-complement-business-practices.html,In June a federal court ruled that Hobby Lobby the artsupply chain could not be fined for refusing to offer its employees morningafter contraception coverage This challenge to the Affordable Care Act will surely go to the Supreme Court where Hobby Lobbys lawyers will argue that a commercial company can legally speaking be Christian  with the same rights to religious freedom that a person has Hobby Lobby is not alone in identifying itself as a Christian business InNOut Burger ChickfilA the trucking company Covenant Transport and the clothing store Forever 21 all call or market themselves as

Roman Catholic businessman Tom Monaghan who founded and then sold Dominos Pizza also finances conservative causes ChickfilA is well known for its gifts to gayconversion ministries but it also supports group foster homes Tyson Foods which was founded by evangelicals and according to its Web site seeks to honor God offers chaplaincy services to employees Hobby Lobby is now famous for its stance against what its founders consider abortion pills But it also promotes a central liberal goal by offering a minimum wage of 14 an hour for fulltime employees about double that of the fastfood employees who struck nationwide this week for better pay and conditions Hobby Lobby closes on Sundays because of the Christian Sabbath but guaranteeing all workers that one day off surely pleases secular workers too  even if some of them may object to the stores Christianmusiconly policy Forever 21 prints John 316 on the bottom of its shopping bags Covenant Transport founded in 1985 by David A

you have to hunt and see what turns up Proverbs 2416 is on the fry boat For though a righteous man falls seven times he rises again but the wicked are brought down by calamity The verses were introduced by Rich Snyder the founders son who died in 1993 They are small because he wanted to express his faith without imposing it on others Carl Van Fleet an InNOut spokesman wrote in an email Steve Green the president of Hobby Lobby and a Southern Baptist said that the Christian identity of his company affects how it negotiates with vendors Well negotiate as Heres what well pay and leave it at that Mr Green said on Wednesday I asked if that meant that they never budged on their initial offers which seemed improbable Sometimes you dont intend on paying more but they come back and things do change he said But were not going to intentionally lie in our negotiating Focusing on particular practices like quotes on fry boats or gospel music can obscure deep philosophical divisions among Christians who think about business ethics For some the Bible is a kind of business manual youd buy in an airport bookstore offering timeless precepts that happen to maximize profits Philip J Clements the founder of the Center for Christian Business Ethics Today tells a story to illustrate how JudeoChristian principles make business run smoothly He once met with a group of businessmen in Africa most of them Muslim who complained of the corruption in their countries So he shared with them Jesus parable of the talents from the Book of Matthew in which a master offers his servants some money for their use When the master returns much later two of the servants have made a profit and pay him back They could have simply absconded with it Mr Clementss point is that the kind of trust Jesus teaches is a precondition for an efficient marketplace The Roman Empire was more corrupt than your countries Mr Clements said he told the Africans yet within it Christians could trust one another These principles are transcendent For Christians like Mr Clements who was raised Pentecostal and is now Baptist religious guidance is primarily useful for business operations Hes less interested in how business practices affect the environment or the role of labor rights He was in fact dismissive of livingwage laws offering the example of Mexicans who work in the United States for below minimum wage So give me a break on the whole concept of minimum wage or living wage Mr Clements said because these people are here working hard and sending money back For others Christian business is about something much larger Douglas A Hicks a Presbyterian minister the provost of Colgate University in Hamilton NY and the author of Religion and the Workplace said that Christians must focus on how business affects people especially the workers Are people able to live out their own agency by making a contribution in the workplace is according to Mr Hicks a question Christians should ask Do employees have meaningful work or just repetitive lowpaid mindnumbing work Mr Hicks did not object to burgerwrapper or shoppingbag evangelism But he cautioned that the businesses that behave in the most Christian manner may not have visible marketing plans Its the actions he said not the branding

                                        and four had survived and grown into the eightcell embryos that I focused on through a year of negative pregnancy tests followed by months of injections ultrasounds blood draws and intrusive medical appointments It all came down to those four embryos and I had to decide what to do with them Our doctor recommended transferring one she was concerned about the risks associated with carrying multiples I was more concerned about
                                        getting pregnant at all She agreed to transfer two embryos if I felt strongly about it I had a few hours to let her know
                                         I called my husband first He was as torn as I was and I knew that ultimately he would go with whatever I decided I called a trusted aunt who is a doctor and two friends who
                                        had each given birth to healthy IVF babies  one set of twins and one singleton They all shared their experiences but they had no clear answers I hung up the phone and wept I cried with relief and gratitude
                                        that the process had come this far and I cried for the unanticipated side effect of fertility treatments I was experiencing yet again the choices I resented having to make and the responsibility I didnt
                                        want to bear  Undeniably we all make choices about our bodies  who we share them with and the steps we take to get pregnant or not  and we all live with the consequences I knew this yet I was still envious of
                                        my friends who simply stopped their birth control waited a few months and then headed to the doctor to learn what magic had taken place They didnt have to struggle with the endless array of decisions
                                        that were plunked rather unceremoniously in front of my husband and me in the form of a ream of paperwork we had to complete once we decided to proceed with IVF  Did we want to know the gender of any embryos we might produce No Who would get custody of them in the event of a divorce Me Would we agree to selective reduction in the event that I was carrying multiples and
                                        the lives of one or more of them were in danger Although I support abortion rights this one gave us both great pause Checking the yes box was far from easy Did we fully understand the risks
                                        involved in the procedure I guess What would we do with any unused embryos Our options were to destroy or donate them either to another family or to research After a great deal of discussion we chose research We filled out the forms and plunged in A few months later I was at my desk wiping tears from my eyes I had no idea if I wanted twins but I knew I desperately wanted to be pregnant The possibility that transferring
                                        two embryos might increase that likelihood was hard to ignore My judgment was clouded by fatigue I was exhausted from all of the waiting and worrying the not knowing I was terrified of making the wrong choice
                                        I deferred to my doctor knowing full well what that meant We transferred one embryo and nine months later I gave birth to a healthy baby girl Just one Eleven months after that we thawed a second embryo which
                                        became our second daughter They are not twins and it was in fact our choice  Our daughters are now 4 and 3 and the remaining two embryos are frozen in a lab about 10 miles from our house They represent one more choice we have yet to make one that I am deeply grateful for despite my occasional
                                        frustration No matter what we decide I know that we will consider our options carefully as we will most certainly be answering questions for a long time to come"
Texas State Senator Says Bid for Governor Is Possible,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/us/politics/celebrated-texas-state-senator-says-bid-for-governor-is-possible.html,WASHINGTON  Wendy Davis the Texas state senator who captured the national spotlight with an 11hour filibuster against restricting abortion rights turned up in Washington on Monday with the news that she was considering a run for governor I can say with absolute certainty that I will run for one of two offices either my State Senate seat or the governor Ms Davis said after a luncheon and speech at the National Press Club It was Ms Daviss second trip to Washington in as many weeks  a period when she has met with staff members at the Democratic Governors Association raised money at soldout fundraisers turned up at parties around town and huddled with Emilys List The woman who turned pink sneakers into a symbol of resilience is under growing pressure from fellow Democrats to run She would have very broad appeal I believe in Texas and across the country said Martin Frost a former Texas congressman who was once head of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee I believe she could raise the money necessary to make this a race Although Ms Davis said to expect a decision about whether she would run within a couple weeks at the National Press Club she looked like a candidate finetuning a political stump speech As attendees passed around plates of cookies  shaped like Texas and frosted in the colors of its state flag  she described her path from impoverished single mother to Harvard Law School graduate to state senator barely glancing at her prepared remarks Although Gov Rick Perry of Texas has announced that he will not seek reelection Ms Davis took aim at him anyway accusing the longserving Republican of trumpeting his states relatively low unemployment rate of 64 percent while standing in the way of policies that would strengthen the states economy They travel to states as far away as California and New York trying to lure business to Texas while at the same time ignoring the needs in our community college and our higher education system to make sure that opportunities are available to all of our young Texans Ms Davis said alluding to Mr Perrys recent Texas Wide Open for Business advertisements And soon we know the consequence of that will be that ultimately well probably have to travel to other states to import brain power too But it is Greg Abbott the states attorney general who is the early frontrunner on the Republican ticket Mr Abbott announced his candidacy last month after amassing a war chest of 18 million by the end of 2012 that has unnerved many Democrats  Mr Frost estimated Monday that Democrats would need to raise about 35 million to 40 million During the last two weeks of June Ms Davis raised more than 930000 much of it in small contributions after her filibuster The Texas Tribune reported last month As her star rises Ms Davis has also been a boon to Texas Democrats drawing national attention to a party desperate for the momentum to break out in a solidly red state On Monday she offered nods to her fellow Democrats calling Mayor Julin Castro of San Antonio and Representative Joaquin Castro extraordinary and acknowledging the masterful help of her fellow Texas Democrats during her filibuster Bill Miller an Austinbased lobbyist who knows Ms Davis said she was hesitant when he encouraged her to pursue statewide office earlier this year But while he thinks Ms Davis will ultimately decide to run he said it would be a mistake to run for governor against Mr Abbott I think he is impossible to beat Mr Miller said But even as many in Texas said it would be a difficult fight there is optimism among Democrats that Ms Davis  a twoterm Democrat representing a conservative district  might have a shot I think theres great enthusiasm and shes probably created more enthusiasm than any Democrat in Texas has created in decades as far as interest from around the country said Ben Barnes a former lieutenant governor and Texas House speaker Organizers expected 150 people to attend a fundraiser in Washington for Ms Davis on July 25 one month after her headlinecatching filibuster with 25 student tickets and 50 individual tickets selling out days in advance But 400 people showed up said Matt Angle a longtime adviser to Ms Davis and director of the Lone Star Project a Democratic policy group I saw Texans up here that I havent seen in 10 years Mr Angle said
"Republicans, White Voters and Racial Polarization",https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/06/republicans-white-voters-and-racial-polarization/,"This National Journal piece the latest to misread Sean Trendes columns on the missing white voters of 2012                                        as an argument that the GOP should try to build a whitesonly majority reminds that Ive been meaning to write about some of the various liberal responses to Trendes argument
                                        Not the responses saying that hes factually or analytically wrong but the responses that either imply or state that even if he were right that there are a lot of upforgrabs white votes that the
                                        GOP might pursue effectively it would be immoral tragic andor ruinously divisiveÂ if Republicans were to actually try to win this way I think the New Yorkers Ryan Lizza has made the most extensive version of this argument The seduction of this alternate path for the GOP is obvious The changes associated with diversifying the Republican Partys coalition are dramatic and to some conservatives frightening Superficially
                                            at least simply attracting more whites seems safe and more ideologically consistent with the Partys current agenda   If this is indeed the path that the GOP pursues it would intensify one of the less welcome political trends of the past few decades the racial polarization of the electorate  In a recent paper the political scientist Alan Abramowitz documented this growing racial divide in our system The growing dependence of the Democratic Party on nonwhite voters has contributed
                                            to the flight of racially and economically conservative white voters to the GOP thereby further increasing the size of the racial divide between the party coalitions he noted  The outcome of the immigration debate will decide how much this trend accelerates Under one rather ominous scenario House Republicans will kill immigration reform and Democrats led by President Obama
                                            will mount a withering attack on the GOP in the Hispanic community blaming the Party for the bills demise Â Meanwhile the Supreme Courts recent decision to strike down part of
                                            the Voting Rights Act has led Republicans in several Southern states to pursue laws that previously would have been challenged by the Justice Department as making it more difficult for some minorities to vote The net result of all this is  a Republican strategy to defeat immigration reform increase its support among whites and make it harder for some nonwhites to vote  [is] a recipe for a future in
                                            which Americas two parties are largely defined by race But as Lizzas mention of the White Houses political strategy on immigration implicitly acknowledges this recipe is one that leftofcenter coalition politics bears a lot of
                                        responsibility for cooking upÂ The Democrats havent just been passive players in the recent racial polarization of the parties Rather theyve embraced and furthered the trend
                                        as a necessary part of making their new presidentiallevel coalition of the ascendant work
                                        Where the Clintonera Democrats still tried to win working class whites outright the Obamaera Democrats mostly just used scorchedearth campaigning                                        to try to minimize the GOPs margin andor keep these voters on the sidelines Where the preObama party still made room for
                                        immigration skeptics and coalcountry populists the Obamaera Democrats have pushed in policy directions calculated to alienate many of the swing voters who cast ballots for Byron Dorgan in the past or Joe Manchin
                                        or Mark Pryor in the present Where the preObama party spoke the language of safe legal and rare on abortion and basically set gun control aside as a losing issue the Obama Democrats have mostly
                                        dropped the rare part and postNewtown taken up the guncontrol cause anew And so on You could argue that these are all just necessary pivots given the racial dynamics of the Obama era But racial bias alone cant explain why the president went from losing noncollegeeducated white voters by
                                        only 18 points in 2008 to being 40 points underwater with that same demographic today The issue
                                        matrix matters as well and over the last five years this administration and this Democratic Party have consistently tried to mobilize new coalition elements in ways that have very predictably tended to alienate
                                        downscale whites And that strategy has worked Energizing ascendant constituencies while pushing workingclass whites toward the Republicans has represented a form of positive polarization for the Democrats
                                        since its left them with a presidentiallevel majority that they did not enjoy before But like any successful gambit its also created vulnerabilities The Democrats may not longer need that many
                                        working class white votes to win but they probably cant actually afford to lose them in a 7030 splitÂ And
                                        in the normal course of political events it would be entirely reasonable for the opposition party to look at a presidents collapsing ratings with a demographic his party has mostly written off and focus
                                        on that group as a target of opportunity in the next few election cycles Now nothing to do with race in America is politically normal But the problemÂ with suggesting that the GOP shouldnt aim for a white working class target because it would further racially polarize the
                                        country is twofold First it asks Republicans to basically play by rules that victorious Democratic strategists are writing and more importantly it tells working class whites that they should pretty much get
                                        used to being ignored by both parties because the countrys racial harmony depends on it I dont particularly want to live in a country where the two political coalitions are thoroughly divided along
                                        racialethnic lines But I also dont want to live in a country where many of the voters most disillusioned with the political system
                                        and most battered by the trends of the last five years and the last thirty alike dont have either party responding to their point of view and asking for their vote I also tend to think as Ive written before that the racialpolarization problem Lizza and other liberals are worried
                                        about is probably one that will take care of itself If the GOP misreads Trendes argument and falls for the idea that it can win workingclass whites especially in nonsouthern states without moving
                                        toward the center or a center more aptly on economic policy then it will fail miserably and probably see its coalition shrink rather than grow No matter which way white voters are trending there is
                                        simply no way to build a national majority on the basis of opposition to immigration reform support for voter ID laws and the GOPs
                                        2012 economic platform and if the Republican Party takes that path it will be deservedly defeated again and again  which in turn will eventually inspire a rightofcenter rethink that shakes up the current
                                        trend toward racial polarization On the other hand if Republicans interpret Trendes analysis correctly and set out to increase their margins with working class whites by developing aÂ more inclusive and populist vision on economic policy
                                        then they will probably ultimately win more Hispanic and even AfricanAmerican votes as well  because the GOPs current weakness with those groups is driven by economic issues as well as identity
                                        politics and there is a reasonablystrong overlap between the kind of arguments that would woo downscale white voters in Minnesota and middleclass Hispanics outside Las Vegas Properly understood then the argument
                                        that the GOP should focus on the Democratic Partys whiteworkingclass vulnerability is not an argument for a conscious strategy of racial polarization Rather its an argument for a Republican
                                        Party that recognizes liberalisms growing weakness with a particular demographic and responds with a reinvention thats pitched to those votersÂ and to the places where their concerns
                                        overlap with those of electorate as a whole I dont particularly expect the GOP to execute this kind of strategy effectively But Id rather see them try the risk of racial polarization notwithstanding then watch both parties unite in ignoring
                                        the particular mix of stresses and anxieties that beset the white working class"
Abortion in America and Europe,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/08/abortion-in-america-and-europe/,"My column two weeks ago on what other developed countries abortion laws tell us about the impact of abortion restrictions                                        prompted a number of rebuttals most notably from Scott Lemieux at The American Prospect and Katha Pollitt at The Nation
                                        To my point that a number of European countries restrict second and thirdtrimester abortions without producing any obviously disastrous consequences for womens health and professional advancement both
                                        Lemieux and Pollitt argue that the European bans only work because the countries in question make firsttrimester abortion more accessible and affordable than does the United States Heres Lemieux  You cant discuss the restrictive aspects of abortion policy in some European countries without acknowledging other policies that make abortion more accessible Adopting French abortion policy would
                                            require not only additional regulations on abortion in some states and fewer in others wed need to repeal of the Hyde Amendment and enact provisions to make abortion providers much more accessible in
                                            general
                                         Similarly one cannot simply compare the language of statutes without considering how they are implemented A waiting period requirement works very differently in a context in which most women can obtain safe abortions
                                            for free at local public hospitals and are protected by labor laws than in a context where many women live hundreds of miles from the nearest abortion provider and can be fired at will for missing a day of work
                                            Counseling requirements work differently in countries where there isnt a large politically potent antichoice lobby dedicated to ensuring that doctors inform their patients with scientifically
                                            inaccurate antichoice propaganda And so on And heres Pollitt making a similar point Heres whats really different about Western Europe in France you can get an abortion at any public hospital and its paid for by the government In Germany you can get one at a hospital
                                            or a doctors office and health plans will pay for it for lowincome women In Sweden abortion is free through eighteen weeks Moreover unlike the time limits passed in Texas and some other states
                                            or floating around in Congress the European limits have exceptions variously for physical or mental health fetal anomaly or rape Contrast that with what antichoicers want for the United States where Paul
                                            Ryan memorably described a health exception to a proposed lateterm abortion ban as a loophole wide enough to drive a Mack truck through it If a French or German or Swedish 12yearold or a
                                            traumatized rape victim or a woman carrying a fetus with TaySachs disease shows up after the deadline I bet a way can often be found to quietly take care of them If not Britain or the Netherlands where
                                            second trimester abortion is legal are possibilities A few observations First off Pollitt is slightly misinformed about the Texas legislation Like many of the European laws she
                                        mentions it does include exceptions related to maternal health and fetal anomalies Its postviability ban does not apply
                                        and I quote to abortions that areÂ necessary to avert the death or substantial and irreversibleÂ physical impairment of a major bodily function of the pregnantÂ woman or abortions that are
                                        performed on unborn children withÂ severe fetal abnormalities You can read an antiabortion critique of the fetalabnormality provision here
                                        Obviously there is disagreement about the appropriate scope of such provisions and there Pollitt and Paul Ryan would certainly differ But the Texas ban is not actually absolute and its exceptions do cover at
                                        least some of the hard cases that prochoice advocates tend to cite in opposition to such laws SecondÂ Lemieux and Pollitt are absolutely right that firsttrimester abortion is more accessible and affordable in some parts of continental Europe than it is in someÂ  regions of the United
                                        States and the accessibility question does matter when it comes to assessing the ultimate impact of second and thirdtrimester bans At the same time though in Europe as in the United States theres a
                                        lot of variation in the accessibility of abortion and to borrow Lemieuxs point the way statutes are implemented matters as much as how theyre written ThisÂ 
                                        Planned Parenthood surveyÂ from 2009 provides a highlevel countrybycountry
                                        skim of some of these accessibility issues obviously from a prochoice perspectiveÂ This is true within countries  its easier to get an abortion in Berlin than in Bavaria not surprisinglyÂ 
                                        and also true when you make crosscountry comparisons Germanys counselingwaiting period regime arguably puts more official limits on firsttrimester abortion than Italys laws for instance but
                                        as Pollitt herself allowsÂ in much of Italy its hard to find an abortion because so many doctors refuse to perform them In Spain where abortion is very much a live political issue
                                        there was a nearabsolute ban the only exception was for rape until the last decade when a Socialist government passed a firsttrimester legalization Â but the older ban included a health exception
                                        that was interpreted permissively enough to basically allow for firsttrimester elective abortions mostly in private clinics in many parts of the country And then of course theres Ireland where abortion
                                        is clearly more restricted at least for now than in even the deepestred US states So yes it is an oversimplification to suggest that France or Germany are somehow obviously more prolife overall than the United States given the multiplicity of differences between our system and
                                        theirs But its also an oversimplification to say that the US is unique among developed nations in having significant variations in abortion access or robust political debate on the issue And the reason
                                        to look at the European experience is not because the continent is somehow an exemplar of exactly the policies that prolife American conservatives are pushing now or would put in place if given constitutional
                                        license Rather its because it provides examples of manyÂ different approaches to the issue  stringently prolife with a stronger welfare state Ireland expansively prochoice with
                                        a much stronger welfare state Sweden more prolife in law but relatively prochoice in practice Spain until recently relatively prochoice in law but more culturally prolife Italy arguably and so onÂ Â that
                                        dont necessarily map on to Americas right vs left debate at all This variation in turn gives us more data on the original question that my column asked WhatÂ happens to a modern society when abortion is restrictedÂ And I dont think that either Pollitt
                                        or Lemieux offered much of a rebuttal to my suggestion that Europes variations and their apparent consequences pose a problem for two commonplace prochoice assumptions That restrictions on abortion dont
                                        actually reduce abortion rates which appears to be true in neither the US nor in Europe and more importantly that any restrictions
                                        on abortion are necessarilyÂ threats to female professional advancement and bodily health The example of Ireland in particular provides no evidence for the latter contention No one seriously disputes that Ireland has long had some of the most restrictive abortion laws in the developed West
                                        and yet there is no clear signÂ in the dataÂ that Irish women are suffering relative
                                        to the Western counterparts in the obvious ways that prochoice arguments would lead one to expectÂ Lemieux responds to my points about Ireland by falling back on a philosophical defense of abortion rights
                                        which is fine and deserving of a response a later date but not really responsive to the empirical question Pollitt responds by noting that many Irish women go abroad for abortion Â but those numbers
                                        are small relative to the abortion rates in other countries and in any event they dont change the fact that Ireland throws up much more severe impediments to abortion than the kind of restrictions that
                                        inspired Wendy Daviss filibuster So I will resubmit my question If abortion rights and easy abortion access are essential to female advancement why have Irish women advanced without them And then finally Ill note again that the European experience poses a challenge for conservative abortion opponents as well who need to consider the possibility that restrictions on abortion might work better
                                         or perhaps only work at allÂ Â with more generous public provisions for maternal health care But thats a subject for another post"
Legislature Restores Some Family Planning Cuts,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/09/us/legislature-restores-some-family-planning-cuts.html,HOUSTON  When Anastasia Tolmasoff went to a Planned Parenthood clinic in March to receive her quarterly injection of DepoProvera she discovered she could no longer afford to receive birth control there  Im living paycheck to paycheck so getting pregnant and having another child is not an option for me said Ms Tolmasoff 33 who rehabilitates wildlife at a nonprofit organization She and her husband cannot afford health insurance  Nearly six months later she visited Legacy Community Health Services in Houston The federally qualified health centers staff helped her enroll in the staterun Texas Womens Health Program to cover her injection Ms Tolmasoff is one of thousands of women affected by the Texas Legislatures 2011 decisions to drastically cut family planning financing and remove abortion affiliated providers  namely Planned Parenthood  from state health programs  In its 2013 session the Legislature sought to mitigate the impact of those cuts with the largest financial package for womens health services in state history increasing spending to 214 million in the 201415 budget from 109 million  Still womens health advocates have raised concerns that the financing does not go far enough Moreover some advocates argue that strict abortion regulations approved during a special session will create additional burdens on women already struggling to access contraception If in fact they really dont want people to have abortions then they should have ready access to family planning said Katy Caldwell chief executive of Legacy Community Health Services And they dont in the rural areas anymore because so many clinics have had to shut down access to family planning The 2011 cuts dramatically reduced the number of family planning providers in Texas Seventysix medical facilities  a third of which were Planned Parenthood clinics  have closed or stopped providing family planning services as a result of lost public financing according to the latest provider survey conducted by the Texas Public Policy Evaluation Project a research initiative at the University of Texas at Austin Although the researchers found that the state has enrolled at least 16 new family planning providers they estimate that Texas investment in family planning services averted 30000 fewer unintended pregnancies in 2012 than in 2010  To restore access to family planning services Texas 201415 budget includes a 100 million expansion of a primary care program to provide services for an additional 170000 women 71 million to operate the Texas Womens Health Program and 43 million to replace family planning grants that the federal government awarded to another organization to distribute  The state plans to spend 60 percent of the primary care expansion dollars on family planning services expand the number of contracted providers to 100 from 57 and provide wraparound benefits including prenatal and dental care for pregnant women which are not covered by other public programs  Ms Caldwell said that although the primary care expansion would provide additional benefits to lowincome women its success depended on how the state allocates the money particularly in rural areas where family planning clinics closed  I love the fact that this is more comprehensive than it was in the past she said But we still dont have enough family planning dollars here in the state of Texasshe added The 201415 budget will meet only a third of the need for subsidized family planning services in Texas according to the Texas Womens Health Coalition which represents 39 medical trade associations and advocacy groups in the state  Although the coalition advocated for the expanded primary care program in the 2013 session it has since raised concerns that the Department of State Health Services has not set up the program to effectively prioritize family planning services The bottom line for us is we want the women to be able to get the services said Dr Janet Realini the coalitions chairwoman She added Theres an advantage to guiding that money to the family planning that preventive care piece because thats where the cost savings occur  In a letter to the coalition Dr David L Lakey the health services commissioner countered that the agency had made family planning services a priority and held nine informal meetings for feedback on the programs expansion The department set the 60 percent target for family planning services he wrote and we intend to meet that target and carry out the program as directed by the Legislature as we have been doing all along Texas also plans to enact regulations in late October that would ban abortions at 20 weeks postfertilization and mandate physicians performing an abortion to have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of the facility The law will also require abortions to be performed in ambulatory surgical centers beginning in September 2014 Gov Rick Perry and other proponents say the regulations will improve patient safety  At least 36 of the 42 licensed abortion facilities in Texas do not meet the new regulatory standards because they are not ambulatory surgical centers It is unclear how many of the six ambulatory surgical centers have a physician on staff with hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of the facility  The facilities that do not meet those standards are evaluating whether they would have to close under the law  It remains to be seen if I can keep my facilities open said Amy Hagstrom Miller chief executive of Whole Womans Health which operates five licensed abortion facilities in Texas Although only one of those facilities meets the ambulatory surgical center requirements she said the hospital privileges requirement could pose an even greater burden because it is outside the control of the abortion facilities Many hospitals have rules that could prohibit them from granting privileges to doctors who perform abortions Ms Hagstrom Miller said hospital administrators have expressed concern that Texas could ban a hospital from participating in other state programs if it granted privileges to such doctors  Opponents of the abortion law say that it would take most providers more than a year to build ambulatory surgical centers to perform abortions You cant just do a few renovations and convert a facility that is already existing said Melaney Linton president and chief executive of Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast which serves parts of East Texas and Louisiana After Texas approved a law in 2003 requiring abortions 16 weeks after fertilization to be performed in ambulatory surgical centers Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast determined it would cost in the seven figures to retrofit its main facility in Houston It took the organization six years to raise financing and build the Houston ambulatory surgical center it operates For six years we could not provide women who need that service that care Ms Linton said Its heartbreaking because women who need to end a pregnancy after 16 weeks are often in some of the most extreme circumstances Ms Tolmasoff said her experience has motivated her to become more politically active You want to tune the politics out she said but when they really start affecting you you have to listen 
Pain Theory in Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/10/opinion/pain-theory-in-abortion.html,To the Editor Re Theory on Pain Is Driving Rules for Abortions front page Aug 2 As a physician I am guided in my work by facts and evidence While opponents of legal abortion claim that fetuses experience pain in order to justify restrictions on later abortion the best scientific and medical research available does not support this assertion Ample evidence suggests that at 20 weeks after fertilization the fetus lacks the physical structures necessary to experience pain As a provider who cares for women I know that abortion is a part of the continuum of reproductive health care that one in three American women has an abortion in her lifetime and that when abortion is less accessible it becomes less safe I wish that lawmakers would recognize these realities take facts and evidence  not bad science and conjecture  into consideration and stop interfering with a womans private medical decisions NANCY STANWOOD Board Chairwoman Physicians for Reproductive Health New Haven Aug 2 2013
"In Iowa, Hopes That a Clinton Can Close a Gap",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/10/us/politics/in-iowa-hopes-that-a-clinton-can-close-a-gap.html,DES MOINES  Iowa has never exactly been a place that feels like home for the Clintons  Bill Clinton did not compete in the 1992 firstinthenation caucuses because Tom Harkin Iowas veteran Democratic senator and favorite son was running for the presidential nomination And when Hillary Rodham Clinton sought the presidency in 2008 her campaign considered pulling out of the state Then New Yorks junior senator she mused publicly about the special obstacle she faced running as a woman here and she came in third place So it was understandable that at a forum here Friday to discuss electing a woman president there was more than a touch of pleading to some of the discussion about why Mrs Clinton should return to the state that proved so unwelcoming Its a new playing field its a new ballgame its apples and oranges said Jessica Vanden Berg a Democratic strategist who grew up in Iowa reaching for the right metaphor to make the case that the 2016 caucuses would be far friendlier to Mrs Clinton To buttress her point Ms Vanden Berg noted that Emilys List which works to elect female Democrats who support abortion rights had filled a small room to capacity with about 100 Iowans on a gorgeous Friday morning in the heart of vacation season nearly two and a half years before the next caucuses Ostensibly they were there to support the general notion of breaking the gender barrier in presidential politics But the repeated applause at the mention of Mrs Clintons name made explicit what is implicit in Emilys Lists Madam President campaign which will next move to New Hampshire and Nevada two other early nominating states Senator Claire McCaskill Democrat of Missouri who has already announced her support for Mrs Clinton should she run joined the forum and got to the point quickly Look at the groundswell of interest and support its pretty unusual in American politics to have this Ms McCaskill a supporter of Mr Obama in 2008 said in an interview Everywhere I go women and men are saying Hillary Clinton is the candidate shes the right candidate we want Hillary Clinton And typically were all fighting with each other at this point in time That many Democratic activists and officials especially women are pining for Mrs Clinton to run for president was evident here But that was not the only notion looming over the conversation Democrats here know that their state which has produced proud liberals from Henry Wallace to John Culver to Mr Harkin has never elected a female governor senator or member of the House It is an ignoble distinction Iowa shares only with Mississippi and it is something Mrs Clinton brought up when she ran in 2008 and is undoubtedly conscious of still The women gathered Friday at a restored downtown arts facility were conscious of it as well During the event Emilys List sent reporters an email with a poll that they released to an Iowa newspaper The QuadCity Times showing that 96 percent of Democratic caucusgoers would consider voting for a woman  Its time to stop saying that women cant win in Iowa said Ms Vanden Berg who last year managed the highprofile Congressional campaign of Christie Vilsack and said Ms Vilsack would have won had she run in a different Iowa district  We know women can win here added Stephanie Schriock the president of Emilys List This state is more than ready The 2014 race will test that Three women are vying for the Democratic nomination for an open Congressional seat another Democratic woman is challenging Representative Tom Latham a Republican and a Republican woman is running for the Senate seat that will be left open by Mr Harkin who announced in January that he would retire It has taken a while to get experienced women in the pipeline to run said Staci Appel a stockbroker and former state senator who will challenge Mr Latham in Iowas Third District and participated in the forum here Other veteran Iowa Democrats attribute the lack of women elected to high office to circumstance running in difficult years or in challenging races Mrs Clinton falls into the latter category said Patty Judge a former state agriculture secretary and lieutenant governor Speaking a bit more candidly than the other Clinton supporters here Ms Judge said I believe that Hillary did not have as strong a campaign here as Barack Obama Iowa politics she continued is about touching people and she said that Mrs Clinton had learned that lesson I think Hillarys people learned a lot and think when she comes back here this time shes going to understand the need for that strong ground game Ms Judge said  She also said gender challenges were not completely gone for female candidates here I managed to get elected agriculture secretary and then for eight years I would find people that would tell me I really didnt think that was a job for a woman and I didnt vote for you but youve done OKÂ  she recalled So it certainly is alive and well but its changing One former top adviser to Mrs Clinton here in 2008 however said it was not fair to the state to blame gender noting that Mr Obama fared better than Mrs Clinton in all the caucus states because of his superior organization and more compelling message with liberal activists The problems back then were not just Iowa said this adviser who was not authorized to speak for Mrs Clinton What is clear now is that Iowa Democrats want a second chance to win Mrs Clintons affection after rejecting her in 2008 There are legions of women my age who were Obama supporters whose hearts were torn in two by that decision said Sue Dvorsky a former chairwoman of the Iowa Democratic Party and Obama supporter in the 2008 caucuses If in one lifetime of activism I could support them both  wow Asked what she would say to Mrs Clinton to try to persuade her to give Iowa another try Swati Dandekar a Clinton supporter in 2008 and former state representative and senator now running for an open Congressional seat said Look at me the American dream is still alive If an immigrant from India who came in 1973 can say Im running for US Congress and Iowans are saying We are there for you I dont have to say any more than that
Tackling the Roots of Rape,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/13/opinion/bruni-tackling-the-roots-of-rape.html,Steubenville The Naval Academy Vanderbilt University The stories of young men sexually assaulting young women seem never to stop despite all the education weve had and all the progress weve supposedly made and there are times when I find myself darkly wondering if theres some ineradicable predatory streak in the male subset of our species Wrong Chris Kilmartin told me Its not DNA were up against its movies manners and a set of mores magnified in the worlds of the military and sports that assign different roles and different worth to men and women Fix that culture and we can keep women a whole lot safer I reached out to Kilmartin a psychology professor and the author of the textbook The Masculine Self after learning that the military is repeatedly reaching out to him Right now hes in Colorado at the Air Force Academy which imported him for a year to teach in the behavioral sciences department and advise the school on preventing sexual violence He previously worked on a Naval Academy curriculum with that aim and helped to write a training film for the Army At a time of heightened concern about rape and related crimes in the armed services hes being welcomed as someone with insights into the problem Its deepest roots he said are the cult of hypermasculinity which tells boys that aggression is natural and sexual conquest enviable and a set of laws and language that cast women as inferior pliable even disposable We start boys off at a very early age Kilmartin told me during a recent phone conversation When the worst thing we say to a boy in sports is that he throws like a girl we teach boys to disrespect the feminine and disrespect women Thats the cultural undercurrent of rape Boys see women objectified in popular entertainment and tossed around like rag dolls in pornography They encounter fewer women than men in positions of leadership They hear politicians advocate for legislation like the Virginia antiabortion bill that would have required women who wanted to end pregnancies to submit to an invasive vaginal ultrasound Before you make a reproductive choice you are going to be required to have somebody penetrate you with an object he said Thats very paternalistic we know whats right Youre not in control of your own body He noted that discussions of domestic violence more often included the question of why a battered woman stayed than the question of why a battering man struck as if the striking was to be expected Men will be brute men just as boys will be lusty boys If Kilmartins observations can read at times like humorless chunks of a politically correct tome thats not how he actually comes across Hes loose funny In fact hes got a sideline hobby as a standup comic No joke And hes got a trove of less wonky riffs He mentions the University of Iowa which for decades has painted the locker room used by opponents pink to put them in a passive mood with a sissy color in the words of a former head football coach Hayden Fry He mentions the bizarre use of the term sex scandals for such incidents as Tailhook decades ago and the recent accusations that Bob Filner the mayor of San Diego groped women around him among other offenses Theyre violence scandals he said If I hit you over the head with a frying pan I dont call that cooking The armed services are a special challenge because theyre all about aggression summoning and cultivating Attila the Hun and then asking him to play Sir Walter Raleigh as well But Kilmartin said that thats a resolvable tension if men are conditioned to show the same selfcontrol toward women that they do successfully in following myriad military regulations if theyre encouraged to call out sexist behavior and if above all commanders monitor their own conduct never signaling that women are secondclass citizens The integration of women into combat duties will help bolstering womens standing and altering a climate of inequality Kilmartin said But he and the rest of us are taking on fortified traditions and calcified mindsets and thats evident in the enrollment in the two classes of Interdisciplinary Perspectives on Men and Masculinity that he began teaching on Friday Although female cadets are about 20 percent of the Air Force Academy theyre more than half of the students who signed up for Kilmartins course he said He said that one of them during the very first session recounted that someone at flight school over the summer had told her that women shouldnt fly planes Oh so do you fly a plane with your penis Kilmartin asked the class One of the male cadets responded Sounds like youre issuing a challenge sir
Democrats Put Hope in Texas Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/us/14iht-letter14.html,NEW YORK  Not since Sarah Palins splashy debut in US politics in August 2008 has any female politician come out of obscurity and virtually overnight captured the eye of the political and media world like the belle from Fort Worth Texas Wendy Davis the state senator whose marathon filibuster of a restrictive abortion bill is now history  In just a few weeks the Wendy Davis phenomenon has grown exponentially She is no longer just a rising star in the Democratic Party constellation She has risen Democrats in Washington in Texas and around the nation marshaled by female activists are clamoring for her to run for governor in 2014  no matter that her chances of winning are slim in a state that has not elected a Democratic chief executive in more than 20 years Some people in her political circle believe she might just pull off a stunning victory which would upend politics in Texas and give new life to the Democratic Party movement to turn the state blue Ms Davis made headlines last week in Washington when she told a rapt audience at the National Press Club that she would decide by Labor Day Sept 2  Emboldened by her newly found celebrity and her own charisma and guts  plus some deep pockets among her supporters in and out of Texas  she could challenge the moneyed conservative Texas Republican establishment and its likely candidate Attorney General Greg Abbott  I want Wendy Davis to run for governor Senator Kirsten E Gillibrand of New York told me on Friday Ms Gillibrand who won reelection by a landslide last November is undeterred by speculation that Ms Davis cannot win in Texas She believes that even if Ms Davis were to lose the race she would still command a big platform in the nations secondlargest state one that would reverberate nationwide to discuss tough issues like womens reproductive health abortion rights education jobs and the middle class She will elevate the conversation  Ms Daviss reach extends beyond Texas  thanks in part to a media and publicity campaign fashioned by one of her biggest champions Emilys List the political action committee that works to elect female Democrats who support abortion rights  Next Friday Ms Davis will headline an Emilys List program in San Francisco featuring two other activists Sandra Fluke the Georgetown law student who became a celebrity when the conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh called her a slut for supporting a requirement that health insurers cover contraceptives and Representative Tulsi Gabbard of Hawaii one of two female combat veterans elected in 2012 and the first HinduAmerican to serve in Congress In addition to headlining that major event Ms Davis has recently been added to Emilys Lists lineup of rising stars and potential female presidential candidates in 2016 2020 and beyond That list starts with Hillary Rodham Clinton and includes younger Democrats like Ms Gillibrand Senator Elizabeth Warren of Massachusetts and Senator Amy Klobuchar of Minnesota And for all that Ms Davis is not the brightest sun of this political summer Mrs Clinton is of course  Here too Emilys List has jumped on the bandwagon Traveling across the country putting on carefully targeted forums and town halls its Madam President initiative is zeroing attention  as if any were needed  on Mrs Clinton the Democrats overwhelming favorite to be their choice for president in 2016  At a recent gathering in Des Moines Iowa a crucial state in the presidential sweepstakes Stephanie Schriock president of Emilys List said that a poll conducted for her organization of likely Democratic caucus participants in Iowa showed that 96 percent of them would vote for a woman to be president Those poll results are remarkable only because Iowa has never elected a female governor senator or member of the House Iowa was the site of an early brutal defeat in Mrs Clintons run for the presidency five years ago but the poll results suggest that next time would be different This is going to change very very quickly Ms Schriock told The QuadCity Times last week Were already seeing it in the numbers And thats why I think weve got a really good opportunity here to have Iowa lead the way on nominating the first woman presidential candidate in the Democratic Party  Perhaps to drive home the point of Mrs Clintons inevitability the featured speaker at the forum was Senator Claire McCaskill Democrat of Missouri who reiterated her allout support Ms McCaskills enthusiasm is relatively new Not only did she support Barack Obama over Mrs Clinton in the 2008 race but she has been frequently quoted as having once said that she would not want her daughter anywhere near Bill Clinton Not all is coming up roses for Democratic women Theres a general feeling among advocates and activists that the womens movement has peaked and that not enough women are signing up to run and work on campaigns We have stalled Ms Gillibrand said citing a reason she introduced her Off the Sidelines campaign two years ago  Last week Emilys List said it had singled out Los Angeles for intensive efforts to recruit train and help finance female candidates according to The New York Times Los Angeles the secondlargest city in America behind New York has a female population of 19 million and politically liberal demographics yet only one woman holds elective office in the entire citywide government Shes a member of the City Council from the San Fernando Valley hardly an empowering position  As for Ms Davis she has hit a nerve Even before stepping into the governors race in Texas and making all the usual enemies she has roiled conservative waters in the Red Nation Now they call her abortion Barbie 
The Real Price of Congressâ€™s Gridlock,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/opinion/the-real-price-of-congresss-gridlock.html,BERKELEY Calif  CONGRESS began its summer recess last week and wont reconvene until after Labor Day Youd be forgiven for not noticing a difference With just 15 bills signed into law so far this year the 113th Congress is on pace to be the most unproductive since at least the 1940s  But just because the legislature has ceased to function doesnt mean our government has Political decision making has moved to peripheral public entities where power is exercised less transparently and accountability to voters is less direct What were losing in the process isnt government  its democracy Take the Federal Reserve Absent any Congressional legislation to speak of  no shortterm spending to increase job growth no longterm plan to reduce the budget deficit  the nations central bank has been forced to do all the heavy lifting with the economy The 85 billion of bonds it buys each month is now the main form of government stimulus to the economy as well as the linchpin of continued job growth Congresss inability to pass effective fiscal policy means that the Feds monetary policy to keep longterm interest rates as low as possible has become the only game in town for boosting private spending and investment  But the strategy also poses serious risks like asset bubbles if borrowers use the cheap money to speculate bond collapses if the Fed slows its bond buying too quickly and spooks the market and inflation if low interest rates cause buyers and sellers to expect prices to rise It could also increase income inequality by giving wealthy investors a cheap source of funds to expand their portfolios Forcing the Fed to become the sole decision maker on the economy is also why the selection of a new Fed chairman has become so important  even more important than it ought to be  Congresss paralysis has also encouraged the Supreme Court to enter the political fray Normally the judicial activism of recent years could be checked by Congressional action But not now Justice Anthony M Kennedys opinion for the majority in the 2010 Citizens United case which struck down limits on corporate campaign contributions rested partly on the presumption that Congress would require corporations to disclose their political expenditures But no bill requiring full disclosure has stood a chance of making it through the quagmire  The courts decision this summer in Shelby County v Holder handed Congress the task of coming up with a new updated formula for deciding which states and localities need permission from the Justice Department under the Voting Rights Act to make changes to their election processes But legislative paralysis makes the passage of any new formula highly unlikely Seen in this light Chief Justice John G Roberts Jrs deciding vote last year to uphold the Affordable Care Act probably reflected his reasonable fear that the court would otherwise be viewed not unfairly as just another political battleground Or consider climate change Its a public debate the nation briefly embarked on in the 2008 presidential race when John McCain and Barack Obama presented different plans for capandtrade systems Naturally gridlock in Congress put an end to it After the election Mr McCain backed off any capandtrade plan and the two parties have been at loggerheads over the environment ever since  The issue ultimately lost the spotlight to a debate over Mr Obamas choice for administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Gina McCarthy who is expected to use the EPAs authority under the Clean Air Act to regulate the carbon emissions of power plants and to a Congressional showdown motivated in part by Mr Obamas EPA appointment over the use of the filibuster on presidential nominees Mr Obama won the skirmish and got his administrator but dont expect much public deliberation over carbon emissions from here on The EPA will handle the issue through regulatory rule making mostly unchecked by Congress and the public  A final displacement of national politics has been onto state governments now grappling with everything from undocumented immigrants and gun control to gay marriage and abortion While many political matters should be left to the states these cry out for federal standards because of the relative ease with which undocumented immigrants gun sellers gay couples and women seeking abortions can transport themselves to more accommodating jurisdictions Whats more these institutions arent even understood by the public to be making political decisions with national implications Media coverage tends to be narrowly drawn for insiders  macroeconomists constitutional scholars EPA watchers the residents of a particular state  or trivialized for outsiders Should the next Fed chief be female Are Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas too openly partisan Is Ms McCarthy too much of a firebrand Are red states diverging from blue states The Republican right  mostly new House members who are supported by the Tea Party and who are in open rebellion against the rest of the right  are probably pleased with the gridlock in Congress They would like nothing better than to stop the federal government from functioning But they may not fully grasp that their efforts have only shifted power elsewhere in the system  Some of the institutions gaining power may be making decisions consistent with conservative values the Supreme Court and some state governments for instance But hardly all the Fed and the EPA  In any event its bizarre that a selfstyled populist insurrection would end up making our government less accountable to the people But thats exactly what its done Whats really gridlocked now is democracy
North Carolinians Fear the End of a Middle Way,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/14/us/north-carolinians-fear-the-end-of-a-middle-way.html,EDEN NC  When Pat McCrory a Republican former mayor of Charlotte was elected governor last year he pledged to bring this state together and to focus on breadandbutter issues amid an ailing economy But with Republicans controlling all branches of the state government for the first time in more than a century the legislature pushed through a wide range of conservative change The Republicans not only cut taxes and business regulations as many had expected but also allowed stricter regulations on abortion clinics ended teacher tenure blocked the expansion of Medicaid cut unemployment benefits removed obstacles to the death penalty allowed concealed guns in bars and restaurants and mandated the teaching of cursive writing Just this week Mr McCrory signed into law strict voter identification requirements prohibiting sameday registration and cutting early voting Many of those from the extreme left who have been criticizing photo ID are using scare tactics he said in a video on his Web site Theyre more interested in divisive politics than ensuring that no ones vote is disenfranchised by a fraudulent ballot Lawsuits have been filed  including one on Monday by the NAACP  and protests are taking place almost weekly in Raleigh the capital and other cities leaving North Carolinians across the political spectrum worried that the states oftenhailed political pragmatism may have given way to the ideological warfare of Washington This is a definite break from what I would consider normal behavior for North Carolina said David French 27 who is looking for a job in industrial design here in rural Rockingham County The whole political system nowadays is becoming more extreme In an interview Mr McCrory said that critics had obscured what he called a pragmatic and fiscally responsible agenda Its a combination of people on the two extremes wanting to bring up and exaggerate controversial issues he said adding that he had pushed back against earlier versions of the abortion and tax bills and was planning to veto other bills this week But the agenda that did pass was unquestionably a right turn for a state that only five years ago voted for Barack Obama the first Democratic presidential candidate to win here since Jimmy Carter With a run of Democratic governors stretching back to 1993 North Carolina was considered such a promising state for the Democrats that they held their convention in Charlotte in 2012 It shocked everybody said Sam Hummel a 76yearold retired investment adviser who was arrested last month in Raleigh wearing an Uncle Sam costume and taking part in the protests that have come to be known as Moral Mondays North Carolina has long had a strong conservative strain even when its political leadership was almost entirely Democratic There have historically been libertarianleaning Republicans in the western mountains and social conservatives have been peeling away from the Democrats for years The state was the home of Senator Jesse Helms known for his smallgovernment defiance as Senator No But it was also the home of Senator John Edwards the Democratic populist who ran for president and became John Kerrys running mate For decades the states contradictory inclinations came to something of a stalemate resulting in its pragmatic political style Things began to change in 2010 President Obama drew antipathy from rural white voters and state Democrats were dogged by troubles federal investigators were looking into the campaign finances of former Gov Mike Easley while the sitting governor Bev Perdue was dropping in the polls The states economy had been rocked more than most by the recession and places like Rockingham County on the Virginia border which traditionally swung in its partisan allegiances had been growing steadily more desperate after the loss of thousands of jobs with the closing of textile and furniture mills and tobacco plants The tipping point may have come in the suburbs Conservatives and probusiness groups had been building a formidable organizational and donor structure as part of a national Republican strategy to win control of statehouses in time to shape legislative redistricting Most active in these efforts in North Carolina was Art Pope a retail magnate who founded groups that put over 17 million into the 2010 elections and whose financing of conservative candidates and policy groups was described at length in a 2011 article in The New Yorker as well as a series of articles by the Institute for Southern Studies a liberal group based in the state John Hood the president of the John Locke Foundation which Mr Pope helped found said that Democrats had enjoyed a substantial spending and organizational advantage in the past and that his effort was partly a response to a liberal party infrastructure that had been built over the previous decades Other business leaders began leaping into the fray like Allen E Gant Jr the president of Glen Raven a 133yearold textile company based in Burlington He started a group called Carolina Business Coalition which pushes for low taxes and promanagement policy We finally found some people who are willing to listen to us Mr Gant said of the new Republican leadership With all of this brought to bear in the 2010 elections a cycle deeply unfavorable for Democrats nationwide North Carolina Republicans won both houses of the legislature for the first time in a century More critically they also won control of redistricting One year later they drew districts guaranteeing safe seats for a Republican majority for years to come In 2012 with Ms Perdues late decision not to run again Mr McCrory won the governors office easily Naming Mr Pope as his budget director he promised an agenda focused on economic growth even pledging not to sign into law new restrictions on abortion But Republicans in the legislature were not interested in halfmeasures I think part of it was the frustration of being out of power for such a long time Mr Hood said Mr McCrory who was in Rockingham County on Tuesday morning to announce the coming of a gun manufacturing plant said he had spent 95 percent of my time on jobs and the economy but the media has probably spent 95 percent of the time on other issues He added that he had met most of his major economic goals But many voters those neither cheering nor protesting are frustrated Doug Clark a columnist for The News and Record of Greensboro welcomed the partisan change but he now sees the states Republican leadership as fostering extreme partisanship and abuse of power He questioned why the legislature after passing laws governing abortion guns and voter identification and frequently trying to exert control over issues traditionally left to local governments never got around to passing the governors plan to overhaul job recruiting That was his signature economic development initiative Mr Clark said Mr McCrory says that the money for the initiative is in the budget and that he can proceed without new legislation Senator Phil Berger the Republican president pro tem of the State Senate who represents this region takes issue with any suggestion that the legislature was overly aggressive or that it was not responding to voters wants Theres not in my view an issue that weve addressed that was not articulated as this is something that needs to be done changes that need to be made in North Carolina he said But voters now seem to be souring on both parties While the number of North Carolina voters over all has risen since 2008 the number who are registered as either Republicans or Democrats has shrunk Unaffiliated voters now make up more than a quarter of the voting population Honest Im not much into North Carolina said Cyril Seacat 78 who moved here decades ago to work in a Glen Ravenowned mill and was sitting in his truck outside a Walmart I dont think theyre doing much of anything right
Giving Troubled Youth a Chance to Leap and Soar,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/15/world/europe/giving-troubled-youth-a-chance-to-turn-it-around.html,LEEDS England  Trey was nervous He tapped his bare feet on the studio floor and pulled the zipper on his indigo jumpsuit up and down so fast it sang He was talking a lot He was talking too much Trey please said Helen Linsell the dance director It was noon Seven hours to go until they would be on stage and not just any stage but the prestigious Riley Theater in Leeds Of the 24 teenagers who had started rehearsals in June 18 had made it to August But the mood in the studio was edgy The day before they had almost lost four dancers including Trey A lanky 17yearold who likes to call himself the Bob Marley of the group he had turned up late rolling in at 11 am Shannon the girl with the curfew monitor on one ankle and the Mum tattoo on a foot lost her temper Parts were redistributed There were tears and insults and very nearly a fight This is no ordinary dance company The young people at Dance United have a background in trouble not ballet School dropouts and petty  and not so petty  criminals they have been as one youth worker put it sentenced to dance Referred by schools parents and more often youth services they train six hours a day for six weeks with professional contemporary coaches in a highly disciplined dance boot camp There is a 14yearold girl at risk of sexual exploitation in her housing estate a boy whose voice has barely broken but whose girlfriend just had an abortion there is Treys girlfriend Ellie they started dating the second week Tall and cheerful with ravenblack hair pulled back in a messy bun she is perhaps the most gifted dancer in the group But a few weeks ago her mother kicked her out of the house and now she is in her own words drifting In line with a statute on the protection of minor offenders none of them can be identified with their full names Trey Shannon and many others have been in and out of courtrooms But nobody talks about it here Not even the staff members know their histories They deliberately choose not to Giving them a clean slate is fundamental to our philosophy said Duncan Bedson the manager of the Leeds project We cant be prejudiced For six weeks they are dancers period Many cannot take the rigorous schedule In week three this year they lost Georgia who was so angry she punched a wall and hurt her hand so badly she had to go to the hospital They lost BillieJo who said on her first day in the studio that she was excited about being happy for once But those who stick with it get a chance to perform in a professional theater And as the experience of 36 Dance United academies in Leeds Bradford Wessex and London over the past seven years suggests they also have a good chance of going back to school or finding jobs On average 7 in 10 make it onto the stage of those 8 in 10 return to mainstream education or work and more than 3 in 4 do not commit offenses or become repeat offenders One in 10 even goes on to study dance professionally with one Dance United graduate MatthewJay Pratt now in his final year at the competitive Trinity Laban Conservatoire of Music  Dance in London It is one of the most original and successful youth engagement programs in Britain costing its private and public backers about 3000 per person but saving society an estimated 128000 in legal costs and welfare benefits according to New Philanthropy Capital a research firm that calculates returns for donors to charity On a Thursday in July about halfway through the Leeds academy the students were in the studio going over a tricky lift It was Shannons turn Big Luke danced across the diagonal and grabbed Shannons waist trying to turn her upside down and swivel her around but her legs refused to go into the spinning wheel She stumbled I cant do it man Yes you can Ms Linsell said Come on lets try again In his north London office Rob Lynden acting chief executive and creative director of Dance United spoke of the transformative power of dance We try to push push push the young people to an uncomfortable place he said We expect nothing less than what they can give Because we know when they exceed their own expectations and that of others they change Dance United started out in the 1990s working with Ethiopian street children youths in postreunification Germany and young Catholics and Protestants in Northern Ireland But in these times of economic hardship and austerity there is plenty of work to be done in England particularly in the jobstarved north where the number of those under 24 who are neither employed nor in school has reached southern European levels at nearly one in five Ask Trey what he has learned and he eagerly shows off his favorite move a long sideways jump his face and chest turned skyward and his arms wide open But he has also learned about getting up in the morning even when his mother is still asleep and how to follow a healthy diet The dancers eat cereal for breakfast and tofu Bolognese for lunch Soda is banned there is water and juice And Trey has learned about books and the power to take control of your own story The show is called Rewritten Pages It is about shedding labels and reshaping ones life Few of the teenagers had been read to as children let alone read much themselves except text messages and Facebook But they know the power of words of labels first hand When the lights went out in the Riley Theater on Aug 1 and the chatter in the audience subsided 18 young dancers took the stage Trey flew like an eagle and Shannon was suspended in midair her legs tracing a perfect halo in the spotlight above Later as the restless guitar music gave way to the sound of a heartbeat she spun around and ripped two pages out of a book discarding them calmly on the floor Then she faced the audience her gaze steady and her hazel eyes proud

The Pastâ€™s Future Republican,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/18/opinion/sunday/bruni-the-pasts-future-republican.html,LET Rand Paul have his epic filibuster and Ted Cruz his scowling threats to shut down the government Let Chris Christie thunder to a second term as the governor of New Jersey his hubris flowering as his ultimate designs on the White House take shape Jeb Bush lying low in the subtropics of Florida has something they dont the unalloyed affection of many of the Republican Partys most influential moneymen who are waiting for word on what hell do hoping that hell seek the 2016 presidential nomination and noting with amusement how far he has drifted off fickle pundits radar at least for the moment Politics today has a shorter memory than ever It also has a more furious metabolism which Bush hasnt fed much since March when he was promoting a new book on immigration and created enormous confusion about whether he does or doesnt support a pathway to citizenship for immigrants who came here illegally He later clarified that he does with caveats and even later praised immigrants for being more fertile That awkwardness gave some of his supporters pause as they wondered whether hed been too long out of the fray and was too clumsy for the splitsecond hyperscrutiny of the Twitter era He hasnt run for anything since 2002 when he was reelected as the governor of Florida an office he left in early 2007 A whole lot has changed since But with the exception of that immigration mess Bush has been a more articulate advocate of a new tone and direction for the Republican Party than have Paul Cruz Christie or others currently in the foreground of the 2016 race which has already begun on both sides of the aisle Hillary Clinton gave a big policy speech last week and has another already announced He has signaled more willingness for fiscal compromise with Democrats than Paul Ryan and Marco Rubio for example have He has rightly emphasized the importance of social mobility to Americas fortunes and has rightly sounded an alarm that such mobility is on the wane At 60 hes older than any of the five potential Republican presidential candidates Ive already mentioned or than Scott Walker dont forget him Bobby Jindal or Rick Santorum His face is less fresh thanks largely to a surname shared with the partys last two presidents But heres the first great irony oddity oxymoron or whatever you want to call it of the 2016 race if Republicans care about safeguarding their future their wisest and best bet may be to reach back into their past In a pack not exactly brimming with moderate sensitive voices Bushs stands out as less strident more reasonable and more forwardlooking than his potential rivals Lately the news medias attention has focused on Paul Cruz and especially Christie who was just on the cover of New York magazine and has drawn headlines with veiled and unveiled swipes at fellow Republicans Hes serving notice as he did with his embrace of President Obama during Hurricane Sandy that he puts less stock in party etiquette or ideological purity than in the practicalities of governing and the necessities of winning But hes also scaring some Republican power brokers and not solely or even mainly because hes iconoclastic Its because hes so very loud so very proud a ticking time bomb of selfcongratulatory bellicosity and gratuitous insult Would he really be the best nominee  In a meeting with Republicans in Boston last week he prematurely lashed out at several possible competitors including Jindal whom he no doubt had in mind when he reportedly said Im not going to be one of these people whos going to come and call our party stupid No Christies much much too tactful for that Bush has registered concern with the way the party can come across as antiscience He has also referred to it as the party of no correctly noting that Republicans right now are defined negatively by all theyre against So what is he for He talks extensively about educational opportunity grounded in school choice He has called for a patriotic energy security strategy that diminishes our reliance on foreign oil by more thoroughly tapping domestic sources of oil and natural gas Hell need a broader agenda than that a longer list of affirmatives in order to turn Republicans into the Party of Yes But hes seemingly aware of the challenge and hasnt sprinted away from the autopsy that the party performed on itself after Mitt Romneys defeat in the 2012 presidential election Bush may lack Christies verve but hes shown some of Christies nerve Last year he said that both his father and Ronald Reagan would have a difficult time fitting into the intensely partisan Republican Party of today and an orthodoxy that doesnt allow for disagreement Weve lost our way he said earlier this year  The party needs to do better with Hispanic voters and Bush isnt just bilingual but also in a sense bicultural with a Mexicanborn wife The state he governed and still lives in Florida has a large Hispanic population Swing voters looking for a Republican who supports abortion rights or gay marriage arent going to find one in him But then theyre not going to find one in Christie or Ryan either Im told by people in the know that while Bush is definitely mulling a candidacy theres only a 20 to 30 percent chance that hell press the button Many factors play into that decision his familys privacy the reality that he and Rubio his onetime political mentee cant both run the nascent political career of his son George P Bush who might be better served by a longer Bush lull AND then theres the question that every presidential contender about to submit to a brutal and brutalizing process must ask is a burning desire for the White House really present The fabled fire in the belly It certainly seems to rage inside Paul Cruz Christie Theyre infernos of untempered ambition Bush has a cooler temperature But for the partys prospects in 2016 and its image beyond then that could be good Just as Republicans cant be the Party of Stupid or the Party of No they cant be the Party of Perpetual Ire and Bush isnt great at irate Hes better positioned for 2016 than he was for 2012 when the bitter disappointments of his older brothers presidency were more keenly remembered and frequently invoked Besides if Hillary Clinton indeed rolls to the Democratic nomination Republicans neednt be so concerned about a nominee of their own with a dynastic aura Clinton versus Bush would be political royalty versus political royalty Just imagine Barbara Bushs muttered asides That alone is almost reason to wish for the matchup or cause for her secondborn son to take a pass
A Sharp Turn to the Right in North Carolina,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/19/us/19iht-letter19.html,WASHINGTON  North Carolina is channeling Alabama and South Carolina when it comes to the best economic social and political model for a Southern state For more than half a century North Carolina has been progressive on education and public investments and probusiness  witness the celebrated Research Triangle between Raleigh Durham and Chapel Hill and the financial center in Charlotte  with less racial strife than other Southern states As Republicans took full control of the state government in Raleigh there has been a shift to the right Taxes for the wealthy have been slashed and spending for education and programs that benefit the poor has been cut Abortion has been restricted and guns rights expanded At the end of the legislative session in July in a state that has enjoyed relatively good race relations  which the business community both encouraged and benefited from  provisions that ensured higher black voter participation were targeted Governor Pat McCrory a Republican elected last year says the turn to the right is necessary and is paying off Were getting tremendous positive feedback from the business community he said in an interview His state had lost its focus and needed to be shaken up  To critics this conservative agenda  much of it orchestrated by Art Pope the governors budget director and a multimillionaire retailer who is seen by some as the states equivalent of the Koch brothers  threatens the states legacy Were turning back everything that made us different from other Southern states said Jim Goodmon the chairman of CBC New Media Group and owner of the Durham Bulls Minor League baseball team With this shift economic development is broken  Ronnie Bryant the chief executive of the Charlotte Regional Partnership the areas top economic development recruiter recently complained to The Charlotte Observer that all the efforts of recent years to promote Charlotte as a business center have been negated in the last few weeks He said business leaders elsewhere were asking What the hell are you guys doing Ann Goodnight a powerful advocate for higher education in the state whose husband is the chief executive of the technology company SAS Institute wrote a letter to The Raleigh News and Observer charging that cuts in education funding were a grievous mistake The places that succeed in economic competitiveness she wrote are investing in education and using the playbook we once embraced  The biggest firestorm erupted when the Legislature changed voting procedures requiring a stateissued photo ID limiting early voting and ending sameday registration  steps that disproportionately hamper black voters in elections They are extremists and are playing the race card said the Rev William Barber head of the states chapter of the NAACP The civil rights group is organizing multiracial coalitions around the state and turning out thousands to protest these changes On taxes the Republicans cut the corporate rate ended the progressive personal income tax and eliminated the estate tax which affected on average fewer than 75 families annually and will cost the state 300 million in lost revenue over the next five years The Legislature also decided not to continue the earned incometax credit for the working poor North Carolina requires a balanced budget and new expenses must be offset elsewhere They put in place tax cuts that overwhelmingly benefit millionaires said Alexandra Sirota director of the leftist North Carolina Budget and Tax Center while choosing not to extend a tax credit for the working poor  The governor who is as moderate in demeanor as his previous record as mayor of Charlotte suggests denied that he had been captured by the right The tax cuts were essential he said because North Carolina was falling behind economic competitors like South Carolina He pointed out that spending for kindergarten through 12th grade had increased though not enough to keep up with inflation and population growth and that funding for community colleges was cut because enrollment was down Asked about support for the worldclass University of North Carolina the 56yearold governor replied They cant be satisfied with the status quo  Ms Goodnight he said is a Democrat Besides he added her husband supports him When asked about the alleged voting fraud that mandated the changes in procedure he offered no specifics Its like insider trading you dont know until you look  The governor bristled at claims that Mr Pope was the real kingmaker When he made Pope the budget director Mr Goodmon said Mr McCrory became a puppet Mr Popes political contributions the governor said are no different from Mr Goodmons giving to Democrats He depicted his budget director as a fiscal conservative a benign libertarian with no racial animosity  Mr Pope declined a request for an interview The governor said he had headed off some farright moves vetoing a bill subjecting welfare recipients to drug tests and sidelining a measure that would have created an official state religion Yet Ms Goodnight points out she is a registered Republican Mr Goodmons contributions  mainly though not exclusively to Democrats  pale next to the millions in family wealth that Mr Pope has given to the Republican Party through his political action committee foundations and personal contributions As for the competition with South Carolina the two states had roughly identical solid economic growth last year and both have jobless rates worse than the national average Multiple surveys have long rated North Carolinas business climate as one of the best in the United States Its higher education system is better than its neighbors wages are higher and poverty is less pervasive Dating from the 1960s under the leadership of Terry Sanford the countrys best oneterm governor and four terms of Jim Hunt North Carolina produced a muchenvied system of higher education and community colleges good race relations a desirable quality of life and a healthy business climate The debate about its usefulness today will persist But the North Carolina model which served the region and country so well is gone in the Tar Heel State 
Nonprofits Are Balking at Law on Disclosing Political Donors,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/nyregion/citing-safety-nonprofits-balk-at-law-on-disclosing-donors.html,In an era of enormous and often secretive political spending an ethics law championed by Gov Andrew M Cuomo was billed as a major breakthrough taxexempt groups that lobby New York State government would finally be required to reveal where they got their money But two years after the law passed a growing number of nonprofit organizations spanning the ideological spectrum are seeking exemptions arguing that their donors could be endangered if their names were released to the public The debate in Albany over which groups should be excluded from the disclosure law is quickly intensifying echoing disputes over transparency versus privacy in California Maine Minnesota and other states It comes as national political spending by nonprofit groups has increased in the wake of the Supreme Courts Citizens United decision on campaign finance In Albany where even transparency is discussed in secret the state ethics commission voted behind closed doors to grant an exemption to Naral ProChoice New York a prominent abortion rights group That lone exemption has prompted Republicans to accuse ethics regulators of favoring liberal organizations The application by Naral was followed by requests from at least four other groups  two more supporting abortion rights a group opposing abortion and samesex marriage and the New York Civil Liberties Union Some government watchdogs are hoping that the ethics commission takes a tough stance by limiting exemptions It can quickly become a slippery slope said Dick Dadey the executive director of Citizens Union a goodgovernment group Mr Dadey said exemptions should be granted only in rare circumstances like evidence of an actual threat Once you start pulling out one thread and creating an exemption he added you risk having the whole network of reporting be undermined But the groups seeking exemptions say the potential cost of disclosure is too high Andrea Miller the president of Naral ProChoice New York said Even here in New York where theres such extraordinary public support for a womans right to choose our organization has been targeted Ms Miller said the group regularly received disturbing handwritten letters and once had a menacing video posted on its Facebook page by a man who was later convicted of assisting in what he thought was a plot to bomb an abortion clinic Other groups around the nation have also sought to shield their donors from public scrutiny In recent years the National Organization for Marriage which opposes samesex marriage has sued in several states to challenge laws requiring the disclosure of donors And this spring the Federal Election Commission agreed to continue exempting the Socialist Workers Party citing the long history of threats violence and harassment against it But New York has emerged as a central battleground for efforts to mandate greater disclosure In addition to the requirement for nonprofit groups to disclose donors to lobbying efforts the state attorney general Eric T Schneiderman in June began requiring them to also reveal donations they use to pay for election spending And last year the New York City Campaign Finance Board adopted similar rules for independent expenditures in city races The new lobbying regulations in New York are notable because they apply to groups organized under Section 501c4 of the federal tax code  groups that have not been required to disclose their donors Such groups are intended to promote social welfare but they have become a political force on the federal level they reported spending of more than 256 million in the 2012 election cycle according to the Center for Responsive Politics in Washington which tracks political spending In New York they have been big players too One group the Committee to Save New York spent more than 13 million on advertising supporting Mr Cuomos agenda in 2011 and 2012 the group went dormant as soon as the state started requiring disclosure of donors Its a period of tremendous evolution right now in these laws about disclosure said Kelly Williams the corporate general counsel for the Brennan Center for Justice a research and advocacy group at the New York University School of Law Ms Williams said organizations should be exempted from disclosure when there was credible evidence their donors could face threats or harassment but not when they feared the prospect of economic harm to their donors  from a boycott for example New Yorks definition of lobbying goes beyond backroom armtwisting at the Capitol It also includes spending on television advertisements that have become a common means for outside groups to rally public support of or opposition against legislation The new measure requires groups that devote substantial resources to lobbying to disclose all of their donors who contribute more than 5000 Mr Cuomos office included in the legislation an exception for lobbying groups whose donors might face harm threats harassment or reprisals like civil rights groups A spokeswoman for Mr Cuomo a Democrat said the exemptions were legally necessary but did not undermine the law For far too long the world of taxexempt groups operating unregulated as lobbying entities has been in need of sunshine and reform the spokeswoman Melissa DeRosa said Under Governor Cuomos leadership New York is the most progressive state in the nation in that pursuit while abiding by federal case law considering safety exemptions So far about 80 groups many of them trade associations have disclosed their sources of financing The Naral exemption was approved by the state ethics commission in June Since then the exemption has attracted notice because Naral has been so politically active waging a campaign last year to help Democrats take control of the State Senate spending 425000 on lobbying this year pushing an abortion rights measure put forth by Mr Cuomo and vowing to go after incumbent Republican senators next year David A Renzi a Republican appointee to the ethics commission from Watertown said at the panels last meeting that he was concerned about the process by which the commission was considering exclusions Really what were talking about is potentially tens of millions of dollars to be exempted from review he said We should have that debate publicly After Mr Renzis complaint the commission decided to table other exemption applications while it considered whether the process should be less opaque The State Senate Republican leader Dean G Skelos of Long Island has asked the commission to withdraw Narals exemption saying the panel acted rashly The ethics commission would not name groups seeking exemptions but several have identified themselves publicly among them Family Planning Advocates of New York State which cited the 1998 murder in suburban Buffalo of an obstetrician who performed abortions and New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms which cited attacks against supporters of Proposition 8 the California ballot measure that banned samesex marriage We have no intention of releasing those donors said the Rev Jason J McGuire the executive director of New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms The New York Civil Liberties Union which said that Supreme Court precedent required the state to provide an exemption for groups whose work is deeply controversial is also worried about ramifications for donors People say nasty things about us or call us up all the time and we can take that said Arthur Eisenberg the groups legal director Its the individual donors who shouldnt need to take that and the price of their association with us and their participation in the First Amendment activity of lobbying should not be at the cost of their feeling secure and free from threats and retaliation
Newest Spy Court Pick Is a Democrat but Not a Liberal,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/21/us/roberts-varies-pattern-in-choice-for-spy-court.html,WASHINGTON  Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr who has filled a secret court that oversees surveillance almost entirely with Republicanappointed judges has named Judge Jos A Cabranes a Democratic appointee to the panel that hears rare appeals of the surveillance courts rulings Although Judge Cabranes was appointed to United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit by President Bill Clinton he is considered among the more conservativeleaning Democratic appointees on crime and security issues In 2005 some supporters  including Michael Mukasey who later became President George W Bushs attorney general  floated his name as a potential Supreme Court nominee Of the Democratic appointees he is more of a centrist than most said Daniel Richman a Columbia professor who specializes in criminal law Chief Justice Roberts appointed Judge Cabranes a member of the appeals court in New York on Aug 9 a court spokesman said although it was not announced until Monday His term expires in May 2020 His appointment was announced as some lawmakers were working to change the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act or FISA which gives chief justices unilateral power to assign federal judges to the 11member Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court and its 3member review panel to provide greater ideological balance The court hears arguments on surveillance matters from the Justice Department with no opposing lawyers to offer contrary views or file appeals Chief Justice Roberts more than his predecessors has tended to assign judges who were appointed by a Republican as he was or executive branch veterans like former prosecutors Among the 14 judges on the FISA court or its review panel two others were Democratic appointees and both are also considered to be centrists or conservativeleaning One was the favored choice of a Republican senator for a judgeship during a fight over nominations in Pennsylvania The other was a career Justice Department official in the Reagan and first Bush administrations who urged the Supreme Court to overturn the 1973 Roe v Wade abortion decision and to broaden exceptions to the Fourth Amendment warrant requirement Philip Heymann a Harvard law professor and a deputy attorney general in the Clinton administration criticized Chief Justice Roberts for not doing more to restore public trust in the FISA court process which he said was crucial if secret intelligence operations are to have credibility Mr Heymann declined to comment specifically on Judge Cabranes citing personal ties But as a broader matter he said the best choices for a court that is not trusted in general and that has an overwhelming conservative bias would be liberals who are outspoken on privacy issues The chief justice may not know it he said but his responsibility is to start to build up legitimate institutions in the area of intelligence gathering and he can be credibly accused of having gone just the opposite direction over the years Through a spokeswoman Chief Justice Roberts declined to comment Judge Cabranes who has never served in the executive branch is not a liberal counterweight to conservatives on privacy rights legal experts said In 2009 he was on a panel that dismissed a Freedom of Information Act lawsuit filed by a group of lawyers seeking to know whether they had been wiretapped under the Bush administrations warrantless surveillance program While his opinion did not say whether the program was legal he wrote that there was no evidence that the National Security Agency was keeping the information secret for the purpose of concealing activities that violate the Constitution or are otherwise illegal And in 2008 Judge Cabranes was part of a panel that allowed evidence from a warrantless wiretap and physical search of an American citizen abroad Wadih ElHage to be used in his trial related to Al Qaedas 1998 embassy bombings in Africa While the intrusion on ElHages privacy was great the need for the government to so intrude was even greater Judge Cabranes wrote Orin Kerr a law professor at George Washington University who noted the latter case on Twitter said that Judge Cabranes was generally considered a conservative among Democratic nominees and the 2008 opinion was a strong endorsement of the Bush administrations view The only Democratic appointee on the main FISA court Judge Mary McLaughlin of the Eastern District of Pennsylvania was appointed by Mr Clinton in 2000 Her candidacy was pushed by Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania then a Republican said Lisa Graves who worked on judicial nominations in the Clinton administration Senators had the power to block hearings for nominees from their states Pennsylvanias two Republican senators at the time  Mr Specter who later switched parties and Rick Santorum  cut a deal with the White House to allow nominations to go forward in return for getting to pick some Judge McLaughlin who had served as a special counsel to Mr Specter was his choice Ms Graves said She was well regarded but was obviously someone who had worked closely with a Republican senator Ms Graves said Still Eleanor Acheson who worked on judicial nominations for the Clinton White House said Judge McLaughlin was respected by practicing lawyers in Philadelphia and had already been on the administrations radar as a potential nominee On the FISA review panel Judge Cabranes is joining another Democratic appointee Judge William C Bryson of the United States Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit Before his appointment by Mr Clinton in 1994 Judge Bryson spent 16 years as a Justice Department official and worked as a deputy to the first President Bushs solicitor general Kenneth Starr along with Chief Justice Roberts Judge Bryson had been a clerk for Justice Thurgood Marshall a liberal in 197475 Judge Bryson won respect in the Clinton administration Ms Acheson said and his nomination was completely defined by the merits Still he thrived in the ReaganBush Justice Department for whom he signed a Supreme Court brief calling for Roe v Wade to be overturned Judge Bryson also signed a brief arguing for a broad interpretation of subpoenas seeking business records that might be relevant to an

Catholic Push to Overhaul Immigration Goes to Pews,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/us/politics/catholic-leaders-to-take-immigration-push-to-the-pews.html,WASHINGTON  Catholic bishops and priests from major dioceses across the country will preach a coordinated message next month backing changes in immigration policy with some using Sunday Masses on Sept 8 to urge Congressional passage of a legislative overhaul that includes a path to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants The decision to embrace political action from the pulpit is part of a broader effort by the Roman Catholic Church and other faith groups that support President Obamas call for new immigration laws It includes advertising and phone calls directed at 60 Catholic Republican lawmakers and prayerful marches in Congressional districts where the issue has become a divisive topic We want to try to pull out all the stops said Kevin Appleby the director of migration policy at the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops who said the immigration issue was at a nowornever moment They have to hear the message that we want this done and if youre not successful during the summer youre not going to win by the end of the year Catholic leaders who have tried to wield their clout against Mr Obama on issues like abortion birth control and samesex marriage are betting that their congregations will be able to exert pressure on reluctant Republicans and wavering Democrats to support the president on immigration They say they are motivated by the Bibles teachings and by the reality that many Latino immigrants are Catholics and represent a critical demographic for the church The political campaign by Catholic priests is certain to catch the attention of Catholic members of Congress Catholics are the largest single religious group in Congress making up just over 30 percent of the members according to the Pew Research Centers Religion and Public Life Project The current House has 136 Catholic members including Speaker John A Boehner and 60 other Republicans according to Pew For some Republican members vocal support by local priests and bishops could provide the religious rationale they need to support an overhaul in the face of criticism from conservatives The connection between a pastor and their congregation is really like nothing else in society said Ali Noorani the executive director of the National Immigration Forum White House officials said they were counting on Catholics and members of other religious groups to help pass an immigration overhaul through a Republicancontrolled House that is filled with members fighting against one Cecilia Muoz the director of the White House Domestic Policy Council said Catholic leaders had participated in outreach meetings at the White House Its pretty rare for the Catholics to take on an issue like this straight to the pews said Ms Muoz who is leading Mr Obamas immigration effort She said Catholics had long been advocates for an immigration overhaul but were now more organized This is actually a much more acrossthechurch effort and it shows Last year Catholic activism pushed Mr Obama to compromise on a plan to require religious employers to provide contraception health coverage The Catholic Church often plays an outsize role in the political debate over abortion and marriage But it remains unclear how much the Catholic campaign on immigration can change the minds of lawmakers who view the presidents proposals as amnesty for lawbreakers Representative Steve King a Catholic Republican from Iowa and a leading opponent of the immigration overhaul said the campaign may help persuade some colleagues who are already under political pressure to pass an immigration bill If the church puts out a unified message there will be some Catholic legislators who will want to accept that guidance because they want to get there anyway Mr King said It gives them cover Representative Daniel Lipinski a Catholic Democrat from Illinois said he had listened to the bishops and priests from his district But he said he viewed their opinions on immigration as less binding than the churchs positions on social issues There are some issues that the church speaks authoritatively on such as abortion in protecting life said Mr Lipinski who remains skeptical about promises of increased border security And then there are prudential judgments that are made informed by Catholic theology but its not something that Catholics are required to follow The effort by Catholics started last Thursday  the day of the Feast of the Assumption of Mary  and it will continue through midOctober when House members are expected to vote on immigration legislation Already nearly a dozen major dioceses and archdioceses including Chicago Cincinnati Los Angeles Brooklyn and San Antonio have committed to holding Masses and events on or around Sept 8 and the Archdiocese of New York is considering how it might participate as well Not all priests plan to deliver homilies But the church is calling on bishops across the country to meet with phone or write their members of Congress in support of an overhaul Though the Senate passed an immigration overhaul in June the legislation has stalled in the House where some conservative members have denounced any broad bill as amnesty and others prefer a piecemeal approach Weve seen on other issues where the Catholic Church leans into an issue like health care or abortion people listen said Angela Kelley the vice president of immigration policy at the Center for American Progress The same could be said for immigration reform Many religious organizations have played a substantial role in helping to rally support for an immigration overhaul On Tuesday the Evangelical Immigration Table started a more than 400000 radio ad campaign on Christian and talk radio which will be heard in 56 Congressional districts across 14 states But the Catholic Church in particular is throwing its full might behind an immigration overhaul If a representative gets contacted by their bishop and the representative is Catholic they listen and they strongly take into consideration the views of the church Mr Appleby said One major pilgrimage is already under way in California Marchers have departed from Sacramento and San Ysidro on the border with Mexico with plans to convene for a rally on Sept 2 in Bakersfield where organizers expect thousands to descend on the district of Representative Kevin McCarthy the No 3 House Republican Weve identified him as the linchpin said the Rev Jon Pedigo of Our Lady of Guadalupe Parish in San Jose who is the director of the Catholic bishops Justice for Immigrants campaign Another pilgrimage in September is to pass through the Virginia districts of two Republican congressmen Eric Cantor the majority leader and Robert W Goodlatte the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee At a town hallstyle meeting in Virginia on Monday Mr Goodlatte rejected what he called a special pathway to citizenship for unauthorized immigrants already in the country Representative David Valadao a Catholic Republican from central California said he supported an immigration overhaul and citizenship for some illegal immigrants a sizable number of whom live in his largely agricultural district It would be good to have the conversation and help them understand that this is important for a lot of different reasons Mr Valadao said Having your priests talk about it in front of your constituents is always beneficial

Inditex the holding company that owns Zara and seven other apparel concerns Spanish newspapers said she had a stroke on the Mediterranean island of Minorca on Aug 14 and was flown to a hospital in La Corua in northwestern Spain where she lived Forbes magazine this year ranked Ms Mera as the richest woman in Spain and the 66th richest woman in the world She ranked first among women who had acquired their wealth through their own efforts rather than inheritance or marriage Her former husband Amancio Ortega with whom she started the company as an equal partner in 1974 is listed by Forbes as the worlds third richest man with assets of 57 billion Ms Meras wealth came from owning approximately 7 percent of Inditex stock worth 61 billion Zara changed the apparel industry chiefly by speeding up its massmarket response to new designs coming from the leading fashion houses in Paris Milan New York and other cities Zara could come up with its own variations on those designs and have them in stores within two weeks previously six months was the industry average It accomplished this through what is known as vertical integration Zara designs produces distributes and sells its own lines in its own retail stores  1763 in 86 countries including the United States It uses no subcontractors or intermediaries and relies little on advertising Devotees of the Zara label include the Duchess of Cambridge the former Kate Middleton Zara takes an extra step in getting daily feedback from its many stores The company can incorporate customer desires by modifying a design and shipping the new product out within days The company says it takes care not to violate copyright laws in following designer trends In 1985 Zara and its fast fashion model came under the corporate umbrella of Industria de Diseno Textil or Inditex SA a conglomerate whose eight brand names each with its own chain of stores aim at specific markets Massimo Dutti for example targets urban cosmopolites while Bershka is youthoriented In 2001 when Inditex shares were first sold to the public Daniel Piette fashion director for Louis Vuitton SA called it possibly the most innovative and devastating retailer in the world Rosala Mera Goyenechea was born on Jan 28 1944 in a workingclass neighborhood of La Corua a port city in Galicia a center of Spains textile industry Her father worked for a utility company and her mother for a butcher shop Ms Mera skipped secondary school and in 1963 met Mr Ortega the son of a railroad worker and a maid who had left school at 13 to work as a delivery boy for a shirt maker When they met he was working at one clothing shop in La Corua and she at another They married in 1966 In their living room they began making quilted bathrobes and lingerie that Ms Mera had designed The London newspaper The Independent said in its obituary of Ms Mera that her lingerie designs were a bit shocking at the time but immediately popular The newspaper suggested that this new liberalism in undergarments reflected a slight breeze of change in the final years of the dictatorship of Francisco Franco The couple soon expanded the business setting up manufacturing operations employing hundreds and later opening their own store At first they wanted to call the store Zorba after watching the 1964 film Zorba the Greek But after discovering that there was a bar named Zorba two blocks away and since they had already made the molds for the letters spelling Zorba for a storefront sign they simply rearranged them to see what they could find They settled on Zara The business eventually expanded to other Spanish cities then to Portugal then around the world The couple separated in 1986 and divorced in the 1990s Ms Mera stopped working at Zara after the separation but remained on the board until 2004 She devoted more time to charity work much of it through a foundation that she and her husband had set up to help disabled people Ms Mera made 600 million from Inditexs public stock offering in 2001 and diversified her investments buying stakes in a fishfarming group a company that looks for cancer treatments in ocean products and the maker of a fingerprinting system for newborns She was a major investor in the Bulgari Hotel in London For years Ms Mera could be seen in La Corua at the movies or pubs She was also politically active speaking out against tightening Spains

Shadowy Inauguration for Sunshine Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/22/opinion/shadowy-inauguration-for-sunshine-law.html,The New York state ethics commission voted behind closed doors last June to exempt a leading abortionrights group Naral ProChoice New York from a new ethics law requiring taxexempt organizations to disclose their major donors as they lobby in public forums The action is causing understandable controversy and cries of liberal bias It should be reconsidered  out in the open and in the spirit of the laws goal to shed more sunshine not less on the entwined workings of government and political lobbying  Predictably groups from across the political spectrum are now seeking the same accommodation under the laws exemption for organizations whose donors of more than 5000 might be endangered if their names were made public Naral is hardly alone as a busy player in what is a booming jostling world of political lobbying by nonprofit organizations from right to left claiming social welfare exemption under the federal tax code  The Cuomo administrations twoyearold disclosure law  so far observed by about 80 organizations  allows exemptions for groups whose donors might face harm threats harassment or reprisals But its principal goal is to shed badly needed sunlight on a shadowy crossroads of state lobbying and politicking  Drawing the line between the heated inyourface conflict of modern political debate and real threats of danger is no easy matter particularly in abortionrights endeavors where there is a history of violence including the murder of a doctor 15 years ago in suburban Buffalo A conservative pressure group New Yorkers for Constitutional Freedoms which is opposed to samesex marriage said it was seeking an exemption by citing attacks on similarly minded supporters in California  These fears may indeed be real But the ethics commission should hardly be expected to play the protective role of a police agency nor should it end up granting blanket exemptions for groups mainly worried about protecting donors wish for privacy The commission has a responsibility to the public under the law to show that exemptions will be rare and backed by undeniable evidence of actual threats Otherwise bigmoney partisan lobbying via hidden backers will only proliferate as the public heads deeper into the dark and the ethics law itself will begin to unravel thread by thread  In the face of a members complaint the commission has been postponing consideration of other lobbying groups applications for exemptions It is reported to be considering whether its procedures can be made less opaque  surely an absolute requirement if a good law is not to be riddled from the outset with loopholes 
A Conservative Catholic Now Backs Same-Sex Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/24/us/a-conservative-catholic-now-backs-same-sex-marriage.html,HOT SPRINGS SD  In the past couple of years conservative opposition to samesex marriage has clearly started to erode Prominent Republicans like Senators Rob Portman and Lisa Murkowski and former Secretary of State Colin L Powell have come out in support of gay marriage Even David Blankenhorn the expert witness in the Proposition 8 trial in California and a Democrat announced that he had changed his mind They are for the most part moderate conservatives using secular democratic arguments None come from the Christian right Among religious conservatives opposition to samesex marriage has remained essentially unquestioned Which is why The Things We Share A Catholics Case for SameSex Marriage an essay by Joseph Bottum published Friday on the Web site of Commonweal magazine is something new in this debate Mr Bottum 54 is a serious Christian He attended Roman Catholic high school college and graduate school His erudite writing for conservative magazines like National Review and The Weekly Standard is laced with references to church history and theology and to Christian writers like G K Chesterton and W H Auden He fiercely opposes abortion and for five years until 2010 he was editor in chief of First Things a key opinion journal for religious conservatives In his large Victorian house here 50 miles from Mount Rushmore a crucifix hangs in the hallway At lunch he crossed himself before we sat down Mr Bottum is the kind of man who when he casually says Thomas you know that he means Aquinas the 13thcentury Catholic philosopher Not five years ago he condemned backers of gay marriage as amoral Yet in his new long and challenging essay Mr Bottum argues in effect that he was wrong and that fellow conservative Catholics are misinterpreting their tradition in particular Aquinass natural law theology Aquinas considered heterosexual monogamous union the highest form of marriage but Mr Bottum believes that he was actually less interested in strict legal precepts than in an enchanted vision of the world  a vision that Mr Bottum now says is better served by supporting samesex marriage But before we got deep into theology Mr Bottum told me about his family As we sat on his front porch in sight of the track at the town high school the Marlborosmoking fair and floppyhaired Mr Bottum reminded me that his greatuncle lost his Senate seat to George McGovern Mr Bottums grandfather the senators brother might have won office had he not converted to Catholicism We had another name for conversion Mr Bottum said when I visited him on Wednesday We called it marrying an Irish girlÂ   Mr Bottums parents werent very religious he said but he always had a metaphysical side I never didnt believe in God His passion for Catholicism was heightened when as a student at Georgetown he encountered the poetry of Robert Lowell a Catholic convert I really got Lowell and read him to pieces said Mr Bottum whose friends call him Jody He attends Mass weekly and objects to the death penalty as well as abortion which leaves him frustrated with both political parties On balance the Republicans are usually more educable on the death penalty than Democrats are on abortion He took his family from Manhattan back to South Dakota three years ago after he was fired by First Things for reasons he will not discuss If Mr Bottum had testy relations with his coworkers at First Things many of them Catholic conservatives there was little sign that he would break with them on samesex marriage And a disagreement over Aquinas seemed even more unlikely Religious Catholics are generally united in their reverence for St Thomas Aquinas whose theology dominates Catholic thought The traditionalmarriage movement is led by men like Brian S Brown the president of the National Organization for Marriage and Prof Robert P George of Princeton Catholics who rely on Aquinass reasoning to make the contemporary case for traditional marriage So Mr Bottums change of heart is noteworthy He makes several arguments The first is pragmatic Basic democratic premises like fairness equal rights and majority rule suggest that the time for samesex marriage has come he says We can agree Mr Bottum argues that Americans are turning in favor of samesex marriage and there is no coherent jurisprudential against it  no principled legal view that can resist it Furthermore the bishops campaigns against samesex marriage are hurting the church Especially for the young Catholicism is coming to symbolize repression So this fight would only be worth fighting for Catholics if their theology required such a fight Mr Bottum now believes  heres where the essay will really outrage fellow churchmen  that Catholics are mistaken to think that natural law requires them to oppose samesex marriage Natural law as systematically explained by Aquinas in his treatise Summa Theologica is the will of God as understood by people using their reason Aquinas extrapolates many principles of natural law including those of marriage But Mr Bottum contends that these rules are not the point Natural law Mr Bottum writes depends for its force on a sense of the mystery of creation the enchantment of everyday objects the sacredness of sex In the West that climate of belief has been upended by science modernism a Protestant turn away from mysticism and most recently the sexual revolution The strictures of natural law were meant to structure an enchanted world  but if the enchantment is gone the law becomes a pointless artifact of a defunct Christian culture And if Mr Bottum writes heterosexual monogamy so lacks the old enchanted metaphysical foundation that it can end in quick and painless divorce then what principle allows a refusal of marriage to gays on the grounds of a metaphysical notion like the difference between men and women Traditionalmarriage activists would counter that we can at least begin a Christian renaissance by upholding marriages last connections to its Christian past But Mr Bottum says thats the wrong starting point There are much better ways than opposing samesex marriage for teaching the essential Godhauntedness the enchantment of the world he writes Better tactics might include massive investments in charity the further evangelizing of Asia a willingness to face martyrdom by preaching in countries where Christians are killed and a churchwide effort to beautify the liturgy Ive given up on politics Mr Bottum said as we sat on his wide porch after lunch Ill vote Republican because Im a Republican But I dont believe a change in culture can come from politics It can only come from reenchantment with the world
"Court Is â€˜One of Most Activist,â€™ Ginsburg Says, Vowing to Stay",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/25/us/court-is-one-of-most-activist-ginsburg-says-vowing-to-stay.html,WASHINGTON  Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg 80 vowed in an interview to stay on the Supreme Court as long as her health and intellect remained strong saying she was fully engaged in her work as the leader of the liberal opposition on what she called one of the most activist courts in history  In wideranging remarks in her chambers on Friday that touched on affirmative action abortion and samesex marriage Justice Ginsburg said she had made a mistake in joining a 2009 opinion that laid the groundwork for the courts decision in June effectively striking down the heart of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 The recent decision she said was stunning in terms of activism Unless they have a book to sell Supreme Court justices rarely give interviews Justice Ginsburg has given several this summer perhaps in reaction to calls from some liberals that she step down in time for President Obama to name her successor On Friday she said repeatedly that the identity of the president who would appoint her replacement did not figure in her retirement planning There will be a president after this one and Im hopeful that that president will be a fine president she said Were Mr Obama to name Justice Ginsburgs successor it would presumably be a oneforone liberal swap that would not alter the courts ideological balance But if a Republican president is elected in 2016 and gets to name her successor the court would be fundamentally reshaped Justice Ginsburg has survived two bouts with cancer but her health is now good she said and her work ethic exceptional There is no question on the bench or in chambers that she has full command of the complex legal issues that reach the court  Her age has required only minor adjustments I dont waterski anymore Justice Ginsburg said I havent gone horseback riding in four years I havent ruled that out entirely But waterskiing those days are over Justice Ginsburg who was appointed by President Bill Clinton in 1993 said she intended to stay on the court as long as I can do the job full steam and that at my age is not predictable I love my job she added I thought last year I did as well as in past terms With the departure of Justice John Paul Stevens in 2010 Justice Ginsburg became the leader of the courts fourmember liberal wing a role she seems to enjoy I am now the most senior justice when we divide 54 with the usual suspects she said The last two terms which brought major decisions on Mr Obamas health care law race and samesex marriage were she said heady exhausting challenging  She was especially critical of the voting rights decision as well as the part of the ruling upholding the health care law that nonetheless said it could not be justified under Congresss power to regulate interstate commerce In general Justice Ginsburg said if its measured in terms of readiness to overturn legislation this is one of the most activist courts in history  The next term which begins on Oct 7 is also likely to produce major decisions she said pointing at piles of briefs in cases concerning campaign contribution limits and affirmative action  There is a framed copy of the Lilly Ledbetter Fair Pay Act of 2009 on a wall in her chambers It is not a judicial decision of course but Justice Ginsburg counts it as one of her proudest achievements The law was a reaction to her dissent in Ledbetter v Goodyear Tire and Rubber Company the 2007 ruling that said Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 imposed strict time limits for bringing workplace discrimination suits She called on Congress to overturn the decision and it did  Id like to think that that will happen in the two Title VII cases from this term but this Congress doesnt seem to be able to move on anything she said In so many instances the court and Congress have been having conversations with each other particularly recently in the civil rights area she said So it isnt good when you have a Congress that cant react The recent voting rights decision Shelby County v Holder also invited Congress to enact new legislation But Justice Ginsburg who dissented did not sound optimistic The Voting Rights Act passed by overwhelming majorities she said of its reauthorization in 2006 but this Congress I dont think is equipped to do anything about it Asked if she was disappointed by the almost immediate tightening of voting laws in Texas and North Carolina after the decision she chose a different word Disillusioned  The flaw in the courts decision she said was to conclude from the nations progress in protecting minority voters that the law was no longer needed She repeated a line from her dissent It is like throwing away your umbrella in a rainstorm because you are not getting wet Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr wrote the majority opinion and he quoted extensively from a 2009 decision that had temporarily as it turned out let the heart of the Voting Rights Act survive Eight members of the court including Justice Ginsburg had signed the earlier decision On Friday she said she did not regret her earlier vote as the result in the 2009 case was correct But she said she should have distanced herself from the majority opinions language If you think its going to do real damage you dont sign on to it she said I was mistaken in that case Some commentators have said that the two voting rights decisions are an example of the long game Chief Justice Roberts seems to be playing in several areas of the law including campaign finance and affirmative action Justice Ginsburgs lone dissent in Junes affirmative action case leaving in place the University of Texas admissions plan but requiring lower courts to judge it against a more demanding standard may suggest that she is alert to the chief justices apparent strategy Justice Ginsburg is by her own description this little tiny little woman and she speaks in a murmur inflected with a Brooklyn accent But she is a formidable force on the bench often asking the first question at oral arguments in a way that frames the discussion that follows She has always been a night person she said but she has worked even later into the small hours since her husband Martin D Ginsburg a tax lawyer chef and wit died in 2010 Since then she said there is no one to call her to bed and turn out the lights  She works out twice a week with a trainer and said her doctors at the National Institutes of Health say she is in fine health Ever since my colorectal cancer in 1999 I have been followed by the NIH she said That was very lucky for me because they detected my pancreatic cancer at a very early stage in 2009 Less than three weeks after surgery for that second form of cancer Justice Ginsburg was back on the bench  After the pancreatic cancer at first I went to NIH every three months then every four months then every six months she said The last time I was there they said come back in a year Justice Ginsburg said her retirement calculations would center on her health and not on who would appoint her successor even if that new justice could tilt the balance of the court and overturn some of the landmark womens rights decisions that are a large part of her legacy I dont see that my majority opinions are going to be undone she said I do hope that some of my dissents will one day be the law She said that as a general matter the court would be wise to move incrementally and methodically It had moved too fast she said in Roe v Wade the 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion The court could have struck down only the extremely restrictive Texas law before it I think its inescapable that the court gave the antiabortion forces a single target to aim at she said The unelected judges decided this question for the country and never mind that the issue was in flux in the state legislatures The question of samesex marriage is also in flux around the nation In June the court declined to say whether there was a constitutional right to samesex marriage allowing the issue to percolate further But Justice Ginsburg rejected the analogy to the lesson she had taken from the aftermath of the Roe decision I wouldnt make a connection she said The fireworks at the end of the last term included three dissents announced from the bench by Justice Ginsburg Such oral dissents are rare and are reserved for major disagreements One was a sharp attack on Justice Samuel A Alito Jrs majority opinion in a job discrimination case and he made his displeasure known rolling his eyes and making a face Justice Ginsburg said she took it in stride It was kind of a replay of the State of the Union when he didnt agree with what the president was saying in 2010 about the Citizens United decision It was his natural reaction but probably if he could do it again he would have squelched it
A Calculated Push Into Entertainment Lifts â€˜Duck Dynastyâ€™ Familyâ€™s Fortunes,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/business/media/duck-dynasty-familys-fortunes-lifted-by-calculated-push-into-reality-tv.html,Forget the ZZ Top beards and the Bayou accents the Robertsons of West Monroe La are a family of traditional American entrepreneurs ambitious rich and spectacularly successful And that was true even before they were television stars They certainly are stars now  the subjects of the biggest reality show hit in the history of cable television Duck Dynasty which has shattered ratings records this summer reaching a high of 118 million viewers for the season premiere this month  But in the more contained world of ducks guns and camouflage gear the Robertsons were already celebrities thanks to the familys core business sales of duck gear especially duck calls  Now the range of merchandise attached to the Robertson name is so vast  shirts caps coolers books edibles hunting gear of every kind  that keeping track of it has become almost impossible said Willie Robertson scion of the Robertson clan and president of the Duck Commander company Last week he was at the corporate headquarters of Walmart and was surprised to see his face on a garden gnome I knew I had a Chia Pet and a bobblehead and an action figure Mr Robertson said by phone I didnt know I had a garden gnome Thats awesome I guess Pez dispenser is the last weird thing I have to see myself on Chances are that pitch will come shortly Every day I get pitched on this pitched on that Mr Robertson said Its like youre living in a movie That movie is mostly a creation of Mr Robertson and his family a conscious dive into the entertainment world that has lifted a regional business into an international phenomenon The show is seen in more than 100 countries drawing strong ratings on networks from England to Latin America The show does well across this country though as might be expected it fares best in the South with Atlanta Knoxville Tenn Charlotte NC and Birmingham Ala among the top locations in ratings I thought we were booming before Mr Robertson said Booming is a relative term The familyowned business has private sales figures but Mr Robertson offered some indications of the level of growth Ive seen figures of 2200 percent growth he said  You couldnt chart it as far as where we have had business growth Its bursting at every level every store Sales of duck calls to actual hunters are now a minority he said with the dominant buyers being people who put it on their desk and toot on it  Sarah McKinney a spokeswoman for Walmart said the companys stores across the country stocked Duck Dynasty merchandise in six separate departments  Tshirts featuring Duck Dynasty characters are now the top sellers Ms McKinney said among women and girls as well as men And sales of Duck backtoschool material have soared this year she said Duck Dynasty began on the AE network after some members of the family appeared for three seasons on an Outdoor Channel show tailored more specifically to actual duck hunting David McKillop the general manager of AE said the network viewed a tape and realized the potential for his channel was in the family interaction After what he called a vision meeting with Mr Robertson AE commissioned two pilots The second ended with a scene of the family gathered around the dinner table That clicked AE saw an overarching theme A cross between The Beverly Hillbillies and The WaltonsÂ  A family dinner would cap each episode Mr McKillop said It would be like Goodnight JohnBoyÂ   Willie Robertson is not reticent about his own role in building what is now an imposing duckcentric empire The family business was started by his father Phil a Louisiana football standout who translated an obsession with hunting ducks into the now enormous duckcall business Willie Robertson credits some of his business acumen to experience he gained in his 20s after he left the family company to run a childrens camp business  I was able to watch the family business from afar he said I was able to come in with a lot of energy and a vision for growing it even bigger When Mr Robertson returned to Duck Commander he realized his father had created a strong brand but he had pretty much run out of ideas Mr Robertson said  He didnt know how to take it to the next level and it might have started a downward slide like a lot of family businesses do Mr Robertson had a personal interest in entertainment especially comedy He was a fan of Saturday Night Live He watched American Idol to determine what it was that attracted huge audiences He saw the large Robertson brood as a family of characters The first show on the Outdoor Channel called Duck Commander was focused heavily on hunting but Willie Robertson steered it toward purer entertainment  I heard you should edit for women and children he said The concept for the new show would center on family and funny he said Im sure if you just saw headshots of us you wouldnt deduct that was going to come out of that But he had to overcome one area of opposition Phil Robertson the patriarch did not want to do the show He said Im already as famous as I want to be I explained to him Phil this can expand your platform to talk about the things you like to talk aboutÂ  Those things for the most part are faithbased Phil Robertson is increasingly dedicated to preaching something he has mentioned he would prefer to be doing with most of his time Last week a YouTube video posted in 2010 went viral showing him denouncing abortion rights during a guest speaking appearance Were believers in the Lord Willie Robertson said We think he set this all up for us But AE is not looking for a religious show The show is not about their beliefs Mr McKillop said with emphasis Mr Robertson generally agrees He says he has had to remind his father that he is not Pat Robertson  and this is not the 700 Club Its a comedy show Mr Robertson added If you find something attractive about our family how we stay together and eat dinner together and laugh and have fun you may want to keep some of these principles in mind Were Christians thats part of the package But if that doesnt turn you on fine If you just want to laugh at it thats OK Given the potent appeal of Duck Dynasty the prospect for many more seasons  and merchandise sales  seems promising Adam Hanft a brand strategist suggested the Robertsons have some important decisions to make Do they want to be a trend or a longterm brand  The latter requires strategic thinking he said Youve got to learn to say no when everyone wants more of you AE certainly wants more Duck Dynasty  fast The network has managed to churn out four seasons of the show in just 18 months Mr McKillop said Were in a great place with them for multiple more seasons Mr Robertson said At first the money was a big factor We all love making money But at some point I dont know how much you need The cool part is that

Challengers to South Carolina Senator Are Lining Up on the Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/us/politics/challengers-to-south-carolina-senator-are-lining-up-on-the-right.html,LAKE WYLIE SC  Some of the early shots in the Republican primary battle against Senator Lindsey Graham have been fired from this tiny community on the northern border of the state where the Civil War began A small group called Carolina Conservatives United one of dozens organized loosely under the flag of limited government low taxes and strict adherence to the Constitution sent out images last week of a milk carton bearing Mr Grahams face and asked Gov Nikki R Haley to issue the states version of an Amber Alert to find its missing senator Lindsey Graham has not been seen in the state of South Carolina for most of the last two years said Bruce Carroll the chairman of the group Conservatives in South Carolina are eager to oust Mr Graham who has enraged the far right for among other things reaching across the aisle on immigration and supporting President Obamas nominations for the Supreme Court Tea Party supporters called him a community organizer for the Muslim Brotherhood when instead of heading home for the Congressional break this month he went to Egypt at the request of the president But to stand a chance against the politician who succeeded Strom Thurmond in 2003 conservatives will have to win a civil war of their own At least 40 groups align themselves along Tea Party and Libertarian lines and trying to unify them to topple the states senior senator will be no easy task So far three people have stepped forward to challenge Mr Graham in the June primary State Senator Lee Bright Richard Cash a former Congressional candidate and Nancy Mace the first woman to graduate from the Citadel and at the moment the challenger whose political star is rising the fastest Ms Mace the owner of a public relations firm in Charleston prides herself on her social media skills She has never run for office but her story is familiar to many here For a time she became the face of gender integration when she graduated from the Citadel in 1999 an experience she followed with a 2001 book In the Company of Men A Woman at the Citadel Toughing it out at the formerly allmale military college makes her a perfect candidate for voters seeking a true conservative she said I feel like they are looking for someone who is very strong and who wont waver she said in an interview last week But Ms Mace is also the biggest target so far in part because of her connection to a political gossip Web site called FitsNews which she helped create in her role as a Web designer and media manager Will Folks once a press secretary for Representative Mark Sanford and a former political consultant for Governor Haley runs the site which consistently attacks the governor In 2010 Mr Folks claimed to have had an inappropriate physical relationship with Ms Haley two weeks before the election in her highly competitive bid for governor The claims were never proved and Ms Haley who is heading into a campaign for her second term next year has long said it was just another example of underhanded South Carolina politics Suggestions of a connection to the Web site can quickly throw Ms Mace off message My opponents political operatives have started smearing me she said Im talking about all of them It says more about my opponents than it does about me The smears she said began in Mr Grahams camp two months before she announced her candidacy The others have joined in One is Mr Bright who endorsed Ron Paul in the states presidential primary and has used the Web site connection to attack Ms Mace He has also been at odds with Ms Haley over ethics changes and strategies to keep Mr Obamas health care law from being implemented in the state Mr Bright tends to support extremely conservative legislation and introduced a bill in 2011 to have the state create its own currency if the Federal Reserve system collapsed Ms Haley said she was not jumping into the battle over who should replace Mr Graham Speaking this month at the annual Red State gathering organized by Erick Erickson the founder of the conservative blog RedStatecom the governor said I controlled Tim Scott Well see what you do with the other one She was referring to former Representative Tim Scott a Tea Party favorite she appointed this year to the Senate seat vacated by Jim DeMint who left to head the Heritage Foundation The Senate Conservatives Fund which Mr DeMint founded in 2008 took on Mr Graham last week for suggesting that a government shutdown as a way to fight the Obama administrations Affordable Health Care act would be a bridge too far Mr Cash a businessman and a social conservative from Piedmont in the voterich upstate region is considered a sleeper in the race said David Woodard a longtime South Carolina political consultant who ran Mr Grahams Congressional campaign in 1994 and wrote the 2006 book The New Southern Politics You got to look at their money and the guy with the most money is Richard Cash Mr Woodard said According to recent campaign finance records Mr Cash had about 250000 including at least 200000 of his own money Ms Mace said she raised more than 100000 in her first two weeks Mr Bright has not filed any campaign finance papers Mr Graham has 63 million Although he declined to comment on his opponents his campaign staff pointed out that tough opposition in a primary is nothing out of the ordinary in South Carolina Lindsey Graham is a strong fiscal social and national security conservative with the record to back it up said Tate Zeigler a campaign spokesman But Mr Cash is staking out a position as the most antiabortion Christian constitutionalist in the race He is certainly the most seasoned campaigner among the challengers even though his first race was not until 2010 when he was one of six Republicans trying to capture an open Congressional seat Although he was not well known he ran a disciplined campaign that moved him into a runoff against Representative Jeff Duncan Mr Woodard said In meetings with Tea Party groups Mr Cash repeats a carefully honed slogan about his candidacy which he says is built on three Cs capitalism Christianity and the Constitution The states traditional Republican leaders and political consultants say that it will take a deeply unified effort to mount a successful campaign against Mr Graham but that in South Carolina an unpredictable state with one of the countrys largest number of prominent Tea Party politicians it is not unthinkable The key is for one candidate to find a way to harness that power Anybody who wants to look at all those groups with a broad stroke should think again said Matt Moore the chairman of the states Republican Party This summer dozens of conservative groups talked about finding the states Ted Cruz  a reference to the Texas senator whose longshot grassroots victory in 2012 is considered a model among Tea Party supporters It remains to be seen whom that should be said Paul Anderko the president of the GPS Conservatives for Action PAC We know its not going to be an easy fight and people are just listening and waiting to find the right candidate Mr Anderko said But South Carolina is a funny state Sometimes incumbents do go down in flames
Reader Idea | Thinking Like a Historian About Current World Events,https://learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/08/26/reader-idea-thinking-like-a-historian-about-current-world-events/,"
                                        Students in Ms Arjunans class chose stories about Malala Yousafzais activism to research for a history project  All week this week well be featuring great ideas from readers and this one comes from a world history teacher in Philadelphia  If youve used The Times for teaching and learning and would like to see your idea in our blog write in and tell us what
                                        youve done Teacher Aruna M Arjunan Institution Central High School Grade Level of Students High School Idea As a world history teacher one can often feel like the school year is a marathon that leaves little room for covering current events in the manner in which they should be studied This research project                                        PDF asks students to not only examine a current event in detail but also to develop critical thinking skills by analyzing contemporary events using the lens of a historian  Why We Chose It World current events as seen through The Times and other sources are centerstage in this rigorous and detailed unit which raises the provocative question what will become history
                                        and what will be forgotten As Ms Arjunan says the project helps students think critically like historians and not just consumers of history  What Ms Arjunan Did and Why in Her Own Words Initial Inquiry To start I have students examine the world history textbook that is issued by our school district and notice trends or patterns of what is included in history and what is not
                                     We use the Analysis of our History handout PDF to calculate and analyze some statistics regarding what is covered
                                        in history textbooks and just as importantly what is not Then we draw some conclusions through a class discussion on what makes history Next students peruse The New York Times and International Herald Tribune to gain a basic understanding of what is going on in the world currently
                                     Because the course in which this project is embedded is world history the current event my students choose to ultimately analyze must occur outside the United States As such I initially direct them to the world
                                        news subheading Once there I simply asked them to write down headlines After this they read at least two articles that will become part of a larger discussion of current issues  This is usually one of the first instances in which Ive truly discussed current events in my classroom It is a much needed discussion and students usually have a lot of questions about cultures and parts of
                                        the world we have yet to cover After making some basic initial observations about whats in the news and making a list as a class of current events students complete the Initial Proposal handout                                        PDF for homework  Initial Proposal  The goal of this is to ensure that my students are choosing a current event that meets two main criteria  Students choose three possible current events they may want to focus on and complete the Initial Proposal handout PDF
                                        I made it due many days after our initial discussions on current events to give them time to examine contemporary issues independently at home and decide for themselves what three topics they might want to explore
                                        Students struggling to find topics might be pointed towards the Learning Networks Weekly News Quiz as a source of inspiration
                                     This year the most popular were Malala Yousafzais activism Beijings air pollution
                                        and Irelands abortion law news  After they suggest three I comment on their choices and rank them with a one two or three One is the choice I think is the best for that student to pursue two is the topic that might work if they cannot choose
                                        one three indicates the topic I suggest they should not pursue When I rank topics I keep the following criteria in mind  Final Proposal  Students are asked to pick a topic from their choices that I ranked one or two only Soon after I return to them their initial proposals they fill out the final proposal form                                        PDF  This form asks them to not only give some basic details of their current event chosen but also to suggest some areas of background research they will need to conduct and postulate what they think their thesis statement
                                        might argue whether or not their event will be covered in history textbooks When I used this project with older students I actually took the argumentative portion one more step asking them how it might represented
                                        in history textbooksas a photo a chapter a unit paragraph section etc My ninth graders found this to be above their ability and so I modified the assignment to be simply whether or not it would make
                                        history  Research Paper Sources   After the proposal is completed and returned to them with my comments we take time in class to do some research We discuss what makes an article valid and credible and discuss perspective in news media in class
                                     If I find that my students find this idea challenging I read to them the two versions of the Three Little Pigs story and discuss media bias Finally
                                        students start the research necessary  I showed them how to use The New York Times Web site to conduct searches and specifically filter their research hits for approximate date ranges and articles not blog posts When it
                                        comes to background sources I encourage my students to find books or articles that help them understand vital aspects of their topic For example when students were working on the abortion legislation issue in
                                        Ireland I encouraged them to find information on the history of abortion laws in Ireland or better yet what the laws actually say  The Research Paper Sources form PDF was one of the most challenging parts of this project Students had to redo
                                        it if they didnt find enough sources or if I felt that they didnt have multiple perspectives represented in their articles  Research Paper  The research paper usually requires a first draft that is not assessed for a grade but for feedback and guidance The first drafts generally have weaker thesis statements and I have to go back to review what makes
                                        a good one  This assignment is one that my students find challenging as they generally dont start arguing their thesis until midway through the paper and they often initially write the equivalent of a synthesis of their
                                        news articles and then conclude with whether or not they feel this would be included in future textbooks If students seem to be struggling with the first draft I suggest they complete an outline that I would give
                                        feedback on I dont use it for all of my students as some are well on their way to arguing their thesis from the moment they read the prompt  Presentation  The presentation is usually the first opportunity many of my students have to argue a point in a public forum and as such it is met with nerves and frustration Therefore students have a fairly structured format
                                        for their presentations as shown in the Presentation Requirements PDF and Rubric                                        PDF handouts  To engage them further in the content they are asked to go a bit beyond the requirements of the paper and I generally find that my students do a great job with this By this point they are comfortable discussing
                                        their topics so their presentations are informative and spur great discussions on larger issues One example is our discussion about whether education is a human right which followed two presentations on Malala
                                        Yousafzai and the Taliban  In the end The evolution of this project has been many years for me Ive tried it in my American history and world history courses and Ive achieved a range of success This version of the project was by far the
                                        most successful and led to many meaningful discussions about contemporary and historical issues Ive always loved the conclusions my students drew about the world and what makes history as a result of this
                                        project and I think it certainly helps them think critically like historians and not just consumers of history  Related Learning Network Materials"
"James Purdy, a Fabulist Haunting the Fringes",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/27/books/james-purdy-neglected-writer-continues-to-fascinate.html,When he died in 2009 at 94 James Purdy was a forgotten man He had always been a cult writer held in almost worshipful regard for his wildly original sometimes shocking novels and stories that worked the margins of American society fringe territory populated by smalltown folk failed artists and tormented gay men  Over time he made the transition from underrated to unread The trajectory was steep In his brief but brilliant heyday from the late 1950s to the mid60s he seemed poised to take a place in the literary front ranks Susan Sontag assessing his 1964 novel Cabot Wright Begins for The New York Times Book Review called him indisputably one of the halfdozen or so living American writers worth taking seriously That opinion was not eccentric The backup chorus included Edith Sitwell Angus Wilson Dorothy Parker Tennessee Williams and Gore Vidal Their combined voices failed to secure Mr Purdy a permanent place in the mainstream His hope kept being deferred the hope of being a major voice in American literature said Paul W Miller a Purdy scholar now retired from Wittenberg University in Ohio It never happened Liveright Publishing which reissued Cabot Wright Begins has just given Mr Purdy what may be his last best chance at a breakthrough The Complete Short Stories of James Purdy released in July gathers all 49 of his published stories from A Good Woman which first appeared in the magazine Creative Writing in 1949 to Reaching Rose from the 2000 collection Moes Villa and Other Stories It also includes five early unpublished stories found in the Purdy papers at Yale  the earliest dating from the 1930s  and two recent stories that John Uecker Mr Purdys literary executor says the author deemed ready for publication  Robert Weil the editor in chief of Liveright and a longtime Purdy fan said I wanted to do something that would resurrect his career and secure him his rightful place in American letters Otherwise I felt he might be lost  I thought it was worth a gamble to bring together all the stories known to exist he added  It is a gamble To read all of the stories and follow the arc of Mr Purdys career is to be reminded of how idiosyncratic unpredictable and deeply strange an artist he was These qualities drastically limited his readership but they also make him a tantalizing figure for certain writers notably Jonathan Franzen and a hero for provocateurs like Tao Lin John W McCormack a senior editor at the experimental literary magazine Conjunctions said Someone that iconoclastic is always going to appeal to young writers In her review of Cabot Wright Begins Sontag shrewdly identified at least three authorial identities Purdy the satirist and fantasist Purdy the gentle naturalist of American particularly smalltown American life and Purdy the writer of vignettes or sketches which give us a horrifying snapshot image of helpless people destroying each other These multiple personalities made Purdy difficult to classify He had no antecedents said Jerome Charyn a fellow author at Arbor House in the 1970s He came out of nowhere singing John Martin who brought out a large collection of Purdy stories in 1991 when he ran Black Sparrow Press puts Purdy in the same dark category as Paul Bowles Eudora Welty Flannery OConnor and Carson McCullers  Purdy digs a bit deeper than those he wrote in an email He takes more risks He is more extreme He added He is not afraid to push on until he fails which he often does Dwight Garner in a review of the collected stories in The Times called him one of those American originals who is mostly more interesting to read about than to actually read The nowhere that Mr Purdy came from was the unforgettably named Hicksville Ohio where he was born in 1914 about a decade earlier than he let on His difficult smalltown boyhood in nearby Findlay where he took nourishment from the tales that older relatives told helped shape the sensibility that sent critics searching for a new label Midwestern Gothic In Chicago where he moved after graduating from Bowling Green State University he fell in with members of the Bohemian set around the painter Gertrude Abercrombie many of them future jazz greats like Dizzy Gillespie and Max Roach As a writer he earned more than his fair share of rejection Like Dawn Powell a fellow Ohioan he was a Midwesterner trying to make inroads in New York Adding to his sense of alienation he was a gay man in a hostile straight society His early work saw the light of day only when a couple of welltodo patrons arranged for private printings of his stories His first commercial publication came in Britain rather than the United States  Mr Purdy nevertheless had his moment In the late 1950s and early 60s his stories appeared in topshelf journals like Partisan Review Commentary Esquire and The New Yorker His publisher Farrar Straus  Cudahy was already becoming synonymous with highquality fiction His first fulllength novel Malcolm published in 1959 was later adapted by Edward Albee for the Broadway stage He was a rising star Success proved elusive though and Mr Purdy did little to advance his cause Cabot Wright Begins a scathing take on New Yorks literary culture included a merciless sendup of Orville Prescott a book critic for The Times Eustace Chisholm and the Works about the doomed relationship between a repressed gay man and one of the innocent Billy Budd figures that turn up frequently in Mr Purdys fiction failed to find an audience Its graphic description of an abortion and its horrific sadomasochistic resolution made it a difficult read  Publishers dropped Mr Purdy He could not find an agent Given his personality as an artist it was inevitable that he would be isolated from the literary mainstream said David Means a shortstory writer who sought out Mr Purdy in the 80s When you write a long strange book and call it The House of the Solitary Maggot you cant shoot for the stars  By the late 70s Mr Purdy had settled into the role of the prince in exile from a literary kingdom he held in contempt It was in this period that Fran Lebowitz met him at his invitation for a cup of coffee on Hudson Street It was summertime and he was wearing a seersucker suit she recalled He was very oldfashioned in his manner very courtly very proper in his dress It was very apparent to me that he had no money  The two became friends From time to time Ms Lebowitz arranged readings for him He had so much unpublished work and this was the only way to hear it she said But he was a terrible reader He did not make any concessions to the fact that people wanted to hear He did not make any concessions period That to me  in addition to the carrying of grudges  is the definition of character Small awards and grants came his way along with the occasional accolade like the lifetime achievement award that The Antioch Review with whom he had a long history gave him in 2001  The ceremony was bittersweet and emblematic of Mr Purdys predicament I met him at the National Arts Club said Robert S Fogarty the editor of the review He was lamenting the fact that he couldnt get a publisher in the United States
U.N. Investigators Press North Koreans to Allow a Visit,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/28/world/asia/un-rights-panel-presses-for-access-to-north-korea.html,SEOUL South Korea  The first United Nations panel of experts assigned to investigate North Korean human rights abuses urged the government in Pyongyang on Tuesday to allow them to visit even as the North called their work slanderous The panel a threemember Commission of Inquiry was finishing five days of public hearings here in the South Korean capital during which defectors from North Korea many of them survivors of its labor or political prisoner camps have provided harrowing accounts of hunger torture forced abortions and public executions Some women who testified told the commissioners how human traffickers lured them with promises of jobs and food and sold them in China where they said they were forced into prostitution or a slavelike life in rural families Relatives of South Koreans who were taken to the North during the 195053 Korean War or whose fishing boats were seized by North Korean gunboats in postwar years also appealed for international attention to the fate of their missing fathers and siblings Michael Donald Kirby head of the commission said We are the eyes and ears of the international community Speaking during a news conference in Seoul on Tuesday he appealed for access to North Korea He said his panel would have no preconceptions and act with complete independence in its investigation The best way for North Korea to respond is with evidence he said urging visits to the Norths prison camps and other sites where human rights violations have been reported An ounce of evidence is worth many many pounds of insult or attack North Korea denies keeping political prisoners or violating human rights In the past week it has called the commissions work an interference with internal affairs and slander and provocation It also called North Korean witnesses before the commission human scum who were manipulated by the South Korean authorities It warned that the human rights racket could easily derail a recent movement between the two Koreas toward a thaw in their relations after months of bellicose rhetoric South Korea supports the United Nations inquiry but its politicians are deeply divided over how aggressively the South should press the North over human rights The South Korean president Park Geunhye did not meet the United Nations commissioners Prime Minister Shinzo Abe of Japan by contrast plans to meet them when they travel to Tokyo this week for public hearings involving family members of the Japanese who are thought to have been kidnapped and taken to North Korea decades ago The panel is scheduled to finish its investigation by the end of the year and to submit its report to the United Nations Human Rights Council in March with recommendations Many North Korean defectors hope that the United Nations Security Council will ask the International Criminal Court to indict North Korean leaders for crimes against humanity Rights activists have also called for the United Nations to begin a monitoring program in China to help protect the rights of North Korean refugees there The number of inmates in North Korean political prisoner camps once estimated at 150000 to 200000 is believed to have decreased to 80000 to 120000 in five camps according to the 2013 white paper on North Korean human rights prepared by the governmentrun Korea Institute for National Unification in Seoul It said the North had recently dismantled one camp releasing many inmates and relocating the others to a new smaller camp North Korea also closed another camp near the border with China the South Korean paper said relocating its inmates to other facilities The closing of the second camp followed a sharp decline in the prison population there caused by acute food shortages and large numbers of deaths said a report released Tuesday by the Committee for Human Rights in North Korea a nongovernmental organization based in the United States It cited North Korean defectors or recent South Korean news reports quoting what they identified as anonymous sources inside North Korea

                                         In the past three years at least 54 abortion providers have either shut down or ended their abortion services in the 27 states where information was compiledÂ And the decline
                                        could have been worse In states such as Alabama Wisconsin Mississippi and North Dakota some clinics remain open only because court challenges succeeded in temporarily blocking the enforcement of new rules The survey isnt comprehensiveÂ  But it leaves no doubt that abortion opponents can do a lot of damage without overturning Roe"
Press Adds â€˜What if?â€™ to Five Wâ€™s in France,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/29/world/europe/press-adds-what-if-to-five-ws-in-france.html,PARIS  What does a newspaper do over the summer in a country where nearly everybody goes on vacation at the same time With many French journalists and their sources away from late July to late August and many vacationing readers less inclined than ever to read daily reports about Europes dreary economy or global turmoil newspapers and magazines here leave some of the news behind in favor of far more creative writing Articles on offer this summer starred the Enlightenment philosopher Voltaire and that most golden of monarchs Louis XIV as well as a series of interviews with longdead composers and ventures into somewhat esoteric historical fiction like what if the oil embargo of 1973 had gone on longer Rather than turning to shark attacks or celebrity scandals while the country burns through what is typically five weeks of vacation time the French press uses the seasonal torpor to run pieces that entertain with a literary flair if also a sometimes tenuous link to reality We have very long holidays here and you cannot really work you cant find your usual sources but you have to fill the newspaper said Alexandra Schwartzbrod the deputy managing editor of Libration a leftist daily newspaper And she added readers are looking for something different something lighter Rather than being seen as obscure newspapers that offer flights of fancy or a quirky turn on history there was a series on great autopsies and another on famous impostors do well Read closely some of these pieces are highly political but less dogmatic than editorials They draw on the fondness in France for discussing books and all things intellectual while the fiction bestseller lists include the latest Dan Brown novel Inferno the top nonfiction book at the moment is A Summer With Montaigne by Antoine Compagnon This summer Libration ran a series of 40 essays of historical fiction it is the papers 40th anniversary on what the world  or at least France  would have been like if real events had turned out differently For instance what if the farright politician JeanMarie Le Pen had become prime minister Answer abortion becomes a crime the death penalty is reinstated the remains of Philippe Ptain who was a World War I hero but then led Frances Vichy government are disinterred from the cemetery near his last prison and reburied with other World War I veterans Another essay considered a Y2K bug that lived up to popular fears Clocks were reset to 1900 and Marcel Proust communicated with French sailors on a nuclear submarine  the piece had both a zaniness and a creativity that is unheardof in American newspaper writing However improbable the conjectures the conceit was provocative inviting the reader into an imaginary salon where people have the time and frame of reference to use their imaginations for pure pleasure People look to Libration for irony for satire the summer notebooks are a way to criticize things in a playful way said ric Loret an editor at the paper who worked on the historical fiction essays Le Figaro a paper seen as a bastion of the political right has been running a 17part series of political fiction It imagines that the current Socialist president Franois Hollande visits the tomb of the former Socialist president Franois Mitterrand in the middle of the night accompanied by a former conservative president Jacques Chirac Mr Hollande in this telling explains to Mr Chirac that he has been encouraged by the spirit of Mr Mitterrand to dissolve the National Assembly which would provoke new legislative elections Political mayhem ensues At the end of the series it turns out that it is all a grand joke by Mr Hollande but when asked how he actually plans to address Frances problems his answer is I do not know It is a way for Le Figaro to write about what it sees as Mr Hollandes weak leadership Meanwhile Le Figaros weekly magazine has been running interviews by a music writer with dead composers Frdric Chopin Gioachino Rossini Richard Wagner and Jacques Offenbach among others In the piece on Offenbach the writer tries to depict his character by describing the composer as constantly interrupting the interview to talk to and about singers he is auditioning for his next operetta The articles even carry a date that corresponds to each composers lifetime Sept 12 1873 for Offenbach who died in 1880 Behind the talkiness and the whimsy lies a deep difference between the role of the French and American press We dont have a popular press in France at all said Erwann Gaucher a media critic who directs the regional Web sites for France Tlvision and teaches at the journalism school at Sciences Po in Paris referring to the media outlets that exist in Britain and the United States These papers are aimed at people who are clearly part of a higher class and socioprofessional category There is an aspect of being in a club of peers during the summer so lets talk about beautiful things like a club of people who like the Enlightenment he said Mr Loret of Libration added that it is something of an expectation particularly of the well educated in France to know some Victor Hugo poetry some Voltaire and a smattering of the work of many other literary and philosophical figures Since writers have backgrounds similar to their readers these topics seem like natural fodder Le Monde which is leftleaning but viewed as the countrys newspaper of record took a somewhat more downtoearth approach to the summerseries tradition this year with its look at great autopsies including those of Ludwig van Beethoven Michael Jackson and tzi the 5000yearold mummy found in 1991 in the Alps Mr Gaucher sees all these efforts as an example of French journalists predilection for being clever and writerly but not necessarily for producing what might elsewhere be considered good journalism There are a lot of journalists in France who are more or less consciously writers who dont write and here suddenly in the summer they have a bit of space they have a bit of time to address topics that arent journalism anymore he said But it creates something rather strange right now there is as much news as there is at any other time of year most notably in Egypt but its the time when they are going to write about the most beautiful places in France or great philosophers or our ancestors the Gauls Its completely crazy
A Kingmaker for Documentaries,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/movies/thom-powerss-routine-for-toronto-festival.html,Over the past decades boom in nonfiction film documentaries of all shapes sizes and niche interests have found their way into theaters But getting there is still half the battle Documentarians face often paltry budgets and ample competition for attention in an increasingly fractured marketplace But once the documentary is complete and sometimes even when its not festivals can provide the initial momentum that can mean a fighting chance The calendar is peppered with thriving nonfiction festivals with different approaches Perhaps most crucial for many films are the proving grounds of Sundance in January and next week the Toronto International Film Festival an event that can reward documentaries with marketable profiles After all thats where the high school sports hopefest Undefeated received an important boost on its way to an Academy Award last year Attentive listeners to the thankyou speech that Oscar night might have heard a name of a man that sounded like that of a superhero or his alter ego Thom Powers organizer of Torontos documentary section In the small world of nonfiction film Mr Powers can help influence what makes it to public screens partly because Toronto isnt his only job His portfolio includes the monthly Stranger Than Fiction series of new and classic films at the IFC Center in Manhattan the DOC NYC series in November and the Montclair Film Festival in New Jersey all events that he directs with his wife Raphaela Neihausen Throughout the year his work involves assisting filmmakers from viewing early cuts of films to recommending publicists working with sales agents and distributors and trying to put on a good show worth talking about At Toronto pitchable topics and established filmmakers tend to shine most brightly Paul Sturtz a programmer of the TrueFalse festival in Missouri said Mr Powerss selections are perceived as not always formally adventurous but audience aware Theres usually a hook he added Theres something you can hang your hat on rather than This is an intensely beautifully made film about people youve never heard of  Mr Powerss appraisals of a documentarys seaworthiness are trustworthy even when critical said Steve James director of The Interrupters and Hoop Dreams Thoms turned down films that I submitted to Toronto he added If he likes a film and he programs it you know its a good film Hes no pushover To Mr Powers the task of assembling a 15film slate for Toronto from some 500 candidates is a delicate matter of competing priorities Weeks of Previewing  He views some or all of 250 films during the heavy previewing period of June and July assisted by members of a prescreening team who will watch an additional 250 Three of his 15 films were already selected by June the new projects from Errol Morris The Unknown Known about Donald H Rumsfeld and Frederick Wiseman At Berkeley and The Dog about the eccentric reallife model for the bank robber played by Al Pacino in Dog Day Afternoon a project he had been tracking for years Additional suggestions come trickling in from the prescreeners but also from sales agents distributors and other programmers Great films dont stay hidden for very long Mr Powers said Someone sees them and starts telling other people about them and inevitably one of those people will tell me He also cultivates his contacts The Stranger Than Fiction series typically adjourns for postscreening drinks at a nearby bar After the June screening of Dirty Wars for example Mr Powers checked in on the directors of The Dog and their sales agent Josh Braun of Submarine Films Its not only about seeing the films its about positioning them at the festival Mr Powers said of his efforts to help filmmakers land viewers and buyers That can mean arranging a screening to helping a film build up a profile through social media A Few More Decisions Made In the first week of July a stack of DVDs not to mention a virtual stack of Vimeo links awaited his review at his home in Montclair Since June some more slots had been taken up with fresh recommendations that had panned out New additions to the final 15 included an unsolicited but recommended submission about the Belarus Free Theater Dangerous Acts Starring the Unstable Elements of Belarus Finding Vivian Maier passed along by Mr Braun new films by Marcel Ophuls and Claude Lanzmann that played Cannes and Alex Gibneys Lance Armstrong chronicle Six slots remained The potential selections on this day came via Mr Powerss chief prescreener Dorota Lech who also works for the Hot Docs festival in Toronto Her regular dispatches outline what happens in each film and why she thinks he might or might not like it For Mr Powers culling from these plentiful options can be like bailing water from a sinking ship He popped in a documentary about soap operas a soft recommendation from Ms Lech who thought it might be better suited for DOC NYC Snippets from fans and writers flitted across the screen in a musicdriven montage evoking a television segment Will they get into a characters life Mr Powers wondered Do I feel myself being an advocate of the film the subject matter Ms Neihausen passing on her way out had another question Is that a commercial Next up were two works on heavier topics legalizing marijuana and abortion rights These suffered by comparison to stronger recent films on the subjects How to Make Money Selling Drugs and After Tiller due for release in September Familiar stories need to stand out even more whether its a serious topic or very broadly speaking human interest So far nothing was hitting the mark but a documentary about the Vermont descendants of European stonemasons involved strikingly picturesque photography of stark snowy vistas Then the pace grew meditative long camera takes historical texts read in voiceover Mr Powers an avowed fan of more narrative storytelling formats turned restless It shares a European sensibility he said Strong attention to visual detail and faith in the patience of the viewer that speaks of a governmentfinanced system that doesnt have to make its money back When it comes to the subject of rejections the normally brighteyed and chatty programmer turns into someone you might find in a dentists waiting room Not a fun process he said The unlucky receive letters usually explaining the film is not the right fit for the festival He will write 50 or 60 personally depending on his relationships with the filmmakers All these people have put a year or more of their lives into these films sometimes acquiring financial debt he said All that work and its in the hand of one subjective viewer The Making of a Tastemaker The long and bumpy road to getting a film completed and in front of audiences is familiar to Mr Powers From about 1994 to 2005 he made what he called a meager living in New York working on documentaries He had an early unlikely success producing a documentary on womens attitudes toward breasts a film HBO picked up and then spent eight years figuring out how unique that had been He was asked for a followup  on penises  which was less successful A BBC documentary on Henry A Kissinger fell through as did a second project Then came the opportunity to program Stranger Than Fiction Mr Powers who was teaching a class at the time saw a way to cultivate that community of theatergoing documentary fans and keep up the conversation beyond a single screen Today Stranger Than Fiction is just one of several endeavors some of them collaborations with his wife whom he met at the Berlin film festival when she was presenting a documentary about a gulag beauty contest He might still buy his own health insurance but when you put seven jobs together he said you can make a living Up Against the Deadline The effective deadline for Mr Powerss Toronto selections is late July when the news release for the documentary selection goes out Till then hes dealing with matters large and small handling a distributors request to show a film in a spotlighted gala slot rather than the documentary section approving images and writing copy for the festival catalog heading into New York for a lastminute screening  in this case a film about Vermeers techniques It made the cut Each year there are also documentaries racing to be finished in time Somewhat exceptionally Jehane Noujaim director of the Egypt chronicle The Square reworked the film after its Sundance screening to add coverage of the summers turmoil The directors of the eyecatching albatross documentary Midway were touch and go at one point while Doug Blocks latest personal film ended up not being ready Ive been down this road enough with filmmakers that sometimes it doesnt happen Mr Powers said Theres a cometoJesus call in July where we know as much as we want to do this were not going to be able to do it The Dog finished up just in time Midway is also on the slate along with a film about Bob Guccione and a Pat Robertson expos The Announcement Is Made Mr Powers regards some of the films that Toronto attracts as selections anyone might make Its hard to imagine anyone doing my job isnt going to select the new Errol Morris film he said But then theres another half of films where it isnt Its a total matter of taste He finally decamped to Toronto a couple of weeks before the festival Scheduling conferences with Cameron Bailey artistic director of the festival awaited as did travel logistics for some guests and myriad other details It was a long way from his first outing as a programmer the 2005 debut of Stranger Than Fiction The film was Mr Blocks 51 Birch Street Mr Powers had been hoping for 50 patrons only to watch the theater sell out completely  all 114 tickets And that Mr Powers said began my life of counting seats
Democrats See Value in Texas in Candidacy for Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/us/politics/democrats-see-value-in-texas-in-candidacy-for-governor.html,FORT WORTH  Early this month Wendy Davis the unknown Texas state senator who rocketed to fame this summer with her 11hour filibuster to block an antiabortion bill met with strategists of the Democratic Governors Association at their K Street offices in Washington They were urging her to run for governor next year even though Texas is not among their realistic targets for flipping a Republicanheld executive mansion All around Ms Davis people are encouraging her to get in the governors race Whether she can win seems beside the point Liberal groups in Texas are hungry for her star power to energize the moribund state Democratic Party Political operatives smell the money that a richly financed Democratic campaign which early estimates put at 40 million would direct their way And national Democrats know a Davis campaign would force the Republican Governors Association to divert millions from more competitive races in Ohio Florida and Michigan to the Lone Star State The RGA would probably have to waste resources there which is compelling to us said an official of the Democratic group who declined to be named because he was not authorized to speak publicly Ms Davis tuning out the selfinterested chorus has spent August engaging in a private inquiry into the viability of a race for which independent analysts put the chances of her success somewhere between a long shot and a pipe dream On Thursday she said she would announce her decision in a few weeks  a decision she postponed because she is caring for her father who is hospitalized with complications from surgery she said in a statement What trusted advisers pollsters fundraisers and friends are telling her they said in interviews is that there is a path to victory even in Texas where no Democrat has won statewide office in nearly two decades My impression was she was very interested said Martin Frost a Washington lobbyist and former Texas congressman whose counsel Ms Davis sought You dont get these opportunities very often Shes 50 years old This is the right time for her In her most recent public appearance she sounded very much like a candidate on the verge She was very very seriously considering a campaign she told an audience in San Francisco two weeks ago She added I really think hard things are worth fighting for That sentiment echoed what aides have identified as the best way for Ms Davis to position herself  as a fighter for her beliefs  and deflect Republican efforts to narrowly define her as a defender of lateterm abortion Researchers presented Ms Davis with private polling that showed she was better known for her personality than for her positions They also prepared an analysis of the nearly 900000 Twitter messages in the 24 hours around her filibuster in June which temporarily halted a bill to ban abortion in Texas after 20 weeks A high percentage of those messages focused on her physical ordeal Probably the biggest benefit of this filibuster is Wendy is known statewide and shes known as a fighter and that plays very well in Texas said Matt Angle an adviser to Ms Davis Republicans are moving swiftly to peg Ms Davis whose celebrity was confirmed this month by a Vogue magazine spread as someone out of step with the states conservative electorate God I hope she runs itll be great said Dave Carney a consultant to Attorney General Greg Abbott the most likely Republican nominee I dont see her brand of populism which is beautifully accepted on the Left Coast and the Acela Corridor being a selling job in Texas Ms Davis has sought to broaden her identity emphasizing a life story that few members of the coastal elites would identify with Raised by a mother with a sixthgrade education after her father left she became a single mother herself living in a mobile home She worked her way through community college won a scholarship to Texas Christian University and eventually graduated from Harvard Law School She served nine years on the Fort Worth City Council before defeating a Republican incumbent for the State Senate in 2008 In Austin her shoulderlength blond mane inspired jokes that she was the only politician with better hair than Gov Rick Perry Much of Ms Daviss due diligence in eyeing a run has involved sifting the results of past statewide Texas races The numbers are daunting President Obama lost the state by 16 points in November The 2010 Democratic nominee for governor pulled only 42 percent But Ms Daviss number crunchers are telling her in essence that if she can win her Senate district  much of Fort Worth and its suburbs  she can win statewide It is the only district out of 31 in the state that is a true battleground not drawn to protect one of the parties In winning reelection in November Ms Davis outpolled Mr Obama in her district by 15000 votes She appealed to ticketsplitters who preferred Mitt Romney on the presidential ballot by 8 points Many were white suburban women independents who were not driven by wedge social issues like abortion Ms Daviss advisers determined There are a lot of arguments a candidate like Wendy will be able to make that will appeal to voters who may vote for a Republican in every presidential election for the rest of their lives said Chris Turner a member of the Texas House who told Ms Davis that he thought she could pull together a winning coalition She asked my opinion if I think its doable he said I told her why I think it is Independent analysts are more skeptical Mark P Jones chairman of political science at Rice University said the two demographic groups that Ms Davis needs most white women and Hispanics disagree with her by wide margins on the issue she is best known for opposition to a ban on abortion after 20 weeks Barring some egregious error on the part of Greg Abbott I dont see any realistic possibility for Wendy Davis winning this election Mr Jones said Mr Abbott however showed it is easy to blunder in running against a woman He apologized last week for thanking a supporter on Twitter who had called Ms Davis Retard Barbie Mr Jones said it still might make sense for Ms Davis to jump in if she can improve on the 13 percent loss of the last Democratic nominee to Governor Perry who is not seeking a fourth term That would put the Democratic Party on track to make a significant challenge in 2018 he said including another Davis run for governor or United States senator But Ms Daviss closest confidants do not talk that way They are not focused on future races or lending strategic aid to other Democrats in Texas or nationally They think Ms Davis has a path to victory if she can raise enough money and they have a budget of 40 million or twice what the 2010 Democratic nominee Bill White spent I believe that figure is doable said J D Angle Ms Daviss closest adviser He pointed out that Texas has plenty of wealthy Democrats frustrated that their money has flowed mostly to outofstate candidates Mr Angle who has advised Ms Davis since her first campaign for City Council said that after checking the box that 40 million is available  we all believe it is he said  the final question for Ms Davis is about knowing where the numbers are in terms of persuadable voters I hope Ive convinced her that has been resolved he said
Stringer and Spitzer Seek Votes of Women,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/08/30/nyregion/stringer-and-spitzer-seek-votes-of-women.html, With conflicting polls suggesting that the Democratic primary race for comptroller may be up for grabs Eliot Spitzer and his opponent Scott M Stringer reached out on Thursday to a key voting constituency women Mr Stringer who has hammered Mr Spitzer throughout the campaign over the prostitution scandal that forced him to resign as governor held a rally in Harlem with a group of female supporters Zenaida Mendez the president of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women stood in front of a statue of Harriet Tubman and said in Spanish that Mr Stringer had made a difference in the lives of all the women of New York City  Latina women black women white women Linda B Rosenthal an assemblywoman from the Upper West Side described Mr Stringer as a true champion for womens rights and gender equality citing his work in the State Assembly on antistalking legislation and his support for victims of domestic violence The Spitzer campaign fought back releasing an ad which it said it would start telecasting on Friday highlighting Mr Spitzers advocacy of abortion rights and paid family leave The ad opens with a shot of a pregnant woman as a female narrator says Mr Spitzer fought valiantly for paid family leave The narrator goes on to say that Mr Spitzer did more to protect womens health and our right to choose than almost any elected official anywhere and that those who care about schools getting the funding they deserve should vote for him Two polls on Thursday offered conflicting views of the race The New York TimesSiena College Poll showed Mr Spitzer leading with the support of 50 percent of likely voters in the Democratic primary compared with 35 percent for Mr Stringer but a poll released by Quinnipiac University showed the two candidates neck and neck each with the support of 46 percent of likely voters Women are a crucial battleground not only because Mr Stringer sees Mr Spitzers history of patronizing prostitutes as a vulnerability but also because women are expected to make up about 60 percent of the voters in the Sept 10 Democratic primary Mr Stringer when asked at his rally about Mr Spitzers record on womens issues declined to comment instead citing his own endorsements by NOW Planned Parenthood and Naral as evidence that he was the strongest candidate on womens rights The women whove been on the front lines the women who have struggled the women who have spoken and worked on these issues all are supporting me  none are supporting him he said Meanwhile one of two super PACs that had formed to oppose Mr Spitzer turned out to be largely fangless The group ForwardNY which was to be made up of business leaders and womens groups has raised only 1200 according to filings with the State Board of Elections According to city records it has spent only 2000 on its Web site The groups fundraising total was first reported by Crains A political action committee financed by labor groups opposed to Mr Spitzer has raised 450000 and has spent 300000 on mailings and a radio ad
Stay of Execution,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/books/review/a-wild-justice-by-evan-j-mandery.html,Furman v Georgia is among the oddest Supreme Court cases in American history Decided in 1972 it struck down every death penalty statute in the nation as then practiced without outlawing the death penalty itself The ruling based on the constitutional protection against cruel and unusual punishment stunned even the closest court watchers The death penalty seemed impregnable It was part of the bedrock of Americas legal system steeped in the intent of the founders the will of most state legislatures and the forceful  if occasional  rulings of the courts The 54 vote in Furman reflected a striking political split all five members of the majority were holdovers from the Warren Court known for its liberal decisions while all four dissenters were recent appointees of Richard Nixon who had won the White House with a carefully orchestrated lawandorder campaign And notably each justice wrote his own opinion in Furman meaning there was no common thread to the case no controlling rationale The decision ran to several hundred pages the longest handed down by the court at the time  Explaining Furman and its implications can be tricky but Evan Mandery a professor at the John Jay College of Criminal Justice has done both with remarkable ease A Wild Justice covers a decades worth of litigation beginning in the mid1960s with a daring strategy by death penalty abolitionists to grab the Supreme Courts attention and ending in the mid1970s with an angry public backlash and a crushing legal defeat Mandery knows how to tell a story and hes done some terrific research His judgments are crisp and generally fairminded despite a clear sympathy for the abolitionist side Still at 534 pages A Wild Justice contains few surprises What Mandery has done for the most part is add depth to a now familiar tale  The first sustained legal assault on the death penalty was organized by the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund and led by a group of young attorneys who viewed capital punishment as a civil rights issue because of the high percentage of blacks on death row But defending a single race from execution seemed callous at best We felt a legal and moral obligation to extend representation to other clients many of whom had suffered the same injustices said Anthony Amsterdam the Defense Funds top litigator With more than 600 prisoners awaiting execution the group pushed two key arguments in the courts flawed process and evolving standards of decency Flawed process referred to the combination of wide discretion and poor guidance facing jurors in capital trials The end result said the Defense Fund was an irreversible punishment capriciously applied Evolving standards relied on a different approach challenging the death penaltys sacredcow status in politics and law Times change the defense group argued and attitudes do too Americans no longer supported whipping or branding or public hanging In a 1958 Supreme Court case on another matter the majority had agreed the cruel and unusual punishments clause must draw its meaning from the evolving standards of decency that mark the progress of a maturing society As the Defense Fund saw it these evolving standards now included rejecting the death penalty as well Three justices seemed certain to buy in Thurgood Marshall and William Brennan who opposed the death penalty in all circumstances and William O Douglas who loved common people in the abstract Mandery notes but abused everyone around him in real life Firmly on the other side were the four Nixon appointees Chief Justice Warren Burger and Justices Harry Blackmun Lewis Powell and William Rehnquist Their feeling about the death penalty ranged from Blackmuns personal squeamishness to Rehnquists muscular support but all agreed the issue belonged in the state legislatures not in the federal courts That left Furman in the hands of the two swing justices Potter Stewart and Byron White Stewart viscerally opposed the death penalty White did not What united them was the flawed process argument though for different reasons Stewart sensed that for every person sitting on death row there were hundreds more convicted of a similar crime  or worse  who were not sitting on death row His intention in striking down current capital punishment laws was to force the states to single out the worst offenders White had a different agenda The problem as he saw it was that capital punishment no longer served its main purpose  deterrence  because it wasnt used enough Either execute more people or abolish the penalty altogether his logic went Pick one or the other Whites decision to join the fragmented majority in Furman caught many off guard Manderys explanation is bold to say the least He asserts that Stewart met secretly with White and agreed to abandon his moral position against the death penalty in return for Whites vote Both men would join the majority to protest the flawed process of the current system thereby leaving the door open for the return of capital punishment should the states write new and better laws This no doubt is the books biggest surprise  Unfortunately Mandery cites no source for the meeting because none appears to exist Their conversation is lost to history he writes Neither man ever repeated what was said to their clerks or the other justices They gave no interviews about it Nevertheless they reached a clear agreement Perhaps they did perhaps not The response to Furman was volcanic Public support for capital punishment shot up and new death penalty bills flooded state legislatures Mandery rightly sees this upsurge as part of a larger reaction against a flurry of controversial Supreme Court decisions ranging from busing to abortion But fear of violent crime surely played a role as the homicide rate climbed in these years and Americans flocked to vigilantethemed movies like Death Wish and Dirty Harry In 1976 the court heard oral arguments on five new state death penalty statutes known collectively as Gregg v Georgia To pass muster the Georgia statute included a list of deatheligible crimes a split trial separating the guilt or innocence phase from the punishment phase and a review of all death sentences by the state supreme court Mandery is at his strongest describing the heavyweight battle between Solicitor General Robert Bork representing the Ford administration and Anthony Amsterdam Brilliant though he was Amsterdam couldnt shake Borks deft portrayal of him and his supporters as extremists who yearned for nothing less than the complete abolition of the death penalty The justices quickly picked up on this with Lewis Powell asking Amsterdam who is Jewish whether he thought capital punishment was appropriate for the commandant of Buchenwald When the clearly insulted Amsterdam said no Powell stared in disbelief By a vote of 72  Marshall and Brennan dissented Douglas was no longer on the bench  the court upheld the new Georgia statute ruling that it had fixed the problems described in Furman The death penalty was back Though Mandery ends his rich account here capital punishment marches on About 1300 people have been executed since Gregg with Texas putting its 503rd prisoner to death just weeks ago A clear majority continues to support the death penalty though the fear of wrongful convictions appears to be growing and evidence suggests that juries welcome the option of life in prison without parole Meanwhile the Supreme Court has tightened the reins of capital punishment in recent years ruling that the executions of the mentally retarded people under 18 and those convicted of rape even the rape of a child are unconstitutional For death penalty abolitionists however the promise of Furman must seem a distant bitter memory 
Taking Their Very Sweet Time,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/fashion/weddings/taking-their-very-sweet-time.html,Neon beer signs sports team logos and sexy posters may be de rigueur in the dorm rooms of college males but while at the University of Florida in Gainesville Udonis Haslem went one better Somehow the Gators basketball player managed to keep a pit bull hidden in his room  which at the time was more emblematic of where hed been than of where he was going Mr Haslem is now a captain of the Miami Heat and has won three NBA championships with the team When they met 14 years ago Faith Rein was more focused on the dog and its illegal residence in the dorm than in the starting center of the Gators When her attention shifted to its owner Ms Rein who like Mr Haslem was attending college on an athletic scholarship remembers thinking He was cute and super chill but I was dating a football player and he was seeing a girl on the volleyball team They were playing in different leagues all right She was raised in a Virginia suburb by a black Baptist mother and a Jewish father and had been a 100meter national champion at age 10 I was an inner city Miami kid said Mr Haslem now 33 with a drugaddicted mother a stepmother who never married my father and a son from a high school fling I fought on the streets watched friends die from drugs and violence and learned to shoot hoops in Liberty City I had no idea if she even liked me They occasionally passed in the hallway but didnt meet again until the following year By that time Ms Rein had dumped the football player and was engaged in a notveryserious longdistance relationship with a track star and Mr Haslem was recovering from a broken heart I was going through a rough time because my girlfriend cheated on me with another basketball player a guy I saw every day at practice he said I like to address things and get them out in the open but I knew better than to start trouble I needed to move on Mr Haslem thought Ms Rein was special because she was reserved and not full of herself Yet when she did discuss her background he found it intimidating Ms Rein meanwhile was intrigued with his freeflowing conversations which demonstrated his intelligence yet further illustrated the disparity of their childhoods I liked the way he spoke especially about life on Miami streets recalled Ms Rein who is now 32 and said she had never encountered racism in the suburban life provided by her parents He was darkskinned and rough around the edges I was very attracted When nothing progressed Ms Rein asked him to take her out to dinner He joked that he would take me to Popeyes if I paid she said Over chicken and biscuits he found he liked her competitiveness intelligence and passion for what goes into winning and losing Five minutes after dropping her at the dorm he called and told her I like you I am feeling you She was thrilled but didnt respond hoping that he would now take the lead They met daily always platonically Udonis was a challenge admitted Ms Rein who was more accustomed to men chasing her He excited me Mr Haslem said Faith was refreshing after the loud confrontational attentionseeking women I had known She was bright and motivating and as a jock got what I do But she was not easy to read and I didnt want to spoil our friendship by moving too fast By May 2001 however she and Mr Haslem had become a couple spending most of their free time together Their first challenge took place the following spring when she became pregnant It was her junior and his senior year and he had begun training for the NBA draft Despite the pregnancy she was busy with track meets and helping him complete homework The timing was bad I am not a huge fan of abortion but we both had sports careers plus we could not financially handle a baby said Mr Haslem noting how he struggled with supporting Kedonis the son he had in high school who is now 14 and who lives with his mother Udonis appreciated that I was willing to have an abortion Ms Rein said I found him caring supportive nurturing and all over me to be sure I was OK I saw another side of him during that difficult time and fell deeply in love He had a big heart and was the whole package Their relationship was tested again when Mr Haslem left college without graduating to practice basketball full time before the NBA draft that summer only to find himself devastated when he was not selected He can go inside of himself when he feels insecure Ms Rein said I wanted to be strong for him and let him know he had to stay positive that this setback did not change anything between us She was the rock behind him at this very low point in his career observed Mike Miller Mr Haslems former Gator as well as Miami Heat teammate now a member of the Memphis Grizzlies With that support Mr Haslem rebounded quickly accepting a position with the lan Chalon basketball team in ChalonsurSane France while Ms Rein remained in Gainesville to complete her bachelors degree in business administration They communicated by Web chat twice a day for a year and visited several times They say they never had a disconnect or considered dating anyone else That March when Ms Rein called him sobbing after she tore a hamstring  forcing her to drop track  he comforted her by saying Its OK Mr Haslem returned to Florida the next month More than 30 pounds lighter he had rebuilt his body chiseling it down with weight lifting play and a new diet While she was proud to see how great he looked it was Mr Haslem who got the shivers The loyalty she showed while I was in Europe amazed me he said She said we would live forever in Europe if that was our fate When she graduated in May 2003 Mr Haslem was playing summerleague ball as a free agent honing his defense and rebounding skills in offseason games with the Miami Heat and the San Antonio Spurs His new athleticism was validated when both NBA teams made him offers In August 2003 he signed with the Heat for two years Ms Rein was ready for them to be together but he wasnt able to make a full commitment she said After gab sessions with several members of her family Ms Rein flexed her muscles by moving to New York to pursue a career in sports broadcasting Faith and Udonis were crazy about each other said her older sister Shanelle ReinOlowokere But she needed to make her own money and see how it feels to be independent before becoming a basketball wife I pushed her to go to New York Mr Haslem respected her decision but once again questioned the differences in their backgrounds He was baffled by her family sitdowns In my house he said we didnt talk things over While she worked as a production assistant for HBOs Real Sports With Bryant Gumbel they continued their Web chats and saw each other when the Heat played around the New York area Ms Rein yearned for him and told him so occasionally worrying about latenight Miami parties and women chasing NBA stars In any event he was working hard on the court He resigned with the Heat in August 2005 and bought a fourbedroom house with a yard and a pool in a family community in Broward County soon discovering that coming home to an empty space felt lonely I was impressed with her independence those two years but the separation made me realize how much I missed her and wanted to share my life with her he said I just didnt know how to ask her to marry me We had never lived together and while she comes from a home with parents who have been together forever my family experience with marriage had been negative and painful There was no happy ever after Confident of his love she joined him in February 2006 but had trouble adjusting to South Florida For several months she searched for a job cleaned the house worked out and learned the area Mostly she sat around waiting for Mr Haslem to come home so she could make him dishes like tacos with yellow rice and okra followed by coconut cake All the while Mr Haslem assured her that marriage was in the offing Nevertheless she admitted It was not a good time for me Mr Haslem wanted her to make friends but she was uncomfortable around the highprofile Miami Heat wives of that era It was a lonely existence she said Things changed quickly after their son Josiah was born in January 2007 and Ms Rein became a stayathome mom She was extremely happy raising her son and sharing in the mercurial moments of Mr Haslems thriving basketball career including nursing his frequent injuries from his position as a power forward Inside they are the same bighearted familyoriented kind of people who approach life thoughtfully said James Jones his Miami Heat teammate and boyhood friend They were already life partners They had another son Elijah now 2 12 Shortly after Mr Haslem again signed with the Heat in July 2010 his 53yearold mother Debra Haslem who had overcome her abuse of drugs died of cancer Shortly after that the couple bought a bigger house in Broward County for their growing family which included regular visits from Kedonis This only made Ms Rein more anxious to become Mrs Haslem I loved her just as much then as I do now he said She proved to be a strong family person and has helped me through rough times She deserved to be happy yet I was still afraid of marriage and had convinced myself that with a little more time it would all work out That moment came last Aug 29 after the couple enjoyed a romantic trip to Italy Mr Haslem was planning to ask Ms Reins father for her hand in marriage when they returned to Florida her parents Richard and Gloria Rein had been watching the couples children During their first night back Mr Haslem got the answer he was looking for from Mr Rein but then waited until 230 am to enter the bedroom where his intended was sound asleep When he flipped on the lights Ms Rein was understandably irritated All of a sudden Udonis got down on bended knee opened the ring box and asked me to marry him she said I was shocked but somehow managed a wide smile while blurting out YesÂ  Their nondenominational seaside ceremony took place Aug 24 at the Four Seasons Resort Palm Beach in Florida The event was attended by 200 guests including the Heats president Pat Riley its head coach Erik Spoelstra and the rapper Flo Rida Among the players attending was LeBron James who wearing dark sunglasses and accompanied by Savannah Brinson strolled in just moments before the start The Rev Frederick Allen a minister ordained by Mansion Ministries of Miramar Fla officiated Carrying a bouquet of garden roses and white hydrangeas the bride wowed the crowd in a strapless lace mermaidstyle Vera Wang gown After she and Mr Haslem kissed four times as man and wife they walked along a rosestrewn path to the strains of Tupac Shakurs 2 of Amerikaz Most Wanted The guests made some noise as if the Heat had just won another basketball game But the happiest guest may have been the couples son Josiah who breathed a long sigh of relief Finally he said we all have the same last name
"Spotlight on Wendy Davis, the Democratsâ€™ Big Hope",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/01/us/spotlight-on-wendy-davis-the-democrats-big-hope.html,FORT WORTH  Wendy Davis burst into the national political consciousness this summer as a feminist folk hero She was a titan in pink tennis shoes a single mother who became a lawyer stood up to the Republican boys club and against all odds temporarily halted enactment of a restrictive abortion bill Last week a different side of the Democratic state senator emerged the devoted daughter of an ailing father Jerry Russell who is well known in Fort Worth theater circles but is not mentioned in her compelling campaign biography Her mother a sixthgrade dropout who made do without child support is the one who figures prominently in the back story that inspires Ms Daviss followers  But Ms Daviss story is more complicated and nuanced than legend would have it That is not altogether surprising Getting to know people even famous ones takes time Still Ms Davis  whose moribund party badly needs a superstar  rode a filibuster into the political stratosphere and now her supporters are all but forcing her to run for governor If she does her biography will fall under a more powerful microscope and what voters are likely to find is the story of an ambitious woman who has experienced poverty and wealth is not as partisan as her detractors might think and was shaped as much by her single electoral defeat as by the unbroken string of victories ever since Ms Davis 50 has both accused opponents and been accused by them of loose ethics She has fought against powerful moneyed interests and has enthusiastically joined them in common cause  Through it all she says she has never forgotten where she came from In a recent interview at the Fort Worth hospital where she has rarely left her fathers side since he fell ill a few weeks ago Ms Davis said hardship has defined her I think its hard to fully describe the struggles that I went through she said I talk about that to connect to people because I want people to understand where my values come from I want them hopefully to understand that I didnt put it behind me I carry it with me every day to my benefit When Ms Davis moved to Fort Worth in the early 1970s her father worked at National Cash Register Her parents divorced when she was 11 Then her father quit his job to pursue his dreams in community theater Soon his child support payments dried up and the family finances took a nose dive To cope Ms Daviss mother Virginia Russell forbid use of the airconditioner until June 1 every summer Ms Davis herself went to work at age 14 first selling newspaper subscriptions and later waiting tables There were times when we didnt feel like there was a lot of food in the house she said We never starved but we struggled Still Ms Davis excelled in her studies graduating in 1981 from Richland High School as a member of the National Honor Society I was one of those kids that could just show up and take the test and do well on it she said I didnt study a whole lot Between her junior and senior year of high school Ms Davis said she moved in with her boyfriend Frank Underwood a construction worker Then she got pregnant and had a hasty marriage right out of high school  In 1982 at 19 Ms Davis had a daughter Amber and worked at a pediatricians office and also as a waitress at her fathers dinner theater The couple bought a trailer and moved it to a mobilehome park They were so broke they could not afford the skirt that per the rules was supposed to cover the bottom of the trailer They split up after a year and Ms Davis walked away from the mortgage and moved back in with her mother She said that Mr Underwood paid child support for a while but that she still struggled financially That changed after she went to junior college and met Jeffry Davis a lawyer and former city councilman They married in 1987 Their daughter Dru was born in 1988 and after Ms Davis graduated from Texas Christian University at the top of her class in 1990 she set her sights on Harvard Law School Even with their considerable resources the Davises pushed the envelope her husband cashed in his 401k and eventually took out a loan to help pay for tuition and rent for an apartment in Massachusetts while still paying the mortgage on their Fort Worth home Ms Davis graduated from Harvard Law with honors in 1993 Her first brush with political activism came in the early 1990s when she opposed an expansion of the Fort Worth Zoo whose plans to use green space for a parking lot had the support of powerful downtown interests But it irked Ms Davis and her aestheticminded neighbors in the Mistletoe Heights neighborhood  Exhibiting a taste for political combat she brought the zoo battle into her first race for a Fort Worth City Council seat in 1996 She lost by 90 votes The loss stung but Ms Davis realized there was a lesson to be learned  It was the first time in my life I had tried to do something and hadnt succeeded at it she said I learned that you cant ask people for their support if you havent taken the time demonstrated that youre worthy of it Ms Davis spent three years learning about the issues and meeting the critical players in a district encompassing both wealthy and poor neighborhoods She won the seat when it opened up again in 1999  At City Hall she developed a reputation as both gutsy and pragmatic She pressed the oil industry eager to cash in on a vast urban slice of the Barnett Shale gas field to change what she saw as onesided lease deals in minority neighborhoods She fought with employee unions to scale back lucrative pension benefits And she became the lone naysayer of a popular property tax freeze for senior citizens  a move that Jack Z Smith then a Fort Worth StarTelegram columnist said showed a raw political courage of the type rarely seen in Washington Today she admits that opposing the freeze was politically unwise but says that she would do it again After all with no means testing Fort Worth billionaires benefit while struggling residents who are not yet 65 have to carry the load she said In her Council years Ms Davis also courted developers and promoted publicprivate economic development projects She has wooed wealthy businessmen too  including the billionaire oilman Sid Bass who has given her 200000 in the last two years campaign records show If we wanted to get something done on Council she was the first person I went to said the former City Council member Becky Haskin a Republican Like it or not the Republicans wish they had Wendy Davis in their party Shes a strong woman and they just cant handle it  In 2003 as Ms Daviss political career soared her marriage fell apart After Jeffry Davis filed for divorce she moved into an apartment The house which was in her husbands name is where Amber and Dru grew up and that is where they wanted to stay their mother recalled  The divorce decree in 2005 gave Mr Davis primary custody of Dru who was then 17 and Ms Davis agreed to pay 1200 a month in child support records show  She said it was the right thing to do My girls wanted to stay in their family home she said I did feel like as the noncustodial parent that that was my obligation Today her daughters are constantly at her side and Ms Davis says the three are incredibly close  In 2007 Ms Davis set her sights on the Texas Senate When her name popped up though many wondered what party Ms Davis belonged to She had voted in Republican primaries in 1996 1998 and 2006 and Ms Davis had also given at least 1500 to United States Representative Kay Granger a Fort Worth Republican campaign finance records show When I first put my hat in the ring several very triedandtrue and loyal Democratic activists from our community said What Shes not a Democrat Shes a RepublicanÂ  Ms Davis recalled I took that as a compliment you know that people didnt necessarily know what my ideology might be because I wasnt driven by that Ms Davis won in 2008 and 2012 despite the districts Republican leanings Her crossover appeal has given Democrats hope that Ms Davis can reverse their long statewide losing streak in Texas Texas Republicans scoff at the notion but they are prepared just in case besides the anticipated focus on her relatively liberal Senate record Ms Davis can expect to be criticized on ethicsrelated issues Among them is her law firms contracts with public entities including the North Texas Tollway Authority and her partnership with Brian Newby Gov Rick Perrys former chief of staff and now a registered lobbyist  Ms Davis said that although her legal work has never presented a conflict she would temporarily halt it if she ran for governor And she says she would give it up altogether if she won In the meantime she said that she planned to ask her publicsector clients to waive attorneyclient privilege so she can publicly name them She had previously resisted calls to disclose her client list Whats happened is theres this big ballooned story she said I think we can come to a way to describe the work we do and the compensation weve received
Surprising Friend of Gay Rights in a High Place,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/us/surprising-friend-of-gay-rights-in-a-high-place.html,The San Francisco Gay Mens Chorus sang Give Em Hope for a revered and in some ways surprising guest who shared a California stage with them last month Justice Anthony M Kennedy  Justice Kennedy was in San Francisco for an American Bar Association meeting but he was also there to be celebrated by the men on the risers behind him In remarks from the stage San Franciscos mayor Edwin M Lee thanked the justice for upholding the Constitution and justice for all in his majority opinion in June in United States v Windsor a major gay rights victory Freedom is always a work in progress Justice Kennedy said in his own remarks making clear that there was more work to be done Justice Kennedy has emerged as the most important judicial champion of gay rights in the nations history having written three landmark opinions on the subject including this summers Windsor decision which overturned a ban on federal benefits for married samesex couples Those rulings collectively represent a new chapter in the nations civil rights law and they have cemented his legacy as a hero to the gay rights movement He is the towering giant in the jurisprudence of freedom and equality for gay people said Evan Wolfson the president of Freedom to Marry and one of the architects of the political and legal push for samesex marriage That push has taken on momentum thanks to the Windsor decision which gay rights groups are citing in challenges to state bans on samesex marriage On Thursday the Internal Revenue Service said it would implement the Windsor ruling by recognizing the unions of all lawfully married samesex couples including those living in states that do not allow samesex marriage On Saturday Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg who joined Justice Kennedys majority opinion in Windsor became the first member of the court to officiate at a samesex wedding The praise now being showered on Justice Kennedy by gay rights advocates  and the deep disappointment of conservatives  would have been hard to imagine when President Ronald Reagan nominated him to the Supreme Court in 1987 Gay rights groups were more than a little wary then On the federal appeals court in California where Justice Kennedy had served for 13 years he heard five cases concerning gay rights He voted against the gay rights claim every time I have to say that Kennedy seems rather obtuse on important gay issues and must be counted as a likely vote against us on most matters likely to come before the Supreme Court Arthur S Leonard an authority on gay rights at New York Law School wrote in The New York Native a newspaper that focused on gay issues The justices trajectory since then has been a product of overlapping factors associates and observers say His Supreme Court jurisprudence is characterized by an expansive commitment to individual liberty He believes that American courts should consider international norms and foreign courts have expanded gay rights His politics reflecting his background as a Sacramento lawyer and lobbyist tend toward fiscal conservatism and moderate social views And he has long had gay friends Michael C Dorf a law professor at Cornell who served as a law clerk to Justice Kennedy said the key to understanding his former boss was the culture of his home state The way to think about his instincts is that he is fundamentally a California Republican Professor Dorf said Its not surprising that a California Republican in 1987 would be expected to be at best an unreliable ally for gay rights groups In the 1980s California Republicans like most Americans had deep reservations about the notion of gay equality But there were also early stirrings of the gay rights movement in California Harvey Milk a member of the San Francisco Board of Supervisors and one of the first openly gay elected officials delivered a landmark gay rights speech in 1978 on which the song Give Em Hope was based Mr Milk was assassinated later that year The same year Reagan a former California governor preparing to run for president helped defeat a ballot initiative that would have made it easy to fire gay teachers Over time some leading California Republicans moved more on the issue than many Republicans elsewhere Theodore B Olson a Northern Californian who served as the United States solicitor general under President George W Bush helped lead the fight to overturn Proposition 8 the states ban on samesex marriage Justice Kennedys three major gay rights decisions are in this tradition Professor Dorf said They also hark back to a third California Republican Chief Justice Earl Warren another former governor who wrote Brown v Board of Education the 1954 decision barring segregation in public schools Romer v Evans in 1996 struck down a Colorado constitutional amendment that had banned laws protecting gay men and lesbians Lawrence v Texas in 2003 struck down laws making gay sex a crime And in June Justice Kennedy wrote  the Windsor decision In 1987 gay rights advocates could see little of this coming Jeffrey Levi then the executive director of the National Gay and Lesbian Task Force testified against Justice Kennedy at his confirmation hearings saying that his past opinions offer little hope to gays and lesbians challenging adverse treatment in the courts Professor Levi who now teaches health policy at George Washington University said in an email that there was no way to predict that Justice Kennedy would evolve as he did given prior opinions on gays in the military immigration and federal employment Professor Levi drew a comparison to Dr C Everett Koop whose nomination as surgeon general under Reagan was opposed by gay rights groups based on hostile statements he had made He turned out to be a hero of the early fight against AIDS Professor Levi said of Dr Koop There were though other ways to read the available evidence about the Kennedy nomination As a federal judge in 1980 when he voted to uphold the discharge of Navy personnel for homosexuality he seemed to leave the door open to further challenges We recognize as we must he wrote for a unanimous threejudge panel that there is substantial academic comment which argues that the choice to engage in homosexual action is a personal decision entitled at least in some instances to recognition as a fundamental right and to full protection as an aspect of the individuals right of privacy Seven years later at Judge Kennedys confirmation hearings Senator Gordon J Humphrey Republican of New Hampshire said that language worried him My goodness he said you can find academic comment to justify almost anything Judge Kennedy responded that he had thought it important for the service members to know that I had considered their point of view In 1986 a month after the Supreme Court upheld a Georgia law that made gay sex a crime in Bowers v Hardwick Judge Kennedy not yet a justice gave a speech at Stanford expressing reservations about the ruling He contrasted it to a 1981 decision from the European Court of Human Rights striking down a similar law in Northern Ireland Seventeen years later Justice Kennedy cited the European courts decision in his majority opinion in Lawrence v Texas which overruled Bowers Its continuance as precedent demeans the lives of homosexual persons Justice Kennedy wrote Justice Harry A Blackmun who wrote the majority opinion in 1973 in Roe v Wade which established a constitutional right to abortion warned Justice Kennedy to expect harsh criticism when he stood up for gay rights Mondays decision took courage Justice Blackmun wrote to Justice Kennedy praising his majority opinion in 1996 in Romer v Evans You undoubtedly now will receive a lot of critical and even hateful mail I have had that experience Justice Kennedy replied No one told us it was an easy job when we signed on These days Professor Dorf said there is more praise than criticism and Justice Kennedy has joined a select group What Earl Warren was to civil rights and what Ruth Bader Ginsburg was to womens rights he said Kennedy is to gay rights
The Mayoral Candidates on Public Health,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/02/nyregion/the-mayoral-candidates-on-public-health.html,Some of Mayor Michael R Bloombergs health policies  banning smoking in most public places posting calorie counts in chain restaurants  have become so entrenched even popular that it is hard to imagine they would be rolled back by his successors But several of Mr Bloombergs ambitious health initiatives have been met with less enthusiasm by the public and the courts Many New Yorkers agreed that curbing the consumption of sugary drinks to combat obesity was a worthy goal but they did not like the mayors seemingly dictating how it should be done The courts ruled that the citys Board of Health appointed by the mayor had overreached in trying to restrict the sale of large sugary drinks in places like movie theaters and stadiums It may be up to the next mayor to decide whether to pursue the idea Some restaurant owners have objected to letter grades rating their sanitary conditions complaining that the system has been accompanied by overly aggressive inspectors And the effort to curb teenage pregnancy by distributing morningafter pills in some public schools and letting parents opt out has been criticized by those who think the city should require direct parental consent The New York Times asked the leading candidates in contested mayoral primaries three questions about public health The description of their positions is drawn from their responses and previous statements Would you pursue the ban on large sugary sodas Â Bill de Blasio D said he believed that Mayor Michael R Bloomberg was right on this issue and he has been consistent in his support Considering that so far the courts have struck down the Bloomberg plan it remains uncertain whether even a Mayor de Blasio would be able to engineer a viable equivalent Â John C Liu D has taken a stand against the mayors insistence that banning large sugary sodas is the way to curb the obesity epidemic Siding with those who say it would reduce consumer choice he said simply that he would not pursue the limits on large sugary drinks which are now tied up in the courts Â Christine C Quinn D has always been cool to this idea saying it would be punitive and not necessarily effective She remained consistent saying she would not pursue the ban Â William C Thompson Jr D has in the past suggested that the limits on sugary drinks would hurt small businesses In answer to the question he derided it as a BandAid solution to the problem of obesity He said he would focus on public education campaigns for students and parents He also proposed to expand tax credits to make it easier for supermarkets to operate in poor neighborhoods Â Anthony D Weiner D waved off the mayors soda proposal as not a priority The candidate who has proposed a singlepayer system of health insurance in New York essentially deflected the question and returned to his own agenda saying I am less concerned about large sugary drinks than I am about the one million New Yorkers who have no health insurance  As a grocerÂ John A Catsimatidis R is intimately familiar with the soda industry He has editorialized against increasing the number of bottles and cans that can be returned for a deposit In this case he favors public education over a ban He said that he would introduce a mandatory nutrition course in the public schools so that we can teach kids early on to make the right choices Â Joseph J Lhota R takes a libertarian view in saying that he would not pursue the drink limits because the role of government should be to educate not mandate Restaurant owners say health department inspectors have too much power Would you change the system and how  Mr de Blasio the public advocate has been a leader on this issue forcing the city to open its books which showed a spike in violations and fine revenue over three years and arguing that the city inspects and fines businesses outside Manhattan at a disproportionately high rate I will end this de facto inspection quota system that unfairly burdens outerborough businesses he said  On restaurant inspections Mr Liu sympathizes with small businesses suggesting that he would pursue a less punitive approach to violations than the current administration We cannot balance the city budget on the backs of smallbusiness owners he said He also said the city would work with restaurant owners to get their businesses up to satisfactory inspection standards  Ms Quinn did not join some other candidates in accusing the city of generating inspections to fill its treasury The day Mr de Blasio released his report on inspections her office announced that the City Council would pass a bill capping the maximum fines against street vendors at 500 She said she would lower fines for many violations and give warnings instead of fines for all firsttime violations  As city comptroller in 2008 Mr Thompson issued a report attacking the health department for failing to inspect some restaurants and for not ensuring that violations were corrected quickly In answer to this question he said he would make the lettergrading system more transparent Restaurant owners just dont know what they need to do to receive an A he said  Mr Weiner did not discuss whether he thought restaurant inspectors had too much power or whether they had abused the power that they have However he did suggest that he would ease up on restaurant owners saying he would give them the opportunity to remedy minor violations without incurring sanctions  Mr Catsimatidis indicated that he agrees with the notion that there has been a presumed quota of restaurant fines and inspections He promised a fair system but he did not explain how it would work other than by giving restaurant owners more time to appeal violations He suggested he would work with businesses to develop regulations to protect consumer health yet not put an onerous burden on the restaurants  Mr Lhota said that inspections had become too punitive and that restaurant owners should be given a cure period in which they could fix violations and avoid a fine The fine system has grown out of control he said He endorsed regulations as a way to regulate bad behavior but said they had too often been used to balance the citys budget Would you continue to distribute birth control pills and the morningafter pill in city schools  On the issue of whether to offer contraception in the schools Mr de Blasio was unequivocal giving a simple Yes without elaboration He did not address the issue of parental consent which is not now directly required  Mr Liu is supportive of the Bloomberg administrations decision to distribute contraception in some city schools Asked if he would continue it he said Yes without hedging or elaboration  Ms Quinn has made access to abortion and emergency contraception for women a signature issue saying she wanted to make New York as prochoice and prowomen as possible In answer to this question she said she would continue the current policy but did not elaborate  In the debates over distributing condoms in the schools in the 1990s Mr Thompson then a Brooklyn appointee to the Board of Education was on the liberal side He still says he has no objections to distributing birth control in schools  On birth control Mr Weiner proposed to tweak the current policy perhaps influenced by his experience representing Queens In the 1990s parents of schoolchildren in that borough had been among the most vocal in the city in objecting to condom distribution which is now the norm He said that he would continue the policy but that he would do a better job of informing parents that they could opt out  Mr Catsimatidis said he favored contraception in the schools as long as it included a provision for parental notification and consent He stayed away from the question of exactly what he meant by consent a concept which different people interpret in different ways and which the city and the courts have argued is fulfilled by the existing optout provision  Mr Lhota said he believed parents should have a stronger hand in deciding whether their children were able to get birth control  like any form of medication  at school He said birth control should not be distributed without parental knowledge But he did not say he would ban it and did not suggest specific changes to the current policy that would ensure that parents knew when their children were prescribed contraceptives in school
"Reporter Returns to Texas Capitol, Where Fatherâ€™s Voice Still Rings",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/booming/reporter-returns-to-texas-capitol-where-fathers-voice-still-rings.html,A little while ago my bosses asked me to fill in for a colleague by reporting from Austin Tex where the State Legislature was considering one of the toughest abortion bills in the country I was happy to say yes Not only was it a fascinating topic but Austin is also one of my favorite towns Not coincidentally my parents and my daughter and soninlaw live there So it was good to be back in the Lone Star State But what surprised me was how eerie it felt to be walking the halls of the Capitol again I grew up in the building My father AR Schwartz known as Babe was a member of the Legislature between 1955 two years before I was born until 1980 when I was in college and he was swept out of office with the Reagan tide The photos of Dad on the member panels that line the Capitol walls show him at 29 and aging with every twoyear session photo like a timelapse walk down the hallway There are pictures of me and my brothers too as mascots of the Legislature on those same panels a photo of me as a newborn in his 1957 House panel and another in his first Senate panel in 1961 I was even part of Dads political campaigns There is an old ad showing me at age 7 sitting in Dads Senate chair with a little story recalling the moment that I had told Dad I liked the big leather swivel chair and asked him to buy one for me At the time he explained that it was state property But when a wealthy Galvestonian Maco Stewart III challenged Dad for his Senate seat the ad included an invented but more politically effective response This seat is not for sale It must be earned Being in the Capitol wasnt that strange since I visit the building on nearly every trip to Austin showing my children those member panel pictures so many times that they are sick of the nostalgic walks No it was working there that caused my peculiar dj vu The last time I had earned a paycheck under the dome was the summer of 1968 I was 11 years old My job legislative page in the State House of Representatives At the time nepotism rules allowed us to work in the chamber our parents didnt serve in and Dad was in the Senate by then child labor laws apparently did not apply I would be called over to a House members desk in those days before texting and be handed a note with quick instructions Take this to Barbara Jordan I would run across the building to the Senate where Ms Jordan sat along with Dad and others like Charlie Wilson who would later be immortalized in George Criles book Charlie Wilsons War I see him always from those days wearing a leisure suit in a shade of green so bright that my eyes ached just looking at him The sergeantsatarms instructed us never to take the elevators possibly slowing the progress of a member of the Legislature on the way to a vote but to scamper up and down the stairs of the Capitol taking the steps in a rapid cascade of footfalls that almost felt like dancing There were a lot of stairs we pages slept well at night Later the old nepotism rule would be questioned My brothers and I gave the money wed earned back writing checks from our junior bank accounts I was OK with it an early lesson in politics that what is promised and given can be taken away My little brother Tommy was furious though and wrote a letter to go with his check to the secretary of the Senate It said something like I hope you remember this letter Because I will So there I was back in a building that has never seemed anything but majestic to me But there were differences Sure to some extent I am still Babes boy  it was a helpful part of every introduction to a member of the Legislature or staffer But I was coming back to town in a role of my own as someone who had made his own career in his own trade journalism Dads career had been about working from the inside to get things done and being a loud and forceful advocate for his side Watching Dad on the Senate floor was like watching a master of the arts of legislation and stagecraft I got the feeling that if I followed in his footsteps Id suffer in comparison Instead I chose to be more of an outsider trying to make a difference by informing readers but not giving a strong push to any one side Besides as a kid Id watched reporters interview Dad and even sneaked into the press room to visit with them The lawmakers were running the show but the folks who covered them seemed to be having a better time My decision to type for a living didnt initially sit well with Dad He didnt understand in those early days why I would give up not just the potential income of a lawyer but the challenge of that career or even of being a politician He said he loved what he did telling me I learn something new every day It wasnt that he disliked journalists but he didnt know many who could support a family comfortably During the lessthanstellar freelancing stage of my career he gave me a book he had found How You Can Make 20000 a Year Writing Oh how he laughed Now we both understand that learning something new every day is something I wanted too  and found a career that helped me do that Mom and Dad are proud of what I do and where Ive gotten So there I was back in the Capitol and hanging out with the working press again I am older today than Dad was when he left the Senate in 1980 Babe Schwartz is still around though working the sessions at the age of 87 as a lobbyist I could make fun of him for going through the revolving door but I could never come up with anything better than the line he started using after he had brain surgery some years back My doctor said I didnt have enough of my brain to practice law  but it was all right to lobby My week with the Legislature ended in the Senate chamber with a long evening session of speeches noisy demonstrations acrimony and a midnight vote The boy I had been and the middleaged man I am shared a tired moment of wonder at the way life can bring us full circle but on a different path When I left the Senate chamber and headed out of the building I ran down the stairs
How Fragile Is the New Democratic Coalition?,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/03/how-fragile-is-the-new-democratic-coalition/,"Last December Jennifer Duffy an election analyst at the Cook Political Report came up with a particularly tantalizing set of data points the kind that demand further
                                        exploration
                                     In 1988 the Democratic presidential nominee Michael Dukakis carried 26 percent of the nations counties 819 of 3144 on his way to losing the Electoral College 426111 and the popular vote by seven percentage
                                        points In 2012 President Obama won fewer counties 690 but he won the popular vote by four points and the Electoral College in a landslide 332206 The forces behind this shift illuminate the internal realignments taking place within the two major political parties But first lets look at how a candidate could carry 129 fewer counties but come out way ahead
                                        on Election Day
                                         In the simplest terms Democrats started to win populous suburban counties in big states with lots of Electoral College votes beginning
                                        with Bill Clintons first presidential campaign in 1992 at the same time that they began to lose sparsely populated rural counties many of which lie in small states with very few Electoral College votes Take two states as an illustration of this phenomenon small thinly populated West Virginia and populous relatively suburban Pennsylvania In 1988 Dukakis won West Virginias five Electoral College votes 5247 carrying 31 of 55 counties 10 of them with more than 60 percent of the vote In 2012 Obama was crushed in West Virginia by Mitt Romney

                                            choice So in 1976 the average Democratic county had fewer voters than the average Republican county Bishop provided Figure 1 which was constructed by Cushing to show how much the base of the Democratic Party had shifted to densely populated metropolitan areas by 2008 The Big Sort focuses on one of the key factors behind these geographic trends people are increasingly choosing to move into neighborhoods and communities of likeminded people who share their political
                                        views creating what Bishop and Cushing call wayoflife segregation Americans in their view have been sorting themselves over the past three decades into homogeneous communities  not at the regional level or the redstatebluestate level but at the micro level of city and neighborhood Other analysts including Alan Abramowitz a political scientist at Emory have produced evidence of an additional factor encouraging
                                        increased local homogeneity individual voters are becoming more consistently liberal or conservative in their views on a range of issues from abortion to safety net spending to gun rights Over the past threeandahalf decades these mutually reinforcing trends have resulted in a surge in landslide counties meaning counties in which one of the candidates won by 20 points or more a trend
                                        documented by Bishop and Cushing At the time of the 1976 presidential election 268 percent of Americans lived in landslide counties by 2000 that had grown to 453 percent By 2012 the percentage of people
                                        living in landslide counties shot up further still to 52 percent Thats double what it was in 1976 Such fundamental shifts in voting dont occur in a vacuum Following a parallel line of inquiry Ron Lesthaeghe and Lisa Neidert of the University of Michigan Population Studies Center have developed a composite measure
                                        of how far along a state or county has moved toward what they call the Second Demographic Transition which they define as  postponement of marriage greater prevalence of cohabitation and samesex households postponement of parenthood subreplacement fertility and a higher incidence of abortion In many respects the SDT is a measure of the extent to which a county state or metropolitan area has adopted liberal views and behaviors with respect to the sexual revolution and other cultural transformations
                                        of the past half century which are in turn central to the trend toward secularism Lesthaeghe and Neidert ranked geographic areas on the basis of this composite measure and found that some of the strongest correlations were with voting behavior On a countybycounty basis their analysis is illustrated
                                        by the map of the United States in Figure 2 The darker the blue the more advanced the area is into the Second Demographic Transition the darker
                                        the brown the less advanced into the SDT You may recognize the similarities of the map in Figure 2 to Election Day maps from last year In terms of state voting patterns  displayed in Figure 3  Lesthaeghe and Neidert found an unusually high
                                        correlation between the margin of support for the Democratic or Republican presidential candidate vertical axis and the extent to which a states population had moved into the Second Demographic Transition
                                        horizontal axis The location of each state is indicated by a small circle In an Atlantic magazine essay earlier this year Richard Florida of the University of Toronto the author of The Rise of the Creative Class comparedÂ the 2012 voting results                                        in each of the 364 metropolitan areas in the lower 48 states to the percentage of creative class workers in each of the metro areas This creative class is made up of those employed in science
                                        and technology business and management healthcare education and arts culture and entertainment Floridas result shows see Figure 4 that the share of creative class workers is positively correlated with the share of Obama voters 40 and negatively correlated with the share of Romney voters 41 Florida pointed out in the Atlantic piece that  for all of Obamas union endorsements metros with larger shares of bluecollar workers in manufacturing transportation and construction voted for Romney with a correlation of 46 and against Obama 45 Republicans may still be the party of the rich Florida writes but most of the countrys moreaffluent metros lined up squarely in the Obama campÂ He notes that this voting
                                        pattern was identified byÂ Andrew GelmanÂ of Columbia University in Red State Blue State Rich State Poor State                                        Gelman famously found that while rich voters continue to trend Republican rich states trend Democratic As traditional economic divisions in politics have weakened other factors are helping to determine partisan affiliation Lesthaeghe and Neidert have found for example that the higher the nonHispanic white birthrate of a state the stronger its vote in 2004 for Bush Figure 5                                        shows the striking correlation Neidert and Lesthaeghe are looking at voting behavior both as a driver of the contemporary demographic transition and as stemming from it  from the differences that is between states and other localities in
                                        the embrace of new behavioral norms Factors shaping political choices are less tied to classic class distinctions and increasingly related to values conflicts regarding family formation Writing with Johan Surkyn Neidert and Lesthaeghe consider the impact on voters of samesex households cohabiting households births to teenagers births to unmarried women divorce and separation the percentage of
                                        twoparent households fertility postponement fertility decline brought on by contraception and abortion the percentage of women without children in the household rates of early or late marriage the disconnection
                                        between marriage and procreation and so forth These topics both feed and reflect what social scientists call ideational transformation which is emerging from trends                                        toward secularization and the subsequent accentuation of individualistic expressive values as well as from the backlash against such trends Democratic strength is now concentrated in fewer but more heavily populated areas Polarization has intensified as voters in over half the nations counties cast landslide margins for one presidential candidate
                                        or the other These tendencies are intensifying and have spilled over to Congressional elections leading to legislative paralysis Selfperpetuating clusters of the likeminded lead voters and their representatives
                                        away from the center It isnt just that its getting harder to compromise  or that a lack of compromise is what many voters want  but that the topics that divide us are among the most difficult on which to
                                        achieve consensus matters of personal intimacy  not only sex love and children but also freedom and individual autonomy This has not always been the stuff of politics it is now Political commitments areÂ molded by a wideranging array of forces from economic security to the type of job a voter holds to his or her place in a status hierarchy or a community This complexity and the builtin
                                        potential for new fissures means that any political coalition  whether its constructed on the model of a big tent or of a working partnership  is inherently fragile How well equipped is

Albuquerque Becomes Latest Focal Point in Abortion Wars,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/05/us/albuquerque-becomes-latest-focal-point-in-abortion-wars.html,ALBUQUERQUE  At the New Mexico Holocaust and Intolerance Museum three dozen people many of them teenagers arrived last month without warning Wearing Tshirts that said Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust they demanded that the museum include an exhibit on what they called the American genocide of legal abortion and fanned out to scatter cards with pictures of bloody lateterm abortion victims They then moved outside to picket with a banner calling Albuquerque Americas Auschwitz Albuquerque has become the latest flash point in the abortion wars with Operation Rescue the militant group based in Kansas calling it the lateterm abortion capital of the country This is because a private clinic Southwestern Womens Options is one of only a few nationwide that offers abortions after the sixth month of pregnancy A pitched political battle is now under way After failed attempts in the Democraticcontrolled Legislature abortion opponents have collected enough signatures to hold a referendum over whether to make Albuquerque the first city in the country to ban abortions at 20 weeks after conception just as a dozen states have done Abortion rights advocates see an ominous parallel with events in Kansas in recent years Operation Rescue moved its headquarters to Wichita Kan in 2003 and labeled it the lateterm abortion capital to underscore the groups campaign against a clinic there run by Dr George R Tiller In May 2009 a gunman killed Dr Tiller in the foyer of his church Operation Rescue leaders who had denounced violence said they had no connection with the killer The drive for a city referendum has been led here by a couple who trained with Operation Rescue in Kansas and moved here three years ago as antiabortion missionaries We felt called to come and serve in Albuquerque said Tara Shaver 29 She and her husband Bud moved here largely to find a way to shut down Southwestern Womens Options she said Ms Shaver is the spokeswoman for a coalition of Roman Catholic evangelical and other groups pushing the ballot initiative City officials say the proposed 20week ban is expected to be put to voters this fall The Shavers newcomer status and close ties to Operation Rescue which is known for harassment of clinics have become rallying points for abortion rights defenders here The fact that they call themselves missionaries is really offensive said Joan Lamunyon Sanford director of the New Mexico Religious Coalition for Reproductive Choice and a leader of a coalition fighting the 20week proposal We dont need outsiders bringing in this kind of disruption The Shavers arrived in Wichita in 2009 to start a year as Operation Rescue interns living on a stipend from the group to learn its methods of documenting medical lapses at abortion clinics and offering sidewalk counseling to women entering clinics After Dr Tillers murder two of the physicians from his clinic joined the practice of Dr Curtis Boyd at Southwestern Womens Options here in Albuquerque Antiabortion groups believe that this clinic is now performing more lateterm procedures than any other in the country though no data are available The Shavers invited Survivors of the Abortion Holocaust a Californiabased group with close ties to Operation Rescue to hold a training camp in Albuquerque early last month About 30 youths mainly from California came The youths finished their sessions here with a series of aggressive public activities In addition to the protests at the Holocaust museum they marched outside the home of a universitybased doctor who teaches abortion methods and at a birthing center he advises They passed out fliers with photographs of three doctors from the Southwestern clinic labeling them Killers Among Us Some here are fighting backOperation Rescue Terror Tactics Not Welcome in ABQ read one banner at a rally held by abortion rights supporters late last month Outofstate interests have come to try to impress their beliefs on New Mexicans Diane Denish a former lieutenant governor and Democratic candidate for governor in 2010 told the crowd of 250 Mr Shaver 34 defended the activism by outsiders Patients are drawn to the Albuquerque clinic from other states he said and it was the national implications of lateterm abortions in New Mexico that brought us here A certain amount of social tension is necessary to cause change he said citing the methods of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr No polling has yet been done to indicate whether the proposed 20week ban would pass Albuquerque has traditionally been Democratic but has turned to the right in the last few years electing a Republican mayor and a conservative City Council and evangelicals have joined Catholics in opposing abortion Courts have blocked such bans as unconstitutional in three states and the American Civil Liberties Union has already said that if the Albuquerque ban passes it will quickly file a lawsuit Dr Boyd and other officials of Southwestern Womens Options did not respond to requests for comment On a recent morning a dozen or so abortion opponents stood outside the clinic with signs evoking supportive honks from a few passing cars Over two hours about a dozen women some visibly pregnant some with outofstate license plates arrived at the clinic to start what in the later months of a pregnancy can be a two or threeday procedure While some protesters waved pictures of bloody fetuses others called out Wed like to help you and This is not a safe place Some Jewish leaders here are still angry about the Holocaust comparisons and picketing of the museum which continued over three days This protest was misguided and offensive said Randee B Kaiser chairwoman of the museums board But Kristina Garza 26 a leader of the California group said that she considered the museum action a success forcing Albuquerque residents to learn more about abortion practices in their city Her group travels the country visiting high schools and colleges to enlist new abortion opponents Its quite possible well return to Albuquerque this fall she said She did not rule out further aggressive protests at the museum or elsewhere To deny recognition of our generations holocaust is discrimination Ms Garza said
Australiaâ€™s Premier Faces Bleak Predictions on Eve of Elections,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/world/asia/australias-prime-minister-facing-election-drops-in-poll.html,SYDNEY Australia  Prime Minister Kevin Rudd who emerged triumphantly from the political wilderness to regain Australias leadership this year is battling widespread predictions of a defeat in federal elections on Saturday that would bring an end to his partys tumultuous six years in power The contest pits Mr Rudd of the Labor Party against Tony Abbott the leader of the conservative opposition LiberalNational coalition Mr Rudd who served as prime minister from 2007 to 2010 returned to the leadership in June after a nearly twoyear campaign by his supporters culminated in a party coup that dispatched the countrys first female prime minister Julia Gillard But the Labor Party which dumped Ms Gillard in the hopes of averting a landslide loss that would devastate its ranks in Parliament has struggled to shake an image that it is more focused on personal feuds than on pressing issues like the slowing of Australias miningdriven economy and the record number of asylum seekers trying to reach the country in dangerous and overcrowded boats Although Mr Rudds return led to a bounce in support for Labor which has led a minority government since its poor showing in the last federal elections in 2010 polls indicate that surge has now evaporated And in a remarkable reversal for Mr Rudd a man once considered Australias most popular politician analysts say the question is not whether the Labor Party will lose but by how much and whether he may be among the casualties Mr Rudd is facing a tough fight for his own seat in Parliament In a survey released on Monday by Newspoll based on polling from Aug 30 to Sept 1 among about 1110 voters Mr Abbott was shown for the first time to have overtaken Mr Rudd as the nations preferred prime minister by 43 percent to 41 percent although the difference between them is within the polls margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points The same poll showed Labor trailing the opposition coalition 54 percent to 46 percent That result would prove disastrous for Mr Rudd and deliver a resounding majority in Parliament for Mr Abbott Maybe our Lord will materialize and touch the forehead of Kevin Rudd and anoint him his chosen representative on earth said Rick Kuhn a professor of politics at Australian National University in Canberra But short of that I dont think its going to happen Saturdays election will end the longest campaign season in modern Australian history The contest although officially declared by Mr Rudd last month has effectively been under way since January when Ms Gillard announced unusually early that the vote would be held in September That opened an acrimonious ninemonth political slog during which Ms Gillards popularity and support within her own party collapsed Mr Rudd came back into office promising a kinder gentler brand of politics in place of the adversarial relationship between Ms Gillard and Mr Abbott Indeed Mr Abbott is perhaps best known outside Australia for a blistering speech Ms Gillard delivered in Parliament last year in which she called him a misogynist and a sexist with repulsive double standards A former Roman Catholic seminarian with socially conservative stances on abortion and gay marriage Mr Abbott is closer ideologically to the American Republican Party than to European conservatives like Prime Minister David Camerons Tories in Britain  He has made the repeal of a carbontrading plan passed by Ms Gillard the centerpiece of his campaign and as recently as 2009 he denied the existence of climate change caused by humans Opinion polls show that Australians overwhelmingly support both abortion rights and legalizing samesex marriage and accept the majority scientific opinion that human activity has contributed to climate change  Owing at least in part to his conservative views and because he is not known as a naturally gifted speaker Mr Abbott has struggled to connect with voters Still Mr Abbotts hardnosed political skills have allowed him to capitalize on the perception that Labor has lost its way as a party said John Wanna a political science professor at Australian National University I think one of the big messages from this time when we look back in history will be that Labor spent four years tearing itself apart and I think the electorate has gotten tired of that Mr Wanna said Despite Mr Rudds stated intention of running a positive campaign focused on the issues this election cycle has stood out for the level of negativity deployed not just by the rival political parties but also by the news media Mr Rudd in particular has come in for unusually pointed criticism from publications owned by Rupert Murdochs News Corporation  Last month The Daily Telegraph Mr Murdochs tabloid in Sydney ran a series of antiRudd editorials on its front page including one in which he was depicted as Colonel Klink from the 196571 American television comedy series Hogans Heroes wearing a Nazi uniform and a monocle On Thursday Clive Palmer a mining magnate who founded his own centerright party that is likely to peel away some votes from the opposition coalition said he would sue Mr Murdoch over a frontpage article in his flagship national paper The Australian The article in question called Mr Palmer a buffoon and said he posed a threat to democracy Its time this fellow was brought to account this foreigner who tries to dictate what we do Mr Palmer said in an interview with Channel 7 TV Mr Murdoch isÂ a native of Australia who holds AmericanÂ citizenship

trophy boyfriend But then McMillans husband told her he had been gay all along disappointing all those ladies who realized their boytoy dreams were a colossal cosmic joke McMillan shredded him to pieces with her eyeballs on Oprah and sued him for 40 million In Who Asked You  and yes the title is alarmingly accusatory  the apparently altogether fictional Betty Jean is a family matriarch who works room service at a hotel When her drugaddict daughter Trinetta skips town Betty Jean is left in charge of Trinettas two sons from two different fathers At the same time shes supporting her own dying husband whos being sexually abused by his day nurse Betty Jeans son Quentin is on his fourth or fifth wife all of them white Not that I care Betty Jean says her son Dexter is in prison and her

Portland detective Archie Sheridan who throughout has been tormented by the serial murderer Gretchen Lowell known as the Beauty Killer Early in the series Gretchen beguiled Archie destroyed his marriage and then just for fun removed his spleen and hammered nails into his chest while honing her reputation as a psychopathically savage butcher In one instance she decapitated a librarian left the body in a car and returned the head to the library a week later with a note apologizing that it was overdue Portland serves somewhat anachronistically as the hipster backdrop to these grisly killings and Cain faithfully goes through the crimelit checklist the informant the detective with his alltoohuman foibles the helpful strippers In Let Me Go the spleenfree Archie is dutifully attempting to resist the lingering psychic thrall of his sexy nemesis who has escaped from a local mental hospital kick a painkiller addiction and solve a new set of murders inevitably pinned on

of Coventry a nude protest against the high taxes her husband imposed on the people of the town The actual Lady Godiva one of only a few female landowners in the period before the Norman Conquest is an intriguing historical figure But in this mawkish telling she comes off like a scheming chortling Samantha from Sex and the City When Godiva attempts to seduce a young paramour the exchange is painful He smiled You are deft of words I am deft of tongue she corrected promisingly Shall I prove it And she grinned at him Gallands description of the ride is convincing her Godiva employs a calm dignity against masculine power to great effect But these passages  and some fleeting attempts at seriousness as in brief considerations of the basic similarities between Christianity and paganism  arent enough to rescue Godiva from selfsatire After reading the novel you may well feel youve witnessed a piece of medieval high camp or spent the weekend at a Renaissance Faire trying to escape the pawing hands of a sweaty sexually voracious jouster MY NOTORIOUS LIFEBy Kate ManningScribner 2699 Mannings novel is based on the life of Ann Lohman a New York midwife who practiced abortions in the 19th century under the sobriquet Madame Restell and whose profession and subsequent wealth turned her into a tabloid villain Lohman was jailed numerous times and eventually served a year in prison It was thought she escaped a more extreme sentence by threatening to reveal the names of her clients  the wives lovers and daughters of some of the citys most influential citizens Later entrapped by the Christian crusader Anthony Comstock she faced a much harsher sentence and killed herself by slitting her throat In My Notorious Life which is cast as a memoir Axie Muldoon a poor child of Irish immigrants becomes apprenticed to a midwife and learns how to deliver babies  and later as a midwife in her own right also to prevent their births Unlike the real Lohman Axie now known as Madame DeBeausacq seizes an opportunity to flee the country and leave her troubles  if not her anger  behind Despite being overdone in places this is a valiant effort its historical setting and language densely and effectively styled Manning is best when writing about the wretched squalor of 19thcentury urban childhood and the orphan trains that transported children from city streets to willing foster homes across the country In places you can even squint and pretend youre reading Angelas Ashes
"Poised to Enter a Convent, Then She Fell in Love",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/booming/poised-to-enter-a-convent-then-she-fell-in-love.html, Boomings Making It Last column profiles baby boomer couples who have been together 25 years or more Send us your story and photos through our submission form Bob and Carol Kelly met in Durham NC where Bob worked for the Environmental Protection Agency and Carol was doing a medical residency at Duke Today they live in Ardsley NY and have been married 31 years Bob continues to work for the EPA as an air pollution meteorologist while Carol is a geriatric care physician The couple have three adult children An edited and condensed version of our conversation follows How did you meet Carol I was a secondyear medical resident We were in the same Catholic Young Adults Group and connected at a conference we attended to represent our parish Bob She ended up getting in an intense conversation with another member who was conflicted about becoming a priest or a doctor and stood me up Bob We had dinner many times at her house and would just talk and talk There were things she would say that spoke to me things that I was listening for in my life some religious some not Carol The residency program was 43 people and 3 were women so a lot of my social life was with men I considered myself one of the guys I didnt realize until a mutual friend told me that Bob seemed to have a different perception of our relationship There was something he didnt know Carol I was planning on entering the convent When our friend told me that Bob thought we were dating it led to a conversation and Bob told me that he was pretty certain that I had a different call to vocation Bob I told her that maybe she had been praying and maybe the answer was me Our relationship got a lot more serious after that Pretty bold Bob She was shocked but it opened up deeper conversations about what she wanted Carol I finally opened my eyes I came to understand why every time I had almost gone into the convent something came up I have lived out my service differently than I had envisioned through my job as a physician first in the Bronx and now in geriatric care What about your parents reaction Carol Confused I was 27 so a child I was not But I had been thinking of entering the religious community since I was 15 and my father had strongly objected It had to do with what he perceived as the secondclass citizen status of nuns And from early on my faith community felt that it was not good to go against my familys wishes so I postponed Then right at the time my parents were beginning to accept it we announced we were going to be engaged The appearance of our first child a year after our wedding made things easier Bob It wasnt because they didnt like me they just didnt understand When I asked for her hand he just said Go ahead That was it And parenthood Bob Fun We talked out the options about child care but when our first was born we didnt want that so I stayed home I worked it out so that I went in just one day a week But after eight months they were going to give my job away so I went back Carol I was in the National Health Service Corps but when my service was completed I worked part time and worked less than most physicians I was committed to having more time with the children and all of us being together in the evenings Did you agree on child rearing What about imparting Catholic values Carol Some of our tough times related to our responsibility to the children and we were also caring for my mother who had dementia In every relationship there will be an enforcer and the parent who they think they can get away with things There were times when I felt a lot of stress about being the enforcer Bob I fell into the old masculine mindset of child rearing that the house and kids were Carols responsibility I was inattentive It is tough raising kids when you are working full time Carol We passed on to the kids that service is very important and Im proud that they are very community minded I think that is the biggest thing we have instilled Bob Catholicism for us has been a unifying force We were involved in our local parish but we would drive to the next parish over because it was more ethnically diverse which was important for our kids You mention some tough times Bob We had counseling and talked about my stepping up in the household so she did not feel she was doing it alone It went back to communication I would let things build and there were times when we did not have time alone to talk because her mother was always home and that was disruptive There is a time that stands out when Carol asked me to join her for lunch at a local deli and she laid out what she needed for me to do in the household She took the initiative and I had to start taking action instead of saying I would It doesnt mean everything gets better Every day I try to listen more to what she is saying The problem was I wanted applause for the helping Now I make her lunch every day Carol Times were hard before I became assertive enough to say You need to do some of this I conceded that we needed some housekeeping help as well which made things more workable Our friends also helped to nudge us together and encourage us to spend more time together when things got really stressful It was a lot of support from religious convictions friends and family Did you ever consider splitting Bob There is the saying divorce no but murder yes I dont think we ever got to that stage but at times we wondered if we would make it It was harder for her because she was busier I had time to myself on my commute and could vent to people at work and friends I studied astronomy with and she didnt have that as much Carol I dont think it was ever a serious consideration There were periods when the entire focus was our children and trying to continue my job instead of being a couple dark times when Bob was at the bottom of the list At times I thought it would not be as close as it once was but good times came again Are there aspects of Catholicism that you do not agree with Issues like birth control abortion and female priests Carol I see the limitations of the church but I still find in the church what is central to who I am In the 1970s and 80s those of us who remained in the church did so because we envisioned that the way the church was going to change was by those of us who disagreed refusing to leave I disagree with the church on artificial birth control I believe that family planning is a decision of conscience But I am very prolife Women in the priesthood is a pretty closed topic but I would like to see women ordained to diaconate Bob I would like to see a lot more openness to the involvement of women I always say we are fighting the devil with one hand tied behind our back Half our population cant be priests men cannot have all the experiences God did not make us that way I think that the church could rethink family planning We were fortunate and followed church teachings but it can be very hard Look I am a scientist but I have faith that Jesus is physically present in the body and blood There is no science to that but I believe Are there aspects of Catholicism you disagree on Bob That is tough When we started out I felt that Carol was much more liberal and shes become much more conservative We have both always been prolife but there are degrees of compulsiveness about it Ultimately I believe it is the womans choice whether she can take good care of this human life Carol became more absolutist about it contraception as well Before marriage she was more open to it and after we were married she was not where I would have been But I think a main difference is she is more spiritual and I am more political A lot of people feel that if you marry in the same religion it will be the same but there are many differences Carol Our major disagreement is that he is still very interested in the politics of the church He participates in the discussions about global changes in the church and he is more emotionally invested in getting the church to change like the role of women for example I think these things will happen in their own time and he wants to make them happen now I believe in those things its just not where I choose to direct my energies I see my role as being in service to the church What do you think has made your marriage last Carol Communication and commitment Its having no doubt that the marriage is a valuable thing and you need to keep perspective that this is worth doing And over the years its my trying to be less uptight and him trying to be more focused Bob Its about finding what keeps the other person coming back to you finding what they feel is important whether its the physical intellectual shared pride in our children I never take Carol for granted What do you admire about each other Carol Bob is filled with wonder for the world He loves astronomy and meteorology and has a vision of beauty and nature in an almost childlike sense and is intensely curious He is an incredibly gentle soul It makes him a pushover with the kids on occasion

"Bristling Republican Rivals Discuss Issues, and Kittens, at Debate",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/09/nyregion/at-debate-bristling-republican-rivals-discuss-issues-and-kittens.html,Joseph J Lhota and John A Catsimatidis made their final pitch to Republican voters on Sunday clashing at a debate on WNBCTV in which Mr Lhota sought to leave the impression Mr Catsimatidis was not a serious candidate and Mr Catsimatidis argued that Mr Lhota was a meanspirited technocrat who lacked big ideas  At the end of an increasingly bitter and attackfilled campaign their frustration with each other oozed through the television screen Mr Lhota and Mr Catsimatidis made clear that they are two very different men even if they generally agree on issues like taxation and policing  Mr Catsimatidis a loquacious billionaire who wants to build monorails and bring back the Worlds Fair eagerly and sometimes awkwardly lobbed attacks about subjects as varied as marijuana legalization and subsidies to the New York Yankees Mr Lhota a buttonedup former city budget director and deputy to Mayor Rudolph W Giuliani often looked annoyed or even incredulous I wish John would listen to me Mr Lhota lamented at one point telling him later You have got to start telling the truth I always tell the truth Mr Catsimatidis stated You think you do Mr Lhota responded He later told reporters I think if John says something to himself three times it becomes the truth all evidence to the contrary Only about 50000 Republicans are expected to vote in Tuesdays primary and polling has been minimal making the race hard to predict Mr Lhota who most recently worked as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority is favored by many to win but he has been outspent by Mr Catsimatidis who is selffinancing his campaign  Mr Catsimatidis has been relentless in attacking Mr Lhota with television commercials and mailings and he ventured into provocative territory in the debate criticizing Mr Lhota for communication problems among first responders on Sept 11 and the citys decision to locate its emergency operations headquarters at the World Trade Center Mr Lhota said he got the City of New York back up and running after the terrorist attacks and responded firmly when he was questioned on the subject  I stand by everything I have ever done he said Mr Lhota criticized Mr Catsimatidis for campaign contributions two decades ago to Mayor David N Dinkins a Democrat whom Mr Giuliani defeated in 1993 Mr Catsimatidis responded by noting that Mr Giulianis 2008 presidential campaign still owed him money 210000 according to his campaign for using his 727 as a campaign plane Mr Catsimatidis is known for his candor and streamofconsciousness campaigning and was asked to elaborate on his comment in the last televised debate that if his son were stopped and frisked by the police he would ask him if he had been dressed funny Well you know if he had his pants half down with his underwear showing if he had his hat turned backwards Mr Catsimatidis said He later insisted that he had a love factor with the minorities adding They all give me hugs The backandforth offered reminders of how different Mr Lhota and Mr Catsimatidis are from many Republican officeholders across the country Mr Lhota described himself as a Brooklyn Republican who supports samesex marriage and abortion rights but he said that although he supports legalizing marijuana he would not lobby the State Legislature to take that step  Mr Catsimatidis described himself as a Republican with a heart He contrasted himself with Representative Paul D Ryan the Republican vicepresidential nominee last year saying that he unlike Mr Ryan was concerned about people over 65 The candidates split over whether the United States should take military action against Syria Mr Lhota said yes Mr Catsimatidis said no and added Any side that we pick in Syria both sides are against us so why make a move right now Both men professed to love animals after Mr Lhota was questioned about his muchpublicized declaration made after part of the subway system was briefly shut down last month to protect two lost kittens that he would not support stopping transit service for kitten safety  Im not the antikitten candidate Mr Lhota said Sunday adding We have thousands of cats  literally thousands of cats  that are in the subway system every single day day and night scurrying across the tracks and they dont get killed I never said I wanted to kill a cat Mr Lhota insisted Mr Catsimatidis seized the opportunity to differentiate himself saying I love animals I love cats I love dogs He said that Mr Lhotas stance against the kittens reflected his inner emotions Before and after the debate Mr Lhota campaigned with Mr Giuliani who argued that Mr Lhota was best suited to follow in his and Mayor Michael R Bloombergs footsteps Clasping hands with his former deputy Mr Giuliani declared Mr Lhota the citys only hope against what he deemed career Democratic politiciansÂ  It was not long before the topic of 911 came up When I got out of my van and arrived at ground zero the first person I saw was Joe Lhota Mr Giuliani said recalling Mr Lhota as calm I looked in Joe Lhotas eyes Mr Giuliani recalled I saw eyes of steelÂ 
"The Pope Gets on the Line, and Everyone Is Talking",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/world/europe/the-popes-on-the-line-and-everyones-talking.html,ROME  Pope Francis already has distinguished himself from his predecessor with a more downtoearth style Now he is both unnerving the Vatican and delighting the faithful by picking up the telephone and spontaneously calling people earning the nickname the Cold Call Pope This month he called to comfort a pregnant Italian woman whose married boyfriend had unsuccessfully pressured her to have an abortion The woman who is divorced and will be a single mother wrote to the pope fearing she had fallen afoul of the church Not knowing the correct address she marked the envelope Holy Father Pope Francis Vatican City Rome The pope offered to personally baptize the baby when it is born next year according to an account in La Stampa a newspaper in Turin In August Francis phoned a woman in Argentina who had been raped by a police officer The pope told her that she was not alone and that she should have faith in the justice system according to an Argentine television news report rebroadcast in Italy On Aug 7 Michele Ferri of Pesaro Italy answered his phone and was startled to hear Hello Michele its Pope Francis Mr Ferri said in a telephone interview he had thought it was a joke But then he spoke about the letter that Id written a letter I hadnt told anyone about not even my mother or my wife and I knew that it was him he said Mr Ferri had written the pope he said after a series of tragedies in the family most recently the killing of his brother in a gas station robbery in early June The pope said that the letter had made him cry he said The 10minute phone call offered comfort and hope to better face life without my brother he said Of course the pain remains but it was a great emotion to hear his voice Later in August Mr Ferri said the pope also called his mother to offer words of support While the papal phoning has been widely greeted with delight it is also proving somewhat perilous with unsubstantiated news reports of calls supposedly made by Francis  including one last week to President Bashar alAssad of Syria and another to a young distraught French gay man The Vatican denied that the pope had made those calls Some Vatican officials are expressing concern that individuals are impersonating Francis to advance political or ideological agendas Other Vatican analysts fear that the advent of papal phone calls could spawn disillusion among those not receiving a call Theres an innumerable number of people who have suffered violence or injustice who might write to the pope for a word of comfort and its clear that he cant answer all of them said Alberto Melloni a Vatican historian and the director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna a liberal Catholic research institute They could think See Im feeling awful and the pope didnt even call  On Thursday the Argentine newspaper Clarn reported that Francis had spoken by phone with Mr Assad in an effort to prevent a military confrontation with the United States The Vaticans spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi emphatically denied the report Then on Friday Mr Lombardi denied newspaper reports in France that the pope had called a young Catholic gay man in Toulouse to reassure him The man Christopher Trutino a 25yearold salesclerk had told a local paper La Dpche du Midi that after he wrote a letter to the pope explaining his struggles to reconcile his sexuality and faith Francis phoned him to counsel him Your homosexuality it doesnt matter he recalled the pope saying One way or another we are all children of God Some on Twitter and elsewhere on the Internet greeted reports of the call as a welcome change in the doctrinal rigidity of the church on the issue of homosexuality But the Vaticans denial of the reports fanned speculation that the call had been a hoax while also prompting some to question whether the Vatican was dissembling to distance itself from a delicate topic Mr Trutino is avoiding the media and could not be reached for comment on Monday But Cyril Doumergue the journalist from La Dpche du Midi who interviewed him said he had sounded authentic and genuinely moved But he said he believed Mr Trutino may have been deceived He said the young man told the newspaper that during the call  which he said began at 2 pm  the pope explained that he would later be receiving King Abdullah II of Jordan But Ansa the Italian news agency said the king arrived at 11 am and the meeting was over by 1206 pm Christopher did not record the conversation so it is impossible to know 100 percent what happened Mr Doumergue said Father Lombardi said that it was the popes prerogative to phone whomever he chose and that the Vatican would not comment on every reported phone call But he said he would intervene when rumors or hoax calls dealt with issues of international relevance like Syria or could have important doctrinal implications 
Recall Fights in Colorado Grow Fiercer in Last Days,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/10/us/recall-fights-in-colorado-grow-fiercer-in-last-days.html,PUEBLO Colo  At first Angela Giron was surprised to find herself in the cross hairs of a campaign to recall Colorado lawmakers who had supported a slate of new guncontrol laws She had won her State Senate seat by a 10point margin Her Southern Colorado district is heavily Hispanic and reliably Democratic hardly ideal terrain to oust a lawmaker with Mexican roots whose mother once worked picking beans I thought what the heck Ms Giron said Why would they do that  But over the summer Ms Giron found herself at the center of a citizenled recall campaign heavily financed by the National Rifle Association and other conservative groups and Second Amendment advocates who have spent hundreds of thousands of dollars on advertisements and mailings to oust herÂ  and a fellow Democrat John Morse the president of the Colorado Senate In her fight Ms Giron has found support among liberal groups and unions across the state as well as guncontrol supporters with deep pockets like Mayor Michael R Bloomberg of New York who contributed 350000 to fight the recall campaigns Emilys List which supports Democratic women who favor abortion rights and New Yorks junior Democratic senator Kirsten E Gillibrand have also sent fundraising emails urging their supporters to help Ms Giron The campaigns have grown from a novelty into the central political battle here in Colorado Fiercely fought and heavily financed by outside groups they are widely seen as referendums on whether swingstate Democrats can survive the populist reaction after supporting gun restrictions  On Tuesday constituents in this struggling old steel town will go to the polls to decide whether Ms Giron should be ejected from office before her term is up A former police official George Rivera will be on the ballot as her potential Republican replacement Mr Morse too will face a recall vote in his Colorado Springs district about 45 miles to the north But even as national interest crested Ms Giron and Mr Morse have tried to focus on local issues In a race dominated by guns Ms Giron has promoted her support for laws on juvenile offenders and overtime pay and how she helped secure money for a new academic building at the Pueblo campus of Colorado State University As the race barreled into its final days the two Democrats and their opponents stepped up what has become an allout fight for every vote in the two Senate districts which have less than 200000 registered voters On Sunday 80 volunteers gathered inside a union hall in Pueblo for their marching orders Find supporters and get them to the polls After thanking everyone Ms Giron clipboard in hand set out for another day of knocking on doors and rallying support Im a fast walker she said as she headed out through a workingclass neighborhood under a sweltering morning sun But it was slow Most people it seemed were either at church or still asleep so Ms Giron scrawled her hellos onto glossy leaflets and wedged them into doorways One man responded to her knocks by shouting I already voted from his living room Ms Giron thanked him and moved on She guessed she has knocked on about 4000 doors this summer defending her pivotal support for new laws that require background checks on private gun sales and limit ammunition magazines to 15 rounds She recalled one voter who approached her and yelled Angela Im so mad at you I cant sell my guns at the garage sale I thought well thats a good thing she said Ms Giron had never fired a gun before this winter when Colorados Democraticcontrolled legislature began an emotional and divisive effort to pass the states first new guncontrol laws in more than a decade Despite almost unanimous opposition from Republicans Democrats pushed ahead with the bills calling them a moderate sensible response to mass shootings at an Aurora Colo movie theater and at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Connecticut As the debate raged and progun billboards popped up in her district Ms Giron held several overflowing town hall meetings She went to a target range with a womens club and shot off a few rounds She spent weekends sifting through emails When she went outside to water her garden or buy groceries she said people would approach her to talk about the gun laws It was a lot of pressure she said this spring People all over the country were looking at us Ultimately she decided to vote for the gun laws though at the last minute she reversed course and withdrew her support for a bill that would have restricted concealed weapons on college campuses Her votes infuriated conservatives and Second Amendment advocates around Pueblo They said Ms Giron had sold herself to voters as a moderate Democrat with rural values when she was first elected in 2010 and they felt betrayed by her stance on gun control After the laws were signed Victor Head a plumber borrowed 4000 from his grandmother and started gathering signatures to put Ms Girons name on the ballot for a special recall election He said he was taken aback by the flood of attention and cash I didnt realize the implications it would have Mr Head said In Pueblo more than 23000 people have voted early but gun control was not always the driving factor behind their decision Several people interviewed Sunday said they were just dedicated liberals or conservatives voting along party lines Some said that they disagreed with Ms Girons gun votes but that they were even more against an expensive special election to recall her But Jim Nunn and his wife both supporters of the recall relished the chance to replace Ms Giron with a candidate with more conservative social and economic views It gives us a chance to voice our opinions a little louder Mr Nunn said If wed have waited people would have forgotten

"In Quinnâ€™s Loss, Questions About Role of Gender and Sexuality",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/nyregion/in-quinns-loss-questions-about-role-of-gender-and-sexuality.html,In July two dozen accomplished women  bankers law firm partners and technology executives  sat Christine C Quinn down in a conference room in the Met Life building for some honest talk about her quest to become New Yorks first female mayor They were getting worried they told her as they watched her slip in the polls and struggle to respond to attacks The participants including Mary Ann Tighe the real estate executive and Diana L Taylor girlfriend of the current mayor warned Ms Quinn that a woman seeking power always faced perils and that the very qualities that had brought her this far  drive ambition toughness  could make her unlikable to many But Ms Quinn was not interested in talking about that I dont get up in the morning thinking about how Ill approach this as a woman or a lesbian I think about the issues she said according to an organizer of the session Afterward a few of the women privately concluded that Ms Quinn just did not get it She needs a voice coach one said and a less nave attitude about the magnitude of the gender challenge she faced Ms Quinns resistance to the conversation says a lot about her She can be unbending and determined and she wanted her campaign to be focused on her competence and accomplishments not her gender But her fall from frontrunner status to a distant third place finish in the Democratic primary is now stirring intense debate about whether her femaleness or her homosexuality played any role in her struggle to win over voters Exit polls showed no gender gap in the results and indicated that Ms Quinn lost for a number of reasons  her close association with the plutocratic incumbent mayor her rivals ability to outmaneuver her on the issue of stopandfrisk policing and her inability to be a change candidate in an election in which voters sought new direction Still her supporters wonder Why has New York home of tough talented women like Eleanor Roosevelt and Anna Wintour proven resistant to female candidates And was it simply too much to expect the electorate to embrace a candidate who would be not just New Yorks first female mayor but its first openly gay one too In interviews with allies and opponents as well as members of the Quinn campaign team not one person blamed her loss wholly or even mostly on gender But many of them also said that watching her candidacy was like seeing scenes from a depressingly familiar movie  a bad local remake of Clinton 2008 Democratic voters who expressed unfavorable views of Ms Quinn in New York TimesSiena College polls described her in followup interviews as ambitious petty mean bossy selfinterested defensive combative and argumentative She was the target of an unusual level of visceral hatred including a band of protesters who screamed at her on the street and interrupted her events Men and some women regularly called her voice grating Nice lady but if I have to listen to that voice for four years Ill die John A Catsimatidis a Republican candidate said Sometimes voters said flatly that they did not like her because she is a lesbian Others had difficulty articulating why they were put off by her I dont really like her said Scott Smith 49 who lives in Park Slope Brooklyn and works in construction adding that she seemed too masculine I guess not enough feminine Critiques of Ms Quinns physical attributes came from many corners even the wealthy Upper East Side women who helped raise money for her mayoral bid Why cant she dress better they would ask Rachel Lavine a Democratic state committeewoman who was on Ms Quinns finance committee I might think that St John is not the end all and be all of fashion Ms Lavine said referring to the upscale clothing line favored by wealthy older women But thats what theyre saying Why isnt she wearing a size two St Johns dress Theres that kind of constant commentary Referring to Ms Quinns rival Bill de Blasio she said You dont hear that about de Blasio  Why cant he buy betterlooking suitsÂ  Ms Lavine said that on the occasions that she had tried to engage Ms Quinns most strident opponents the conversation often devolved into insults about Ms Quinns appearance She said they would call her ugly or fat or that her red hair made her look like a clown Ms Quinn never blamed her problems during the race on sexism or homophobia Still her inner circle debated how to grapple with the question of gender Some supporters wanted a more direct appeal to female voters early on and Emilys List the influential national political action committee that backs Democratic women endorsed her in January hoping it would generate excitement among women But her advisers preferred to play down a genderspecific message as she emphasized her ability to get things done In fact Ms Quinn seldom raised her gender until the final stretch of the primary when she was clearly behind making her pitch seem more desperate The lastminute plea clearly did not work In perhaps the most painful twist for the candidate Democratic women rejected her voting for Mr de Blasio instead by more than two to one according to exit poll results from Edison Research There is a perception that women will support women and thats just not necessarily true said Wendy Greuel who lost a brutal race for the mayor in Los Angeles earlier this year and is friendly with Mr de Blasio from their days in the Clinton administration You cannot run a race where you expect people to do that Of the 10 largest cities in the United States only one has a female mayor  Annise D Parker in Houston And as the City Council speaker Ms Quinn is already an outlier the state and city are considered tough terrain for female candidates Some of New Yorks highestprofile elected women have been exceptions Senators Hillary Rodham Clinton who catapulted into the state from the White House and Kirsten E Gillibrand who was first appointed to a vacant seat Democratic party politics dominated by men have been less hospitable for women in New York Ester Fuchs a professor of political science at Columbia said Women are getting into the primaries but theyre not winning she added Part of the problem she said is that contrary to the hopes of Ms Quinn and her campaign aides women almost never vote as a bloc in city races in which issues like abortion figure very little Without a womens vote a gay vote  which never really materialized  or a powerful ethnic affiliation like with Jews or Hispanics she said Ms Quinn was left without a base Shes Irish Ms Fuchs pointed out noting that many Irish voters have left the city That was a bigger problem for her than anything But true to the concerns of the women who met with Ms Quinn in July some allies thought the campaign could have handled the tricky matter of being a woman candidate with more finesse Gloria Steinem said in an interview that Mr de Blasio effectively took over the language of gender in the race with his proposal to expand preschool programs with a tax increase The proposal was widely seen as impractical but politically effective Even though Ms Quinn passed a Council bill to provide paid sick leave she stalled action on the measure for so long that she was widely viewed as an opponent which hurt her credibility as a fighter for women She veered between projecting toughness and vulnerability a memoir in which she discussed her teenage bulimia and battle with alcohol struck many as a plea for sympathy Ms Steinem who endorsed Ms Quinn said that the citys very might makes it more difficult for women to break through Wherever there is more power there is more opposition she said adding If youre tough enough to run New York City youre too tough to be considered acceptably feminine At Ms Quinns postprimary party on Tuesday night at a Chelsea hotel supporters seemed to still be absorbing her fall Young female volunteers in Team Quinn shirts hugged and Liz Abzug daughter of Bella poured out her frustration about how little had changed in the 36 years since her mothers unsuccessful run for mayor After the crowd interrupted Ms Quinn with cries of Youre not done and Governor she delivered her variation on what has now become the standard line for every woman who loses This may not be the outcome you wanted but theres a young girl out there who was inspired by the thought of New Yorks first woman mayor she said She looked upbeat but her wifes eyes were glossy with tears
Recall Vote on Guns ExposesÂ Rift in Coloradoâ€™s Blue Veneer,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/12/us/recall-vote-on-guns-exposes-rift-in-colorados-blue-veneer.html,DENVER  When Colorado passed a series of tough gun restrictions last winter Democrats and gun control advocates hailed it as a sign of changing attitudes in a Western swing state But moments after a pivotal vote in the state Senate a Republican lawmaker named Greg Brophy warned that Colorados independentleaning voters would rebel against the new laws The backlash will be severe he said On Tuesday Democrats here got a taste of that popular anger as voters in a recall election ousted two state senators who had been strong supporters of the gun control laws Although it was a small offyear election the recall campaign grew into a referendum that pitted the National Rifle Association against Mayor Michael R Bloomberg of New York  On Wednesday gun advocates called the result a huge victory that they said would dampen other states efforts to pursue gun restrictions While some voters in the two districts groused about the flood of donations Mr Bloomberg and outside groups made in the recall campaigns analysts in Colorado said the election results were shaped by an eruption of local discontent from voters who say their leaders are ignoring the concerns of gun owners and abandoning Colorados rural libertarian roots After years of gains propelled by shifting demographics and voter attitudes Democrats now control the state legislature and the governors mansion and make up most of Colorados Congressional delegation But state officials said that the recalls showed how Colorados political pendulum could still swing in surprising directions and that deep rifts still lay beneath its increasingly blue veneer This is a state with a wide variety of interests at stake said Bill Ritter a Democrat and former governor The Democratic Party cannot be the party of metro Denver and Boulder It has to be the party who understands the values views and aspirations of people who live outside of those areas In addition to the gun laws Democratic majorities in the legislature passed greenenergy requirements for rural electric cooperatives offered instate college tuition to illegal immigrants who were Colorado high school graduates and expanded mailin voting And Gov John W Hickenlooper a Democrat granted a reprieve to a convicted killer heading off the states first execution in 16 years Republicans opposed many of those acts As they fought for their political lives the two senators facing recall John Morse and Angela Giron described themselves as commonsense Democrats who understood their states values Mr Morse also the state Senate president had been a police chief Ms Giron represented the heavily Hispanic workingclass town of Pueblo which has struggled through years of layoffs at its steel mill They said the new gun laws which include background checks on private gun sales and limits on ammunition magazines were moderate restrictions that made sense in a state scarred by gun massacres at Columbine High School in 1999 and a movie theater in Aurora last year In a state where hunting and shooting have long been part of everyday life Mr Morse and Ms Giron had to make a nuanced case that they supported both gun rights as well as some restrictions But on Tuesday many of their constituents seemed to reject their arguments Mr Morse lost his recall by 343 votes  almost the same margin by which he had eked out reelection in 2010 Ms Girons loss raised far more red flags for Democrats She represented a district where registered Democrats outnumbered Republicans by two to one and she won her seat in 2010 by 10 percentage points But on Tuesday voters lined up against her 56 percent to 44 percent Of the states four Hispanic lawmakers from Pueblo County Ms Giron was the only one to back the most contentious gun legislation said Theresa Trujillo the Southern Colorado director for the Colorado Progressive Coalition She also said that young Latino voters  a likely source of support  were not committed to the election Recall proponents she said were gungho Our opposition was really very effective at establishing this binary that either youre for guns or youre against guns Ms Trujillo said It was a simple message but that sound bite really caught on and sold well We used every tool possible to fight it to try and build the same kind of momentum but it wasnt as effective Dick Wadhams a former state Republican Party chairman said that the districts more conservative Democrats appeared to break with Ms Giron on issues like guns and abortion A decade ago Mr Wadhams said voters bristled at a series of Republican actions that were seen as too socially conservative Now he said new Democratic majorities were beginning to anger independent voters These recalls are a reaction to the overreach of Democrats and their arrogance Mr Wadhams said Cracks are also spreading in Northern Colorado where agriculture and oilandgas development dominate the economy There several counties upset with what they call the leftward drift of Colorados leaders will vote this fall on whether to secede and form their own state A quixotic goal perhaps but analysts said it highlighted the widening urbanrural rift in the West Despite their symbolic heft the recalls will have limited immediate effects Mr Morse and Ms Giron will be replaced by two Republicans who were on the recall ballots Democrats though will still cling to a majority in the state Senate And all of the gun control laws remain on the books On Tuesday 52540 people voted in the two Senate districts  a tiny fraction of Colorados population of more than five million and about 21000 fewer than voted in the two districts in 2010 And it is far from clear whether most Coloradans agree with the results of the recalls A Quinnipiac University poll in August found that voters did not like the special elections even if they did not agree with the legislators Politicians who have flourished here a state where voters are almost evenly divided between Democrats Republicans and those who do not identify with any political party have often had to tack to the center Political analysts say the next real test for Colorados band of Western Democrats will come next year when Mr Hickenlooper and many of the states other lawmakers are up for reelection Mr Hickenlooper who earned high marks from many analysts for guiding the state through the aftermath of Aurora and two brutal summers of wildfires has seen his popularity dip recently The Quinnipiac poll found that only 45 percent of voters said he deserved another term The reason the recalls prevailed is because the Democrats went too far said Mr Brophy the Republican senator Mr Brophy has announced his candidacy for governor joining Tom Tancredo a former congressman in running for the Republican nomination Colorados secretary of state Scott Gessler is

A Formidable Woman,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/books/review/a-formidable-woman.html,To the Editor I am a fan of Judith Newmans and was sorry to see in her review of Alone Together by Teddy Getty Gaston with Digby Diehl Sept 1 her description of Teddy Gettys account of her long struggle to be a good wife and mother as whitewashed Teddy is my mother I am not only a daughter coming to her mothers defense but also someone who wants to set the record straight Teddy has always had a vivid memory It works well now and was pretty extraordinary in 1976 when she wrote the first draft of the book I would have hoped that Newman understood that many of Teddys choices were influenced by her childhood sexual abuse in an era when your never mentioned it because it was always the fault of the victim It caused her to feel less than which also caused her to fall head over heels in love when the most soughtafter man about town told her to put a value on yourself and get a raise Perhaps Newman hasnt taken into account the effect of being called a dirty little Jew at an early age  at the moment when Hitler was making his presence known Its true that J Paul Getty was rumored to be a Nazi sympathizer but Teddy never saw that side of him  after all hed married her a Jew Getty was a mystery to many and in this book there are many pieces of the puzzle Teddy writes about the human side of a man whom people called a monster It was not glorious that her husband loved oil more than he loved her that she was lonely for him and that their son longed for his father It was tragic Teddy faced so much alone and bent contemporary rules of womanhood and wifehood along the way She had an abortion so Paul wouldnt feel trapped into marrying her She always worked she was a prisoner of war and she took a lover This is not a whitewashed account I have read all 300 letters between Teddy and Paul and I believe it You certainly dont have to like the book but theres no need to accuse its author of having an unreliable mind because she is old I wish Newman had read more carefully what is on the page and what is in the heart of a woman who thought so little of herself and hoped too much for a happy ending GIGI GASTONVenice Calif
Womenâ€™s Groups Rally for Immigration Reform,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/13/us/politics/womens-groups-rally-for-immigration-reform.html,WASHINGTON  More than 100 women were arrested on Capitol Hill on Thursday after they blocked a busy intersection to press the House of Representatives to move on immigration legislation in a protest that rallied national womens groups to the cause The 115 women arrested included Terry ONeill president of the National Organization for Women and Linda Meric executive director of 9to5 both womens groups that have not been prominent in pushing Congress for a path to citizenship for millions of immigrants in the country illegally In a choreographed demonstration the women sat in a circle on Independence Avenue disrupting traffic for about 30 minutes then were handcuffed by Capitol police officers and taken away in vans Organizers said 25 immigrants who are in the country without legal papers were among those arrested Last week House leaders said they would probably not take up contentious immigration legislation this fall with lawmakers attention focused on the fastchanging debate over Syria and Republicans at odds over how to deal with a looming Oct 1 debt ceiling deadline and other urgent budget issues The advocates response came quickly with the protesting women saying they were not willing to wait Immigrant groups have been marshaling their forces for a fight on the House floor this fall and leaders warned they could adopt increasingly aggressive tactics if the debate stalls in the House In June the Senate passed a broad immigration bill with a 13year path to citizenship for illegal immigrants  Pramila Jayapal an organizer of the womens protest said immigration groups had learned that they could expand their public appeal by stressing the impact on women and children of deportations which the Obama administration has continued at a fast pace Maria Hernandez 37 an immigrant from Mexico who does not have legal status said she participated in the protest even though she is raising three young daughters in San Francisco Why not Ms Hernandez said before her arrest Im taking the same risk every time I go out of my house every time I take my daughters to school All protesters were given misdemeanor citations with 50 fines and were released by late afternoon organizers said The police brought no criminal charges which could have triggered deportation proceedings against the illegal immigrants  Leaders of the liberal womens organizations said they were embracing immigration in a bid to expand their following among immigrant and Latina women both fastgrowing populations Those groups have been under siege on other fronts with states passing laws restricting abortion or reducing funding for clinics providing birth control and other health services Ms ONeill of NOW said that although she has been active for many years the sitin was her first arrest We need to bring these issues to the fore in the minds of women voters and demand that Congress gets this done this year she said  In recent days some House Republicans revised their predictions suggesting that some immigration bills could be voted on during the fall A memorandum circulated to House Republicans last Friday by Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia the majority leader mentioned immigration as one issue Republicans should expect to address before November although he listed it after other priorities like the budget Syria and efforts to repeal President Obamas health care law The chairman of the House Judiciary Committee Representative Robert W Goodlatte Republican of Virginia still hopes to see votes on immigration bills by the end of October a judiciary aide said Thursday Those votes could be on four bills the committee approved this year including a tough measure to strengthen immigration enforcement Mr Goodlatte and other Republican leaders would insist on passing measures to enhance enforcement and border security before the House could consider any legal status for illegal immigrants the judiciary aide said  We must have enforcement as a prerequisite the aide said But Representative Zoe Lofgren of California a Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said Mr Goodlattes plan would lead to a train wreck Ms Lofgren who addressed a rally before the sitin said the committee bills had no support among Democrats and might not pass even in the House She said Democrats were waiting to see if Speaker John A Boehner of Ohio would clear the way for a debate on a bipartisan bill that she and six other lawmakers have drafted
Assange as Tyrant?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/opinion/sunday/assange-as-tyrant.html,SYDNEY WHEN asked to explain why he was running for a seat in the Australian Senate while holed up in the Ecuadorean Embassy in London Julian Assange quoted Plato One of the penalties for refusing to participate in politics is that you end up being governed by your inferiors Plato was a bit of a fascist he said but had a point Imagine the chagrin Mr Assange must feel now given that not only did he fail to win a place in the Senate in the recent election but he was less successful than Ricky Muir from the Motoring Enthusiasts Party Mr Muir who won just 05 percent of the vote is most famous for having posted a video on YouTube of himself having a kangaroo feces fight with friends Mr Assange who was born and raised in Australia has radically redefined publishing and provoked an unprecedented global debate about state secrets by subverting established practices and common wisdoms It seems odd then that his bid for political power carried out in his absence by the WikiLeaks Party was drowned by the greatest and most conventional of clichs power corrupts His campaign was saddled with the usual backbiting arguing dysfunction and even leaks In theory it should have turned out better for him Australians who have long had a soft spot for irreverent iconoclasts and an abiding suspicion of authority have always been more sympathetic to Mr Assange than Americans have been AÂ 2013Â poll found 58 percent of Australians agreed with the statement the job WikiLeaks does is more of a good thing Â Only 29 percent thought it was more of a bad thing When Mr Assange decided to run for the Senate pollsters estimated he could get as much asÂ 4Â percent of the vote with an outside chance of winning a seat despite the fact that he would be campaigning in absentia The WikiLeaks Party candidates were highly skilled researchers activists and academics Their policies centered on protecting whistleblowers limiting surveillance agencies and ensuring greater transparency But during the campaign after his party imploded with infighting allegations of selling out and a host of resignations Mr Assange was exposed as a politician himself with some of the same moral failings he has been skewering others for A couple of weeks before the election a storm erupted over preference deals where parties that have already achieved the number of votes they need for a Senate seat can arrange to give spare votes to other parties which usually pledge to give theirs in return Preferences are also passed on by parties whoseÂ votes are too lowÂ to get a seat These deals are crucial paths to power for minor parties In leaked emails Mr Assange stressed that preferences were the single most important factor in winning adding Bar a raid on the embassy we will not win without them But WikiLeaks members alleged that Mr Assanges deputies had overridden the partys governing body the national council to allow for preference deals that place rightwing antiabortion or fringe parties  like the Shooters and Fishers Party  ahead of leftist parties like the Greens which had supported WikiLeaks The campaign manager Greg Barns attributed the deals to an administrative error but WikiLeakss national council had agreed to put the Greens first and some directors requested an immediate internal investigation The conflict over those deals and a delayed investigation prompted a highprofile WikiLeaks candidate Leslie Cannold to resign She said the party was not what it claimed to be a democratically run party that both believes in transparency and accountability Ms Cannold an ethicist has not spoken to Mr Assange since This internal corruption revealed him to be no different she said than the politicians he was claiming hed be keeping accountable Mr AssangeÂ put the resignation downÂ to the teething problems of a young party and said he had been distracted by Edward Snowden But several others resigned at the same time including Dan Matthews a founding member and one of Mr Assanges oldest friends Mr Matthews said in aÂ statement that their base evaporated after the deals were made public and that Mr Assange was incapable of working with a group He was an icon but he was his own man Mr Assanges actions were at odds with a democratic party structure He had appointed himself president for example although there was no mention of this role in the WikiLeaks constitution When a reporter asked him why he laughed I founded it I mean seriously this is so fantastic Look at the name this is the WikiLeaks Party The prominent candidate is Julian Assange Who founded it I founded it Are you serious An unbowed Mr Assange has vowed to fight the next election in three years But to woo the 99 percent of the Australian population who spurned him hell need to stop laughing at those who suggest that appointing yourself the unquestioned leader of a party for an unlimited term might make you a politician after all And not exactly a democratic one
"In State Records, Little Evidence to Back Stricter Abortion Law",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/15/us/in-state-records-little-evidence-to-back-stricter-abortion-law.html,In their successful push this summer for strict new regulations on abortion facilities and the doctors performing them proponents said the legislation was needed because conditions at existing facilities made it unsafe for women seeking to terminate pregnancies  But a Texas Tribune review of state inspection records for 36 abortion clinics from the year preceding the lawmakers vote turned up little evidence to suggest that the facilities were putting patients in imminent danger State auditors identified 19 regulatory violations that they said presented a risk to patient safety at six licensed abortion clinics that are not ambulatory surgical centers in Texas None of the violations was severe enough to warrant financial penalties according to the Department of State Health Services which deemed the facilities corrective action plans sufficient to protect patients And between 2008 and 2013 the Texas Medical Board which regulates the states physicians took action against just three who performed abortions  all for administrative infractions that did not involve criminal practices or lateterm abortions The point of this legislation was to make abortion inaccessible said Amy Hagstrom Miller chief executive officer of Whole Womans Health which operates five abortion facilities in Texas It wasnt about safety because there is no safety problem around abortion in Texas Although most of the states recent inspection findings point to administrative errors as opposed to medical ones abortion opponents have not been deterred Beginning Oct 29 Texas will ban all abortions after 20 weeks of gestation and require abortion facilities to have a physician with admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles In a year additional rules will require abortion facilities to meet the structural guidelines for ambulatory surgical centers which include wider hallways and preoperative and postoperative waiting rooms Emily Horne a lobbyist for the antiabortion group Texas Right to Life said the conditions auditors found in the last year could have easily led to women getting sick or injured and a lower standard of care could result if inspectors find these problems and do nothing about them The clinics need to be safer she said You cant advocate for more abortion that is unsafe Among the violations auditors found at the facilities which get surprise inspections annually were expired or unlabeled medicine and instances in which medical staff failed to follow proper infection control procedures In one case auditors found that a sterilization machine was not working properly and that nurses were not trained to recognize the problem On another occasion a bleeding patient was transferred to a hospital in a private car instead of by ambulance Most of the violations auditors found were at the Whole Womans Health facility in Beaumont which took immediate steps to fix the problems and had its correction plan accepted by the state A health department spokeswoman could not say whether those violations were linked to patient complications citing confidentiality rules  But state health officials have not shied away from making Texas abortion facilities pay for their shortcomings In 2010 they levied a 119000 fine against Planned Parenthood Trust of South Texas for failing to acquire licenses for three facilities that began prescribing abortioninducing drugs in 2005 Mara Posada a Planned Parenthood spokeswoman said the organization was under the impression that it did not have to obtain licenses for those facilities because surgical abortions were not performed there  and the organization did have a license for the facility that offered them  The state also levied several smaller fines ranging from 200 to 500 against clinics that failed to post their licensure numbers on their Web sites misreported the age of gestation or failed to return a corrective action plan on time among other violations The fact that most of the states recent inspection findings point to administrative errors as opposed to medical ones has not deterred abortion opponents  One group Operation Rescue has accused a Houston doctor of performing illegal lateterm abortions as recently as 2011 Harris County officials and the Department of State Health Services are investigating those allegations but previous inspection reports have revealed no violations that presented a safety risk  Abortion rights advocates say that even if the investigation uncovers wrongdoing the doctor was operating an ambulatory surgical center that would have met the requirements of the new law They and medical experts argue that the new regulations will lead to the closing of most of the states legal abortion providers resulting in more women seeking dangerous illegal options Since January nine abortion clinics have closed and another facility has stopped performing abortions Two of those that closed were Planned Parenthood clinics that operated until this month state auditors found no violations there in their last inspections Only six of the states remaining 38 abortion facilities currently meet the structural requirements of ambulatory surgical centers and it is unclear how many have a physician with hospital admitting privileges The goal of the bill is to improve patient safety for the woman and the child Ms Horne said Between 2000 and 2010 five women died in Texas from abortionrelated complications the most recent death occurred in 2008 More than 865300 abortions were performed during that period making Texas abortionrelated death rate 058 deaths per 100000 abortions slightly lower than the national abortion death rate of 07 per 100000  Abortion rights advocates say that is 14 times lower than the risk of carrying a pregnancy to term opponents argue that every abortion comes with a terrible cost the death of a fetus  During his research on the impact of Texas 2011 family planning financing cuts Dr Daniel Grossman a principal investigator on the University of Texas at Austins Texas Policy Evaluation Project said he found no evidence that Texas licensed abortion facilities had unsafe conditions The one safety issue he has identified is the practice of selfinduced abortion  women without easy access to abortion clinics trying to terminate pregnancies themselves The university is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune  This additional burden is just going to be too much for some women Dr Grossman said I think its very very likely that abortion selfinduction is going to go up and thats definitely going to be bad for womens health

Complex Science at Issue in Politics of Fetal Pain,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/17/health/complex-science-at-issue-in-politics-of-fetal-pain.html,It is a new frontier of the antiabortion movement laws banning abortion at 20 weeks after conception contending that fetuses can feel pain then Since 2010 a dozen states have enacted them most recently Texas Nationally a bill passed the Republicandominated House of Representatives in June The science of fetal pain is highly complex Most scientists who have expressed views on the issue have said they believe that if fetuses can feel pain the neurological wiring is not in place until later after the time when nearly all abortions occur Several scientists have done research that abortion opponents say shows that fetuses can feel pain at 20 weeks after conception One of those scientists said he believed fetuses could likely feel pain then but he added that he believed the few abortions performed then could be done in ways to avoid pain He and two other scientists said they did not think their work or current evidence provided scientific support for fetalpain laws Some scientists views have evolved as more research has been done Dr Nicholas Fisk a senior maternalfetal medicine specialist at Royal Brisbane and Womens Hospital in Australia said he once considered early fetal pain a major possibility after finding that fetuses receiving blood transfusions produced increased stress hormones and blood flow to the brain and that painkillers lowered those levels But Dr Fisk a former president of the International Fetal Medicine and Surgery Society said neurological research has convinced him that pain is not possible at all before 24 weeks Supporters of fetalpain laws also say that surgeons use of anesthesia and painkillers when operating on fetuses in the womb proves fetuses feel pain If the child who is waiting for surgery can feel pain the child who is waiting for abortion can also feel pain said Mary Spaulding Balch the National Right to Life Committees state policy director who pioneered fetalpain laws She does not advocate performing abortions with anesthesia or painkillers to have a painless death but rather wants those abortions prevented because a member of the human family has reached a point where they are capable of feeling pain But fetal surgeons say that the drugs are given for reasons other than fetal pain Anesthesia is given to the mother reaching the fetus said Dr Scott Adzick a fetal surgeon at Childrens Hospital of Philadelphia Fetuses receive muscle relaxants and narcotics The drugs are given to prevent maternal pain immobilize the fetus relax the uterus and block harmful effects of a fetuss hormonal stress response he said Asked if fetuses would feel pain without these drugs Dr Adzick said he did not know Dr Mark Rosen who pioneered anesthesia in fetal surgery said if fetuses could experience surgeryrelated pain it would be postoperatively because during surgery anesthesia from the mother is so strong Painkillers given to fetuses would prevent postsurgical pain if it exists but the known scientific reason for them is it promotes healing he said The fetus is going to go on and develop and live Fetalpain laws usually prohibit abortions at 20 weeks after conception about 22 weeks gestational age as measured by scientists  from the last menstrual period since conception cannot be pinpointed By far most abortions occur before 24 weeks because the Supreme Court has saidÂ they may be performed until fetuses can be viable outside the womb which doctors say is around 24 weeks So the laws banning abortions about two weeks before the 24week threshold affect very few 985 percent of abortions occur before 21 weeks according to the Guttmacher Institute a research group that supports abortion rights Later cases often involve justdiscovered birth defects Still both sides consider the laws which have been challenged and blocked in Arizona Georgia and Idaho broader efforts to narrow abortion options and build opposition Scientists with varying views of pain development said they did not consider their work applicable to fetalpain laws or the highly charged abortion debate For example one of the main scientists whose work is cited as support for the laws is Dr Kanwaljeet Anand a professor of pediatrics anesthesiology and neurobiology at the University of Tennessees Health Science Center Dr Anand said he considered fetal pain likely at 18 to 24 weeks But he added that the issue of fetal pain does not have much relevance for abortion since most abortions are performed before the fetus is capable of experiencing pain and that for the very few abortions that occur after that time techniques could be used that he believed would prevent pain Because so much about pain is undetermined most scientific discussions eventually run into theoretical territory Much research involves children or adults making implications for fetuses unclear Scientists say characterizing responses as pain is difficult some fetal reactions are simply reflexes or stress hormones Some researchers say painsensing ability depends on consciousness which may itself emerge gradually Theres far more we dont know than we do know said Dr Rosen who in 2005 cowrote an influential analysis of many studies which appeared in the Journal of the American Medical Association It concluded that fetal pain was unlikely before the third trimester which begins at about 27 weeks The report said pain sensation required neural connections into the cortex The cortex begins emerging around the 23rd week is not functionally developed until the 26th or later and continues developing after birth Dr Rosen said In 2010 another large review by a diverse panel appointed by Britains Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists said most neuroscientists believe that the cortex is necessary for pain perception so the fetus cannot experience pain in any sense prior to 24 weeks In 2012 the American Congress of Obstetricians and Gynecologists endorsed this reasoning saying studies cited by fetalpain law supporters were not persuasive when weighed together with other available information Fetalpain law advocates argue the cortex is unnecessary to feel pain and the thalamus developed around 20 weeks is sufficient Ms Balch of the National Right to Life Committee cites as a strong impetus for the laws a 2007 article in the journal Behavioral and Brain Sciences by Dr Bjorn Merker a Swedish neuroscientist It included observations of five children with hydranencephaly in which most or all of the cortex is missing replaced with fluid Dr Merker wrote that they appeared to smile and cry and theorized that the tacit consensus concerning the cerebral cortex as the organ of consciousnessÂ  may be seriously in error Ms Balch said this research involving children ages 1 to 5 is persuasive evidence that the unborn child feels pain at 20 weeks But Dr Merker said by email that his research had only marginal bearing on fetal pain and did not deal with pain specifically He added I was not aware that I had been cited in connection with the abortion issue and would not elaborate because politics has infected the issue Dr Anand believes the cortex is not necessary for fetal pain saying some adults have continued feeling pain after cortex tissue removal and others have had pain eliminated when just thalamus nerves were removed It seems that the cortex is not that important even in the adult he said Why do you think it is so important in the fetus But Dr Rosen a professor emeritus of anesthesiology obstetrics and gynecology at the University of California San Francisco said pain involves complex feedback loops between different structures so pain receptors must extend through the spinal cord and thalamus into the cortex You can make a telephone call but not till wires that connect our phones exist he said You can say the wire now exists but nobodys turned the service on On both sides viewpoints continue evolving Stuart Derbyshire a psychologist at the National University of Singapore is a leading voice against the likelihood of fetal pain Appointed to the British panel he strongly supports its main conclusion but increasingly doubts another suggestion in the report that the uterine environment may keep fetuses in continuous sleeplike unconsciousness or sedation That he said was a really appealing argument but unfortunately I dont think it quite works Dr Anands fetalpain theories grew from research he did with premature infants about 25 years ago showing that the practice of not anesthetizing infants undergoing surgery caused hormonal stress responses and impeded recoveries This did not prove the infants felt pain but it contributed to making anesthesia standard because lowering stress responses helped babies survive He said he thought the responses reflected pain possible in infants as premature as 22 weeks  Most premature infants are older than fetuses the laws refer to with moredeveloped brains But Dr Anand said he believes fetuses may feel pain through different pathways possibly the subplate a way station for budding neurons which later folds into the cortex Dr Rosen said the subplate theory was unsubstantiated conjecture likely too simplistic for pain sensation In 2004 Dr Anand testified about fetal pain in trials on laws banning lateterm procedures which opponents call partialbirth abortions In 2005 he testified before a Congressional committee considering fetalpain legislation Recently he said he had intended to highlight science not support antiabortion views Since 2005 Ive been asked to testify many many times and Ive turned it down he said I feel its just gotten completely out of hand He said women and their doctors should make abortion decisions case by case In the very few abortions where fetal pain could possibly occur he said consider what can be done to avoid inflicting a lot of pain on the fetus He said a common method used after 20 weeks  injecting amniotic fluid or fetuses with heartstopping medication before removing the fetus  would be fine really from a point of view of fetal pain a compassionate way to do it Antiabortion advocates disagree equating the injections with heart attacks Dr Anand said that if injections could not be done he would recommend some sort of fetal anesthesia Dr Daniel Grossman vice president for research at Ibis Reproductive Health who performs abortions said that fetal anesthesia is rare carrying risks to mothers but that he would provide it if asked to patients who understood the risks Dr Anne Davis consulting medical director for Physicians for Reproductive Health who performs abortions until 24 weeks said publicity about the laws had prompted patients to ask about fetal pain She tells them that the best evidence is the fetuses are not feeling pain until pretty much into the third trimester Some scientists say if fetuses feel pain childbirth would seem to be particularly painful Yet fetalpain law supporters do not advocate fetal anesthesia or painkillers then Ms Balch said she believes there is something that is produced that prevents pain for babies being born Scientists say that is not so There are ways in which the pain of being born may help the fetus by producing activation in the pathways of the brain Dr Anand said

Race for City Council Speaker Intensifies After Primary,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/nyregion/race-for-city-council-speaker-intensifies-after-primary.html,When the Brooklyn Democratic establishment gathered for breakfast at Juniors a few days after the primary election most eyes were on Bill de Blasio the presumptive nominee for mayor who doled out hugs and kisses as he navigated the room But in the background several members of the City Council  none of them from Brooklyn  were also working the crowd As guests dined on eggs and lox Mark S Weprin from Queens Annabel Palma from the Bronx and Daniel R Garodnick from Manhattan whose wife had given birth to the couples second son days before made their way to each table shaking hands and greeting people with Hey how are you and Great to see you There was no need to explain why they were there The unsaid thing is that theyre all running for Council speaker Frank R Seddio the chairman of the Brooklyn Democratic Party said later The speaker of the Council elected by the members is arguably the second most influential official in the city and the position will become vacant in January when the current speaker Christine C Quinn leaves office after her defeat in this years race for the Democratic nomination for mayor Ms Quinn who was elected speaker in 2006 defeating Bill de Blasio who last week defeated her in the primary brought a new forceful power to the post and imposed discipline on a panel that had previously been viewed as unruly She used her position to block legislation that she often in alliance with Mayor Michael R Bloomberg opposed and likewise to rally votes for legislation that she supported The election to replace her will not take place until January after the members elected in November take office But the campaigning has been under way for months and has intensified since last weeks Democratic primary since if history is any guide almost all members of the Council will be Democrats By tradition county party organizations play a significant role in the election of the speaker in some instances essentially dictating votes after horsetrading involving committee chairmanships and patronage jobs And ideology plays a role too  although the post will be chosen by Democrats some of the Councils Democratic members are significantly more liberal than others The choice is complicated as so many things in New York City politics are by gender and race Although whites make up a minority of the city it appears highly likely that the next mayor will be a white man both the Democratic and Republican nominees are white men and also likely that the next comptroller will be a white man the Democratic nominee is heavily favored The outcome of the race for public advocate  the only other elected citywide post  is unclear There will be a Democratic runoff between a black woman and a white man on Oct 1 there is no Republican candidate If there is no black or Latino on the Democratic ticket I think therell be a lot of pressure to pick a minority member for speaker George Arzt a veteran Democratic political consultant said You cant have four white men Multiple members have been mentioned as candidates  in addition to Mr Weprin Mr Garodnick and Ms Palma they include James Vacca of the Bronx Inez E Dickens and Melissa MarkViverito of Manhattan and Jumaane D Williams of Brooklyn Mr Williams who is AfricanAmerican said in an interview that picking a member of a minority group as speaker should be a priority I think that is something that should be pushed he said Beyond ethnicity all of the candidates have strengths and weakness Ms Dickens was a close ally of Ms Quinn which could be a problem for her if Mr de Blasio chooses to get involved in the race She has also been the subject of several negative stories in The New York Post recently about her role as a landlord in Harlem Mr Garodnick who had originally planned to run for comptroller this fall withdrew his candidacy after Scott M Stringer the Manhattan borough president decided to drop his mayoral bid and run for comptroller instead That may have earned Mr Garodnick some good will with Mr Stringers allies including Representative Jerrold Nadler of Manhattan Ms MarkViverito is close to Mr de Blasio and endorsed him for mayor and she is also favored by the health care workers union 1199 SEIU which backed Mr de Blasio in the primary But she is said not to be wellliked by her colleagues and she won the primary in her district with only 35 percent of the vote Ms Palma is described by some as a potential compromise candidate She is not part of any particular bloc in the Council She endorsed Ms Quinn in the primary but is also a former organizer for 1199 SEIU Ms MarkViverito and Mr Williams are both part of the Councils progressive caucus which is closely allied with unions and the Working Families Party Kenneth K Fisher a former Brooklyn councilman who is now a lawyer specializing in municipal issues described the progressive caucus as the most cohesive bloc in the Council and said it could rival the influence of the county leaders this year in choosing the speaker Mr Williams was one of the sponsors of two policing bills passed by the Council this year over Mr Bloombergs veto that created an inspector general for the Police Department and allowed people to sue the police in state court over racial profiling But he may face his own challenges On Tuesday Deborah J Glick an assemblywoman from Manhattan posted on Twitter that Mr Williams was a very nice guy but added Will council pick an antichoice antimarriage equality speaker Asked in an interview what his views were on abortion and samesex marriage Mr Williams demurred saying I think my personal beliefs are less important than what Ive done legislatively on issues that have come before the Council But he noted that he had voted along with most of his colleagues for a bill that would have required socalled pregnancy crisis centers  businesses that masquerade as medical clinics but are operated by antiabortion groups  to disclose in their ads and in their waiting rooms whether they have a licensed medical provider supervising services and whether they provide or make referrals for prenatal care abortions and emergency contraception A federal judge temporarily blocked the city from putting the law into effect saying it risked violating the First Amendment The citys appeal is pending As part of their campaigns Mr Garodnick Mr Weprin and Mr Vacca donated from their own reelection accounts to the campaigns of other candidates running in the primary Mr Garodnick donated a total of 16775 in 2013 mostly to Council candidates Mr Weprin and Mr Vacca each donated over 8000 to other city candidates
"Pope Says Church Is â€˜Obsessedâ€™ With Gays, Abortion and Birth Control",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/pope-bluntly-faults-churchs-focus-on-gays-and-abortion.html,Six months into his papacy Pope Francis sent shock waves through the Roman Catholic church on Thursday with the publication of his remarks that the church had grown obsessed with abortion gay marriage and contraception and that he had chosen not to talk about those issues despite recriminations from critics  His surprising comments came in a lengthy interview in which he criticized the church for putting dogma before love and for prioritizing moral doctrines over serving the poor and marginalized He articulated his vision of an inclusive church a home for all  which is a striking contrast with his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI the doctrinal defender who envisioned a smaller purer church Francis told the interviewer a fellow Jesuit It is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent The churchs pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently We have to find a new balance the pope continued otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel The popes interview did not change church doctrine or policies but it instantly changed its tone His words evoked gratitude and hope from many liberal Catholics who had felt left out in the cold during the papacies of Benedict and his predecessor John Paul II which together lasted 35 years Some lapsed Catholics suggested on social media a return to the church and leaders of gay rights and gay Catholic groups called on bishops to abandon their fight against gay marriage But it left conservative and traditionalist Catholics and those who have devoted themselves to the struggles against abortion gay marriage and artificial contraception on the defensive though some cast it as nothing new Nobody should try to use the words of the pope to minimize the urgent need to preach and teach about abortion said the Rev Frank Pavone national director of Priests for Life who said he spoke Thursday about the priority of the abortion issue at a Vatican conference The interview with Francis was conducted by the Rev Antonio Spadaro editor in chief ofÂ La Civilt Cattolica an Italian Jesuit journal whose content is approved by the Vatican Francis the first Jesuit to become a pope agreed to grantÂ the interview after requests from Father Spadaro and the editors of America a Jesuit magazine based in New York Father Spadaro conducted the interview during three meetings in August in the popes spartan quarters in Casa Santa Marta the Vatican guesthouse where Francis said he had chosen to live because it is less isolated than the papal apartment in the Apostolic Palace I cannot live without people Francis told Father Spadaro  The interview kept under wraps for weeks by the Jesuits was released simultaneouslyÂ on ThursdayÂ morning by 16 Jesuit journals around the world Francis personally reviewed the Italian transcript and it was translated by a team into English said the Rev James Martin an editor at large ofÂ America We have a great pope said Father Spadaro in a phone interview from his office surrounded by Italian journalists There is a big vision not a big shift His big vision is to see the church in the middle of the persons who need to be healed It is in the middle of the world  The popes words are likely to have repercussions in a church whose bishops and priests in many countries including the United States have often seemed to make combating abortion gay marriage and contraception their top public policy priorities Francis said that those teachings have to be presented in a larger context  I see the church as a field hospital after battle Francis said It is useless to ask a seriously injured person if he has high cholesterol and about the level of his blood sugars You have to heal his wounds Then we can talk about everything else  From the outset of his papacy in March Francis who is 76 has chosen to use the global spotlight to focus on the churchs mandate to serve the poor and oppressed He has washed the feet of juvenile prisoners visited a center for refugees and hugged disabled pilgrims at his audiences His pastoral presence and humble gestures have made him wildly popular among American Catholics according to a recent Pew survey Â   But there has been a low rumble of discontent from some Catholic advocacy groups and even from some bishops who have taken note of his silence on abortion and gay marriage This month Bishop Thomas Tobin of Providence RI told his diocesan newspaper that he was a little bit disappointed in Pope Francis because he had not spoken about abortion Many people have noticed that he said The interview is the first time Francis has explained the reasoning behind both his actions and omissions He also expanded on the comments he made about homosexuality in July on an airplane returning to Rome from Rio de Janeiro where he had celebrated World Youth Day In a remark then that produced headlines worldwide the new pope said Who am I to judge At the time some questioned whether he was referring only to gays in the priesthood but in this interview he made clear that he had been speaking of gay men and lesbians in general A person once asked me in a provocative manner if I approved of homosexuality he told Father Spadaro I replied with another question Tell me when God looks at a gay person does he endorse the existence of this person with love or reject and condemn this person We must always consider the person The interview also serves to present the pope as a human being who loves Mozart and Dostoyevsky and his grandmother and whose favorite film is Fellinis La Strada  Francis said some had assumed he was an ultraconservative because of his reputation when he served as the superior of his Jesuit province in Argentina He said that he was made superior at the crazy young age of 36 and that his leadership style was too authoritarian But I have never been a rightwinger he said It was my authoritarian way of making decisions that created problems Now Francis said he prefers a more consultative leadership style He has appointed an advisory group of eight cardinals a step he said was recommended by the cardinals at the conclave that elected him They were demanding reform of the Vatican bureaucracy he said adding that from the eight I want to see that this is a real not ceremonial consultation The pope said he has found it amazing to see complaints about lack of orthodoxy flowing into the Vatican offices in Rome from conservative Catholics around the world They ask the Vatican to investigate or discipline their priests bishops or nuns Such complaints he said are better dealt with locally or else the Vatican offices risk becoming institutions of censorship Asked what it means for him to think with the church a phrase used by the Jesuit founder St Ignatius Francis said that it did not mean thinking with the hierarchy of the church This church with which we should be thinking is the home of all not a small chapel that can hold only a small group of selected people he said We must not reduce the bosom of the universal church to a nest protecting our mediocrity
An Interview With Pope Francis,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/world/europe/an-interview-with-pope-francis.html,These excerpts are from the full interview published in English by America magazine a Jesuit weekly based in New York  In his most extensive and revealing interview since he was elected in March Pope Francis sat for a series of talks in August with a fellow Jesuit the Rev Antonio Spadaro the editor of the leading Jesuit journal in Rome The pope formerly a cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio spoke of the mistakes he feels he made when he became the superior of his Jesuit province in Argentina at the crazy young age of 36 He talked about his vision of the church and why he has chosen not to spend much time talking about abortion gay marriage and contraception He explained what he meant by the headlinegrabbing remark he made about gay people Who am I to judge And he said that doubt is essential to finding God  LAURIE GOODSTEIN Who is Jorge Mario Bergoglio I am a sinner This is the most accurate definition It is not a figure of speech a literary genre I am a sinner Why did you become a Jesuit a member of the Society of Jesus Three things in particular struck me about the Society the missionary spirit community and discipline And this is strange because I am a really really undisciplined person But their discipline the way they manage their time  these things struck me so much What did you learn in your early experience as superior of the Jesuit province in Argentina My authoritarian and quick manner of making decisions led me to have serious problems and to be accused of being ultraconservative I lived a time of great interior crisis when I was in Cordova To be sure I have never been like Blessed Imelda but I have never been a rightwinger It was my authoritarian way of making decisions that created problems What should the church say to divorced and remarried people and homosexuals In Buenos Aires I used to receive letters from homosexual persons who are socially wounded because they tell me that they feel like the church has always condemned them But the church does not want to do this During the return flight from Rio de Janeiro I said that if a homosexual person is of good will and is in search of God I am no one to judge By saying this I said what the catechism says Religion has the right to express its opinion in the service of the people but God in creation has set us free it is not possible to interfere spiritually in the life of a person A person once asked me in a provocative manner if I approved of homosexuality I replied with another question Tell me when God looks at a gay person does he endorse the existence of this person with love or reject and condemn this person We must always consider the person What kind of church do you dream of We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods This is not possible I have not spoken much about these things and I was reprimanded for that But when we speak about these issues we have to talk about them in a context The teaching of the church for that matter is clear and I am a son of the church but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time The dogmatic and moral teachings of the church are not all equivalent The churchs pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently  We have to find a new balance otherwise even the moral edifice of the church is likely to fall like a house of cards losing the freshness and fragrance of the Gospel The proposal of the Gospel must be more simple profound radiant It is from this proposition that the moral consequences then flow I say this also thinking about the preaching and content of our preaching What should be the role of the Vaticans various departments or congregations They are instruments of help In some cases however when they are not functioning well they run the risk of becoming institutions of censorship It is amazing to see the denunciations for lack of orthodoxy that come to Rome I think the cases should be investigated by the local bishops conferences which can get valuable assistance from Rome These cases in fact are much better dealt with locally The Roman congregations are mediators they are not middlemen or managers What should be the role of women in the church I am wary of a solution that can be reduced to a kind of female machismo because a woman has a different makeup than a man But what I hear about the role of women is often inspired by an ideology of machismo Women are asking deep questions that must be addressed The church cannot be herself without the woman and her role The woman is essential for the church Mary a woman is more important than the bishops I say this because we must not confuse the function with the dignity We must therefore investigate further the role of women in the church We have to work harder to develop a profound theology of the woman Only by making this step will it be possible to better reflect on their function within the church The feminine genius is needed wherever we make important decisions The challenge today is this to think about the specific place of women also in those places where the authority of the church is exercised for various areas of the church If encountering God is a journey then we can make mistakes If one has the answers to all the questions  that is the proof that God is not with him It means that he is a false prophet using religion for himself The great leaders of the people of God like Moses have always left room for doubt You must leave room for the Lord not for our certainties we must be humble  Our life is not given to us like an opera libretto in which all is written down but it means going walking doing searching seeing  We must enter into the adventure of the quest for meeting God we must let God search and encounter us  If the Christian is a restorationist a legalist if he wants everything clear and safe then he will find nothing Tradition and memory of the past must help us to have the courage to open up new areas to God Those who today always look for disciplinarian solutions those who long for an exaggerated doctrinal security those who stubbornly try to recover a past that no longer exists  they have a static and inwarddirected view of things In this way faith becomes an ideology among other ideologies I have a dogmatic certainty God is in every persons life God is in everyones life Even if the life of a person has been a disaster even if it is destroyed by vices drugs or anything else  God is in this persons life You can you must try to seek God in every human life Although the life of a person is a land full of thorns and weeds there is always a space in which the good seed can grow You have to trust God
Heroes or Killers? Can We Try to Discuss?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/movies/after-tiller-is-a-documentary-about-abortion-doctors.html,After Tiller a new documentary by Martha Shane and Lana Wilson is a partisan document in the culture wars It could hardly be otherwise since the films subject abortion is one where common ground is elusive if not philosophically untenable The four doctors interviewed and observed on screen who the film says are the only ones in the United States openly performing thirdtrimester abortions are heroic figures in the filmmakers eyes but are condemned as murderers by those on the other side It would be nice to believe that a movie like this could provoke civil and respectful dialogue about an intensely polarizing issue but lets not kid ourselves The four doctors  two in New Mexico one in Colorado and one in Nebraska  honor the memory of their colleague George Tiller who was assassinated in 2009 in Wichita Kan where his clinic had been the scene of protests threats and attacks Since that killing and especially since the 2010 elections a number of states have passed more restrictive abortion laws Nebraska being one of them This forces Dr LeRoy Carhart to find a new place to practice and his attempts to do so inflame antiabortion activists in Iowa and in Maryland where he finally opens a clinic  While the other doctors  Warren Hern in Boulder and Susan Robinson and Shelley Sella who share an office in Albuquerque  do not face that kind of disruption they contend with continuous picketing and with the hovering invisible threat of violence But Ms Shane and Ms Wilson are less interested in recapitulating political debates than in understanding how the doctors approach work that would be emotionally difficult and ethically challenging even without the incessant controversy Some of the patients who come to them are in the late stages of planned pregnancies and have recently learned of catastrophic fetal anomalies Others are teenagers who have through fear denial or ignorance allowed their pregnancies to continue past the stage when simpler more readily available abortions would be possible In each case the physicians and the counselors who work with them have to figure out an appropriate course of action At one point Dr Robinson and a colleague disagree about whether to help a young woman end her pregnancy even though she identifies herself as prolife and their exchange is one of the most illuminating discussions I have seen about the complicated reality of abortion Documentaries can rarely be judged as works of dispassionate neutral reporting since few of them aspire to uphold those journalistic criteria Rather a documentary should be assessed as a representation of the world as it is from a perspective that is itself part of that world After Tiller is impressive because it honestly presents the views of supporters of legal abortion and is thus a valuable contribution to a public argument that is unlikely to end anytime soon After Tiller is rated PG13 Parents strongly cautioned Discussion of abortion and some profanity
A Gender Gap as Ballot Spots Start to Fill,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/20/us/a-gender-gap-as-ballot-spots-start-to-fill.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor of The Texas Tribune writes a regular column for the Tribune Texas Republicans dont have the problem Texas Democrats have there are plenty of conservatives clamoring for the top spots on the ballot But in a year when their liberal opponents are accusing them of waging a war on women they could end up with very few women at the top of their ticket It is easy to see that as a talking point especially if the Democratic ticket is led by a woman but it is difficult to tell what it might mean on Election Day in November 2014 Many political consultants will say that female candidates outdo male candidates when all other things are equal Others like Bryan Eppstein of Fort Worth say the answer is more complex Gender matters less and ideology  Â not party but ideology  Â matters more he said Its not a general advantage or disadvantage The contention that Meg Whitman a Republican might have an advantage over Jerry Brown a Democrat in the 2010 race for California governor proved to be wrong Kay Bailey Hutchison lost to Rick Perry in the Republican primary for Texas governor that same year Mr Eppstein a Republican attributes the wins and the losses to other factors Democrats revved up by State Senator Wendy Daviss sudden celebrity during and after a June debate on a contentious abortion bill see a potential advantage in topping their slatewith a woman against a Republican ticket where women are scarce In some ways the political campaigns on the Republican side are well under way Mr Perry said in July that he would not run for another term and Attorney General Greg Abbott quickly confirmed his plans to run for that job That opened the gates and the days between then and now have been filled with political news Candidates are raising money appearing at forums hugging voters and kissing babies In some ways the beginnings are still under way Candidates cant file for office until Nov 9 and they have until a month after that to make their intentions officially known Democrats are still putting together their announcements Ms Davis of Fort Worth said this week that she would announce her plans Oct 3 it would surprise many Democrats to hear anything other than the start of her run for governor Fuzzy as that might seem it is the clearest peek into the Democratic playbook Others like State Senator Leticia Van de Putte of San Antonio are considering statewide runs in 2014 but none have said anything official yet Some announcements have been in the negative Mayor Julin Castro of San Antonio after a political cotillion at the Democratic National Convention last year seemed all dressed up for a statewide race But hes not running telling reporters and others that he still has things to do as mayor and that he doesnt think this is the right year for him On the Republican side there are women in both of the top races at this speculative point of the gamebut neither is expected to slow the juggernauts John Cornyn and Mr Abbott Mr Cornyn the states senior United States senator does not have any wellknown opponents yet in his race for reelection The most serious threat to Mr Abbott in the race for governor is the underfinanced Tom Pauken a former state Republican Party chairman If Linda Vega and Miriam Martinez are bona fide contenders in those two races they have yet to reveal themselves The races for lieutenant governor and attorney general are emptyon the Democratic side and stag parties on the Republican side Debra Medina is interested in the race for comptroller if she can pull together the resources to be competitive The only other nonjudicial statewide race with female Republican candidates is for the Texas Railroad Commission and no frontrunner has emerged from a field that so far includes seven Republicans Because the Democratic candidates have not lined up its impossible to know right now whether they will have a similar male imbalance Any advantage attributable to gender might be too small anyhow The best performance by a statewide Democrat since 1994 was 49 percent and most results fell far short of that The election will be defined by the issues the top candidates choose to talk about and gender could easily change the tenor of that debate

"With His Remarks on Sexual Morality, a Surprise Pope Keeps on Surprising",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/21/world/europe/with-his-remarks-on-sexual-morality-a-surprise-pope-keeps-on-surprising.html,ROME  From the moment he was introduced to the huge crowds waiting for a new pope in the rain at St Peters Square Pope Francis has been a surprise People gasped when his name was called out He was 76 seemingly another rigid conservative not the younger dynamic figure many Catholics had hoped for Now six months later the surprises keep coming including the popes new remarks that the church risked becoming a small chapel overly fixated on sexual morality and should instead offer a broader more inclusive message Francis is challenging the status quo of the Roman Catholic Church so determinedly and so unexpectedly that Vatican watchers are debating whether this is merely a change of tone as many had thought at first Some now think the pope may be making a deliberate effort to shake up the Vatican governing hierarchy known as the Curia and prepare the ground for a more fundamental shift in the direction of the church I think we are looking at major changes said John Thavis a longtime Vatican observer and author of The Vatican Diaries There is a lot of disorientation inside the Roman Curia They used to feel they were in charge Right now they know they are not in charge The latest unexpected jolt from Pope Francis came in an interview conducted with a Jesuit journalist and released Thursday in Jesuit publications around the world Francis himself a Jesuit chastised the churchs narrow focus on controversial social issues and called instead for a more merciful and less judgmental church He had already sent out earlier signals declining to live in the papal apartments in the Apostolic Palace chiding prelates for driving fancy cars and announcing that church properties should be used as shelters for refugees Francis did try to temper the impact of his remarks on Friday telling an audience of Catholic gynecologists that abortion was a symptom of our throwaway culture and urging them to refuse to perform the procedure But there seems little question that Francis wants to change the papal conversation His predecessor Benedict XVI often seemed engaged in an angry verbal jousting match with secularism and modernity usually delivered through formal encyclicals or speeches that to many Catholics felt like a personal rebuke The church seemed like a rigid institution dictating impossible norms to follow an overly severe mother said Lucetta Scaraffia a scholar of Catholicism in Rome By contrast Pope Francis has made impromptu telephone calls to people who have written him letters seeking help while also thriving on socializing with other priests and laypeople He is assuming the tone of the parish priest many analysts say recognizing that people struggle daily with issues of conscience and that the church rather than shake a finger must offer a broader message of comfort and healing Many analysts have seized on an analogy cited by Francis in his interview the church as a hospital in a battlefield People have been wounded in a war over secularization said Ms Scaraffia a history professor at the University of Rome La Sapienza Hes saying Lets look after the wounds Thats more important than winning the warÂ  The deep challenges confronting the church became evident after Benedicts stunning decision to resign early this year Allegations of mismanagement were erupting in the Vatican and accusations of impropriety shook the Vatican bank Many cardinals blamed the problems on the secretive administrative body the Roman Curia and wanted Benedicts successor to usher in major reforms that would decentralize power Pope Francis has already signaled his independence from some of the Vaticans traditional channels and his biggest governance move as yet has been the creation of an advisory group of eight outside cardinals to help him usher in Curial reform But in his interview he hinted that bigger changes could be coming including possible structural changes to the conferences of bishops known as synods He also pointedly warned that certain departments in the Curia when functioning poorly risk becoming institutions of censorship Analysts also noted how Francis specifically stated that the Curia should be at the service of the church the bishops and the pope  not vice versa But rather than first outlining specific governance reforms and instituting major personnel shifts Francis instead seems intent on articulating his vision for the church to build public support for changes yet to come First you have to get consensus based on the force of the vision and then you find the men said the Reverend Pierangelo Sequeri dean of the Theological Faculty of Northern Italy I dont think the cardinals expected him to act in that way Francis who previously had been Cardinal Jorge Mario Bergoglio from Argentina was selected by a peer group of cardinals widely regarded as theological conservatives Many analysts as well as conservative Catholics have noted that despite the striking differences in his young papacy Francis remains a theological conservative who is not advocating doctrinal change Indeed Francis on Friday offered a strong antiabortion message during a meeting with Catholic gynecologists Every child that isnt born but is unjustly condemned to be aborted has the face of Jesus Christ has the face of the Lord he said But the pope seems intent on not being ideologically pigeonholed In his Jesuit interview Francis said that in his younger days while overseeing the Jesuit order in Argentina he was often quicktempered and came under legitimate criticism My authoritarian and quick manner of making decisions led me to have serious problems and to be accused of being ultraconservative he said But later when he became archbishop of Buenos Aires he changed his style he recalled He consulted regularly with bishops and met several times a year with councils of priests inviting discussion and debate But now I hear some people tell me Do not consult too much and decide by yourselfÂ  he said in the interview Instead I believe that consultation is very important Indeed some analysts believe Francis desire to broaden the appeal and message of the church reflects his background in Latin America where the Roman Catholic Church is competing for followers with evangelical Protestant movements Appealing to the global south was considered an important factor in selecting a new pope while several cardinals spoke publicly about the need for a change agent to fix the problems inside the Vatican Alberto Melloni a prominent Vatican historian said he thought that the cardinals despite their conservatism were aware that Francis would make big changes  especially since most of those same cardinals had previously elected Benedict and bore some responsibility for the shortcomings of his papacy But Mr Melloni added that even if Francis remained a doctrinaire conservative the decision to stop speaking in terms of doctrine and nonnegotiable values was very significant given tight alignment in many countries between the church and political conservatives The political consequences of these changes are very strong and serious said Mr Melloni director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna a liberal Catholic research institute The Holy Father has offered a sort of new freedom to the church in the political scene Sister Carol Zinn president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious the umbrella group of American nuns that came under harsh doctrinal scrutiny under Pope Benedict said Francis approach to the papacy  listening to laypeople and practicing the Jesuit discipline of gradually discerning direction  indicated that he intended to make more than tonal changes What were seeing is an incredible change in the atmosphere she said in an interview And when you have change in the atmosphere its amazing what kinds of things can unfold Because of the commitment he has to a discerning way of life I think we are going to see changes because discernment brings changes

"Deeply Conservative, but Not an Obama-Hater",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/us/politics/deeply-conservative-but-not-an-obama-hater.html,WASHINGTON  Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona likes President Obama voted to give him the authority to strike Syria supported the comprehensive immigration legislation favored by the White House and works comfortably with members of the opposing party The sixterm House Republican who is now serving his first term in the Senate also is a rockribbed conservative especially on economic and fiscal issues He has been a darling of the Club for Growth before going to Congress he ran the Goldwater Institute in his home state As a conservative who mixes conviction and civility he is a member of a vanishing breed He stands out among the Tea Partydriven congressional Republicans who are threatening to shut down the government or risk a US default by refusing to increase the debt ceiling  and do not withhold their venom toward Mr Obama Representative Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan for example delights his constituents with his relish for a presidential impeachment His animosity runs so deep that he said he couldnt stand to be in the same room with Mr Obama On most social questions Mr Flake is squarely on the right He opposes abortion rights and unlike Arizonas senior senator John McCain he refused to break with orthodoxy and support a mild background check for gun buyers He is a Mormon  a graduate of Brigham Young University in Utah and a former missionary in Africa  and opposes samesex marriage But he is not a demagogue in the House he voted to repeal the militarys dont ask dont tell restriction and to allow gays to serve in the armed forces Even though he has been attacked from the political right for defying the majority in his party with his Syria and immigration votes he has no regrets Syria was more about the presidency than the president he said in an interview last week outside the Senate chamber Youve got to look beyond the immediate America benefits from having a strong commander in chief He was a member of the bipartisan Senate Gang of Eight which crafted a comprehensive immigration overhaul measure this year Six years ago he backed another effort to change immigration policies Theres a much better atmosphere today on immigration than there was in 2007 he said As a US representative Mr Flakes successful libertarianminded campaign to ban earmarks  the small spending projects that members were long allowed to direct to their districts  so annoyed party leaders that he was denied a seat on the House Appropriations Committee Mr Flake acknowledged that ending earmarks also took away a tool lawmakers used to forge compromises though political horsetrading Nonetheless he insists that the practice perpetuated an obscene system Members of Congress used earmarks to contract out their campaign financing he said It was the currency of corruption He is consistently antispending antitax and antideficit A decade ago he was one of the few House Republicans to oppose President George W Bushs expanded prescriptiondrug benefit for senior citizens because the measure was not paid for He has favored replacing the income tax with a national sales tax On the economy Mr Obama has been a disaster he said Yet the athletic and deeply tanned Arizonan he would look out of place in North Dakota concedes that the president has a good jump shot which he observed when he was invited to play in one of the presidents pickup basketball games Unlike some of his colleagues he does not personalize his philosophical differences with Mr Obama Ive never been able to work up the hatred that some Republicans have for the president Mr Flake said As a person I like him hes a good family man The fiscal conservative believes Tea Partyinspired plans to shut down the government or to oppose an increase in the debt ceiling and risk default unless Obamacare is killed are crazy Its a mistake said Mr Flake He too is a critic of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act but he says the hardline Republican approach wont work and Congress is held in pretty low regard already This sensible stance has drawn the ire of a few old allies The Senate Conservatives Fund a political action committee is running ads against Mr Flake and other Republicans who refuse to hold the government hostage to repealing the health care law The PAC gushed over Mr Flake during his Senate run last year and its chairman Jim DeMint a former Republican senator endorsed him When it comes to fighting wasteful spending and parochial politics nobody has done more to advance the cause of freedom than Jeff Flake Nobody Today Mr Flake shrugs off the criticism as well as the more vicious attacks on his Syria vote and his immigration stance but he regrets the more acrimonious political climate The last five years or so this has become a lot more intense he said Its the shirts versus the skins you cant work with the other side on anything He said he would continue to seek common ground with the other side There are a lot of talented straightshooting Democrats here Specifically he cites his work with Senator Joe Manchin III of West Virginia on regulatory matters with Senator Michael Bennet of Colorado on immigration and with a fellow freshman Martin Heinrich of New Mexico on questions related to public land Most of his closer Republican colleagues share his fiscal conservatism Tom Coburn of Oklahoma Pat Toomey of Pennsylvania and Marco Rubio of Florida with whom he also worked on immigration He also has high regard for  and often defers to  Mr McCain even though his Arizona colleague does not share all his fiscal views The breakdown in comity and increased political polarization he said does not just stymie liberals it is harmful to conservative causes too As an advocate of limited government Im often not opposed to gridlock he said But the lack of any regular order in the Senate

Dolan Calls Popeâ€™s Tone on Sexual Morality a â€˜Breath of Fresh Airâ€™,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/nyregion/dolan-calls-popes-tone-on-sexual-morality-a-breath-of-fresh-air.html,Three days after Pope Francis set a new tone for the Roman Catholic Church Cardinal Timothy M Dolan the archbishop of New York embraced the magnificent interview in which the pope chastised the church for its obsession with sexual morality and called him a breath of fresh air After Sunday Mass at St Patricks Cathedral Cardinal Dolan who has himself softened his language on homosexuality in the past year likened the pope to the Yankees retiring relief pitcher I think hes our Mariano Rivera Hes a great relief to all of us Last Wednesday Pope Francis surprised Catholics and nonCatholics alike with the publication of a lengthy interview in which he reprimanded the church for emphasizing dogma and moral doctrines over ministering to its people including those who have quit or are indifferent He laid out a vision for a more inclusive church as a home for all and said the church could not afford to be obsessed with samesex marriage abortion and contraception The comments were a sharp departure from his predecessor Pope Benedict XVI who had zealously defended church doctrine once calling homosexuality a strong tendency ordered toward an intrinsic moral evil Cardinal Dolan whose name was floated as a possible candidate for the papacy made his own waves last spring in televised interviews on Easter Sunday Having vigorously fought the legalizing of samesex marriage in New York he said the church could be more welcoming of gay men and lesbians Weve got to do better to see that our defense of marriage is not reduced to an attack on gay people he said On Sunday Cardinal Dolan who is president of the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops held a brief news conference in the sanctuary to talk about Pope Francis first six months in the Vatican and to address the popes groundbreaking interview with an Italian Jesuit journal He was joined by the Very Rev Robert Barron of Chicago a priest known for his weekly radio program Word on Fire who delivered the homily  Asked how the citys gay Catholic population regarded the new pope Cardinal Dolan said I think they embrace him and Im glad they do The popes message Cardinal Dolan said was that we dont look at people first and foremost as their sexual orientation or sexual identification we look at him as a child of God made in his image and likeness He added Thats the glasses we use Everything else is secondary so I hope that hits home Father Barron offered a similar analysis If the first and last thing that gay people hear from the Catholic Church is that your acts are intrinsically disordered thats a tragedy he said I heard a new pastoral strategy in this interview Its a question of what do you prioritize how do you do the work You lead always with the merciful face of Christ Still Cardinal Dolan said the interview did not signal a shift in church doctrine or policy whether toward samesex marriage or abortion One of the lines that nobody seems to be paying attention to was when he said Im a loyal son of the church he said He knows that the highest and most sacred responsibility is to pass on the timeless teaching of the church What hes saying is that we have to think of a more effective way to do it because if the church comes off as a scold its counterproductive he said If the church comes off as a loving embracing mother who periodically has to correct her children then we will be effective  Worshipers leaving the standingroomonly service embraced the popes comments I was very pleased that hes open to things that the Catholic Church has been very rigid about said Autumn DeMauro of Pittsburgh It could give young people a reason to come back
The Death and Afterlife of Thalidomide,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/23/booming/the-death-and-afterlife-of-thalidomide.html,The story of thalidomide told in this weeks Retro Report video is one of the most shameful in the history of the modern pharmaceutical industry In the 1950s a German company Chemie Grnenthal developed thalidomide which was marketed in Europe as the first safe sleeping pill and was seen as a highly effective treatment for pregnant women with morning sickness The drug enjoyed such widespread success that in some European countries it became almost as popular as aspirin But thalidomide was far from safe Although the cause was not realized until later the first known victim of thalidomide was a girl born with no ears on Christmas Day in 1956  a daughter of a Grnenthal employee  In time thousands of children around the world whose mothers took the drug while pregnant were born with severe physical disabilities including flipperlike arms and legs The archival footage of these children in the Retro video is both horrifying and heartbreaking as are the stories of the many families who were devastated and unable to cope Thalidomideaffected children were in some instances rejected by their parents and institutionalized Others had their flippers amputated to accommodate prostheses for arms and legs In one extreme case a young mother and her doctor were charged with the mercy killing of her deformed infant But in the United States things were different thanks to one of those little known heroes who simply did her job well and in the process prevented the drug from being approved In September 1960  Dr Frances Oldham Kelsey a young pharmacologist who had just started working at the Food and Drug Administration was asked to review the drug for approval but became alarmed by what she saw as the lack of rigorous scientific research supporting the drugs safety done by Grnenthal and William S Merrell the United States distributor Once she examined the research carefully the case for thalidomide quickly unraveled She kept asking the company for more data delaying approval In late November 1961 longignored evidence became public in Germany linking thalidomide to birth defects Grnenthal which in a court case years later blamed causes like nuclear fallout or botched home abortions for the childrens deformities did not apologize to the victims and their families until last year Because of Dr Kelseys perseverance the drug never received FDA approval and in 1962 the drug was banned worldwide But almost as important it marked the beginning of a new era for the FDA Major regulatory reforms were finally forced on the pharmaceutical industry many of the same federal guidelines that we live under today Thalidomide is one principal reason United States drug laws are so strict But this was not the end of thalidomide In the early 1990s researchers discovered that the same properties of the drug that restrict blood vessel growth and resulted in the stunted limbs were useful in treating a number of medical disorders including some cancerous tumors like multiple myeloma Crohns disease and multiple sclerosis While the medication now carries a strict warning that it is not to be taken by pregnant women in Brazil where it is used extensively to treat leprosy a group of researchers report that as many as 100 children have been disabled by thalidomide since 2005 This weeks Retro Report is the 12th in a documentary series and the one I find the most affecting a case where the video footage of these children is worth tens of thousands of words The video project was started with a grant from Christopher Buck Retro Report has a staff of 13 journalists and 10 contributors led by Kyra Darnton a former 60 Minutes producer It is a nonprofit video news organization that aims to provide a thoughtful counterweight to todays 247 news cycle The videos are typically 10 to 12 minutes long
Chinese Look Overseas for Surrogates,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/business/global/chinese-look-overseas-for-surrogates.html,NEW YORK  Wealthy Chinese are hiring US women to serve as surrogates for their children creating a small but growing business in 120000 designer American babies for Chinas elite Surrogacy agencies in China and the United States are catering to wealthy Chinese who want babies outside the countrys restrictive family planning policies who are unable to conceive themselves or who are seeking US citizenship for their children The possibility of emigration is another draw  US citizens may apply for green cards for their parents when they turn 21 While there are no figures for the total number of Chinese who have sought or used US surrogates agencies in both countries say demand has risen rapidly in the past two years US fertility clinics and surrogacy agencies are creating Chinese language Web sites and hiring Mandarin speakers Circle Surrogacy based in Boston has handled half a dozen Chinese surrogacy cases over the past five years said John Weltman its president I would be surprised if you called me back in four months and that number hadnt doubled he said Thats the level of interest weve seen this year from China and the very serious conversations weve had with people who I think will be joining us in the next three or four months The agency which handles about 140 surrogacy cases a year 65 percent of them for clients outside the United States is opening an office in California to serve clients from Asia better Mr Weltman said he hoped to hire a representative in Shanghai next year The increased interest from Chinese parents has created some cultural tensions US agency staff members who ask that surrogates and the prospective parents develop personal relationships have been surprised by potential Chinese clients who treat surrogacy as a strictly commercial transaction In China where surrogacy is illegal some clients keep secret the fact that their babies were born to surrogates going so far as to fake pregnancies agents say Chinese interest in obtaining US citizenship is not new The 14th Amendment to the US Constitution gives anyone born in the United States the right to citizenship A growing number of pregnant Chinese women travel to America to obtain US citizenship for their children by delivering there often staying in special homes designed to cater to their needs While the numbers are unclear giving birth in the United States is now so commonplace that it was the subject of a hit romantic comedy movie Finding Mr Right released in China in March Over all the number of Chinese visitors to the United States nearly doubled in recent years from one million in 2010 to 18 million in 2012 US immigration statistics show Mr Weltman said that prospective Chinese clients almost always want US citizenship for their babies Other agencies pointed to a desire to have children educated in the United States Some wealthy Chinese say they want escape routes overseas because they fear they will be the targets of public or government anger if there is more social unrest in China There is also a perception that their wealth will be better protected in countries with a stronger rule of law At least one Chinese agent promotes surrogacy as a cheaper alternative to the American EB5 visa which requires a minimum investment in a jobcreating business of 500000 While the basic surrogacy package Chinese agencies offer costs between as much as 200000 if you add in plane tickets and other expenses for only 300000 you get two children and the entire family can emigrate to the US said a Shanghaibased agent That cost still means the surrogacy alternative is available only to the wealthiest Chinese Prospective parents typically pay the surrogate between 22000 and 30000 an agency fee of 17000 to 20000 and legal fees as high as 13000 If egg donation is required that can cost an additional 15000 and prenatal care and delivery fees can run between 9000 and 16000 Indeed surrogacy in the United States is so expensive that in recent years hundreds of American parents have reportedly turned to surrogates in India It is often infertility that sends Chinese couples to US surrogacy agencies More than 40 million Chinese are considered infertile according to the Chinese Population Association The incidence of infertility has quadrupled in the past two decades to 125 percent of people of childbearing age Tony Jiang a Shanghai businessman and his wife Cherry were among them They turned twice to domestic surrogates after struggling and failing to conceive on their own Both attempts were unsuccessful and left them unimpressed with the impersonal nature of in vitro fertilization treatment in China Mr Jiang researched surrogacy in Thailand India and Ukraine before settling on the United States in part because of its superior health care system In December 2010 he and his wife welcomed a daughter born in California to an American surrogate he calls my Amanda The same surrogate later carried twins for the couple Friends began to ask him to help them do the same thing and in 2012 he set up his own agency DiYi Consulting He has handled 75 surrogacy cases for Chinese parents so far Agents said that while many of their clients struggled with infertility a substantial portion already had one child  some in their teens  and were looking to have a second child outside Chinas 1979 family planning policy which restricts couples in most cases to one They count among their clients government officials and employees of stateowned enterprises for whom having a second child would be a firing offense Members of the Chinese Communist Party would also face disciplinary action if a second child were discovered Families who violate the onechild policy face the prospect of forced abortions sterilizations and fines policies that have been most brutally enforced in poor rural areas  Seeking surrogacy overseas is not in itself illegal Technically Chinese who deliver their second children overseas still violate family planning policies but in practice the government has little ability to enforce this said Zhong Tao a Shanghaibased lawyer who has handled similar cases  Obtaining a Chinese household registration which is necessary to enjoy subsidized health care and enroll for lower tuition as a local student in state schools is more complicated if not impossible for second children For children who are foreign citizens parents must apply for visas and residence permits Chinese surrogacy clients typically want to use their own eggs and sperm which allows them to have children who are fully biologically theirs agents said A growing number though are open to egg donation Often Chinese donors will seek ethnically Chinese or Asian egg donors commonly with Ivy League degrees But others want tall Eurasian children agents said Lots of clients that are Chinese do use tall blond donors said Jennifer Garcia case coordinator at Extraordinary Conceptions a Carlsbad Californiabased agency where 40 percent of clients are Chinese Agents said that clients believe these taller biracial children will be smarter and better looking Chinese clients also often request boys a consequence of a cultural preference for male children While sexselective abortion is illegal  though still common  in China gender selection is technically straightforward through in vitro fertilization in the United States where it is used in surrogacy cases Genetic screening also allows prospective parents to rule out inherited conditions You can basically make a designer baby nowadays Ms Garcia said  Alexandra Harney is a Reuters correspondent 
Catholic College Rescinds Invitation to Speaker Defending Same-Sex Marriage,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/education/catholic-college-rescinds-invitation-to-speaker-defending-same-sex-marriage.html,Providence College a Roman Catholic school in Rhode Island has canceled a lecture in support of samesex marriage on Thursday by a gay philosophy professor citing a church document that says that Catholic institutions should not honor those who act in defiance of our fundamental moral principles The lecturer John Corvino chairman of the philosophy department at Wayne State University in Detroit has spoken previously at more than 10 Catholic colleges and often appears in friendly debates with religious opponents of gay marriage His appearance at Providence College had been cosponsored by nine departments and programs and some of the organizers said the cancellation surprised them The cancellation was announced by the colleges provost on Saturday one day after the Roman Catholic Church was rocked by the publication of a long interview in which Pope Francis called for the church to find a new balance by refraining from frequent condemnations of homosexuality abortion and birth control and emphasizing mercy and love In his email announcing the cancellation Hugh F Lena the provost and senior vice president of Providence College cited a document produced by the American bishops in 2004 Catholics in Political Life to support the decision And he said that college policy dictates that that both sides of a controversial issue are to be presented fairly and equally There has often been tension between the ideal of academic freedom and the mandate to uphold church teaching at Catholic colleges When the University of Notre Dame invited President Obama to give the commencement speech there in 2009 it set off widespread protests because of his support for abortion rights Notre Dame stood firm But Anna Maria College a small Catholic school in Massachusetts rescinded its commencement speech invitation to Victoria Reggie Kennedy the widow of Senator Edward M Kennedy and a supporter of gay marriage after the local bishop objected Dr Corvino is the author of the new book Whats Wrong with Homosexuality and is known for cowriting a book and appearing in debates with Maggie Gallagher the former head of the National Organization for Marriage which opposes samesex marriage He said he had been invited to speak at Providence College by Christopher Arroyo an associate professor of philosophy Dr Arroyo declined an interview request on Monday Dr Corvino said he had been very interested in speaking on a conservative campus like Providence College because he was preaching to the choir at most of his talks now I want to convince them that samesex marriage is not only possible but is also a good thing for the couple and good for society at large he said But I also want to engage in a deeper dialogue about issues that we agree are important He said he was conversant with Catholic theology because as a young man he had begun training to become a Capuchin Franciscan priest but left after he discerned on a retreat that he was gay Dr Corvino said that he had given lectures and debated at many Catholic colleges but that a talk at Aquinas College in Grand Rapids Mich was also canceled in 2008 The event at Providence College was initially planned as a solo lecture though Mr Corvino said he suggested that it be a debate and provided the names of several potential sparring partners Last week the organizers added Dana L Dillon a theologian at Providence College to present a response But Dr Lena the provost said in an interview lateÂ Monday night that the event was canceled because it was largely a platform for only one side and that itÂ could beÂ rescheduledÂ if it includedÂ a philosophy professor with experienceÂ arguing against Â gay marriage Fred K Drogula president of the faculty senate at Providence College and an associate professor of history said he could not find a college policy dictating that every lecture must have an equal opposing viewpoint And he said it was inappropriate to invoke the bishops document Catholics in Political Life because it applied primarily to politicians Dr Drogula said The job of any quality academic institution is to teach students how to think critically which includes challenging testing and defending our ideas
Rubio Withdraws Support for Gay Black Judgeâ€™s Nomination to the Federal Bench,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/us/politics/rubio-withdraws-support-for-gay-black-judges-nomination-to-the-federal-bench.html,MIAMI  The nomination of a gay black Miami judge to the federal bench will not move forward after Senator Marco Rubio announced he was withdrawing his support over concerns about the judges actions in two criminal cases Without Mr Rubios approval Judge William Thomass nomination to the Federal District Court for the Southern District of Florida in Miami is effectively blocked Judge Thomas who serves on the MiamiDade Circuit was nominated by President Obama with Mr Rubios backing more than 10 months ago Senator Bill Nelson Democrat of Florida signed off on the nomination on July 24 after a background check raised no red flags For a confirmation to proceed nominees must secure the approval of both United States senators in their home state Supporters of Judge Thomas who grew up on welfare in Pennsylvania in a family of 10 children said Mr Rubios opposition was rooted in politics not court rulings Mr Rubio a Republican has seen his allure among conservatives tumble a result of his aggressive push for immigration reform In recent weeks he has scarcely mentioned immigration keeping his focus mostly on issues with broad conservative appeal like abortion and health care Had he been confirmed by the United States Senate Judge Thomas would have become the first black openly gay man on the federal bench As much as I would like to think that politics has nothing to do with this it looks as if it does said Yolanda Strader president of Miamis largest association for black lawyers who called Judge Thomas one of the hardest working on the bench It would be unfair to prevent a wellqualified judicial nominee from proceeding with the nomination process because he is an openly gay black male Ms Strader said the group has started an information campaign on social media and is considering an online petition to help move the nomination forward A spokeswoman for Mr Rubio said in a statement that there wereÂ  concerns about Judge Thomass fitness for the federal bench Those concerns include questions about his judicial temperament and his willingness to impose appropriate criminal sentences the spokeswoman said Mr Rubio who after a long delay approved the nomination last week of another black Florida judge took issue with Judge Thomass actions in two criminal cases But in one of the cases involving a sentencing in a hitandrun Mr Rubios criticism was blunted by both the lead prosecutor in the case and the administrative judge for 11th Judicial Circuit criminal division Both of them wrote letters to Mr Rubio who felt the sentence was too lenient saying that Judge Thomas acted fairly and well within the law Early this year Judge Thomas sentenced Michele Traverso 26 who killed a bicyclist to 226 months in prison Investigators suspected that Mr Traverso who was enrolled in a drugcourt program for cocaine had been drinking before the accident Mr Traverso did not turn himself in until the day after the bicyclists death The prosecutor said the case was hamstrung from the start The delay in surrendering to the police meant that bloodalcohol levels could not be measured As a result prosecutors could not charge Mr Traverso with driving under the influence only with leaving the scene of an accident What is more his lawyer told the court that he and not his client was to blame for the delay in Mr Traversos surrender Another complication is that Mr Traverso suffers from a potentially fatal immunological disorder that makes him susceptible to infection An aunt and an uncle both died young from the disease Mr Traverso had already served nearly a year so he was permitted to serve out the rest in a Miami jail where his doctor could treat him and then serve two years of house arrest The sentence fell within the guidelines In a letter of support for the judge to Mr Rubio the prosecutor Jane Anderson said the sentence was disappointing but understandable given the complicated facts in the case and the lesser charge The judge conducted the sentencing hearing with compassion and careful judgment she said Mr Rubio also expressed concern over Judge Thomass decision to keep out a confession in a murder case involving five defendants in which a young woman was raped and shot to death and her boyfriend left for dead Judge Thomas ruled that two of the defendants in the case including a 15yearold either had not been properly read their Miranda rights or had not understood them The rulings were appealed and Judge Thomas was partially affirmed by the appellate court All five defendants ultimately were convicted or pleaded guilty The Congressional Black Caucus has been critical of Republicans in Congress who are holding up judicial nominations including for a number of black judges The group said that out of 787 federal positions only 95 are held by black judges That is a slender reed for Senator Rubio to hang this on said Representative Alcee Hastings Democrat of Florida referring to the two court cases Decisions in this country need to be made by females and Latinos and Asians and blacks
How Did Conservatives Get This Radical?,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/09/24/how-did-conservatives-get-this-radical/,"Whether they did so out of conviction or fear House Republicans bent to the will of the dominant Tea Party faction of their party and voted 228 to 1 on Sept 20 to make continued financing of the federal government
                                        contingent on defunding the Affordable Care Act Whatever you think of this strategy the tactics are radical How can Republicans courting a fullfledged fiscal crisis claim to be conservative Peter Wehner who held key posts in the last three Republican presidential administrations declares that they cannot This is not conservatism either in terms of disposition or governing philosophy It is rather the product of intemperate minds and fairly radical and thoroughly unconservative tendencies

                                        what they see as the core differences between conservatives and liberals Since the emergence of intensified political polarization in the late 1970s there has been a burst of studies examining linkages between ideology partisan identification and moral values Much of the more recent research in this vein suggests that Tea Party conservatives and their political leaders in and out of Congress are a special subset within the broader universe of conservatives Christopher Parker and Matt Barreto who teach political science at the University of Washington recently published Change They Cant Believe In

                                        conservatism and what they describe as Tea Party reactionary or pseudoconservatism In response to my inquiry Parker wrote in an email Ultimately a conservative  in the classical sense  wishes to preserve a stable society Of course this includes stable institutions and observing the rule of law For these reasons and several
                                            more a conservative prefers evolutionary more incremental change to revolutionary change revolutionary change threatens the stability conservatives seek to conserve Hence conservatives reluctantly accept
                                            change  so long as it isnt revolutionary They do so for the sake of stability and order Moreover for the sake of order and stability real conservatives are amenable to political compromise
                                            with their opponents Conversely according to Parker reactionary conservatives are backwards looking generally fearful of losing their way of life in a wave of social change To preserve their groups social status theyre willing to undermine longestablished norms and institutions
                                             including the law They see political differences as a war of good versus evil in which their opponents are their enemies For them compromise is commensurate with defeat  not political expediency
                                            They believe social change is subversive to the America with which theyve become familiar ie white mainly male Protestant native born straight Real Americans in other words Parker and Barreto conducted surveys to see if Tea Party conservatives differ from nonTea Party conservatives As the graphs in Figures 13 show the two kinds of conservatives diverge significantly on key issues

Population Control Is Called Big Revenue Source in China,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/world/asia/chinese-provinces-collected-billions-in-family-planning-fines-lawyer-says.html,BEIJING  Nineteen provincelevel governments in China collected a total of 27 billion in fines last year from parents who had violated family planning laws which usually limit couples to one child a lawyer who had requested the data said Thursday The lawyer Wu Youshui of Zhejiang Province sent letters in July to 31 provincial governments asking officials to disclose how much they had collected in 2012 in family planning fines referred to as social support fees He said he suspected that the fines were a substantial source of revenue for governments in poor parts of China We want to shed light on how the current family planning policy works Mr Wu said via telephone Many are debating reform of the family planning policy Learning how it works may help with that debate Mr Wus findings were first published Thursday by Beijing News Mr Wu opposes Chinas onechild policy and has written on his microblog he is a Christian Last year some prominent scholars and policy advisers started a major effort to push central officials to fundamentally change or repeal a law that generally punishes families for having more than one child That push comes as economists point out that Chinas economic growth rate is likely to slow because its pool of cheap young workers is dwindling as the population ages The 2010 national census showed that the average birthrate for a Chinese household was 1181 it was lower in cities and higher in rural areas Some scholars say that number is extraordinarily low and the real figure is probably a bit higher The family planning regulations are prone to abuse because local officials are often evaluated by their superiors based on how well they keep down the populations of their areas There have been wellknown cases of forced abortions or sterilizations across China Last year Chinese Internet users sympathized with the plight of Pan Chunyan who said she had been abducted by officials in Daji Township when she was eight months pregnant with her third child The officials forced her to have an abortion at a hospital In June 2012 another woman Feng Jianmei was forced to abort a 7monthold fetus in Shaanxi Province in a case that also ignited national outrage Parents in other parts of China have accused local family planning officials of abducting babies who are considered extra children in a household and selling them to orphanages sometimes for 3000 per baby The Beijing News report said Mr Wu the lawyer obtained data showing that Jiangxi Province had collected the most in fines of the 19 provinces that replied to him it amassed 554 million in 2012 Sichuan was second with 400 million and Fujian was third with 340 million The provinces that collected the least were Qinghai with 572000 and Ningxia with about 2 million Both have low populations compared with most other provinces and they are also home to many rural residents and ethnic minorities who have more leeway in the number of children they can have without incurring fines The 12 provincelevel governments that did not provide data told Mr Wu that the fines were collected at the county level and used there so the provincial governments had no information On Sept 18 the National Audit Office published a report on the collection and spending of the social support fee after it reviewed nine provinces The office looked at five counties in each of those provinces It found that extra children were not properly counted that there were no uniform standards for collecting the fees and that management of the fees was poor Mr Wu said that he suspected that the fines had been managed in a chaotic way and that it appeared that countylevel officials overseeing the punishments had been unsupervised He said the fee should be abolished altogether and it should be the familys decision how many children to have

Texasâ€™ Davis Is Expected to Enter Race for Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/27/us/politics/wendy-davis-is-expected-to-run-for-texas-governor.html,HOUSTON  Wendy Davis the Texas state senator whose filibuster in June against an abortion bill backed by the states powerful Republicans catapulted her to national political prominence has told supporters and potential donors that she plans to announce next week that she will run for governor according to Democrats in Texas and Washington Ms Daviss decision has the potential to turn the race to determine Gov Rick Perrys successor into a rare competitive showdown between longsuffering Texas Democrats and the Republican conservatives who have ruled state politics for decades She would enter the race as a substantial underdog but her candidacy would represent the most serious challenge to the Republican lock on the office Two Republicans Mr Perry and George W Bush have held the office since the party began its winning streak in governors races in 1994 with Mr Bushs victory over the incumbent Ann W Richards For weeks Ms Daviss travels to Washington her speeches meetings with potential supporters and public statements have suggested her intentions On her Twitter feed on Thursday she wrote A week from today Im announcing something big Can you chip in now to show the strength of our grassroots network Last week she emailed supporters telling them that she would answer the question about her political future next Thursday and that she was excited about what we can do together in the future The Democratic Governors Association meanwhile has been running a banner headline on its home page reading Wendys Big News A spokesman for Ms Davis said Thursday only that she had made a decision and that it would be revealed next week Matt Angle a longtime adviser to Ms Davis and the director of the Lone Star Project a Democratic policy group said he was looking forward to her decision adding All of us believe that Wendy deserves the right to make that announcement herself Until she makes that announcement there is no guarantee what her final decision will be But absent an official announcement people involved in Republican and Democratic politics said word had spread in Austin of her intention to run and that some of the organizational planning and machinery for her campaign was already being put into place Her campaign would be based in Fort Worth a large portion of which she has represented in the State Senate Â Her announcement next week will take place in the Fort Worth suburb of Haltom City at the same coliseum where she received her high school diploma Ms Daviss Republican rival seems likely to be Greg Abbott the Texas attorney general He has raised more than 20 million and is tremendously popular among conservatives many of whom support him for taking on the Obama administration on legal fronts including federal environmental regulations and the presidents health care law Most independent political analysts view Mr Abbott as an almost unbeatable candidate and the conventional wisdom is that Ms Daviss campaign would be considered a success if she runs a close race in a state where Republicans hold every state office  But some Democrats say they are more optimistic I think her chances are very good said Mark W White Jr a Democratic governor from 1983 to 1987 who defeated a wealthy Republican incumbent William P Clements in 1982 but lost to him four years later in a rematch I compare it to my chances of winning when I decided to run for governor Everybody said it was impossible to do and I was able to do it and theyre probably telling her the same thing Shes got the advantage that David had over Goliath Ms Daviss filibuster which was watched online across the country was an attempt to block the Republicancontrolled Legislature from passing some of the toughest restrictions on abortion in the country The bill ultimately passed but her filibuster gave her and Democrats a boost of momentum and cash Shortly before and after her filibuster she received nearly 1 million in campaign contributions in just two weeks much of it from people who gave her 50 or less Political analysts said that was small change compared with the roughly 40 million she would need to raise to compete on a statewide level with Mr Abbott an ally of Mr Perrys Abbott is an intelligent and disciplined candidate who is very unlikely to commit the type of unforced catastrophic errors that could cause him to be defeated said Mark P Jones a political science professor at Rice University in Houston It would take a political miracle for Wendy Davis to win Republicans dominate Texas politics They control both chambers of the State Legislature and hold all statewide elected offices The last time a Democrat was elected to statewide office was nearly 19 years ago when Attorney General Dan Morales Lt Gov Bob Bullock and a handful of others won reelection in 1994 Democrats running statewide in Texas have lost by an average of 12 to 16 points for the better part of two decades said Calvin Jillson a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas Some Democrats however note that for 105 years from 1874 to 1979 an unbroken string of Democratic governors led the state They and other analysts said that even if Ms Davis were defeated her campaign would lay the foundation for future wins and help revive the party particularly as minorities grow as a share of the population  Her entry into the race will be a shot in the arm for Democratic morale but will also likely inspire a counterreaction among the conservative wing of the Republican Party especially social conservatives who view Davis through the prism of abortion politics said James Henson director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin
Rights Groups and Clinics Sue Texas Over Provisions in Its New Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/us/rights-groups-and-clinics-sue-texas-over-abortion-law.html,National womens rights groups and Texas abortion clinics filed suit on Friday in federal court in Texas seeking to block provisions of a new state law that they said would have dramatic and draconian effects on womens access to the procedure The suit targets two provisions of a sweeping antiabortion law that Texas adopted in July The rules are scheduled to take effect on Oct 29 The first is a requirement that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital Many medical experts say the rule which was passed in the name of safety is medically unnecessary and that the requirement cannot be met by clinics in smaller communities In a telephone news conference on Friday Texas clinic owners said that the rule may force onethird of the states 36 abortion clinics to shut down leaving large areas of the state without ready access The second requires the use in socalled medication abortions of what many doctors called an outdated less effective and more dangerous drug protocol Under guidelines based on research studies the twodrug combination is widely used through the ninth week of pregnancy and accounts for about one in five abortions nationwide Under the Texas law clinics would have to follow instead a regime described in the original Food and Drug Administration approval in 2000 Based on initial studies it required doses three times those of the current protocol and an extra visit to the clinic and was recommended only through seven weeks of pregnancy Politicians are interfering with the personal medical decisions of women who already have the least access to birth control and preventive health care said Cecile Richards president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America one of the groups bringing the suit Gov Rick Perry who has said he hopes to make abortion a thing of the past signed the legislation in July after calling a special session of the Legislature to pass it The bill came under a national spotlight when Wendy Davis a Democratic state senator temporarily derailed passage in the Republicancontrolled Legislature with a filibuster In a written comment on the lawsuit Friday Lt Gov David Dewhurst attacked abortion rights groups for pursuing an agenda that disregards the value of human life and accepts subpar medical care for women undergoing a serious surgical procedure Mr Perry and Republican leaders described the law as important to protect womens health Opponents called it an unconstitutional attack on abortion rights and a thinly disguised effort to shutter clinics This law is part of a coordinated national strategy by antiabortion groups seeking to make it impossible to obtain an abortion said Jennifer Dalven director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union another party to the suit along with the Center for Reproductive Rights The suit Planned Parenthood et al v Abbott was filed Friday morning in Federal District Court for the Western District of Texas in Austin The goal is to obtain a preliminary injunction to prevent the two measures from taking effect Emily Horne a legislative associate with Texas Right to Life said that I believe the law will be found constitutional and that over all its a great thing for womens health Similar laws are under litigation in several other states and in most cases have been blocked In Alabama Mississippi North Dakota and Wisconsin courts have said that requiring physicians to have admitting privileges was an unjustified obstacle to abortion rights Courts in North Dakota and Oklahoma have struck down laws imposing the earlier drug protocol for medication abortions but one remains in effect in Ohio Fridays lawsuit does not challenge two other hotly disputed provisions of the Texas law  a requirement that all abortion clinics meet the costly architectural and staffing standards of ambulatory surgery centers and a ban on nearly all abortions at 20 weeks after conception based on the disputed theory that the fetus can feel pain at that point The surgery center requirement which major doctors groups say is medically unnecessary for all but the lateststage abortions could force a majority of the states abortion clinics to close But it does not take effect until September 2014 giving rights advocates time to consider their response Texas was the 12th state to adopt a 20week ban which legal experts say is in conflict with Supreme Court decisions granting a right to abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb usually at around 24 weeks Courts have blocked such measures in the three states where they have been challenged but they remain in effect in others In Fridays news conference the groups said they were studying the issue but for now were focusing on the two provisions likely to have the most immediate and farreaching impacts If the admitting privilege rule takes effect they said the sole abortion clinics in Harlingen Killeen Lubbock McAllen and Waco and all three providers in Fort Worth would have to halt services forcing some women to make multiple trips of more than 100 miles to obtain an abortion In Texas and elsewhere many clinics outside the largest cities must rely on visiting doctors who are not eligible for local admitting privileges Many religiously affiliated hospitals also refuse to grant privileges to doctors involved with abortion
"Hispanics Grow Cool to G.O.P., Poll Finds",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/us/politics/poll-shows-hispanic-shift-away-from-the-gop.html,AUSTIN Tex  A new survey shows that Hispanics the nations largest minority group have grown increasingly negative toward the Republican Party during the political battle over changing immigration law and lean surprisingly liberal on social issues like gay marriage  a combination of factors that presents a steep challenge for Republicans in trying to win back Hispanic voters More than 6 in 10 Hispanic respondents said they felt closer to the Democratic Party than they had in the past while only 3 in 10 said they felt closer to the Republican Party When Hispanics were asked to offer descriptions of the parties 48 percent of the responses about the Republicans were negative associations like intolerant and out of touch while 22 percent of the responses for the Democrats were negative The outlook for Republicans has grown increasingly negative since 2004 when President George W Bush won reelection with 44 percent of the Hispanic vote The survey released Friday by the Public Religion Research Institute a nonprofit research group in Washington found that 56 percent of registered Hispanic voters identified with the Democrats while 19 percent said they identified with Republicans and 19 percent as independents The religious identities of Hispanics are also changing with 69 percent saying they grew up Catholic but only 53 percent saying they identify as Catholic now Those saying they are evangelical Protestants have increased by six percentage points to 13 percent But Hispanics like Americans as a whole are increasingly claiming no religion at all 7 percent of Hispanics say they were raised in a faith but now have no religious affiliation bringing the total percentage of Hispanics with no religion to 12 percent Robert P Jones the chief executive of the institute said in an interview If these trends continue what well see is a growing polarization among Hispanics anchored on one end by evangelicals who tend to be conservative and on the other end by religiously unaffiliated Hispanics The unaffiliated voted for Obama by 80 percent so you see really different political profiles Conservatives have often claimed that Hispanics are a natural constituency for the Republican Party because they care about what the party considers family values This holds true on abortion with 52 percent saying abortion should be illegal in all or most cases and 47 percent saying it should be legal But on samesex marriage 55 percent of Hispanics favor allowing gay and lesbian couples to marry compared with 43 percent who are opposed And Hispanics in the poll said they were far more likely to vote for candidates based on their stances on immigration than on their stance on abortion or gay marriage The parties handling of immigration has been a major factor swaying Hispanics allegiances In the survey 42 percent of Hispanics said that Democrats were better able to deal with immigration while 16 percent said Republicans would do better But in a finding that could be tantalizing for both parties 21 percent of Hispanics polled said neither party is best able to handle immigration and 17 percent said both parties are equally able to deal with immigration About one in five registered Hispanic voters and more than onethird of Hispanic citizens who are not registered to vote said they were independents suggesting they might be up for grabs between the parties Latinos named health care as one of their primary concerns and they were sharply divided on President Obamas health care law Nearly half 48 percent said they would support repealing the law while 47 percent opposed repeal a finding that could be promising for Republicans battling that law Hispanics in the poll had strong ideas about resolving illegal immigration Sixtyseven percent of Latinos surveyed said unauthorized immigrants in the country should be allowed to become American citizens if they meet certain requirements Only 17 percent said they should be allowed to become legal permanent residents but not citizens An even smaller number 10 percent said they should be deported In June the Senate passed a broad immigration bill that includes a path to citizenship for all of an estimated 117 million immigrants here illegally Republican leaders in the House said they would not take up that measure but that they could act on smaller bills that would strengthen enforcement and make other fixes to the system Some Republicans have said they would consider legal status for illegal immigrants but without any path to citizenship Half of Hispanic adults are immigrants born outside the United States But in contrast to widespread perceptions that many Latinos are here illegally and do not speak English well the report cites census data showing that twothirds of Hispanic adults are United States citizens and about twothirds either speak English primarily or are bilingual The poll was conducted between Aug 23 and Sept 3 and was released at a conference of religion news writers in Austin Online interviews were conducted in English and Spanish with 1563 Hispanic adults citizens and noncitizens who were part of the GfK KnowledgePanel a nationally representative probabilityÂ sample of Americans and the margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points
Congress Cracks Up,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/28/opinion/collins-congress-cracks-up.html,Our challenge today is to explain how Congress evolved into our national nutcase I am thinking mainly of the House Republicans Back in the good old days last week these were the guys who said they would vote to raise the debt ceiling only if Obamacare was axed and the Keystone XL pipeline was built Ah last week Giants strode the earth last week Last week our nation was governed by men and women who were as a matter of principle willing to pay the nations creditors when the bills were due just as long as the president canceled his central domestic initiative and oil shippers got a new pipe But that was then This week the House Republican leaders were looking at a long long list of musthaves that also included changes in regulations relating to coal ash reduction in Civil Service pensions restrictions on malpractice suits and an end to some greenhouse gas regulations  And their members found that list too restrictive Behindthescenes discussion continued about more things the Republicans could demand A ban on lateterm abortions A trilliondollar budget cut Bring back the gold standard Bring back the bustle Its 2013 and anything is possible So what do you think is wrong with these people Thanks to gerrymandered Congressional districts and the Tea Party we do seem to have a surprising number of elected officials who actually dont believe that raising the debt limit so the government can pay its bills is a good plan All that does is just say Well youve got a little bit more credit  keep spendingÂ  Representative Walter Jones of North Carolina once told a radio interviewer But theres got to be more to it than that Lets try to think of three other reasons the United States Congress continues to behave as if its playing the Jack Nicholson part in The Shining Ill go first 1 The Republicans are desperately obsessively demonizing Obamacare to cover up the fact that they dont want to do anything to Medicare or Social Security Those used to be the partys obsession  remember privatizing Social Security But that was before they noticed that the entire Republican base is on Social Security  Ranting about Obamacare which one New Hampshire politician recently compared to the Fugitive Slave Act is an excellent way to give the impression that youre fighting to reduce entitlements without having to do anything about the actual entitlements  2 Its all about Twitter Social media have transformed Congresss younger generation While much of the Senate is arguably too old to know how to use the TV remote three of the four leaders of this weeks faux filibuster are 42 Twitter in particular makes politicians even more selfobsessed than they used to be Talking about tomorrows DefundObamacare vote tonight on Hannity Be sure to tune in twittered Senator Ted Cruz on Thursday Cruz kept demanding that the Senate listen to the American people but he really meant that they should listen to his Twitter followers A politician riding on a wave of tweets feels as if the nation is cheering his every word even when the nation is actually reading the sports page while a select splinter of hardcore supporters manically pound away on their smartphones A hundred thousand people cheering you on in the social media feels like a mass movement But this is a gigantic country You can find 100000 people who believe in a secret plot by Belgium to corner the market on beetroot Richard Baker the coauthor of The American Senate says the late Senator Robert Byrd waged a war against cellphones on the Senate floor When he entered the room there was this whooshing under the desks But Byrd is gone and now we have Ted Cruz  3 Zombie apocalypse Only possible explanation On Friday the Senate finally managed to vote to keep the government running until midNovember when wed get to do this all over again Its now up to the House which will be having an unusual working weekend while the Republicans decide whether to pass the Senate bill and move on or festoon it with antiObamacare amendments The majority whip Kevin McCarthy suggested that his colleagues might want to join him for an evening showing of the movie Prisoners One Republican aide worried that the media might read too much into the title what with the country being held hostage to the Houses current psychosis and all The media are actually disappointed that McCarthy passed up Insidious and Despicable Me Cynics would say that keeping the government going for a few more weeks is just the kind of modest uncontroversial proposal that automatically vanishes into the black hole that is the current House of Representatives But maybe theres hope After all on Friday the House members did show they could pass legislation in a purposeful bipartisan fashion They approved a bill naming a building in Virginia after a deceased federal worker 
Abortion and Fetal Pain,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/opinion/abortion-and-fetal-pain.html,To the Editor When and whether a human fetus experiences pain may be a scientific issue Complex Science at Issue in Politics of Fetal Pain front page Sept 17 but in the abortion debate this is really just a red herring Imagine that it could be proved that the fetus does not experience pain or that its pain could be eliminated with some sort of intrauterine anesthetic Would this lead any abortion opponents to say Oh I guess abortion is OK after all I doubt it The question of fetal pain is not primarily a scientific issue but an emotional one used politically to promote the view that a woman should not have a right to make her own reproductive decisions JAMES PAULSON Oshkosh Wis Sept 18 2013   The writer is a professor of chemistry at the University of Wisconsin Oshkosh
Lhota Seeks to Persuade a Liberal City to Elect a Disciple of Goldwater,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/30/nyregion/lhota-seeks-to-persuade-a-liberal-city-to-elect-a-disciple-of-goldwater.html,A littleknown underdog in a hotly contested race Joseph J Lhota knew his fledgling campaign needed a miracle So the budgetminded undergraduate laid out a bold plan an investigation into the finances of the Georgetown University campus pub where students were complaining about the runaway cost of beer and pizza It has obviously lost all sense of fiscal control Mr Lhota wrote of the pub in a sobersounding campaign pamphlet in the winter of 1975 It was a signature Lhota blend of fiscal discipline a pub with cheaper beer and social laissezfaire let students buy cheaper beer And it worked catapulting him to a seat on the student senate his first elected office  A cerebral and outspoken Republican who came of age in the tumultuous era of Watergate and leftwing campus ferment Mr Lhota 58 has long sought ways to make his limitedgovernment views appeal to liberalleaning peers Now running for mayor of New York he faces the ultimate test of his ideological salesmanship persuading an overwhelmingly Democratic electorate to pick a leader who cites Barry Goldwater and Margaret Thatcher as his intellectual forebears In a city accustomed to Republican candidates who choose their party out of convenience not conviction Mr Lhota is a lifelong conservative with deepseated but idiosyncratic beliefs about governments role in society even as he seeks to direct a sprawling municipal apparatus that spends billions of dollars each year on social services and spread the gospel of banning smoking and trans fats In college Mr Lhota eschewed protests in favor of nights in the gallery of the United States Senate where he sat rapt as Mr Goldwater his boyhood hero orated on the floor He took a shine to supplyside economics long before the term Reaganomics was coined and developed a revulsion at Marxism a hostility Mr Lhota expressed last week when he fiercely criticized his Democratic rival Bill de Blasio for sympathizing with the leftist Sandinista government in Nicaragua in the 1980s But Mr Lhotas conservatism also has a libertarian hue he supports samesex marriage abortion rights and the legalization of marijuana and he is quick to distance himself from the moral prescriptiveness of the national Republican Party He has occasionally called himself a libertarian but he recently disavowed the term saying too many New Yorkers confuse the label with  in his words  Tea Party crap  Joe is a unique political creature in a city that tends to be more black and white said Elliot G Sander a Georgetown classmate who like Mr Lhota once led the Metropolitan Transportation Authority In an interview Mr Lhota described himself as a champion of the individual who nevertheless believes that government in moderation can play a pragmatic role in bettering society Government should steer not row he said sitting in a cramped campaign office overlooking Grand Central Terminal Government is to point you in the right direction and not to do everything for you I was born a limitedgovernment person Mr Lhota added Ive always had this streak going through me A headstrong and independent child who bristled at rules Mr Lhota grew up in the Bronx and in Lindenhurst on Long Island the son of a New York City policeman and grandson of a firefighter Although his family rarely discussed politics at home it was an era when urban governments saddled with runaway spending and labor disputes were headed toward decline and Mr Lhota recalled an early tug toward libertarianism His grandfather a Democrat battled City Hall when his asphalt street in the Bronx was raised without residents permission blocking entrances to garages and basements My grandfathers stoop went down to three steps said Mr Lhota who was 5 at the time For a kid like me who loved to play stoopball it was unbelievable He devoured the Federalist Papers in school but it was Senator Goldwaters 1964 presidential run that had him riveted taken by the candidates Western ruggedness and contrarian bent There were arguments at the dinner table with relatives who supported President Lyndon B Johnson Known as the founder of the modern conservative movement Mr Goldwater was a libertarian who supported abortion rights and had a penchant for blunt impolitic talk  not unlike Mr Lhota today He was not your typical politician Mr Lhota said He believed the government has no role whatsoever in making decisions which are purely personal and I believe that Arriving in Washington for college in 1973 Mr Lhota was accepted into the Institute on Comparative Political and Economic Systems a rightleaning summer boot camp for undergraduates The institute was the brainchild of a group of conservatives including William F Buckley Jr who were concerned about the upheavals of the 1960s and wanted to educate a new generation in what they described as core American principles of freedom individual responsibility and the free market Mr Lhota was later featured on a brochure as a notable alumnus There Mr Lhota met the man who would be his foremost intellectual influence George J Viksnins a Georgetown professor and a fiercely antiCommunist Latvian refugee who preached an early version of trickledown economics Dr Viksnins who died last year was a singular character bearded garrulous with an acrid Gauloise cigarette permanently clenched in one hand He and Mr Lhota hit it off immediately The two became close  Mr Lhota often joined the professor for evenings at his offcampus home where they would drink smoke and play poker At Georgetown Mr Lhota enrolled in Dr Viksninss courses in which the professor taught the theories of Joseph Schumpeter who argued that capitalism would be destroyed by the attacks of an idle intellectual class He made more sense in economics than any other professor I ever had Mr Lhota recalled In Latvia Dr Viksnins had seen his father murdered by a Communist regime and he instilled a deep antipathy toward socialism in his student I still am a virulent anticommunist Mr Lhota said It is a bad system an immoral system and one that takes away the rights of people and the rights of individuals And everywhere its gone its failed In his junior year Mr Lhota decided to apply his theories about government to the real thing seeking a seat on the student senate His campaign platform besides calling for the beerandpizza audit took on an antiregulatory tone demanding that Georgetowns largest studentrun business remain apolitical and keep its leadership separate from the government He also oversaw the candidacy for student body president of a classmate David T Ralston Jr whose service as an ROTC officer made him a longshot in a race held near the end of the Vietnam War It was Mr Lhotas bridgebuilding skill that clinched a surprise victory Mr Ralston said He is disarmingly frank and I think that has been his real key to bringing in people who may not ideologically agree with him Mr Ralston now a lawyer in Washington recalled in an interview Despite his student government successes few friends believed Mr Lhota a business major would pursue a political career Often strapped  occasionally because Dr Viksnins had defeated him at poker  Mr Lhota worked jobs at odd hours on campus to help pay for tuition and student loans including an overnight shift as a security guard Government work he recalled recently wasnt on the agenda It was not until 1994 when he was lured from his job as a municipal finance banker to join the administration of Rudolph W Giuliani that Mr Lhota had another chance to put into practice his ideas on government  and at times encounter their limitations As director of the office of management and budget and then deputy mayor he slashed the city budget and took pride in conspicuous prudence even in the smallest of monetary matters When a City Hall press secretary brought bagels and coffee for reporters attending a meeting on budget cuts Mr Lhota scolded her saying the expense could be perceived as lavish After asking the city to remove a glass covering from an oil painting in his office  a portrait of James J Walker the sartorially gifted gentleman mayor who resigned in disgrace in 1932  Mr Lhota canceled the request after learning that a fee was involved Lets save money Mr Lhota wrote in a note to an aide Put Jimmie Walker up asis Mr Lhota kept at his desk quotes from Winston Churchill and a videocassette of the movie Patton starring George C Scott which he switched on to inspire colleagues He started a City Hall book club where he assigned Thirteen Days a history of the Cuban Missile Crisis But he also discovered that libertarian theories could sometimes clash with municipal reality When Mr Giuliani in 1994 supported a partial ban on smoking in restaurants Mr Lhota a cigar enthusiast resisted describing smoking as a personal matter outside the governments purview The ban was imposed anyway Looking back on the episode Mr Lhota now concedes that he was wrong I thought the world was going to come to an end and then it didnt he said It was the right thing to do Nowadays he added Im practical when it comes to these issues
Rematch for Nassau Executive Could Be Bellwether of National Trend,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/02/nyregion/rematch-for-nassau-executive-could-be-bellwether-of-national-trend.html,A fair question to ask about the race for executive of Nassau County is Why would anyone want the job The county the states richest and the nations 13th wealthiest by median household income according to the Census Bureau is in virtual receivership as a result of decades of lavish spending on police and other services and mounting debt that brought it to the verge of bankruptcy 13 years ago Budgets and labor contracts proposed by the incumbent county executive Edward P Mangano can be stymied by a stateappointed control board the Nassau County Interim Finance Authority Nevertheless Thomas R Suozzi who held the job from 2002 through 2009 and Mr Mangano the man to whom he lost it by 386 votes both want the position and are back for a rematch in November Its the Thrilla in Mineola said Lawrence Levy executive dean of the National Center for Suburban Studies at Hofstra University tailoring the popular title of the 1975 heavyweight rematch between Muhammad Ali and Joe Frazier in Manila to the seat of this suburban county that Jay Gatsby Theodore Roosevelt Charles A Lindbergh and Levittown made famous Its also a race that some political experts think could be in Mr Levys words the canary in the coal mine for national politics in 2014 and 2016 in the way the 2009 Nassau race was when it presaged a Tea Partyled tax revolt in 2010 that threw Democrats out of Congress and the statehouses This year the Nassau race could be an early test of whether Tea Party issues still have appeal Mr Levy said Homeowners are emphatically fed up with steep property taxes but it is not clear what other steps they will tolerate to restore the health of county finances Mr Mangano is hoping to stigmatize Mr Suozzi for raising taxes while Mr Suozzi is accusing Mr Mangano of imperiling economic prospects by heavy borrowing Mr Mangano a ruggedly built Long Islandaccented 51yearold lawyer who put himself through college as a janitor says he wants to stay in the job simply because he loves his home county and found a sense of accomplishment at the helm He was raised in Bethpage then the home of Long Islands largest employer Grumman Aircraft and raised two sons there In a breakfast interview at a favorite diner he claimed he pared the work force he inherited from Mr Suozzi to 7301 employees from 9177 in 2009 and from a peak of 13000 in 1998 He reduced the countys bond indebtedness by 25 million though it is still almost 345 billion As a result he argued bonds appraised at near junk level now have an A rating just one notch below the top The countys economy is humming Mr Mangano said with one of the regions lowest unemployment rates  58 percent  and 15000 jobs created at the old Grumman site alone which is now an industrial complex The county anticipates a 94 percent upsurge in sales taxes this year to 112 billion he said Our plan is working he insisted Nassau County is on the road to being the strongest county financially in the country By contrast he said Mr Suozzi drastically increased tax rates which he said stifled the local economy Most memorably he said Mr Suozzi imposed a tax on homeowners energy use that Mr Mangano said he was proud to repeal even though the tax had yielded 38 million in revenue for the county Mr Mangano was condemned by the financial control board for the repeal Mr Suozzi who is also 51 a lawyer and father of three rejected those characterizations in an interview in his law office in which he outlined his campaign motifs In the 1960s and 1970s Nassau County was the dream place and New York City was the joke with Johnny Carson joking about the muggers and graffiti he said But New York City is booming and Nassau County is in decline The roads and parks are in disrepair and were the ones who have a financial control board Mr Suozzi trim and welltailored with boyish good looks said he cut the work force by 1200 without layoffs reduced police overtime raised taxes only in his first year and cut borrowing As a result the county received 13 upgrades of its bonds he said A member of a dynasty in the politics of Glen Cove he his father and his uncle were mayors and his cousin is the current mayor Mr Suozzi said he lost in 2009 because he overconfidently skimped on campaign spending wanting to squirrel away money for ambitious future runs In 2006 he lost the Democratic primary for governor to Eliot Spitzer Too many Democrats stayed home in 2009 24 percent showed up compared with a 36 percent turnout for Republicans I didnt work hard enough he said I took the race for granted I didnt see that the Tea Party was rising that people were mad at Obama and the Democrats were not in favor Mr Suozzi likes to remind voters of Mr Manganos affection for the Tea Party publicizing quotes from Mr Mangano that his fiscal policy is absolutely in line with Tea Party principles Asked about that Mr Mangano said he welcomed Tea Party support He declined to distance himself from its positions on abortion immigration and gun control issues that he said had nothing to do with running county government Mr Suozzis vision is to expand the tax base by creating livelier downtowns near railroad stations with office buildings for hightech firms and restaurants and shops that would entertain the young and keep them from moving to Manhattan or Brooklyn Nassaus houses once drew young couples eager to start families but today he said there are 30 percent fewer people between ages 25 and 34 than there were in 1990 He faulted Mr Mangano for going too far in cutting the police force  where the average pay is 130000 when overtime is included  and said Mr Mangano ended up spending more on overtime to fill staffing voids Rather than take the powerful police union head on Mr Suozzi said he would in mellower fashion try to get union leaders to understand that the goose that laid the golden eggs is dead The historically Republican countys changing demographics would seem to favor Mr Suozzi About 73 percent of the 134 million residents said they were white compared with 79 percent in the 2000 census as immigrants and minorities have moved in In April there were 371557 Democrats to 332036 Republicans Still the race will depend on which party can better turn out its troops Mr Suozzis revived spunk is evident on the hustings The other day he went to Martin Luther King Memorial Park in Uniondale and vigorously embraced AfricanAmerican community leaders Standing near Dr Kings bust Mr Suozzi told the crowd of 60 that Mr Mangano had neglected minorities and had failed to provide the schools and quality of life that hightaxed residents deserve The government of Nassau County should look like the people of Nassau County he added promising more minority appointments Wilma Tootle a retired principal said she was particularly drawn to Mr Suozzis promise to restore youth programs Our youth are lost in the streets she said We dont want our youth and underserved to always be at the bottom of the totem pole But Mr Mangano also connects well with supporters At a barbecue for veterans at Eisenhower Park he was surrounded by aging soldiers of World War II Korea and Vietnam hoping to have their problems corrected or simply pump his hand The taxes are killing us said Eileen Lamb 63 a retired nurse who lives in Syosset with her husband John a Vietnam veteran We have five kids and its driving them off the island

"In TV Ad, Lhota Cites Common Ground, and Differences, With de Blasio",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/nyregion/in-tv-ad-lhota-cites-common-ground-and-differences-with-de-blasio.html,Joseph J Lhota lagging in the polls in the race for mayor of New York City on Wednesday released the first television advertisement of the general election campaign trumpeting his liberal stances on social issues but criticizing the taxraising plan of his Democratic rival Bill de Blasio Mr Lhota a Republican needs to win over Democratic voters to have a chance to win the Nov 5 general election given the large number of Democratic voters in New York City The ad which will run in English and Spanish is the latest effort by his campaign to show that he is different from Republicans in Washington and elsewhere across the country The 30second ad begins by highlighting the common ground shared by Mr de Blasio and Mr Lhota saying that both candidates support abortion rights samesex marriage and the decriminalization of marijuana The difference a narrator asks De Blasio wants to raise taxes and supports reckless government spending Lhota wants to cut wasteful government spending putting more money back in your pocket Mr Lhota a former city budget director and deputy mayor to Rudolph W Giuliani is hoping to attract voters by presenting himself as a fiscally responsible alternative to Mr de Blasio whom he has portrayed as eager to raise taxes undisciplined with city spending and beholden to labor unions that will be negotiating new contracts with the next mayor But Mr Lhota has struggled so far to persuade many voters beyond his Republican base to consider his candidacy Two polls released last month showed Mr de Blasio ahead of Mr Lhota by more than 40 percentage points among likely voters
10 Questions for President Obama,https://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/03/10-questions-for-president-obama/,"President Obama remains stuck in a doublebarreled showdown with Congressional Republicans  over the government shutdown and over the need to raise the governments debt limit by midOctober to allow the United States Treasury to meet its obligations Mr Obama sat down for an interview with John Harwood of CNBC and The Times between meetings with Wall Street executives on the stalemate and the bipartisan leadership of Congress What follows is a condense edited version of their conversation
                                        
                                      I want to see if you can clear up a little confusion about your position on something Youve said youre not going to negotiate the destruction of your health care plan youre not going to negotiate
                                        on the debt limit Exactly what are you prepared to negotiate on and when  Im prepared to negotiate on anything I think its important for us to talk about how we create a budget that is creating jobs encouraging growth dealing with our longterm debt issues The deficits
                                        are coming down  at the fastest pace since World War II Theyve been cut in half since I came into office But we still have some challenges in terms of our longterm health care spending on Medicare
                                        in particular So whatever the leadership wants to talk about weve got a budget and we think weve got some good answers We dont expect 100 percent But what Ive also said is that it is not acceptable
                                        for one faction of one party in one chamber to say Either we get what we want or well shut down the government Or even worse  We will not allow the US Treasury to pay
                                        its bills and put the United States in default for the first time in history So the message I have for the leaders is very simple As soon as we get a clean piece of legislation that reopens the government  But no negotiation until after that  Until we get that done until we make sure that Congress allows Treasury to pay for things that Congress itself already authorized we are not going to engage in a series of negotiations And the reason John is very
                                        simple If we get in the habit where a few folks an extremist wing of one party whether its Democrat or Republican are allowed to extort concessions based on a threat of undermining the full faith and
                                        credit of the United States then any president who comes after me will find themselves unable to govern effectively And that is not something that Im going to allow to happen  Are there any circumstances under which you could make a budget deal with Republicans that does not involve new taxes  It is possible for us to make sure that we are not increasing the income tax rate Thats now behind us I think it is very important for us to continue to cut out programs that are unnecessary not working
                                        some of them need to be reformed It is important for us to deal with our longterm entitlement spending But I also think its important for us to make sure that were investing in the things that are going to help the economy grow And Ill just give you one specific example and thats our
                                        infrastructure Every business relies on good roads airports that function ports that are working And we are vastly underinvesting in what is critical for our longterm growth Weve got to find a way
                                        to pay for that I think we have to distinguish between income tax hikes which theyve always been adverse to  Loopholes too No revenue  Well I think that were going to have to close the loopholes in order to pay for those things that are going to help us grow But the important point here John is that in the normal giveandtake between parties
                                        thats something that we should be able to solve Keep in mind in terms of reopening the government what Democrats have already said theyre willing to do is to vote for reopening the government at
                                        funding levels that the Republicans have established and that the Democrats dont like So if John Boehner puts the Senate bill on the floor right now that maintains the status quo doesnt increase government spending beyond where it already is its far short of what Democrats think are
                                        necessary for us to invest in things like education and  research and development and all the things that are important But what were saying is well put everything on hold we can enter
                                        into robust negotiations around all these issues Democrats wont get 100 of what they want Republicans wont either But thats the kind of democratic process the American people expect  Before the election last year you thought there was a possibility your reelection would break the fever within the Republican Party It didnt happen Do you see this moment as a chance through
                                        this political confrontation to break the fever now  The interesting thing John is that the majority of Republicans around the country may disagree with me on a whole range of issues but they also recognize that a democracy only works if everybodys following
                                        the rules That theres going to be some giveandtake And I think thats actually true for a whole lot of Republicans on Capitol Hill  There are a lot of Republican senators and congressmen some of them whove publicly said We disagree with the president on a whole host of issues But what we shouldnt be doing is shutting down
                                        the government hurting our economy having 800000 federal workers who have no idea whether theyre going to be able to pay the bills at the end of the month and certainly what we shouldnt be doing
                                        is  creating a potential financial catastrophe if the United States defaults The last time there was even a threat of default back in 2011 we know that the economy did not grow it went backwards during that quarter As a consequence we got downgraded And thats not something that
                                        any of us should want to repeat Weve got to take that off the table  As you try to appeal to those other Republicans you think you could work with I wonder about your tone lately I have heard from you an increasing amount of exasperation an edge  even mockery sometimes You
                                        said recently I keep hoping a light bulb goes off And it gives the impression that you think that your Republican opponents are either craven or stupid or nuts Is that what you think And if
                                        you think so does it help your cause to let people see that out loud  During the course of my presidency I have bent over backwards to work with the Republican Party  and have purposely kept my rhetoric down I think Im pretty well known for being a calm guy Sometimes
                                        people think Im too calm And am I exasperated Absolutely Im exasperated Because this is entirely unnecessary We have a situation right now where if John Boehner the speaker of the House puts a bill on the floor to reopen the government at current funding levels so that we can then negotiate on a real budget that allows
                                        us to stop governing from crisis to crisis it would pass The only thing thats stopping it is that John Boehner right now has not been willing to say no to a faction of the Republican Party that are willing
                                        to burn the house down because of an obsession over my health care initiative Theyve now voted 40 times to repeal this 40 times  A law that passed the House passed the Senate was signed by me was ruled constitutional by the Supreme Court that as we speak is being implemented that is already benefiting millions of people who allow their kids
                                        to stay on their parents plan till theyre 26 that are providing rebates to families because their insurance companies have to treat them fairly that are making sure seniors are getting cheaper
                                        prescription drugs And I am exasperated with the idea that unless I say that 20 million people You cant have health insurance these folks will not reopen the government That is irresponsible If and when they
                                        vote to make sure Congress pays our bills on time so America does not default on costs its already accrued then I am prepared to have a reasonable civil negotiation around a whole slew of issues And thats
                                        reflected not just by my words but by my deeds over the last four years  Wall Streets been pretty calm about this The reaction has been Washington fighting Washington posturing yadda yadda yadda Is that the right way for them to look at it  No I think this times different I think they should be concerned And I had a chance to speak to some in the financial industry who came down for their typical trip And I told them that it is not unusual
                                        for Democrats and Republicans to disagree Thats the way the founders designed our government Democracys messy But when you have a situation in which a faction is willing potentially to default on US government obligations then we are in trouble And if theyre willing to do it now theyll be willing to do
                                        it later One thing that I often hear  is Well Mr President  even if theyre being unreasonable why cant you just go ahead and do something that makes them happy now
                                        What I have to remind people is that what were debating right now is keeping the government open for two months We would then be going through this exact same thing in the middle of Christmas shopping season
                                        Which I dont think many businesses would be interested in One thing that I know the American people are tired of and I have to assume the vast majority of businesses are tired of is this constant governing from crisis to crisis So in that sense do we need to break that
                                        fever Absolutely We have to stop doing that Lets get a budget that allows people to plan over the long term that allows us to deal with our fiscal problems in a sensible reasonable way even on an issue
                                        like health care  You know if they want to give me specific suggestions around how we can improve delivery of health insurance to people who need it and people with preexisting conditions Im happy to talk to them about it
                                        But Im not going to do it subject to the threat that somehow America defaults on its obligations I think Wall Street can have an influence CEOs around the country can have an influence I think it is important for them to recognize that this is going to have a profound impact on our economy and their
                                        bottom lines their employees and their shareholders Oftentimes when youre outside of Washington the default position both for ordinary voters for businesses for the press is to say Eh you know this is the usual squabbling Both sides are acting
                                        like spoiled children This is not one of those situations Weve got a group of folks who think that they can hold America hostage for ransom that they cant win through an election  I was looking at poll data on the health care law Very very popular among AfricanAmericans marginally popular among Hispanics very unpopular among whites What are the implications for the country on this issue
                                        and many others of politics that are polarized not just by party but by race  When you break out whats actually in the Affordable Care Act its popular among all groups If you ask the ordinary person Do you think its a good thing that insurance companies have
                                        to let young people stay on their parents plan until their 26 Absolutely Do you think its a good idea that  insurance companies have to spend 80 percent
                                        of premiums on peoples health care and not on administrative costs Absolutely Do you think its a good idea that people with preexisting conditions should be able
                                        to get health insurance They say yes So the challenge we have with the health care law is similar to the challenge weve had in our politics more broadly And that is that there have been caricatures of what weve been trying to do Theres
                                        always been some levels of polarization in our politics Those have gotten worse in part because of gerrymandering So members of Congress have no incentive to reach out to all groups Partly its gotten
                                        worse because you got these super PACs who are coming in and financing advertising that stirs up polarization And the media has gotten more polarized But I dont think when you look at the health care law specifically that its an issue thats going to break down in terms of race The majority of folks who are uninsured in this country even
                                        though theyre working and will be helped by the Affordable Care Act the majority of them are going to be white not AfricanAmerican or Hispanic  Does the shutdown at all affect the vetting of your potential Fed nominee slow that down A lot of people have said Why is he taking so long on that appointment  Well keep in mind that Ben Bernanke is still there and hes doing a fine job And this is one of the most important appointments that I make other than the Supreme Court So no the shutdown is not slowing down
                                        the vetting The person Im going to be appointing will end up being somebody who reflects the Feds dual mandate Theyre going to be making sure that they keep an eye on inflation that theyre not
                                        encouraging some of the bubbles that weve seen in our economy that have resulted in bust But theyre also going to stay focused on the fact that our unemployment rate is still too high And ordinary
                                        workers out there still need an economy thats strengthened aggregate demand thats strengthened so that we can end up putting more people back to work with better wages  Pope Francis said the other day without changing the churchs positions said the Catholic Church had become too obsessed on issues like gay rights and abortion What do you think of the popes remarks
                                        and do you see any broader applicability beyond the Catholic Church  I tell you I have been hugely impressed with the popes pronouncements He seems somebody who lives out the teachings of Christ Incredible humility Incredible sense of empathy to the least of these to the
                                        poor And hes also somebody whos I think first and foremost thinking about how to embrace people as opposed to push them away  how to find whats good in them as opposed to condemn
                                        them
                                     That spirit that sense of love and unity seems to manifest itself in not just what he says but also what he does For any religious leader thats something a quality I admire I would argue for any leader period thats a quality that I admire And so to bring it back to the issues here in Washington no party has a monopoly on wisdom I think that a lot of folks in the Republican Party
                                        who disagree with me are good people who love their country and love their kids want whats best for their communities But part of the genius of the founders was that they were able to set up a system where even when there are profound disagreements we can work those disagreements out in a sensible civil way And ultimately the experiment
                                        in selfgovernment continues The fight that were having right now is not about the health care law its not about a particular budget what it has to do with is do we continue with that process where we have elections the majorities
                                        are determined theres some protections for minorities in the system but we are able to strike compromises and then move forward If we cant do that  this countrys too diverse its
                                        too big  what youll end up seeing is more and more the polarization that you talked about thats not healthy for our politics Its also not good for our economy The biggest strength we have as a nation I think is precisely that diversity and our capacity to get everybody energized and moving And that creates a dynamism in the economy
                                        and the whole thing kind of holds together If we start getting more and more balkanized then we end up having some of the problems that other countries have had in the past That weakens us and that has an impact
                                        on our standing in the world Thats something that we need to avoid and we need to get that settled right now"

Wendy Davis Enters Race for Texas Governor With a Shorter Speech,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/us/politics/entering-race-for-texas-governor-with-a-shorter-speech.html,HALTOM CITY Tex  Exactly 100 days after the legislative filibuster that defied the Republican establishment and turned her into a Democratic star State Senator Wendy Davis announced Thursday that she would run for governor opening an underdog campaign to lead a state that last sent a Democrat to the governors mansion nearly 23 years ago Standing before an estimated 2000 supporters at a modest redbrick arena in the workingclass community where she received her high school diploma in 1981 Ms Davis tied her candidacy to both the challenges that brought her to this unlikely campaign and to the promise of a state eternally entranced by its own mythology  We know that Texas is more than a state she said Texas has always been a promise The promise that where you start has nothing to do with how far you can come In Austin today our current leadership thinks that promises are something you just make to the people who write the big checks Ms Daviss speech perhaps reflecting the difficulties of a Democrat in a conservative state focused as much on her personal story as on her political agenda Her mother she has said was a single parent with a sixthgrade education Soon after Ms Davis graduated from high school she got married divorced and became a single mother herself at the age of 19 living in a trailer with her daughter Amber and she told the audience coming home to find the power turned off or her phone disconnected Ms Davis described how her life began to turn around after a coworker left a brochure on her desk for Tarrant County Community College She took classes there while working two jobs  at a doctors office and waiting tables  and eventually became a paralegal attended Harvard Law School served on the Fort Worth City Council and eventually won a Fort Worth seat in the Texas Senate in 2008 Im not sharing that story because its unique or special said Ms Davis 50 Im sharing it precisely because its not  But in fact her rise reflects an extraordinary personal story and political career transformed by one event  Fourteen weeks earlier in June Ms Davis stood on the Senate floor for more than 11 hours as part of a filibuster followed on social media nationwide to block Republicans from approving some of the toughest restrictions on abortion in the country Republicans passed the abortion restrictions but Ms Davis became a symbol of womens rights a national political figure and a lightning rod for the aspirations of Texas Democrats  Though expected her announcement has helped revive Texas Democrats in a state where Republicans control the Legislature and every statewide office And it comes at a crucial time in Texas politics Demographers as well as Democrats and Republicans have predicted that the booming Hispanic population will make Texas a competitive state for Democrats by 2020 or perhaps sooner Even if Ms Davis were to lose some Democrats believe she will have set the stage for future wins as the demographic shifts add to their advantage Ms Davis touched on the larger fight for Democrats in her speech telling the audience she was not leading a campaign for governor but one for the very future of our state But her 15minute speech was also notable for its omissions  she mentioned neither abortion nor her filibuster  and seemed an attempt to ensure she does not become a singleissue candidate Political researchers and analysts described her chances of winning as slim She is an unabashed Democrat in a state that President Obama lost in the 2012 election by nearly 13 million votes The last time a Democrat occupied the governors mansion was Jan 17 1995 the last day of Gov Ann W Richardss tenure Ms Daviss main opponent is likely to be one of the most popular Republicans in the state Greg Abbott the Texas attorney general who has already raised more than 20 million Republicans have reacted calmly to Ms Daviss rise to political prominence  Shes way too liberal for Texas said Steve Ogden a former Republican state senator who served with Ms Davis in the Legislature until his retirement in January By any objective measure Texas is doing pretty good and the government gets some credit for that  In a statement a spokesman for Mr Abbotts campaign Avdiel Huerta welcomed Ms Davis to the race and likened her candidacy to Texas Democrats trying to conjure support for Californiastyle candidates that try to sell Obamas liberal agenda and go against what makes Texas great Ms Daviss aides and supporters said she can raise the roughly 40 million she needs to compete with Mr Abbott The last Democrat to run for governor Bill White the former mayor of Houston who lost to Gov Rick Perry in 2010 raised nearly 27 million and he did not have Ms Daviss national name recognition It can be done said Scott Atlas the finance chairman of Mr Whites campaign for governor and a supporter of Ms Daviss referring to the 40 million goal But its going to take a major effort to convert what is an extraordinary amount of enthusiasm dedication and support into campaign contributions And her supporters say the extremism of the Republican Party in Texas has opened the door for something different and even an upset victory I know she can win because she is smart and she has the common peoples interests at heart said Jeanne Stillwell 70 a retired schoolteacher in Fort Worth who attended the rally with two friends Weve seen it done before Ann Richards did it and they didnt think she could win 
"Poll Finds Support for de Blasio, if Not All His Ideas",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/nyregion/new-york-city-mayor-poll-bill-de-blasio-joseph-lhota.html,New York City voters want to keep Raymond W Kelly as police commissioner They want more charter schools And nearly half of them support the Police Departments use of the stopandfrisk tactic  But the citys voters by an enormous margin are planning to support Bill de Blasio for mayor next month despite the fact that Mr de Blasio a Democrat opposes each of those positions according to a New York TimesSiena College poll released on Friday The poll found a huge challenge facing Joseph J Lhota the Republican nominee as he seeks to persuade voters in an overwhelmingly Democratic city to choose him With the election just a month away on Nov 5 Mr de Blasio held a commanding lead of 68 percent to 19 percent among likely voters More than 4 in 10 likely voters said they had no opinion of Mr Lhota while only about a quarter did not have an opinion of Mr de Blasio currently the citys public advocate And 58 percent had a favorable opinion of Mr de Blasio compared with 22 percent who viewed Mr Lhota favorably Mr Lhota is seeking to change the dynamic He began broadcasting his first general election television advertisement on Wednesday pointing out that he supports samesex marriage abortion rights and the legalization of marijuana but that unlike Mr de Blasio he does not plan to raise taxes  Mr de Blasio seeking to thwart any advantage Mr Lhota might gain from being on the airwaves alone immediately introduced his own ad showing a clip from his victory speech on the night of the primary The race is not over the two men have agreed to televised debates on three successive Tuesdays this month and those exchanges as well as the television ads will introduce the candidates to New Yorkers who have not yet tuned in But the poll found extraordinarily daunting odds against Mr Lhota a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority Mr de Blasios lead cut across just about every category he led among voters regardless of age race gender and income and education level Registered Republicans made up the only group in which a majority backed Mr Lhota  I like de Blasios general demeanor his bearing and his poise and he is more for the common man than Lhota Doris Bruntel 69 a legal proofreader from Chelsea said in a followup interview She described herself as conservative but said she believed that Mayors Rudolph W Giuliani a Republican and Michael R Bloomberg an independent had prioritized the concerns of business and that Mr de Blasio was looking out for the rest of us Voters shared several of Mr de Blasios priorities  particularly his desire to address income inequality and the high cost of housing and to improve public education And a majority of voters suggested that they want the next mayor to prioritize reducing the gap between rich and poor a key plank for Mr de Blasio rather than to create a climate that would reduce taxes and regulation to sustain job growth something emphasized by Mr Lhota On most issues the poll found Mr de Blasio enjoyed a strong advantage over Mr Lhota By almost four to one voters thought that Mr de Blasio would do a better job than Mr Lhota in improving public education By almost three to one they supported Mr de Blasios proposal to increase taxes on highearners to finance an expansion of prekindergarten education And by almost two to one they believed that Mr de Blasio not Mr Lhota would keep the city safe from crime or a terrorist attack or during a natural disaster Seven in 10 supported creating an independent inspector general to monitor the police  a measure passed by the City Council with Mr de Blasios support and Mr Lhotas opposition More than 8 in 10 voters wanted to make affordable housing a top priority an issue also most associated with Mr de Blasio Voters said Mr de Blasio better understood their needs and problems And in a troubling sign for Mr Lhota voters said that Mr de Blasio was better equipped to manage the citys complex government even though Mr Lhota was a budget director and a deputy mayor under Mr Giuliani Daniel Meehan of Bayside Queens 64 a retired warden with the citys Correction Department said Mr Lhota was being hurt by his Republican label I think Lhotas getting caught up in what I perceive to be a backlash against Republicans especially with whats going on now he said Its becoming an issue of the haves and the havenots But some voters said they would be interested in at least hearing Mr Lhota out If he was the better problem solver and had solutions to increasing jobs in the city and bettering our school system that could change my mind Jeffry Perez a 21yearold college student from the South Bronx said Donald P Levy director of the Siena Research Institute said that while anything can happen Mr Lhota faced an uphill challenge because potential lines of attack  that Mr de Blasio would take the city back to an era with more crime and more fiscal woes  were not clicking with voters Hes got a lot of problems lets face it Mr Levy said Its time for him to pull out whatever he thinks is his best stuff at this point his biography his toughness his ability to respond to disasters his ability to keep New Yorkers safe from a terrorist attack and make difficult decisions There were a few signs of concern for Mr de Blasio Although his blunt criticism of the stopandfrisk tactic helped to propel him to victory in the Democratic primary general election voters have mixed feelings about it Voters favored creating more charter schools echoing a position taken by Mr Bloomberg and Mr Lhota but not one favored by Mr de Blasio who has proposed charging charter schools a sliding scale of rent They also agreed with Mr Lhotas desire to keep Mr Kelly as police commissioner while Mr de Blasio would replace him But occasionally voiced criticisms of Mr de Blasio  that he is too liberal for some or that he might be overemphasizing his family in his television commercials  have not gained much traction with voters Only 20 percent of those surveyed said they felt that he is too liberal And 47 percent said the media attention on his family and personal life had been about right while 35 percent said it had been a bit much Mr de Blasio and Mr Lhota are not the only choices for mayor There will be 15 candidates on the ballot including Adolfo Carrin Jr a former Bronx borough president who is the Independence Party nominee and Jack Hidary a hightech entrepreneur Mr Carrin had the backing of just 2 percent The citywide TimesSiena College poll was conducted on landlines and cellphones from Sept 28 to Oct 2 with 700 likely voters The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points
"Different Francis, Same Mission",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/05/opinion/different-francis-same-mission.html,In the year 1206 a rich young man named Francis Bernadone was at prayer before a painted crucifix in the crumbling chapel of San Damiano near Assisi The man who was to become St Francis reported that he heard a voice issuing from the figure on the cross saying Francis rebuild my Church which has fallen into ruins  On Friday a pope of the same name was in Assisi to celebrate the feast of St Francis convinced he had been charged with the same mission  Pope Francis was accompanied by the eight cardinals from around the world who on Thursday finished a closed threeday meeting on how to renew the dysfunctional and scandalhit Vatican bureaucracy that sits at the heart of the Roman Catholic Church The eight constitute a new Council of Cardinals which one ecclesiastical historian has described as the most important step in the history of the Church for the past 10 centuries  The winds of change are blowing through the Catholic Church Pope Francis is proving a pontiff of surprises He may be conservative on doctrine but he is the opposite in style First came his grand gestures of humility  carrying his own suitcase making calls on his cellphone staying in a hostel Next came his series of appointments to top positions within the church replacing reactionary or traditionalist figures with more openminded officials Accompanying all this has been a series of increasingly radical statements that make clear he wants change on a far wider scale In an interview last month the Jesuit pope accused the Church of having grown obsessed with abortion gay marriage and contraception He rejected its preoccupation with smallminded rules Then on Tuesday in an interview with a leading Italian atheist the pope said Heads of the Church have often been narcissists flattered and thrilled by their courtiers The court is the leprosy of the papacy  This Vaticancentric vision neglects the world around it and I will do everything to change it The Catholic Church runs on the model of an absolute monarchy Its governance template is still essentially as it was fixed by Pope Sixtus V in 1588 Officials in a series of departments known as congregations act as papal courtiers In theory the members of this Curia discharge the wishes of the pontiff But in practice they often work at crosspurposes or intrigue as clerical careerists to arrogate power to themselves  Attempts at reform have been made in the past But they have been undermined by this selfserving bureaucracy In the 1960s the Second Vatican Council decreed new models of collegiality that would cede power to bishops locally and collectively in synods Ever since the Curia has connived to undermine the plan and draw power back to itself In the discussions before the election of Pope Francis cardinals from across the globe made clear their dissatisfaction with a Curia whose officers routinely acted as the masters rather than the servants of local churches  The new pope set up this new Council of Cardinal Advisers in response and handpicked its members from cardinals around the globe who had been the most prominent critics of the Vatican bureaucracy Little has emerged about the deliberations of the council this week We know from their consultations with local churches before they went to Rome that they have looked at key institutional issues like the reform of the Curia and the Vatican Bank The cardinals produced scores of documents for internal discussion The chairman of the group Cardinal Oscar Rodrguez Maradiaga of Honduras told an interviewer there were 80 documents from Latin America alone They touch on pastoral issues like lifting the ban on remarried Catholics taking Communion creating a greater role for women in the Church and reopening the debate on compulsory clerical celibacy Pope and cardinals alike know that institutional changes are needed to ensure that Franciss reforms are not reversed by a conservative successor That requires concrete ideas to transform the curial court into a modern civil service These might include bringing in outside management consultants to make recommendations as archbishop of Buenos Aires Francis brought in an accounting firm to sort out a malfunctioning church bank Yet they must do more The cardinals should consider recruiting top lay administrators to run Vatican departments There is no reason these have to be overseen by cardinals or bishops indeed top outsiders with lay backgrounds might think in creative ways beyond the experience of clerical insiders  Nor is there any reason why women should not do such jobs And if department heads do still have to be cardinals there is no church law forbidding a female cardinal even if she could not be a priest  To prevent such reforms being unpicked the Synod of Bishops should be empowered to supervise and vet all future appointments of personnel to the Curia And the group of eight needs to institutionalize itself as a permanent body Change will not come quickly or easily so the cardinals need to show both imagination and resolution They should take as their inspiration a pope who is named after a saint who was lacking in neither    Paul Vallely a British journalist is the author of the recently published Pope Francis  Untying

The First Illicit Thing You Read,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/04/books/review/the-first-illicit-thing-you-read.html,In the Book Reviews Sex Issue a select group of writers shared their memories of the first illicit thing they ever read More than 200 readers also wrote on The New York Timess Web site about their experiences with books poems and other works of literature that their parents or teachers might not have wanted them to read Some of the Book Reviews favorite reader stories are featured below The full assortment of tales can be read here  AJ Howard Fairhope Ala I was 14 when I encountered my first piece of illicit literature The news had eagerly reported the controversy surrounding the books release I remember reading an electronic copy on my familys Gateway computer late one night in the days following its release I remember breathlessly reading the dirtiest sections shocked that adults would allow this sensational activity to be described in such exact and excruciating detail The date was sometime in September 1998 and the work was The Starr Report Karen Syracuse NY When I was in sixth grade I somehow got my hands on and read Scruples by Judith Krantz The very first chapter was pretty eye opening as one of the main characters after dispersing her late husbands ashes from a plane window proceeds to give the pilot oral sex while flying of course My mom who is not a reader brought the book to her regular Saturday morning beauty salon appointment so she could check in with what her daughter was reading To give her credit after practically choking on her morning Danish she made a point to ask me if the book was worth reading and after I told her it was she calmly folded the book handed it back to me and said Well then carry on Marjorie New York NY Sonny Corleone with the bridesmaid against the door I was 11 BJ New York I was about 10 years old and staying at my very proper aunt and uncles house in upstate New York while my parents went away for a weekend I was a kid insomniac and a reader and those two things led me to my aunts den at about 2 am where I found Radclyffe Halls Well of Loneliness the classic novel about lesbian sexuality Who knew that women did things like this Who knew someone would write something like this And mostly who knew my stuffy relatives had such racy taste I devoured the book in about three hours and returned it to the shelf before I could be discovered reading it I think that this early exposure to a sympathetic gay character really affected the way I came to view gays It certainly led me to smile to myself every time I saw my sweet but dowdy aunt and upright uncle at seders and bar mitzvahs in the years that followed Luiza Houston When I was 12 years old my parents owned a library with more than 3000 books in it They strongly encouraged reading for the purpose of furthering knowledge and stimulating creativity In one of my trips to our home library I encountered the book Eleven Minutes by Paulo Coelho and began the reading unaware of its content The book describes in detail the life of Maria a girl raised in the countryside of Brazil who is offered a job in Switzerland and becomes a prostitute unintentionally The author gives a graphic outlook on the womans life from her first intercourse to her frustrated search for love At first the reading was exciting but for me as a child it became rather scary as it provided further detail It was my childhoods 50 Shades of Grey The awkwardness about this illicit reading experience was that I began the book during a family road trip Each time I came across an explicit moment in the story I looked over to grandma wondering if she knew what I had been reading By the end of our trip my mother realized I had one of her Rrated books and warned me  once This book youre reading is quite explicit huh My cheeks turned red and I said in all my cynicism Oh really Nancy Jane Moore Austin Tex As my mother told the story the librarian at the bookmobile refused to let me check out Little Women saying that it was too old for an 8yearold So I came home and read Peyton Place instead Scott Candage Williston ND I read Naked Lunch by William Burroughs at about 16 years old I would carry it around while walking through my high school Of course I was trying to impress people by carrying it around But nobody in my class knew what it was and no teachers bothered to ask Red Emma Orange County Calif Learned about political satire wit and sex in the same sublime reading experience when I found a copy of Myron by Gore Vidal on the shelf of the public library at age 15 or so Other fans of this unlikely and overthetop novel will recall that Vidal substitutes the names of members  of the Supreme Court for more explicit nouns in protest of a particularly dumb censorship ruling He thrust his enormous Rehnquist deep into her Whizzer White I suspect the experience of reading this book which led me to ask the librarian for the copy of Myra Breckinridge kept behind the counter forever brought a frisson of the erotic to my involvement in politics and well not sure what exactly to the actual sex act But I have been happily married to another leftprogressivesocialistintellectual freedom loving woman for 30 years Bruce Murray Oakville Ontario My father had a library filled with firstedition books from the 20s and 30s He was not a collector He just happened to buy and read books when they were newly published The authors included Hemingway Buck Maugham and Lawrence The most intriguing one for me as a 12yearold was Lady Chatterleys Lover by DH Lawrence It seemed innocent enough Romances whose heroines remained chaste were immensely popular then I decided to question my father about Lady Chatterley He told me he had bought the book in the 30s when he was studying surgery in Cleveland He informed me it had been banned in most countries because of its explicit sexual content Sold I stored Lady Chatterley beneath my mattress along with my issues of Playboy Each night I read as if I were eating my favorite dessert My sin would be absolved in the confessional Guilt had its benefits Years later my father hired a surgeon from England Dr Tony Lawrence When he first came to dinner at our home my father asked him whether he was related to DH Lawrence He said DH Lawrence was his grandfathers brother Uncle Bertie was considered the black sheep of the family My father asked if he had read Lady Chatterleys Lover He replied he was never permitted to read it Furthermore it had not been available in England My father asked him whether he wished to read his copy and Tony declared that he would My fathers copy of Lady Chatterleys Lover was never returned I was forced to move on to Fanny Hill MarieDB New York When I was in a Catholic boarding school age about 15 or 16 in the repressive early 1950s we were given an assignment to write a paper on the works of a Catholic writer I chose Graham Greene to the consternation of the nun who gave the assignment when she realized what was in his books such as The End of the Affair But he was Catholic so she let me proceed but told me not to lend the books to the other girls It would have been worth my life to try to keep them from the other girls in the dormitory In all fairness she gave me an A I especially loved The Power and the Glory Richard S Austin Tex Oh Stephen King you showed me such inappropriate things at such a young age Some of them were impossibly sexy and mysterious but many of them really scared the life out of me with their frank exploration of the dark side of sexuality I remember reading The Tommyknockers at 13 or so We were visiting some family and my uncle saw the book and frowned Your mom let you read that I nodded and said Its not that bad My uncle nodded like he didnt believe me said Ive read it and left me alone It really made me realize how suspicious some people can be about books Tonya Prestonburg Ky When I was 10 years old I read William Faulkners short story A Rose for Emily It was in one of Moms longforgotten dogeared literature anthologies Reading her old college textbooks transported me to a world far away from the small Appalachian town I lived in and made me feel like I was doing something daring and adventurous Reading a story about a woman who had poisoned a man and kept his corpse with her for years seemed like such a naughty rebellious thing for such a young child to read I was terrified that Mom would discover I had read and not let me read her old textbooks any more I hid this rather thick anthology under my bed and surreptitiously read it whenever I could In a way A Rose for Emily introduced me to Dickinson Poe Hawthorne Melville Hawthorne Fitzgerald Eliot Twain Whitman Thoreau and dozens of writers I would later study in college Who knew that such a macabre story would lead to a lifetime of reading and exploring Bob Richmond Knoxville Tenn All this fashionable literature people snuck under the covers When I was 10 years old in 1949 I read a good bit of the 1928 edition of Williams Obstetrics from my physician fathers library He must have found out because I remember the book disappeared not long afterwards I found out that sex really happens pretty much the way my friend Jimmy described it but I remember more clearly the extremely graphic descriptions of lateterm

The Promise and Peril of Pope Francis,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/opinion/sunday/douthat-the-promise-and-peril-of-pope-francis.html,TO understand Pope Francis  his purpose his program and its potential pitfalls  its useful to think about whats been happening to New York Citys Jews  From the 1950s on New Yorks Jewish population declined amid suburbanization and assimilation But over the last 10 years the numbers began to rise again climbing 10 percent between 2002 and 2011 But this growth was almost all among Orthodox Jews The citys Reform and Conservative populations continued to drop as did Jewish religious observance over all  As a result New Yorks Jewish community is increasingly polarized with more Jews at the most traditional end of the theological spectrum more Jews entirely detached from the institutions of their ancestral faith  and everfewer observant Jews anywhere in the middle Whats happened in New York is happening nationally a recent Pew study found a similar pattern of growth among the Orthodox and a similar waning of religious practice and affiliation in the rest of the American Jewish population  This is not just a Jewish story Its been the story of religion in the West for over 40 years The most traditional groups have been relatively resilient The more liberal modernizing bodies have lost membership money morale And the culture as a whole has become steadily more disengaged from organized faith There is still a religious middle today but it isnt institutionally JudeoChristian in the way it was in 1945 Instead its defined by nondenominational ministries spiritual but not religious pieties and ancient heresies reinvented as selfhelp  Of late this process of polarization has carried an air of inevitability You can hew to a traditional faith in late modernity it has seemed only to the extent that you separate yourself from the American and Western mainstream There is no middle ground no center that holds for long and the attempt to find one quickly leads to accommodation drift and dissolution And this is where Pope Francis comes in because so much of the excitement around his pontificate is a response to his obvious desire to reject these alternatives  selfsegregation or surrender  in favor of an almostfrantic engagement with the lapsedCatholic postCatholic and nonCatholic world The idea of such engagement  of a new evangelization a new springtime for Christianity  is hardly a novel one for the Vatican But Franciss style and substance are pitched much more aggressively to a world that often tuned out his predecessors His deliberate demystification of the papacy his digressive interviews with outlets secular and religious his calls for experimentation within the church and his softer tone on the issues  abortion gay marriage  where traditional religion and the culture are in sharpest conflict these are not doctrinal changes but they are clear strategic shifts John Allen Jr one of the keenest observers of the Vatican has called Francis a pope for the Catholic middle positioned somewhere between the churchs rigorists and the progressives who pine to Episcopalianize the faith  But the significance of this positioning goes beyond Catholicism In words and gestures Francis seems to be determined to recreate or regain the kind of center that has failed to hold in every major Western faith So far he has at least gained the worlds attention The question is whether that attention will translate into real interest in the popes underlying religious message or whether the culture will simply claim him for its own   finally a pope who doesnt harsh our buzz  without being inspired to actually consider Christianity anew In the uncertain reaction to Francis from many conservative Catholics you can see the fear that the second possibility is more likely Their anxiety is not that the new pope is about to radically change church teaching since part of being a conservative Catholic is believing that such a change cant happen Rather they fear that the center hes trying to seize will crumble beneath him because the chasm between the culture and orthodox faith is simply too immense  And they worry as well that we have seen something like his strategy attempted before when the churchs 1970sera emphasis on social justice liturgical improvisation and casualcool style had disappointing results not a rich engagement with modern culture but a surrender to that cultures Me Decade manifestations  producing tacky liturgy ugly churches Jonathan Livingston Seagull theology and ultimately empty pews Francis seems acquainted with that danger  witness his warnings against a church that just becomes an NGO or against reducing Christianity to taking a spiritual bath in the cosmos  But the test of his approach will ultimately be a practical one Will the church grow or stagnate under his leadership Will his style just win casual admirers or will it gain converts inspire vocations create saints Will it actually change the world or just give the worldly another excuse to close their ears to the churchs moral message By his fruits we will know  but not for some time yet
The Supreme Court Returns,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/opinion/sunday/the-supreme-court-returns.html,The Supreme Court begins a new term on Monday even as the landmark rulings of last term continue to reverberate The court has agreed to hear more than 50 cases so far on disputes both familiar and fresh from affirmative action and freedom of speech to campaign finance and the presidents power to make recess appointments  No case yet promises the highprofile splash of rulings on national health care voting rights or samesex marriage but in many of them longestablished Supreme Court precedents may be at risk  AFFIRMATIVE ACTION A familiar issue but this time the question is whether a state may amend its constitution to prohibit the consideration of race or sex in public university admissions decisions Ten years ago the court ruled that the University of Michigan Law School could use race as one factor in assessing applications Michigan voters responded by passing a constitutional amendment banning the practice  The court in Schuette v Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action will now consider whether that amendment violates the equal protection clause The courts very narrow decision last term in Fisher v University of Texas at Austin did not change the state of the law on the use of race to achieve diversity This case risks doing so CAMPAIGN FINANCE In one of the most closely watched cases of the term McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission the court will consider the constitutionality of overall limits on how much an individual donor may give directly to federal candidates party committees and PACs in a twoyear election cycle  McCutcheon is the first major campaign finance case to reach the court since its controversial 2010 ruling in Citizens United v Federal Election Commission which struck down a ban on independent spending in campaigns by corporations and labor unions In a 1976 case Buckley v Valeo the court upheld limits on direct political contributions to prevent corruption That precedent is being tested again in the McCutcheon case the justices should reaffirm it  FREEDOM OF SPEECH AND RELIGION In McCullen v Coakley antiabortion protesters are challenging a Massachusetts law that sets a 35foot buffer zone around health care clinics where abortions are performed The Supreme Court upheld a similar buffer zone in 2000 but the protesters in this case say the law discriminates against them based on their point of view That earlier ruling may not survive because four of the justices in the 2000 majority have left the court  In Town of Greece v Galloway the court will decide whether the First Amendment permits a prayer before a town board meeting A 30yearold Supreme Court decision says that nonsectarian legislative prayers do not violate the Constitution but in this case all but a handful of the prayers were performed by Christian clergy The question is whether this will make a difference to the justices  ABORTION Cline v Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice deals with the constitutionality of an Oklahoma law that requires doctors to use abortioninducing drugs precisely as the Food and Drug Administration approved them 13 years ago The laws challengers point out that standard medical practice has changed and doctors routinely prescribe the drugs differently now at much lower doses and two weeks later into a pregnancy which is fully permitted by federal law  Earlier Supreme Court rulings have struck down laws that pose an undue burden on abortion rights The court should see Oklahomas tactics for what they are  part of an effort to undo the right to choose under the guise of protecting womens health  PRESIDENTIAL POWER National Labor Relations Board v Noel Canning addresses issues as vast as the separation of powers and as small as the meaning of the word the The case involves the presidents constitutional power to make appointments during the recess of the Senate as President Obama arguably did in January 2012 when he appointed three members to the NLRB The board then ruled against a bottling company called Noel Canning in a labor dispute  The company appealed arguing among other things that the board members appointment was improper because the Constitutions use of the phrase the recess refers only to the period when Congress is between sessions and not to a break within a session The Obama administration points out that presidents for more than a century have made appointments during breaks when Congress was out of town Accepting the companys extremely narrow reading of the Constitution would invalidate a practice that has resulted in hundreds of appointments over the years   Beyond these cases the new term could hold other surprises Several of last years biggest cases were not accepted by the court until after the term began  For instance the justices have yet to decide whether to hear an appeal on the issue of the Affordable Care Acts requirement that the health plans of private forprofit employers cover birth control Several companies have challenged the rule on the grounds that it violates their religious freedom and federal appeals courts have split on the issue which makes it likely that the court will step in On many of these cases the outcome may depend again on a single vote  and often but not always that means Justice Anthony Kennedy whose vote decided more 54 cases than any other member of the court last year
Conservative Georgia District Urges G.O.P. to Keep Up the Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/politics/conservative-georgia-district-urges-gop-to-keep-up-the-fight.html,FORT OGLETHORPE Ga  Just down the road from where Union troops suffered their worst defeat of the Civil War Jeff Epperson sang the praises of his congressman Representative Tom Graves whose Defund Obamacare Act set the table for the partial government shutdown Even though business has been slow at Mr Eppersons sword and knife shop since tourists stopped visiting the historic Chickamauga battlefield which closed on Tuesday because of the furlough of federal workers in the shutdown he said the only thing that would weaken his support for Mr Graves would be if the congressman caved in now In that case he might vote for a more conservative choice in the next Republican primary If he backs off then I would say absolutely Id be inclined to look for someone else said Mr Epperson whose store flew a Dont Tread on Me flag The Republican insistence in the House on tying financing of the federal government to dismantling the Affordable Care Act is being driven by a deeply conservative caucus from places like Mr Gravess 14th Congressional District newly created by Georgias Republicancontrolled Legislature Even as Republican elders warn that the party is risking a voter backlash that could cost it in future elections interviews here indicate that hardliners like Mr Graves have more to fear if they waver from a potential challenger to their right Mr Graves 43 won 73 percent of the vote in November in a district that is 85 percent white and has a 166 percent college graduation rate A journey through the district which stretches from the exurbs of Atlanta to the northwest mountains on the Tennessee border found many voters who even if they were unfamiliar with Mr Gravess biography strongly supported him He represents the people said Tim Ferguson a forklift operator who was waiting for a haircut at Pauls Barber Shop in Calhoun Hes not going to commit political suicide by backing down Voters here viewed the Washington stalemate just as Mr Graves and many of his party members in Congress portray it a tale of Republicans who have repeatedly shown a willingness to compromise while Democrats petulantly refuse to meet halfway Obama should not be so dogmatic said Julia Welch 82 who runs an antiques store in Dallas the seat of Paulding County He wants his way and no other Jon Tripcony a surveyor in Dallas recalled a photograph of Republican leaders in shirt sleeves facing empty seats across a table The photo which Mr Graves posted on Twitter was staged to dramatize Republicans call for Democrats to discuss a budget passed by the House It may have been dismissed as a publicity stunt by much of the news media which noted that House Republicans repeatedly refused to join a conference on a budget the Senate passed earlier But in northwest Georgia it was taken at face value There was not one single Democrat Mr Tripcony said Theyre just spoiled little kids I dont get it Mr Ferguson 48 said House conservatives should not shrink from the next fiscal deadline raising the debt ceiling even if it means defaulting on government bonds a prospect that economists overwhelmingly say would bring down catastrophe If it has to happen for the American people to get whats best defunding Obamacare so be it Mr Ferguson said Our credit ratings going to go down but it went down before Did the apocalypse come The number of hardline House conservatives is estimated from two dozen to as many as the 80 who signed a letter to Speaker John A Boehner demanding that he tie financing the government to defunding the Affordable Care Act which he had initially ruled out Their politics are shaped less by the national picture for Republicans who have lost five of the last six popular votes for president than by the demographics of districts like this one that were drawn by conservative legislatures after the 2010 census to ensure safe Republican seats That the president who lost Mr Gravess district by 49 percentage points last November is unpopular was no surprise But the level of animosity from some was acute He was compared to a tyrant preparing to end constitutional democracy as in Germany in the 1930s Peggy Newsome 73 who was picking up bags of groceries at the Paulding County Helping Hands food bank said Everything hes put his hands on hes screwed up More moderate voices seemed rare John Godrey 69 a retired textile industry executive strolling the grounds of the Coosa Valley Fair in Rome said he was a Republican but found Mr Graves unrealistic Obamacare is a passed law and the only way to do anything about it is through elections he said Republicans have to take back the Senate and probably get a president Mr Graves served seven years in the Georgia General Assembly before winning a seat in Congress in a special election in July 2010 He ran on an antiabortion progun taxcutting platform and arrived a few months before the Tea Party wave swept House Republicans into the majority In 2011 Mr Graves was sued by a Georgia bank for defaulting on a 22 million business loan That seems to have made little impact on his constituents though it is remembered in Calhoun where he used the loan to invest in a motel The property was abandoned after the electricity was shut off for nonpayment Mr Gravess partner said at the time that they were not responsible because the property had been transferred to a third party Beth Peters the coordinator of domestic violence services in Gordon County recalled scrambling for 24 hours to find new homes for the motels residents many of them poor or disabled Ms Peters 48 who voted for Mr Graves said she now questioned his judgment You kind of wonder if hes able to decide whats right for us in Washington if he cant run his own business she said Mr Tripcony the surveyor said he underwent heart surgery not long ago without health insurance a bad blow He has been making payments against the cost He had heard of the online marketplace for insurance that opened on Oct 1 under the Affordable Care Act I just dont trust it said Mr Tripcony who has an equal distrust of President Obama I dont like him and I dont feel comfortable with anything hes got to do with Mr Tripcony said he had a better idea for a system to provide health care at a fair price I think it should be the same for everybody he said One big company whether owned by the government or private Informed that he had described the singlepayer system that Mr Obama abandoned when Republican critics called it socialized medicine he said Yeah I know its crazy He said he might eventually seek health insurance under the new system In a couple of months when they get the Web sites working I may do it
A Federal Budget Crisis Months in the Planning,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/us/a-federal-budget-crisis-months-in-the-planning.html,WASHINGTON  Shortly after President Obama started his second term a looseknit coalition of conservative activists led by former Attorney General Edwin Meese III gathered in the capital to plot strategy Their push to repeal Mr Obamas health care law was going nowhere and they desperately needed a new plan Out of that session held one morning in a location the members insist on keeping secret came a littlenoticed blueprint to defunding Obamacare signed by Mr Meese and leaders of more than three dozen conservative groups  It articulated a takenoprisoners legislative strategy that had long percolated in conservative circles that Republicans could derail the health care overhaul if conservative lawmakers were willing to push fellow Republicans  including their cautious leaders  into cutting off financing for the entire federal government We felt very strongly at the start of this year that the House needed to use the power of the purse said one coalition member Michael A Needham who runs Heritage Action for America the political arm of the Heritage Foundation At least at Heritage Action we felt very strongly from the start that this was a fight that we were going to pick Last week the country witnessed the fallout from that strategy a standoff that has shuttered much of the federal bureaucracy and unsettled the nation  To many Americans the shutdown came out of nowhere But interviews with a wide array of conservatives show that the confrontation that precipitated the crisis was the outgrowth of a longrunning effort to undo the law the Affordable Care Act since its passage in 2010  waged by a galaxy of conservative groups with more money organized tactics and interconnections than is commonly known  With polls showing Americans deeply divided over the law conservatives believe that the public is behind them Although the laws opponents say that shutting down the government was not their objective the activists anticipated that a shutdown could occur  and worked with members of the Tea Party caucus in Congress who were excited about drawing a red line against a law they despise A defunding tool kit created in early September included talking points for the question What happens when you shut down the government and you are blamed for it The suggested answer was the one House Republicans give today We are simply calling to fund the entire government except for the Affordable Care ActObamacare The current budget brinkmanship is just the latest development in a wellfinanced broadbased assault on the health law Mr Obamas signature legislative initiative Groups like Tea Party Patriots Americans for Prosperity and FreedomWorks are all immersed in the fight as is Club for Growth a businessbacked nonprofit organization Some like Generation Opportunity and Young Americans for Liberty both aimed at young adults are upstarts Heritage Action is new too founded in 2010 to advance the policy prescriptions of its sister group the Heritage Foundation The billionaire Koch brothers Charles and David have been deeply involved with financing the overall effort A group linked to the Kochs Freedom Partners Chamber of Commerce disbursed more than 200 million last year to nonprofit organizations involved in the fight Included was 5 million to Generation Opportunity which created a buzz last month with an Internet advertisement showing a menacing Uncle Sam figure popping up between a womans legs during a gynecological exam  The groups have also sought to pressure vulnerable Republican members of Congress with scorecards keeping track of their health care votes have burned faux Obamacare cards on college campuses and have distributed scripts for phone calls to Congressional offices sample letters to editors and Twitter and Facebook offerings for followers to present as their own One sample Twitter offering  Obamacare is a train wreck  is a common refrain for Speaker John A Boehner As the defunding movement picked up steam among outside advocates Republicans who sounded tepid became targets The Senate Conservatives Fund a political action committee dedicated to electing true conservatives ran radio advertisements against three Republican incumbents  Heritage Action ran critical Internet advertisements in the districts of 100 Republican lawmakers who had failed to sign a letter by a North Carolina freshman Representative Mark Meadows urging Mr Boehner to take up the defunding cause Theyve been hugely influential said David Wasserman who tracks House races for the nonpartisan Cook Political Report When else in our history has a freshman member of Congress from North Carolina been able to round up a gang of 80 thats essentially ground the government to a halt On Capitol Hill the advocates found willing partners in Tea Party conservatives who have repeatedly threatened to shut down the government if they do not get their way on spending issues This time they said they were so alarmed by the health law that they were willing to risk a shutdown over it This is exactly what the public wants Representative Michele Bachmann of Minnesota founder of the House Tea Party Caucus said on the eve of the shutdown  Despite Mrs Bachmanns comments not all of the groups have been on board with the defunding campaign Some like the Kochfinanced Americans for Prosperity which spent 55 million on health care television advertisements over the past three months are more focused on sowing public doubts about the law But all have a common goal which is to cripple a measure that Senator Ted Cruz a Texas Republican and leader of the defunding effort has likened to a horror movie We view this as a longterm effort said Tim Phillips the president of Americans for Prosperity He said his group expected to spend tens of millions of dollars on a multifront effort that includes working to prevent states from expanding Medicaid under the law The groups goal is not to defund the law We want to see this law repealed Mr Phillips said A Familiar Tactic The crowd was raucous at the Hilton Anatole just north of downtown Dallas when Mr Needhams group Heritage Action arrived on a Tuesday in August for the second stop on a ninecity Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour Nearly 1000 people turned out to hear two stars of the Tea Party movement Mr Cruz and Jim DeMint a former South Carolina senator who runs the Heritage Foundation Youre here because now is the single best time we have to defund Obamacare declared Mr Cruz who would go on to rail against the law on the Senate floor in September with a monologue that ran for 21 hours This is a fight we can win Although Mr Cruz is new to the Senate the tactic of defunding in Washington is not For years Congress has banned the use of certain federal money to pay for abortions except in the case of incest and rape by attaching the socalled Hyde Amendment to spending bills  After the health law passed in 2010 Todd Tiahrt then a Republican congressman from Kansas proposed defunding bits and pieces of it He said he spoke to Mr Boehners staff about the idea while the Supreme Court which upheld the central provision was weighing the laws constitutionality There just wasnt the appetite for it at the time Mr Tiahrt said in an interview They thought we dont need to worry about it because the Supreme Court will strike it down But the idea of using the appropriations process to defund an entire federal program particularly one as farreaching as the health care overhaul raised the stakes considerably In an interview Mr DeMint who left the Senate to join the Heritage Foundation in January said he had been thinking about it since the laws passage in part because Republican leaders were not more aggressive Theyve been through a series of CRs and debt limits Mr DeMint said referring to continuing resolutions on spending and all the time there was discussion of OK were not going to fight the Obamacare fight well do it next time The conservatives who ran in 2010 promising to repeal it kept hearing This is not the right time to fight this battleÂ  Mr DeMint is hardly alone in his distaste for the health law or his willingness to do something about it In the three years since Mr Obama signed the health measure Tea Partyinspired groups have mobilized aided by a financing network that continues to grow both in its complexity and the sheer amount of money that flows through it  A review of tax records campaign finance reports and corporate filings shows that hundreds of millions of dollars have been raised and spent since 2012 by organizations many of them loosely connected leading opposition to the measure  One of the biggest sources of conservative money is Freedom Partners a taxexempt business league that claims more than 200 members each of whom pays at least 100000 in dues The groups board is headed by a longtime executive of Koch Industries the conglomerate run by the Koch brothers who were among the original financiers of the Tea Party movement The Kochs declined to comment While Freedom Partners has financed organizations that are pushing to defund the law like Heritage Action and Tea Party Patriots Freedom Partners has not advocated that A spokesman for the group James Davis said it was more focused on educating Americans around the country on the negative impacts of Obamacare  The largest recipient of Freedom Partners cash  about 115 million  was the Center to Protect Patient Rights according to the groups latest tax filings Run by a political consultant with ties to the Kochs and listing an Arizona post office box for its address the center appears to be little more than a clearinghouse for donations to still more groups including American Commitment and the 60 Plus Association both ardent foes of the health care law American Commitment and 60 Plus were among a handful of groups calling themselves the Repeal Coalition that sent a letter in August urging Republican leaders in the House and the Senate to insist at a minimum in a oneyear delay of carrying out the health care law as part of any budget deal Another group the Conservative 50 Plus Alliance delivered a defunding petition with 68700 signatures to the Senate In the fight to shape public opinion conservatives face wellorganized liberal foes Enroll America a nonprofit group allied with the Obama White House is waging a campaign to persuade millions of the uninsured to buy coverage The laws supporters are also getting huge assistance from the insurance industry which is expected to spend 1 billion on advertising to help sell its plans on the exchanges It is David versus Goliath said Mr Phillips of Americans for Prosperity But conservatives are finding that with relatively small advertising buys they can make a splash Generation Opportunity the youthoriented outfit behind the Creepy Uncle Sam ads is spending 750000 on that effort aimed at dissuading young people  a cohort critical to the success of the health care overhaul  from signing up for insurance under the new law  Â The group receives substantial backing from Freedom Partners and appears ready to expand Recently Generation Opportunity moved into spacious new offices in Arlington Va where exposed ductwork Ikea chairs and a PingPong table give off the feel of a Silicon Valley startup  Its executive director Evan Feinberg a 29yearold former Capitol Hill aide and onetime instructor for a leadership institute founded by Charles Koch said there would be more Uncle Sam ads coupled with college campus visits this fall Two other groups FreedomWorks with its Burn Your Obamacare Card protests and Young Americans for Liberty are also running campus events A lot of folks have asked us Are we trying to sabotage the lawÂ  Mr Feinberg said in an interview last week His answer echoes the Freedom Partners philosophy Our goal is to educate and empower young people Critical Timing But many on the Republican right wanted to do more  Mr Meeses lowprofile coalition the Conservative Action Project which seeks to find common ground among leaders of an array of fiscally and socially conservative groups was looking ahead to last Tuesday when the new online health insurance marketplaces called exchanges were set to open If the law took full effect as planned many conservatives feared it would be nearly impossible to repeal  even if a Republican president were elected in 2016 I think people realized that with the imminent beginning of Obamacare that this was a critical time to make every effort to stop something Mr Meese said in an interview He has since stepped down as the coalitions chairman and has been succeeded by David McIntosh a former congressman from Indiana  The defunding idea Mr Meese said was a logical strategy The idea drew broad support Fiscal conservatives like Chris Chocola the president of the Club for Growth signed on to the blueprint So did social and religious conservatives like the Rev Lou Sheldon of the Traditional Values Coalition The document set a target date March 27 when a continuing resolution allowing the government to function was to expire Its message was direct Conservatives should not approve a CR unless it defunds Obamacare  But the March date came and went without a defunding struggle In the Senate Mr Cruz and Senator Mike Lee a Utah Republican talked up the defunding idea but it went nowhere in the Democraticcontrolled chamber In the House Mr Boehner wanted to concentrate instead on locking in the acrosstheboard budget cuts known as sequestration and Tea Party lawmakers followed his lead Outside advocates were unhappy but held their fire We didnt cause any trouble Mr Chocola said  Yet by summer with an August recess looming and another temporary spending bill expiring at the end of September the groups were done waiting  I remember talking to reporters at the end of July and they said This didnt go anywhereÂ  Mr Needham recalled What all of us felt at the time was this was never going to be a strategy that was going to win inside the Beltway It was going to be a strategy where during August people would go home and hear from their constituents saying You pledged to do everything you could to stop Obamacare Will you defund itÂ  Heritage Action which has trained 6000 people it calls sentinels around the country sent them to open meetings and other events to confront their elected representatives Its Defund Obamacare Town Hall Tour which began in Fayetteville Ark on Aug 19 and ended 10 days later in Wilmington Del drew hundreds at every stop The Senate Conservatives Fund led by Mr DeMint when he was in the Senate put up a Web site in July called dontfundobamacarecom and ran television ads featuring Mr Cruz and Mr Lee urging people to tell their representatives not to fund the law When Senator Richard M Burr a North Carolina Republican told a reporter that defunding the law was the dumbest idea Ive ever heard the fund bought a radio ad to attack him Two other Republican senators up for reelection in 2014 Lamar Alexander of Tennessee and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina were also targeted Both face Tea Party challengers  In Washington Tea Party Patriots which created the defunding tool kit set up a Web site exemptamericacom to promote a rally last month showcasing many of the Republicans in Congress whom Democrats  and a number of fellow Republicans  say are most responsible for the shutdown  While conservatives believe that the public will back them on defunding a recent poll by the Kaiser Family Foundation found that a majority  57 percent  disapproves of cutting off funding as a way to stop the law Last week with the health care exchanges open for business and a number of prominent Republicans complaining that the Defund Obamacare strategy was politically damaging and pointless Mr Needham of Heritage Action said he felt good about what the groups had accomplished  It really was a groundswell he said that changed Washington from the outside

Abortion Vote Exposes Rift at a Catholic University,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/us/abortion-vote-exposes-rift-at-catholic-university.html,LOS ANGELES  Not three weeks have passed since Pope Francis said the church had grown obsessed with abortion declaring We have to find a new balance But on the campus of Loyola Marymount University overlooking this citys west side a fight over abortion now threatens to rip the school asunder Trustees of the Jesuit university will decide on Monday whether to remove coverage for elective abortions from the faculty and staff health care plans The coming vote has exposed a deep rift over just how Catholic a Catholic university should be in the 21st century  and how to maintain that distinctive Catholic identity amid growing diversity on campus  Religiously conservative professors and alumni argue that as the proportion of Catholics on campus  in the student body and on the faculty  has fallen in recent years the university has lost touch with its Catholic identity They have leaned hard on university officials to reestablish a more prominent role for Catholic doctrine at the university starting with eliminating insurance coverage for abortions  But the potential end of abortion coverage has sent a collective shiver through much of the faculty who fear that it could also signal the end of an era in which nonCatholics have been wholeheartedly welcomed by the university and professors have enjoyed the academic freedom to teach theories that do not necessarily accord with Catholic doctrine  Both sides however have come to view Mondays vote as symbolic of a battle for the universitys soul  Loyola Marymount has always represented tolerance diversity and a welcoming atmosphere where we can exchange ideas openly said Laurie Levenson a professor at the law school If this represents a shift in what it means for Loyola to be a Catholic university and being a Catholic university now means exclusion I think Loyola would lose something very special It could dramatically change whos attracted to the university and what faculty want to be involved Christopher Kaczor a philosophy professor who described himself as a faithful Catholic agreed that it was potentially a turning point in the universitys history  Part of the universitys mission is to promote justice Professor Kaczor said And in the Catholic tradition abortion is considered a justice issue So to say the university supports justice and then also pay for abortions is a contradiction  Loyola Marymount is hardly the only Catholic university wrestling with questions about its religious identity  Across the country the percentage of faculty members who are Catholic has been dropping for years as nearly a third of Americans raised Catholic have left the church prompting some colleges to aggressively recruit Catholic professors  At Notre Dame in 2009 protests over President Obamas appearance on campus because of his support for abortion rights led to more than a dozen arrests Boston College meanwhile tried to ban students from distributing free condoms in dorms this year  While Catholics still make up at least 70 percent of the student bodies at Boston College and Notre Dame only about half of incoming freshmen at Loyola Marymount identified themselves as Catholic this year The percentage of Catholics on the faculty here has fallen well below 50 percent according to university officials estimates Students said there were few reminders that they attended a Catholic university at all aside from the glistening white church at the center of campus or the occasional cross on a classroom wall And in 2010 David W Burcham a Presbyterian was appointed president of Loyola Marymount  the first nonCatholic president of any Jesuit university in the country according to school officials  David Luke an alumnus said Loyola Marymounts drift away from its Catholic roots has reached a crisis point  This year Mr Luke helped found an organization called Renew LMU which has pushed the administration to enroll more Catholic students and hire more Catholic faculty members in 1990 Pope John Paul II issued a directive that at least half the faculty members at Catholic universities should be Catholic Mr Luke said that support for human life was central to Catholic teachings and that only professors who are against abortion should be allowed to hold certain posts on campus like director of the Bioethics Institute  We are concerned about the overall Catholic character Mr Luke said Secular faculty are welcome on a Catholic campus but its incumbent on those faculty to inform themselves of Catholic teaching and show some amount of respect In August Mr Burcham sent a letter to faculty and staff members saying that since 1988 the school had repeatedly inquired with its health insurance companies about whether it would be possible to drop coverage for elective abortions from the faculty health plan Until this year the answer had always been no But this summer the letter said the insurance companies agreed to drop the coverage and the trustees would vote on it in October An uproar soon followed Last week dozens of faculty members signed a fullpage advertisement in the student newspaper The Los Angeles Loyolan urging the trustees to maintain abortion coverage Privately professors without tenure expressed concern that they could scuttle their careers if they spoke up some have started looking for other jobs  For a lot of us it looks like some of our worst fears about teaching at a Catholic university are coming true said Anna Harrison a tenured professor of Christian history  Like other Jesuit schools Loyola Marymount has welcomed scholars of all faiths Condoms are not distributed on campus but professors have been free to post stickers advocating abortion rights on their office doors A performance of 8 a play about the fight for samesex marriage in California was held on campus last year over objections from religious conservatives  Professor Harrison feared that Mondays vote could mean the end of that free intellectual exploration  If teachers are going to become more cautious and less creative in the classroom then its the students who will lose out she said We dont want faculty who are afraid to embrace the complexity and richness of the subjects theyre teaching  Though Mr Burcham has refused to comment publicly before the vote his administration has also steadfastly insisted that whatever the result academic freedom at the university would not be jeopardized  Faculty and staff have and will continue to have the right to express their strongly held beliefs and principles and to pursue their scholarship wherever it may lead them said one statement from the presidents office Our commitment to academic freedom is at the very heart of what we do at Loyola Marymount University
"Sex, Doubt and the Pope",https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/06/sex-doubt-and-the-pope/,"Many liberal Catholics have been encouraged by Pope Franciss comments about sexual ethics in a recent interview His general point was that these are lesser
                                        matters not to be emphasized at the expense of the churchs essential message of healing and salvation Asked about homosexuality he simply evoked Gods love for all humans when God looks
                                        at a gay person does he endorse the existence of this person with love or reject and condemn this person    In life God accompanies persons and we must accompany them starting from their situation It is
                                        necessary to accompany them with mercy More widely he said We cannot insist only on issues related to abortion gay marriage and the use of contraceptive methods     The dogmatic and moral
                                        teachings of the church are not all equivalent The churchs pastoral ministry cannot be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines to be imposed insistently Nevertheless the pope unlike many Catholics seems still to accept the hierarchys official views on abortion contraception and homosexuality The teaching of the church
                                        for that matter is clear and I am a son of the church but it is not necessary to talk about these issues all the time Presumably then he agrees with the official line that these actions are seriously
                                        immoral In an earlier interview he similarly accepted the official view that divorced and remarried Catholics
                                        may not receive Communion and that women cannot be priests But as many liberal Catholics recognize this doctrinal line is no longer intellectually defensible Traditional Catholic themes like respect for life the family as a primary aim of sexual activity and the dangers
                                        of reducing sex to pleasure remain vital to an adequate sexual morality But the insistence that any abortion any homosexual act any use of contraceptives is simply immoral will not withstand rational reflection
                                        A full defense of this claim is beyond the scope of this piece But one salient point is that although the bishops claim that their views on these topics are knowable by natural reason without the aid of revelation
                                        hardly anyone except conservative religious believers sees the force of the rational case Unless the pope is prepared to reject the hierarchys absolute condemnation of these actions and revise the official teaching his comments reflect merely changes of style and tone These are welcome as far as
                                        they go but they fall far short of the reform needed if the church is to fulfill its fundamental aim of bearing witness to the truth There are two other comments in his interview that suggest Pope Francis might be open to this essential witness One sketches his views on thinking with the church all the faithful considered
                                        as a whole are infallible in matters of belief and the people display this infallibilitas in credendo this infallibility in believing through a supernatural sense of the faith of all the people walking
                                        together A pope with this view  itself rooted in Vatican IIs Dogmatic Constitution on the Church  might well fashion a theology of sex in dialogue with laypeople
                                        who are far better attuned to the realities of human sexuality than most bishops Even more important are Pope Franciss remarks about the role of uncertainty in religious life The stubborn refusal to admit mistakes is the original sin of the Catholic Church But Pope Francis speaks of the
                                        uncertainty always involved in the process of spiritual discernment and emphasizes that the great leaders of the people of God like Moses have always left room for doubt You must leave
                                        room for the Lord not for our certainties Here the pope shows signs of having learned what most of his recent predecessors have not that even what we take to be divinely revealed truth is a historical
                                        construct requiring periodic refinement and revision The question is whether he is willing to recognize the inadequacies of the hierarchys dogmatic stances on sexual ethics and develop a more adequate
                                        position
                                     If Pope Francis does want to pursue this path his remarks suggest that he will do so with deliberation much consultation and in small but decisive steps Heres a scenario that is not entirely implausible and
                                        that could begin a true Catholic reformation Pope Francis picking up the ball dropped by Paul VI could once more convene a panel representative of the entire church to advise him on the question of birth control
                                        Such a committee would very likely recommend as Paul VIs did allowing at least the pill as an acceptable method of family planning The pope would then write an encyclical citing the doctrine of the church
                                        as the whole people of God and maintaining that a pope alone even in consultation with the bishops cannot properly make a decision on this central moral question On this basis he should revise the teaching
                                        on birth control Do I expect Pope Francis to do such a thing No because despite some encouraging comments he has repeatedly as a son of the church endorsed standing doctrines But if his embrace of uncertainty
                                        can even in a few cases overcome his filial docility Pope Francis could initiate the reform the church so desperately needs

Anxious Allies Aiding Booker in Senate Bid,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/nyregion/anxious-allies-aiding-booker-in-senate-bid.html,Cory A Booker is an undisputed star of a new generation of AfricanAmerican leaders electrifying liberal audiences with his oratory and charming the social media set with his digital savvy But the Senate campaign Mr Booker a Democrat is running in New Jersey  at times sputtering unfocused and entangled in seemingly frivolous skirmishes over Twitter messages involving a stripper  has unnerved his supporters who thought that a robust and unblemished victory over his Republican opponent Steve Lonegan would catapult him onto the national stage As his allies move to shore up what was supposed to be a painless path to Congress the biggest and wealthiest of them Mayor Michael R Bloomberg will start spending more than 1 million on Monday to broadcast television commercials on Mr Bookers behalf a vast sum to pour into a single candidacy With the special Senate election next week the late campaign push is trying to exploit unhappiness over the government shutdown to promote Mr Booker Newarks mayor as a problem solver who eschews the kind of hardline partisanship crippling the Capitol He is a solutions guy rather than an ideologue Mr Bloomberg said in an interview Mayor Booker in an acknowledgment that he can no longer ignore Mr Lonegan is now unleashing his own assault rolling out his first attack ad and pummeling his opponent in a debate that was broadcast on Sunday Mr Bookers bumpy campaign and shrinking lead in the polls are all the more unsettling to Democratic Party officials because Mr Lonegan is a political anomaly in the bluehued state a Tea Party conservative who describes himself as a radical opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest cheers the current shutdown of the federal government and has relied on polarizing rightwing figures like Sarah Palin and Rick Perry as campaign surrogates Mr Lonegan despite his ideological alignment appears to have tapped into lingering doubts about whether Mr Booker can translate his outsize selfpromotional persona so popular with the Democratic base into the rigors of a highly disciplined campaign Mr Booker first elected mayor in 2006 has stumbled into several distracting sideshows this year He has said he welcomed online speculation that he might be gay but has said he is not he playfully told a stripper that he loved her during a private chat on Twitter and he has battled reports which he denies that he exaggerated stories about downandout residents he had met in Newark In a series of searing ads and memorable zingers Mr Lonegan has mocked Mr Booker as a celebrityobsessed dilettante who can rarely be found in the city he governs once pointing out that while he himself enjoys a good Scotch and a cigar Mr Booker acknowledges he indulges in manicures and pedicures A radio commercial hammered Mr Booker 44 for traveling to the West Coast a few weeks ago to attend a fundraiser with Matt Damon and Ben Affleck after murders had spiked in Newark declaring While youre listening to this ad Cory Booker is in California getting as far away as he can from his own citys problems During the debate on Sunday Mr Lonegan suggested that Mr Booker spent every waking hour on Twitter where the mayor has 14 million followers and unabashedly exchanges messages with strangers day and night We need a leader not a tweeter Mr Lonegan 57 cracked Nobody is predicting a Booker loss in the special election But polling that once showed a blowout suggests a tighter contest A survey of likely Democratic and Republican voters conducted by Monmouth University and released on Oct 1 shows Mr Booker ahead by 13 percentage points over Mr Lonegan a former mayor of Bogota a small suburb in Bergen County This is much closer than anybody thought it should be said Patrick Murray the director of the Monmouth University Polling Institute citing Mr Lonegans conservative social positions Mr Bookers widespread name recognition and the states history of electing Democratic senators New Jersey has not sent a Republican to the Senate since 1972 This should be a 20point lead and not anything less than that Mr Murray said Mr Bookers pollster Joel Benenson called his candidates lead pretty strong and in line with the Election Day performance of past Democrats in New Jersey The unusual timing of the special election to fill the seat held by the recently deceased Senator Frank R Lautenberg  on Oct 16 a Wednesday  means that voter turnout is likely to be exceedingly low and the outcome even less predictable than usual The Monmouth survey contained evidence that Mr Lonegans strategy of portraying Mr Booker as a showboat rather than a workhorse has found an audience A plurality of 45 percent said they believed that his Senate run was motivated more by a desire to seek the national stage than an eagerness to work for the people of New Jersey Lonegan has successfully made the race about Booker said State Senator Raymond J Lesniak a Democrat The focus is on Corys warts Mr Booker newly aggressive after showing a reluctance to attack his opponent over the past few weeks repeatedly assailed Mr Lonegan as extreme and Tea Party fringe in Sundays debate predicting that his brand of Republicanism would reinforce the deep divisions that plague Congress My opponent is going to make everything wrong with Washington even worse he said Mr Bloombergs TV ad amplifies that message In a divided Washington a narrator says Mr Booker is a senator to get things done In an interview Mr Bloomberg said every American should be upset over the gridlock and praised Mr Booker for working closely with the states Republican governor Chris Christie Mr Bloomberg whose super PAC Independence USA is bankrolling the commercials said Mr Booker had shown a rare knack for using data rather than ideology to grapple with seemingly intractable urban problems like tracking handguns He likened him to a former New York City mayor Rudolph W Giuliani He changed the zeitgeist from Newark is ungovernable to Newark is governableÂ  said Mr Bloomberg who has been a longtime admirer of Mr Booker It is unclear however whether the states electorate sees Mr Bookers record in the same light Under his watch Newark has attracted new businesses like Pitney Bowes a mail management company and outoftown largess from wealthy tech leaders like the founder of Facebook Mark Zuckerberg But Mr Booker raised taxes and violent crime has remained largely unabated With 10 days remaining until the election both candidates scrambled to energize their followers dropping in on a doughnutfilled lawn party Mr Lonegan and a hair salon Mr Booker Mr Lonegan stuck with his theme of an unwieldy federal government strangling the country Mr Booker again railed against Mr Lonegan as almost laughably out of step with the state But everywhere they went conversations seemed to drift toward the races marquee name Mr Booker In interviews even those who said they planned to vote for him expressed reservations about his experience and ambitiousness arguing that he had not yet truly proved himself in Newark Kenneth Paige a 54yearold barber in East Orange where Mr Booker campaigned over the weekend cited the continued problem with crime in Newark What did he really do said Mr Paige a Democrat who indicated that he would vote for his partys nominee nonetheless In Union where Mr Booker stopped a few hours later Elaine Murphy 60 said she was breaking with her party to vote for Mr Lonegan Mr Booker she said had to fix Newark before he spread his wings out Her friends in Newark she said tell her that he hasnt done anything great for them
Supreme Court Has Deep Docket in Its New Term,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/07/us/politics/supreme-court-has-deep-docket-in-its-new-term.html,WASHINGTON  After backtoback terms ending in historic rulings that riveted the nation the Supreme Court might have been expected to return to its usual diet of routine cases that rarely engage the public Instead the courts new term which starts Monday will feature an extraordinary series of cases on consequential constitutional issues including campaign contributions abortion rights affirmative action public prayer and presidential power This term is deeper in important cases than either of the prior two terms said Irving L Gornstein the executive director of the Supreme Court Institute at Georgetown University  An unusually large number of the new cases put important precedents at risk many in areas of the law the court has been rapidly revising since the retirement of Justice Sandra Day OConnor She was at the courts ideological center and her moderate instincts played a crucial role in shaping the courts jurisprudence on abortion race religion and the role of money in politics Justice OConnor was succeeded in 2006 by the more conservative Justice Samuel A Alito Jr and the impact of that switch is likely to be felt in new cases in all four of those areas with the court revisiting and perhaps replacing precedents from earlier courts in all of them  In the last term the court grappled with the nature of equality  in college admissions in the voting booth and at the altar The new term will include a run of cases on the structure of the political process including ones on the balance of power between the branches of government and the role of money in politics  One case National Labor Relations Board v Noel Canning No 121281 is a test of President Obamas ability to bypass the Senate by making recess appointments It has partisan overtones reminiscent of the clash over the constitutionality of his health care law Canning seems to me the most important case on the courts docket to date said Gregory G Garre a lawyer with Latham  Watkins who served as solicitor general in the administration of President George W Bush Once again the court and the president seem destined to face off with potentially huge stakes for both institutions A second case continues a signature project of the court led by Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr which has been subjecting campaign finance laws to skeptical scrutiny in a halfdozen decisions including Citizens United v Federal Election Commission which in 2010 freed corporations and unions to spend without limit in candidate elections The new case moves the courts focus from such independent spending to caps on direct contributions from individuals to candidates and political parties That case McCutcheon v Federal Election Commission No 12536 may imperil a foundational 1976 campaign finance precedent Buckley v Valeo  The Buckley decision is not the only major precedent at risk this term The court has been asked to overrule an unusually large number of major decisions including ones on free speech religious liberty and property rights The court has two cases concerning abortion on its docket One of them McCullen v Coakley No 121168 is a challenge to a Massachusetts law that restricted protests near reproductive health care facilities The court upheld a similar Colorado law in 2000 in Hill v Colorado This is probably the most likely precedent to be overruled said Kannon K Shanmugam a lawyer with Williams  Connolly The second one concerns whether states may limit the use of abortioninducing drugs The case Cline v Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice No 121094 has taken a detour to the Oklahoma Supreme Court which has been asked for a clarification  When the case returns the Supreme Court may well modify its understanding of one of Justice OConnors central legacies Planned Parenthood v Casey in 1992 That decision reaffirmed the core of Roe v Wade the 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion and prohibited laws placing an undue burden on womens access to abortion  It remains to be seen whether any one of the new cases captures the public imagination in the same way some of the recent blockbusters did By comparison to the usual term though there will be plenty of excitement We got used to 10 cups of coffee a day said Andrew J Pincus a lawyer with Mayer Brown Now we are having only three There is more strong coffee coming  The justices will soon decide whether to hear a new challenge to Mr Obamas health care law The cases concern the laws requirement that employers provide insurance coverage for contraception  Some corporations object saying the requirement violates their right to religious freedom They cite Citizens United which recognized corporations free speech rights The chances of the court taking this case up this term are somewhere between 99 and 100 percent said Paul D Clement who served as United States solicitor general in the George W Bush administration and represented 26 states in the last health care case  The justices are also quite likely to agree to hear a case on whether the police may search the phones of people they arrest  The term will get off to a fast start with the court hearing the campaign finance case on Tuesday A week later in Schuette v Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action No 12682 the court will return to the subject of raceconscious college admissions plans In June it considered the question of whether the Constitution permits them at public universities and largely ducked the issue returning the case to a lower court  The new case flips the inquiry now asking whether Michigan voters were entitled to ban the use of race in selecting students A pair of Supreme Court precedents struck down similar measures on the ground that they had unfairly recast the political ground rules Those decisions may be at risk in the new case In November the justices will consider whether and when town officials may open their public meetings with prayer The case Town of Greece v Galloway No 12696 came from Greece NY a town near Rochester Starting in 1999 the town board has begun its public meetings with a prayer from a chaplain of the month That chaplain has almost always been a Christian Town officials said that members of all faiths and atheists were welcome to give the opening prayer Some residents have been offended by the prayers and they said the practice violated the First Amendments prohibition of government establishment of religion  In 1983 in Marsh v Chambers the Supreme Court upheld the Nebraska Legislatures practice of opening its legislative sessions with an invocation from a paid Presbyterian minister saying that such ceremonies were deeply embedded in the history and tradition of this country This will be the ninth term for Chief Justice Roberts and the fourth featuring the courts current membership The court is always a work in progress of course but the current one has matured into an assertive force at the center of American life  Justice Anthony M Kennedy remains the courts ideological fulcrum When the courts more conservative members capture his vote they can take bold action as when the court struck down part of the Voting Rights Act of 1965 in a 5to4 ruling on the nexttolast day of the term in June A day later when Justice Kennedy joined the courts liberals the court struck down part of the Defense of Marriage Act in another 5to4 decision  The coming term may not conclude in June with quite the same fireworks as the last two But it has the potential to reshape American politics and individual liberties in profound ways
Jesuit Campus to End Coverage for Elective Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/us/jesuit-campus-to-end-coverage-for-elective-abortions.html,LOS ANGELES  The trustees of Loyola Marymount University a Jesuit university in Los Angeles voted Monday to eliminate coverage for elective abortions from the health care plans offered to faculty and staff members in 2014 The right to life and dignity for every human being is a fundamental part of Catholic beliefs all other rights flow from this primary right to life and dignity said a letter to faculty and staff members from the university president David W Burcham and the chairwoman of the board of trustees Kathleen Hannon Aikenhead  Therapeutic abortions and contraception will continue to be covered In addition another health care plan that includes coverage for elective abortions which will be managed by a third party will be made available to faculty and staff members at a slightly higher premium Faculty members on both sides of the debate over the universitys abortion coverage expressed disappointment I dont think this is morally coherent Christopher Kaczor a philosophy professor who had pushed the university to eliminate its abortion coverage wrote in an email It is like saying Since I believe abortion is intentional killing I wont drive you to the clinic but Ill arrange for my brother to drive you there if you pay him a few bucksÂ 
A G.O.P. Moderate in the Middle ... of a Jam,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/08/us/politics/a-gop-moderate-in-the-middle-of-a-jam.html,WASHINGTON  As a moderate House Republican Representative Charlie Dent of Pennsylvania by definition typically finds himself somewhere near the middle when the majority of his colleagues veer well to the right But now Mr Dent is in the center of things as perhaps never before as the shutdown fight entered its second week He is one of roughly two dozen House Republicans whose votes have become the subject of a fight with President Obama and Congressional Democrats who are urging Speaker John A Boehner to let the House vote on a budget bill without conditions Mr Boehner insists the votes arent there to approve such a measure which could end the government shutdown Mr Dent  who in a swing state has more to worry about from the shutdown than Republicans in solidly red districts in red states  begged to differ with his leadership I believe the votes are there said Mr Dent who added that he would vote for a clean spending bill I believe that most Democrats will vote for it and I believe there will be a lot of Republicans that will support it as well Though Libertarianleaning House members have garnered much of the attention in Congress with their vocal complaining challenges to the leadership and scorchedearth tactics it is moderate Republicans like Mr Dent 53 who could end up deciding the fight if it reaches the point where both Republican and Democratic votes are required to settle key issues And Mr Dent whose square jaw sandy hair and pale blue eyes make him look more like a local news anchor than a member of Congress said he was ready to help should the opportunity arise Im a centerright member of Congress in a centerright district in a centerright country Mr Dent said When youre in this business of governing sometimes you must step up and govern Mr Dent was one of just 22 Republicans who helped pass major legislation this year  to avert a fiscal showdown to provide relief to victims of Hurricane Sandy and to pass the Violence Against Women Act  in the face of overwhelming opposition within his own party He is a leader of the Tuesday Group a weekly gathering of House Republicans who view themselves as commonsense conservatives Last week Mr Dent and a Democratic partner Representative Ron Kind of Wisconsin rolled out a longshot bipartisan proposal of their own  a bill that would reopen the government with a sixmonth spending bill that includes a repeal of a medical device tax unpopular with some Democrats Mr Dent acknowledged that ginning up enough bipartisan support to force Mr Boehner to put his proposal on the floor for a vote would be difficult I want to say to my Democratic friends up here today you know theyve put their necks out theyve agreed to make a change to health care law as part of this continuing resolution he said There are going to be members on the Republican side on the far right who are not going to like this because this bill does not defund or delay the health care law But Mr Dent added its important that we accept incremental progress when we can and this is one of those times So far however there has been little tangible headway Part of the problem is that moderates are behaving a bit too moderately They have yet to vote with Democrats on procedural maneuvers that could force the hand of the Republican leadership or to sign a petition Democrats are circulating that would require a vote on a shortterm spending bill to reopen the government if a majority of House members signed They are unwilling to defy their leaders to that extent Another example of their hesitance to buck the system came when Representative Peter T King Republican of New York threatened a coup by 20 to 25 Republican lawmakers who he said would vote against their own party on a procedural motion in order to avert a shutdown He was ultimately joined by just one fellow pragmatist  Mr Dent I was disappointed but not necessarily surprised Mr King said One thing I give the Tea Party credit for is they do what they say theyre going to do and they dont care what anybody thinks and they dont care about bringing down the House More centrist Republicans Mr King added they will talk they will complain but theyve never gone head to head As Mr Dent explains the situation the roughly two dozen pragmatists like himself  most of whom hail from MidAtlantic and Northeastern states  are faced with a bigger challenge If I say Im voting no what am I accomplishing he asked We need yes votes not no votes There are also fewer of them Connie Morella a former Republican representative from Maryland was considered a moderate and served during the last government shutdown 17 years ago But if moderates then were an endangered species said Ms Morella a professor at American University now theyre nearly an extinct species During the last shutdown in the mid1990s roughly onethird of the Republican conference came from districts President Bill Clinton had won giving them some incentive to compromise Now according to David Wasserman the House editor of The Cook Political Report only 17 Republicans hold districts that Mr Obama won in 2012 Mr Dents district for instance was narrowly carried by Mitt Romney Dent is a realist in a party increasingly dominated by purists Mr Wasserman said Hes always seen himself as a cooler head in a room full of firebreathers and to an extent thats true Mr Dents seat previously held by Senator Patrick J Toomey a staunch conservative sits in a true swing district in eastern Pennsylvania The district which looks a bit like a craggy barbell runs from Allentown and the Lehigh Valley to more Republicanleaning areas near Harrisburg Mr Dent has proved himself to be more socially liberal than many of his Republican counterparts He was just one of 15 Republicans in 2010 who voted to repeal the militarys dont ask dont tell policy and he is a cosponsor of several acts to prevent bullying and discrimination based on sexual orientation Earlier this year he chastised a group of his colleagues for pushing a controversial bill to ban abortions after 20 weeks saying they should be focusing on more important issues like the economy The dwindling coalition of centrist legislators on both sides of the aisle is one of the reasons the current Congress has all but ground to a halt Republicans like Charlie Dent are the only reason Republicans can still plausibly get out of this jam Mr Wasserman said The scary prospect for those wishing to avert similar situations in the future is the prospect of no Charlie Dents left in 10 or 20 years So has Mr Dent ever thought about leaving the Republican Party or calling Congress quits No absolutely not he said For now he just plans to keep doing what he thinks is best for the country and continuing to explain his decisions to voters back home I fully understand that my constituents are not going to agree with me on every vote I cast he said Hell my wife doesnt even agree with me on every vote I cast
"With New Abortion Restrictions, Ohio Walks a Narrow Legal Line",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/us/with-new-abortion-restrictions-ohio-walks-fine-line.html,CLEVELAND  Angela H married with two children became pregnant accidentally and after medical complications during her last pregnancy and severe postpartum depression said neither she nor her family was ready for another child Under a law that took effect in Ohio this month the Cleveland abortion clinic she visited had to offer her a chance not only to view an ultrasound of the fetus but also to watch its beating heart which she said she resented Its a hard decision for anybody to make she said of abortion asking that her surname not be published out of privacy concerns To make it more difficult by passing these laws and making women feel guilty is terrible Ohio has become a laboratory for what antiabortion leaders call the incremental strategy  passing a web of rules designed to push the hazy boundaries of Supreme Court guidelines without flagrantly violating them Many of the rules critics say are designed to discourage women from getting abortions or to hamper clinic operations even forcing some to close The mandated discussion of fetal heartbeats is one of a cascade of abortion restrictions adopted in Ohio over the years from a waiting period to curbs on the medicationinduced abortions preferred by many women The pace has quickened since John R Kasich became governor in 2011 cementing Republican domination of state politics Avowedly antiabortion Mr Kasich said through a spokesman that he considered the restrictions he signed this year reasonable These laws have passed without the national drama provoked by farreaching abortion bans that were approved then overturned in court in states like Arkansas and North Dakota  But taken together they affect patients and clinics in myriad ways  in the view of the laws proponents rightly making women think twice before ending a pregnancy and ensuring clinic safety or in the view of opponents imposing heartless obstacles and guilt on women who are seeking a legal procedure In Ohio the last few years have been fantastic if you support the prolife movement said Mike Gonidakis the president of Ohio Right to Life His group has even lobbied against a more sweeping ban on earlyterm abortions incurring the wrath of more restless abortion foes But he says Weve been able to craft prolife laws that can withstand court scrutiny On Wednesday the American Civil Liberties Union filed a challenge in state court to the heartbeat mandate and other new restrictions asserting that they were adopted in violation of the Ohio Constitutions single subject rule because they were part of an unrelated budget bill More broadly abortionrights advocates call the incremental strategy which has been refined by several national groups and pursued in a number of states an insidious way to limit access to abortion and shame women who in many cases already have to walk past shouting protesters to enter clinics If you cant outlaw abortion outright just make it harder and harder to get said Chrisse France the executive director of Preterm a large nonprofit abortion clinic on the East Side of Cleveland that performs about 4900 abortions a year mainly for lowincome women They say theyre doing this to protect womens health but some of the laws are actually harmful and some are just cruel Conversations with patients at Preterm revealed diverse reactions to the mandated waiting period and counseling but no sign that any women were changing course Madelyn Puterbaugh 23 said that her birth control had failed and that it was not the right time for her to bear a child She said she had turned down the chance to view the fetal heartbeat I didnt look she said I thought Id be too sad She went ahead with the abortion but said she had not minded the required 24hour wait between the counseling and the procedure They gave me a lot to think about she said but its my choice Ohio has long required abortion clinics to have a formal transfer agreement with a nearby hospital for emergency care something physicians say is medically unnecessary because hospitals are required to treat emergency patients Now a new measure bars public hospitals from signing such agreements  a shift that could force two or three of the states remaining 11 clinics to close because they cannot find willing partners Other measures wrapped into the state budget bill this year and signed by Governor Kasich include a requirement that women seeking an abortion be told the probable odds that their pregnancy would go to full term if they changed their minds a diversion of federal welfare money to socalled crisis pregnancy centers new financing for rapecrisis centers on the condition that they provide no abortion referrals and a tightening of parental consent requirements for minors To avoid passing money to Planned Parenthood the state also ended competitive bidding for federal family planning grants giving priority to public agencies As a result some nonprofit womens health centers that have no connection to Planned Parenthood or abortion also face drastic cuts The newest rules follow a flurry of changes in 2011 when among other things the state banned abortions except to save the mothers life once the fetus is viable Fearing potential criminal charges clinic doctors around the state have stopped performing abortions beyond the 22nd week of pregnancy even in cases involving severe birth defects or serious medical conditions Since a federal court allowed it here in 2011 after years of litigation Ohio has been the only state to require what doctors call an outdated less safe and less effective regimen for medication abortions The law mandates adherence to the original Food and Drug Administration approval which called for three times the drug dosage now standard and authorized the method only through seven weeks of pregnancy As a result while later studies showed them to be safe through nine weeks medication abortions can no longer be offered in the eighth and ninth weeks of pregnancy Similar restrictions on medication abortion were passed this year in Texas and are under court challenge they have been voided as unconstitutional barriers in North Dakota and in Oklahoma which is seeking a review by the Supreme Court At Preterm the annual number of nonsurgical abortions plummeted to 90 in 2012 from more than 600 in earlier years But theres no evidence that this cut down on abortion said Ms France the clinic director Women just said Never mind Ill get a surgical abortionÂ  In Ohio as elsewhere abortions have declined over all in recent years although there was a slight uptick to 25473 reported procedures in 2012 with black women accounting for a growing share Whether the new laws have significantly reduced the numbers or simply made abortions more fraught is disputed Mr Gonidakis of Ohio Right to Life said he felt sure the measures had persuaded many women to change their minds and predicted that even more when confronted with the fetal heartbeat and other information would do so in the future There are so many families waiting to adopt he added offering an alternative that crisis pregnancy centers and others are increasingly promoting In the coming months Mr Gonidakis said his organization plans to focus its lobbying on the easing of state adoption rules and an increase in tax breaks for adoptive parents But other antiabortion groups and conservative legislators are pressing ahead with a proposal to ban abortion altogether once a fetal heartbeat is detectable as early as six weeks into pregnancy
California Expands Availability of Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/us/california-expands-availability-of-abortions.html,LOS ANGELES  Gov Jerry Brown on Wednesday expanded access to abortion in California signing a bill to allow nurse practitioners midwives and physician assistants to perform a common type of the procedure an aspiration abortion during the first trimester Oregon Montana Vermont and New Hampshire allow nurse practitioners to perform such abortions which use a tube and suction while several other states including California permit nonphysicians to provide drugs to terminate pregnancy But the new California law goes further allowing a wider range of nonphysician practitioners to perform surgical abortions While other states have passed a tide of laws restricting abortion access California has gone against the political tide We are trending in a different direction and were very proud of it said Toni Atkins the state assemblywoman who wrote the bill California has a strong history of support for reproductive health care for women She said women in rural parts of the state had trouble finding an abortion provider This is an issue of accessibility Ms Atkins said California is a very large state and more than half the counties dont have an abortion provider Abortion opponents said the new law would endanger womens health This bill trivializes what is taking place with abortion said Brian Johnston director of the National Right to Lifes Western regional office It will massively expand the number of abortions and at the same time reduce safety For those who say they care about womens health theyre doing the opposite reducing the medical standards for abortion This is not the first time in recent years that California  where Democrats control all statewide offices and both houses of the State Legislature  has bucked national trends Last year while conservative state governments were enacting tougher qualifications for voting Democrats passed a series of laws intended to make registration and voting easier than ever But on the issue of abortion California is the only state this year to have expanded access to the procedure By contrast 68 restrictions on abortion have been passed by states so far this year according to Elizabeth Nash the state issues manager for the Guttmacher Institute a research organization that studies reproductive health issues California is moving in a direction to protect reproductive health as other states across the country are passing abortion restrictions Ms Nash said Supporters of the bill pointed to a state pilot program at the University of California San Francisco which found that nurse practitioners certified midwife nurses and physician assistants were able to provide the procedure just as safely as surgeons During the pilot program which began in 2007 some 8000 aspiration abortions were provided by nondoctors Complications rates for doctors and nondoctors were similar below 2 percent in both cases This is a very safe procedure and we now have a very large study to show that this does not compromise safety said Dr Tracy Weitz who led the study Most people saying it compromises safety actually have an agenda to make abortion illegal which we know from decades of experience actually makes abortion unsafe Hopefully this will give women more options early in their first trimesters when we know abortion is safest Dr Weitz added And the second trimester when it is more complicated will remain in the domain of physicians Governor Brown announced his approval of the bill along with several others related to womens health care including one that brings construction standards for clinics that perform abortions in line with those of other primarycare clinics
Cory Booker for the U.S. Senate in New Jersey,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/10/opinion/cory-booker-for-the-us-senate-in-new-jersey.html,On Wednesday New Jersey voters will go to the polls to choose a United States senator replacing the late Frank Lautenberg Mayor Cory Booker of Newark a moderate Democrat is running against an extremely conservative Republican Steven Lonegan Mr Booker is far and away the better candidate to serve the needs of his entire state and to provide a national voice for the less fortunate across America Mr Booker has a solid record of bringing investment to Newark adding more housing and reducing corruption in city government The job is of course unfinished and some gains on crime made earlier in his two terms have stalled But he has drawn national attention to Newark bringing in money jobs and development to help revive a city long defined by urban blight He has also worked well with Gov Chris Christie a Republican a good sign that he would be the kind of openminded moderating voice Washington so desperately needs Mr Lonegan a former mayor of Bogota NJ says he wants to focus on economic issues But his method like that of one of his role models Senator Ted Cruz a Republican of Texas could only add to the senseless partisanship that has now taken the economy to the brink of disaster He would for example raise the debt ceiling only in alignment with budget cuts He has a plan to try to close all regulatory agencies every 7 to 10 years and start each agency over from scratch Mr Lonegan is out of the mainstream on many other issues He once said he believed it was a mistake to create Social Security and Medicare such obligations he said should instead have been left to charity He has argued for eliminating the minimum wage He opposes abortion even in cases of rape and incest He opposes samesex marriage and he is pushing to delay the Affordable Care Act His past record on immigration became a national scandal when in 2006 he tried to get McDonalds to take down a billboard printed in Spanish He later tried to have English declared the official language in his hometown  Mr Booker a progressive on social issues supports womens rights samesex marriage health care reform and gun control the National Rifle Association is supporting his opponent He says he would push for a higher minimum wage environmental regulations corporate tax reform and more assistance for college students  We have worried that Mr Booker has tended to be overly secretive about his finances But as this campaign grew more intense he released tax returns for 15 years gave more details about separation payments from a law firm where he worked before entering office and announced plans to end his association with a technology startup he helped found Greater openness and timely disclosure would help him avoid the pitfalls endemic to Washington Mr Booker has lived and worked for people in some of Newarks roughest neighborhoods The Senate will pose different political challenges where success as a legislator will depend less on his fame and personality than on focus and resourcefulness He has the pragmatism and commitment to those in need that will make him a necessary and effective voice in Washington We recommend Cory Booker for the United States Senate 
"A Husband Lost, a Daughter Found",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/fashion/a-husband-lost-a-daughter-found.html,Four years ago when people asked if I was married or had children my answers were easy Yes to the first and no to the second because my husband was alive and the newborn I had placed in an open adoption when I was a teenager hadnt yet found me on Facebook Before the answers became complicated my husband Alberto and I had spent the weekend in Connecticut celebrating my 34th birthday The advertising agency he had founded with his best friend was weathering the recession and I was climbing the ranks at a Manhattan public relations firm  There were no overt signs that Albertos 40yearold heart was about to give out but one terrifying Sunday in March 2009 I awoke and he did not The year that followed came with a different set of questions often from wellmeaning friends Do you regret not freezing his sperm and Dont you wish you had children with him  Alberto and I had discussed the possibility of children on our second date Maybe someday we agreed but no rush So during our three years of marriage we had placed a premium on spontaneity passport stamps and sleep There were moments in the first heavy months of widowhood when I wished Albertos laughter or balloonshaped toes were living on in a toddler Yet I was also relieved that I didnt have to sublimate my grief for motherhood And grieve I did on Twitter on Facebook on Tumblr  What began as catharsis evolved into a public narrative and among the strangers following my story was a teenage girl in North Carolina In the summer of 2011 she exchanged her anonymity for a friend request Because her Facebook name didnt match the one on her birth certificate I failed to make the connection I didnt realize the historic shift my life was about to take until the next morning when I noticed a Facebook chat window on my desktop It was initiated at 110 am and contained one elongated word from someone named Laurie Heyyyy Hey back I thought Who are you again When I clicked on the chat her profile page loaded and I realized exactly who Laurie was She was older than the most recent photo her adoptive parents had sent but there were her fathers dark Filipino eyes and my familys Irish bone structure Her hair was my natural brown which she wore long and straight as I had when I met her biological father in California  He was in his early 20s when I was a highschool senior Our relationship was torrid tumultuous and lasted three months I had ended things with him several weeks before learning I was pregnant but I dutifully gave him the news and the address of my first two prenatal appointments When he showed up for neither I got a sense of how the next few decades might play out My parents met the news of my pregnancy with defeated sighs but managed to voice their support of me and my situation For two weeks after graduation I tried to size up that situation  The exboyfriend was already seeing someone else I had college and career plans Single motherhood and abortion seemed scarier than pregnancy but adoption struck me as a fair tradeoff Id give up nine months of my life and betterqualified people would take over from there The logistics werent exactly clear it was 1993 and preInternet but my father had been adopted in the 1950s so I figured it wouldnt be too complicated My parents urging me to take time and be certain of my choice arranged a summer trip to Idaho where my father had attended college In the little town of Moscow I took a job as a florists assistant and rented a room in the farmhouse of a professors family Before summer edged into fall I decided to forgo my return In addition to corresponding with potential adoptive parents in Idaho I was embarrassed to show my secondtrimester self in my home state of California  In October I spent a weekend at the splitlevel home of a Boise couple who had grown up in California and possessed what I did not college degrees a mortgage and a 14year marriage I met their suburban friends and admired their adopted toddler who knew precisely when to say please and thank you  I could envision my child  a daughter according to the ultrasound  having a lovely life with them I wasnt mistaken not when I placed her in their arms at the hospital nor when I returned to my prepregnancy life Dont you wonder what shes like friends and relatives would ask Never had to wonder Through 17 years of photos I watched Laurie and her three adopted sisters grow up with matching Easter dresses private schools summer art classes and cooking lessons Via letters Lauries parents shared her first phrases and which classes she was acing  Their postmarked letters came first from Idaho then North Carolina My replies were postmarked from Berkeley from which I graduated with an English degree West Hollywood where I found a niche in PR and New York where I moved after marrying Alberto on our eighth date And now exactly six months before her 18th birthday the postmark was virtual and from Laurie herself  Through tears I made ecstatic calls to my parents and girlfriends I devoured all 793 of Lauries Facebook pictures replied to her chat and our digital dance began Every two weeks we exchanged gushy 300word Facebook messages with new stories questions and answers I sensed where we were heading phone calls a reunion Skype and felt more than a twinge of anxiety What did she expect from me What kind of person did she hope to find  While I was in a better head space than during the previous griefsoaked year the signifiers of a life under construction  binge drinking deadline extensions halfhearted relationships  were still very much in evidence I wasnt ready to be anyones role model And I had no idea how to be a mom Yet when our voices finally met I heard my own teenage giggle and cadence in hers And the voice wasnt accusing me of motherhood issues or abandonment Laurie wanted to hear about my wedding day my job and what living in New York City was like She in turn described her best friends her crosscountry race times and what she loved about her boyfriend A few giddy hours later she popped the question Will you fly to North Carolina for a sleepover on my 18th birthday What about your parents I asked She assured me of their approval  I promised I would come When we hung up I made eye contact with Albertos framed portrait  Alberto I said Im meeting my daughter in three weeks Is there a script for this The next morning I made a plan I wanted to meet Laurie without tobaccostained fingertips or the 10 pounds I had gained which meant hello to Pilates and goodbye to cigarettes and beer I knew three weeks werent enough for a total transformation but a new regimen put me back in touch with the energy and focus I had been lacking How I looked or smelled was of little consequence when Laurie and I collided in a hug 18 years in the making we became one silhouette of fabric limbs tears and giggles Face to face we were astonished by the similarities in our handwriting gestures and sleep posture Sprawled out on her trundle bed the morning after our sleepover I apologized for not being much of a grownup I admitted I had imagined myself far more grounded in life and love at this age She interrupted to say how impressed she was by my foreign travel sky diving and urban life Her admiration melted my fear that I wasnt the kind of mother she wanted me to be Back in New York I became that annoying person showing everyone photos of her daughter The lifestyle changes Laurie inspired actually stuck and counteracted my grief triggers Pilates and biking helped me sleep soundly No smoking meant I drank less and had fewer winechoked meltdowns More significantly the frequent texts I was exchanging with Laurie left me little reason to feel sad or get drunk Since the reunion Lauries parents have welcomed me for her senior prom and graduation and last summer the two of us flew to California for a week with my parents During her first major heartbreak she turned to me for advice And as I reenter the dating scene I send her mirror selfies of my outfits and postdinner debriefs Becoming a widow and then a mother in that order isnt how I pictured my 30something life unfolding Yet losing my husband deepened my joy in finding my daughter And embracingÂ my narrative means Im no longer daunted by those smalltalk questions Yes I was married I lost him to a heart attack And yes Im a new mom to an incredible 19yearold named Laurie
Madame Restellâ€™s Other Profession,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/realestate/madame-restells-other-profession.html,In July the Streetscapes column looked at the claim that the 1870 Stuyvesant was the first New York apartment house and decided in the affirmative But no one is on solid ground in declaring a first unless he can also propose a second and it turns out that runnerup is a lot harder to find than the winner Whereas the Stuyvesant was built by an old New York family the likeliest No 2 is the work of a woman shunned by society Until someone examines every one of the hundreds of building permits in the 1870s any opinion is part guesswork But a strong candidate for the citys second apartment building is Ann Lohmans Osborne completed in 1876 on the east side of Fifth Avenue from 52nd to 53rd Street Under the name Madame Restell Mrs Lohman was in the abortion business with her husband Charles as early as the 1840s and had done well enough by the 1860s to build a large brownstone mansion on the northeast corner of Fifth and 52nd Street which she acquired as part of a larger lot According to her obituary in The New York Times in 1878 she had tried to sell off the adjacent land including a 75foot piece of frontage on Fifth Avenue but no one wanted to live next to her This was before the arrival in this section of the Vanderbilts who finished three colossal mansions across the street in 1882 So in 1875 Mrs Lohman retained the architects Duggin  Crossman hitherto specialists in the design of topend speculative row houses Staying in character they designed a topend apartment house looking just like two sidebyside overbig brownstones each 37 12 feet wide Cut them down by a third and they could be ordinary Midtown row houses except for the single central doorway with elaborate torchiers For a building at the dawn of the apartment age the Osborne had a very creditable plan Â It had a good address and unlikeÂ theÂ 1874 Black Starr  Frost Building farther down Fifth at 28th StreetÂ no groundfloor stores to dilute its residential claims Each floor had two nineroom apartments running front to back yielding about the same amount of space as two floors in a goodsize brownstone discounting the space for the stairway in a row house The kitchens were at the back important if you didnt want to entertain your teatime guests with the smell of your dinner The entertaining spaces three rooms that could be thrown together en suite were placed in the universally accepted location facing the street Each bedroom had a closet and it was not an afterthought as in other buildings A single bathroom sufficed for the whole apartment Perhaps people in the 19th century didnt have to go as often as we do The two servants rooms were 9 by 11 feet  noticeably larger than many servants rooms in top buildings now on Park and even Fifth Avenue typically 6 by 10 The apartments had coat linen and china closets and rear stairs for servants Most important the building had a steam elevator  two elevators in fact The front passenger car attended by a hall boy in livery kept in constant motion from an early hour in the morning until a late hour at night according to an 1880 issue of the journal Carpentry and Building It is the elevator the lack of which had been noted at the Stuyvesant that more than anything denotes the genteel quality of the Osborne But the upper floors were still not considered desirable Apartments on the second floor were 210 a month by the fifth floor they fell to 150 In terms of access all apartments had not yet been created equal The Times noted that even with these accouterments and its Fifth Avenue location the Osborne had trouble attracting tenants and had to reduce rents by 50 percent The 1880 census seems to show the building half filled albeit with brokers merchants and other prosperous citizens who were not picky about their neighbor An unusual tenant was George Ripley a reformer and writer who advanced the idea of a socialist utopia and edited The Dial in the 1920s an influential literary journal Even he had several servants In 1878 Madame Restell committed suicide by razor in a bathtub a fit ending to an odious career in the opinion of The Times which was indignant that her ghastly traffic had permitted her to acquire real estate worth 750000 Relatives continued the operation of the Osborne but in 1883 they converted the Restell house and the Osborne into the Langham Hotel for transients The Osborne name was soon taken by the apartment house at Seventh Avenue and 57th Street apparently unrelated and the hotel was demolished around 1900 In 1870 The Times had written There is no other city in Christendom to which the proper and complete solution of this apartmenthouse problem is so important as to New York essentially predicting New Yorks future as an apartment city And almost immediately after the Osborne was built the elevator became the sine qua non of elite apartment living Madame Restells reputation remains that of one who profited by a ghastly trade her pioneering effort in architecture almost entirely forgotten

How Activist Is the Supreme Court?,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/sunday-review/how-activist-is-the-supreme-court.html,WASHINGTON  JUSTICES Antonin Scalia and Ruth Bader Ginsburg are ideological antagonists on the Supreme Court but they agree on one thing Their court is guilty of judicial activism If its measured in terms of readiness to overturn legislation this is one of the most activist courts in history Justice Ginsburg said in August in an interview with The New York Times This court has overturned more legislation I think than any other But Justice Ginsburg overstated her case If judicial activism is defined as the tendency to strike down laws the court led by Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr is less activist than any court in the last 60 years  Nonetheless Justice Ginsburgs impression fits with a popular perception of the court In 2010 in Citizens United it struck down part of a federal law regulating campaign spending by corporations and unions overruling two precedents in the bargain In June it struck down parts of the Voting Rights Act and the Defense of Marriage Act The court will no doubt be accused of yet more activism if it continues to dismantle campaign finance restrictions as it seemed ready to do Tuesday at arguments in a case about limits on campaign contributions from individuals But these decisions are outliers when measured against the courts overall record over the last nine years It is perhaps unsurprising that the liberal court led by Chief Justice Earl Warren from 1953 to 1969 invalidated federal state and local laws at almost twice the rate of the Roberts court But the more conservative court that followed led by Chief Justice Warren E Burger from 1969 to 1986 was even more activist striking down laws in almost 9 percent of its cases compared with just over 7 percent in the Warren court and just 4 percent in the Roberts court The court led by Chief Justice William H Rehnquist from 1986 to 2005 was also more activist than the current one at 64 percent  Lee Epstein who teaches law and political science at the University of Southern California cautioned that it was dangerous to draw definitive conclusions from a fairly small number of decisions from the Roberts court Still she said claims about the Roberts courts activism seem overwrought Indeed there is a new school of criticism  one that includes some voices from the right where judicial restraint was once part of conservative legal orthodoxy  that says the Supreme Court is not activist enough  In a recent essay Why We Need More Judicial Activism Suzanna Sherry a law professor at Vanderbilt University said the Supreme Court had erred more often in sustaining laws than in striking them down Too much of a good thing can be bad she wrote and democracy is no exception In a new book Terms of Engagement Clark M Neily III of the Institute for Justice a libertarian group calculated that the Supreme Court struck down just 103 of the 15817 laws enacted by Congress in the halfcentury ending in 2002 It is implausible he wrote to suppose the federal government hits the constitutional strike zone 995 percent of the time Mr Neily urged the Supreme Court to be more active but rejected the phrase judicial activism  Its inherently pejorative he said favoring instead a new term judicial engagement  The federal appeals court in Atlanta adopted that nomenclature in 2011 in striking down the heart of President Obamas health care law saying the Constitution requires judicial engagement not judicial abdication After the Supreme Court argument in the case in the spring of 2012 with things looking grim for the fate of his law Mr Obama tried to shift the terms of the discussion back to activism Id just remind conservative commentators he said that for years what weve heard is the biggest problem on the bench was judicial activism or a lack of judicial restraint  that an unelected group of people would somehow overturn a duly constituted and passed law Three months after Mr Obamas remarks Chief Justice Roberts broke with his usual conservative allies and voted with the courts four liberals to uphold the law In a joint dissent the four conservatives said the majority was wrong to portray its ruling as judicial modesty when it amounts instead to a vast judicial overreaching Writing in Public Discourse last year Joel Alicea then a law student at Harvard University said the clash between the chief justices opinion and that of the joint dissenters is a clash between two visions of judicial restraint and two eras of the conservative legal movement Justice Scalia said last month that he used another definition when I complain about the activism of my court His colleagues were activist he said at George Washington University when they identified rights like one to abortion that were not in the text of the Constitution The Roberts court may not be especially activist in the classic sense of striking down a lot of laws But there does appear to be an element of politics in its rulings  In a nutshell liberal justices tend to invalidate conservative laws and conservative justices liberal laws Professor Epstein and Andrew D Martin of Washington University in St Louis wrote last year in The Emory Law Journal in a look at the Roberts courts first five terms Only Justice Anthony M Kennedy the justice at the courts ideological center is a puzzle In remarks this month at the University of Pennsylvania he said his court should play only a modest role Any society that relies on nine unelected judges to resolve the most serious issues of the day is not a functioning democracy he said Yet Justice Kennedy is the most aggressive of the Roberts justices voting with the majority 94 percent of the time when the court struck down a law Professors Epstein and Martin found Unlike the other Roberts justices they added no underlying ideological pattern seems to exist to Kennedys votes Justice Ginsburg said there was a theory behind her votes to strike down some laws and not others In general she said we trust the democratic process so the court is highly deferential to what Congress does But some laws she went on require special scrutiny Citing a famous footnote in a 1938 Supreme Court decision United States v Carolene Products she said courts must be more vigilant when fundamental rights are at stake when the political process has been frustrated or when disfavored minorities are singled out for mistreatment That explains she said why she was in dissent in the 54 decision in June to strike down part of the Voting Rights Act a decision she called stunning in terms of activism That law she said meant to protect black voters She was in the majority the next day in a 54 decision striking down the Defense of Marriage Act which denied federal benefits to married samesex couples That law she said singled out gays and lesbians for discrimination Mr Neily in common with few people except Justice Kennedy the

What Do We Owe the Future?,https://opinionator.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/13/what-do-we-owe-the-future/,"SAN SEBASTIN Spain Contemporary life is overloaded with visions of the future Whereas Friedrich Nietzsche bemoaned the surplus of historical sense crushing old Europe under the weight of its past we are now suffering from an obsession

                                        well beyond the temporal horizon of the present But how do we determine the interests of and our obligations to those not yet born Are we really able to listen to what the future
                                        tells or more often faintly whispers to us And more crucial still why are the demands of the present neither pressing nor absorbing enough in their own right 
                                        
                                     Its true that the consequences of todays actions are going to have a longterm impact The effects of a disaster like Fukushima will certainly outlast those responsible for the catastrophe But does

                                        emphasizes the rights of the unborn in order to regulate female sexuality The reductio ad absurdum of this argument is the prohibition of any form of contraception by certain religious conservatives who place

                                             Another dimension of the colonization of the future is its idealization as the beall and endall of our actions The future is converted into a fetish that supplements the deficiencies and redeems the flaws inherent
                                        in the present Since the coming generations have not yet attained empirical existence the ones now living will never be able to measure up to their purported perfection This seemingly new phenomenon is actually a mutation of the old metaphysical tendency to debase the world here below at the expense of an otherworldly ideal Platos Ideas Aristotles unmoved mover medieval

"Chuck Smith, Minister Who Preached to Flower Children, Dies at 86",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/us/chuck-smith-minister-who-preached-to-flower-children-dies-at-86.html,The Rev Chuck Smith a Southern California minister who shepherded flower children and rock n roll into the conservative wing of the evangelical movement while building a religious organization that grew to encompass 700 congregations and hundreds of radio stations died on Oct 3 at his home in Newport Beach Calif He was 86 The cause was lung cancer said a spokesman for Calvary Chapel of Costa Mesa the flagship church of Mr Smiths worldwide Calvary Chapel federation Though lesser known than evangelical leaders like the Rev Pat Robertson and the Rev James C Dobson Mr Smith was influential for his liturgical innovations for the cultivation of a new generation of prominent preachers and for the introduction of pop culture into the evangelical movements vernacular His amalgam of fireandbrimstone theology and avuncular charm made him a successful if unlikely Christian fundamentalist ambassador to the youth culture of the late 1960s He predicted the end of the world and condemned drug use sex out of wedlock abortion and homosexuality while serving as pastor to a hippie tribe known as the Jesus Movement To his ragged following he was Papa Chuck and he welcomed them to his church by the thousands accepting their barefoot floorsitting outdoorliving habits and incorporating their rock music into his Sunday services  an innovation that other evangelical churches as well as mainline Protestant and Roman Catholic churches later adopted His decision to dispense with the traditional liturgy replace pipe organs with electric guitars preach from the pulpit in a Hawaiian shirt if he felt like it and give the same comeasyouare rights to worshipers set the standard in the 1970s for what the church historian Donald E Miller a professor of religion at the University of Southern California has called the new paradigm of independent Christian megachurches Mr Smiths disavowal of denominational labels  he did not call his church Pentecostal Baptist or Assembly of God but rather just a Christian church  has also been widely embraced in the evangelical world In 1971 Mr Smith helped found Maranatha Music one of the first contemporary Christian record companies in the United States partly to provide a platform for the Christian musicians and songwriters who performed at his church The group Love Song one of the first Christian rock groups was for a time a kind of house band at Calvary Chapel In 1996 Mr Smith and a protg Mike Kestler founded the Calvary Satellite Network which broadcasts sermons and Christian music over about 400 lowpower and 50 fullpower stations in 45 states Mr Smith himself was never a fiery preacher and rarely appeared on television His sermons with linebyline explications of the Bible were more professorial than charismatic Outside Calvary Chapel he was probably best known for the people he mentored Those who went on to lead large evangelical organizations of their own included Greg Laurie pastor of Harvest Christian Fellowship a network of several hundred churches and Kenn Gulliksen the founder of a church movement called Vineyard who introduced Bob Dylan to evangelical Christianity which Mr Dylan embraced in the 1970s and early 80s Mr Gulliksen is often referred to as Bob Dylans pastor It was Mr Smiths simple teaching style and easygoing manner mainly that drew members of the Jesus Movement to his church in 1969 after his own teenage children had introduced him to movement followers they had befriended at the beach One was Lonnie Frisbee a selfdescribed mystic and prophet who became prominent in the movement With Mr Frisbee as his liaison Mr Smith was soon holding mass baptisms in the surf at Corona del Mar dunking longhaired men and women in the Pacific by the hundreds Some called them Jesus freaks a phrase Time magazine used in a 1971 cover article about the movement It looked like no congregation anyone had ever seen before Mr Laurie wrote in his 2008 memoir Lost Boy Barefoot hippies sat on the floor praising the Lord while old ladies in hats smiled shrugged and sang their hymns Randall Balmer a scholar of evangelical culture and chairman of the Dartmouth College religion department said in an interview that even in a congregation that embraced the counterculture Mr Smith never sugarcoated his fundamentalist beliefs Besides condemning illicit sex and recreational drugs he called homosexuality a perverted lifestyle warned of the eternal hell awaiting sinners and promised the imminent arrival of Armageddon He said the Sept 11 terrorist attacks signaled Gods displeasure with the general acceptance of homosexuality and abortion Mr Balmer said some of Mr Smiths young followers might have been disillusioned with the counterculture and searching for spiritual sustenance elsewhere when they joined Calvary Chapel But the pastors genius for incorporating counterculture trappings into his brand of evangelism was part of his appeal too Mr Balmer said as was his sheer likability This was a very charming man he said Charles Ward Smith was born in Ventura Calif on June 25 1927 to Charles and Maude Smith whom he described to interviewers as Bible quoting Christians His father was a salesman After graduating in 1948 from the Bible college of the Foursquare Church a Pentecostal denomination Mr Smith served several of its congregations before leaving convinced that internal politics was the unChristian scourge of Foursquare and every other denomination The more spiritual a man is the less denominational he becomes he wrote years later He started his own church in the early 1960s and in 1965 agreed to become pastor of Calvary Chapel which was then a struggling nondenominational congregation with about 25 members By the 1970s attendance at Sunday services averaged 3000 He is survived by his wife Catherine L Johnson Smith four children Chuck Jr Jeff Janette Smith Manderson and Cheryl Smith Brodersen and five grandchildren Based on his reading of the Book of Revelation Mr Smith began predicting the end of the world in the early 1980s Although his predictions repeatedly proved wrong he was undeterred Every year I believe this could be the year he told an interviewer We are one year closer than we were
The Clone Named Dolly,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/14/booming/the-clone-named-dolly.html,This weeks Retro Report video tells the story of Dolly the sheep the first clone of an adult mammal The Scottish scientists who created her recall the painstaking process of trying to get the experiment to work After hundreds of tries they successfully took a cell from an adult sheep fused it to another sheeps unfertilized egg and implanted the resulting embryo in a surrogate mother But Dollys birth and the rush of media attention that followed when the news broke in 1997 gave way almost instantaneously to fears and speculation about what this discovery meant for humanitys ability to manipulate biology The debate only intensified in 1998 when an American scientist isolated human embryonic stem cells which can develop into any type of cell in the body raising the hope of a new field of regenerative medicine Here one of the science reporters who covered the debate for The Times offers a rearview commentary Some events are just too emotive to be seen clearly until long after the dust has settled The cloning of Dolly the sheep created a public ruckus because of the assumption that sheep clones would lead straight to human clones The generation of human embryonic stem cells raised much the same set of fears Both cases stirred deep anxieties that science was getting out of hand and moving deep into ethically fraught territory But in terms of the march of science both events were of distinctly secondorder magnitude a fact almost impossible to convey at the time The difficult step in animal cloning had in fact been taken many years before in the cloning of frogs and when the Nobel Prize jurors got around to recognizing the field they gave their award to John Gurdon frog cloner not to Ian Wilmut the socalled father of Dolly In a similar vein the discoverer of embryonic stem cells was Martin Evans an English biologist who developed the technique in mice in 1981 The world only started paying attention to stem cells in 1998 when James A Thomson of the University of Wisconsin applied Dr Evanss recipe to people but the Nobel Prize went to Dr Evans Journalists are sometimes said to write the first draft of history But its hard to write history about events that are being driven by emotion In the debate over human embryonic stem cells the opponents were concerned that federal funding for the research in which castoff earlystage human embryos are destroyed would be the first step toward federal funding of abortion Partly in reaction some proponents of embryonic stem cell research vastly overpromised the probable medical treatments which 32 years after Dr Evanss experiment and 15 years after Dr Thomsons are barely visible Clinical trials for a treatment for macular degeneration are proceeding but a muchheralded one for spinal cord injury was abandoned in 2011 Basic scientific research is enormously risky If it werent the government wouldnt have to finance it Most research ideas end up as dry holes Its fine for the federal government to take such a risk because it can afford to support 100 such projects of which the one winner will make up for all the dogs Yet in the frenzy of claims about the miraculous medical cures that President George W Bush was seen as obstructing voters in California in 2004 placed a 3 billion bet on stem cell research  a lot of risk for a single state to bear The frustration of reporting events like Dolly and stem cells is that its almost impossible to get such longerterm considerations into a daily news story which typically focuses on a tiny piece of a large and complex puzzle The charged issue of human stem cell origins was eventually sidestepped by technology In 2006 a Japanese biologist Shinya Yamanaka cleverly guessed the identity of the four transcription factors responsible for the stemness of stem cells When these are injected into an adult cell they make it revert to the egglike status from which it was once derived Little or no need anymore to mess with the castoff embryos from fertility clinics The future of stem cell research almost certainly lies with the Yamanaka method which can use the patients own cells and dodge any problem of immune incompatibility But most schemes for therapeutic use still depend implicitly on the idea that stem cells can be converted into the right cell type in the test tube and then dropped into the body as wellbehaved replacement cells Its far from certain that this will always be the case No test tube treatment can exactly replicate the experience of a cell in a growing embryo as it is exposed to a complex sequence of signals from a constantly changing cast of neighboring cells In retrospect Dolly the clone was just a sheep not the start of a great moral collapse Embryonic stem cells despite the furor may turn out to be a technical dead end But reporters cannot stand aside from the waves of emotion that drive such issues They just have to do the best they can with their first draft and hope it doesnt look too ridiculous in the cold light of history This weeks Retro Report is the 15th in

"De Blasio, Attacking Lhota, Dominates in Their First Debate",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/nyregion/de-blasio-and-lhota-trade-barbs-in-first-televised-debate.html,Bill de Blasio not content to rest on a lopsided lead in the race for New York City mayor relentlessly pounded his rival Joseph J Lhota in their first televised debate on Tuesday repeatedly linking him to what he called an obstructionist national Republican Party and the divisive mayoralty of Rudolph W Giuliani Shedding the traditional playitsafe strategy of a frontrunner Mr de Blasio a Democrat dominated the hourlong confrontation pursuing the last word in every exchange pleading with the panelists for longer response times and throwing his less agile opponent off balance with pointed crossexaminations  Mr Lhota a Republican arrived determined to raise questions about Mr de Blasios thin managerial resume to portray him as an overly conciliatory liberal unprepared to face down crime and to depict his social agenda as ruinous to the citys already shrinking middle class Instead Mr Lhota spent much of the evening defending the fare increases during his time as chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority explaining why he met with Tea Party members on Staten Island and justifying his wish to delay the start of President Obamas Affordable Care Act At times Mr Lhota was left to protest that Mr de Blasio was trying to inaccurately lump me with national Republicans  Its unbecoming Bill said Mr Lhota a supporter of samesex marriage and abortion rights But Mr de Blasio kept on the same line of attack repeating it over and over The fact is he does subscribe to the views of the Republican Party that have hurt New York City Mr de Blasio said The debate on WABCTV seemed to showcase the nimbleness of Mr de Blasio a longtime political operative who is now the citys public advocate even as it revealed the depth of Mr Lhotas difficulties in front of a large audience  Instead of exposing Mr de Blasios weaknesses Mr Lhota a former deputy mayor under Mayor Giuliani found himself consistently outmaneuvered The body language was revealing Mr Lhota seldom made eye contact with Mr de Blasio In fact his eyes often drooped closed for several seconds He frequently seemed tangled in the nuances of his own policy plans expending precious minutes that might have been used to deliver his own attacks At one point he became bogged down in a laborious and academicsounding debate over the constitutionality of mandatory inclusionary zoning a policy that requires affordable housing in certain developments Even the debates moderator Bill Ritter a news anchor on WABC seemed a bit dazed after the discussion thanking the candidates for spending so much time on an arcane and admittedly unsexy topic In the end there was no crystallizing moment or memorable gaffe that underdog campaigns crave as they try to shake up the dynamic of a race Mr de Blasio proved adept at sidestepping questions he did not like Invited to offer two ideas for negotiating with municipal unions he pivoted into a critique of Mayor Michael R Bloomberg administrations attitude toward labor that ended with the milquetoast declaration that we have to balance our budget  And asked to explain how his meager management experience qualified him to be mayor Mr de Blasio seemed to ignore the question entirely starting into a non sequitur about Mr Lhotas work in the Giuliani administration and listing endorsements from highprofile Democrats  Though both candidates sometimes seemed scolding and selfserious there were a few lighter moments Dave Evans a reporter for WABC recalled the Democratic nominees meteoric rise saying that just a few months ago most people didnt know who Bill de Blasio was Mr de Blasio cut in Dave I agree There was an inevitable exchange of dueling sports team allegiances Mr Lhota teased Mr de Blasio for his Boston loyalties saying he could accept Mr de Blasios support for the Red Sox but drew the line at his fondness for the Celtics The thing that bothers me the most said Mr Lhota a former executive at Madison Square Garden home to the Knicks youve got to support our basketball teams here in the city Aware of his rivals runaway popularity Mr Lhota sought ways to latch on to Mr de Blasios populist message In a metoo moment Mr Lhota joined in with Mr de Blasios fierce critique of the Bloomberg administration deriding the mayor as insensitive for urging more billionaires to move into the city and chastising Mr Bloomberg for paying too little attention to the residents outside Manhattan  But at times the facts eluded Mr Lhota He accused Mr de Blasio of offering to send police officers to have coffee with motorcyclists some of whom have menaced city drivers in recent weeks even dragging a man out of an SUV and beating him However Mr de Blasio never suggested such a kaffeeklatsch Perhaps the evenings most substantive clash was over the future of charter schools in New York a topic that has long divided parents unions and educators Mr de Blasio who has said he wants to stop allowing such schools to use city space for free struck a conciliatory tone promising to work with charters that are doing a good job But he made clear he would not embrace the charter school movement wholeheartedly as the current mayor has  Mr Lhota a vocal supporter of charter schools said his opponent was revising his position for a general election audience Bill de Blasio has changed his mind and has flipflopped on this issue during the entire Democratic primary he said The debate  one of three planned before the election on Nov 5  was the first time in a marathon campaign that Mr de Blasio had stood face to face with a single political rival He had benefited from a string of multicandidate primary debates where his opponents struggled to pin him down on specifics of his policy plans The stylistic differences between the two candidates were evident throughout the night Mr de Blasio his jacket unbuttoned and slightly askew spoke of using our economic dollars to lift people up from the grass roots Mr Lhota his suit buttoned snugly and adorned with an American flag pin recalled spending much more time in the private sector As the debate wound down the candidates were offered a chance to say what they admired most about their rival Mr Lhota readily pointed to Mr de Blasios wife and two children calling them a wonderful family  I cant speak enough of them Mr de Blasio was less effusive  Oh he said to the moderator with a sly grin I thought you wanted me to talk about me He let out a loud laugh before settling on a modest compliment Joe Lhota he said is a very knowledgeable guy 
"With G.O.P. Badly Divided, Boehner Is Left â€˜Herding Catsâ€™",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/16/us/politics/as-deadline-looms-boehner-herding-cats-in-bid-for-deal.html,WASHINGTON  After House Republicans began their closeddoor meeting on Tuesday with an impromptu rendition of Amazing Grace Speaker John A Boehner stood up with what he hoped would be an equally inspiring message The Senate was trying to steamroll the House with a new plan to reopen the government and lift the debt ceiling leaving his team with only two options We can wait on the Senate for four days and accept whatever they give us he told them Or we can go on offense and force their hand It was yet another moment of decision for Mr Boehner who finally finds himself at the crossroads he has been marching toward for weeks an imminent financial default on the one hand and on the other an unyielding conservative rank and file that persists with the futile effort to take down President Obamas health care law even if they also take down the speaker in the process  While his colleagues sang about how what once was lost had now been found Mr Boehner did not tell them a more dispiriting truth With less than 48 hours left before the nation is set to exhaust its authority to borrow money he and his lieutenants were running out ofÂ ideas  a fact made starkly evident by the mad and fruitless scramble on Tuesday to come up with aÂ measure that could win enough support from his members Around 7 pm he sent the House home and canceled all votes for the day Hes herding cats said Representative Tom Price Republican of Georgia Mr Boehner initially tried to unite his conference around a plan that had a little bit for everyone For his hardline conservative members Mr Boehners proposal would have eliminated government contributions for the purchase of health insurance on the new exchanges for lawmakers White House officials and their staffs as well as forbidden the Treasury Department to use extraordinary measures to extend its borrowing capabilities For his more moderate members Mr Boehner offered a simple appeal  his plan would have reopened the government through Dec 15 and extended the nations borrowing authority through Feb 7  But conservatives and their advocacy groups balked and Mr Boehner was forced to set his plan aside This is about as challenging as it can be in terms of trying to figure out where the effective agreement is going to be to move forward and how do you get to that point where everybody looks at that and says Well that isnt everything but thats a reasonable way forwardÂ  said David Winston a Republican strategist and close adviser to Mr Boehner Almost every day since the government shutdown began on Oct 1 Mr Boehner and his besieged band of House Republicans have trotted out a new gambit to try to outmaneuver Senate Democrats and the president The public was upset over closed national monuments Pass legislation reopening them Vital health and safety services had no staff to carry out their functions Appropriate money to finance them All the while Mr Boehner of Ohio tended carefully to the members of his fractious conference He joined them Friday night for P F Changs Chinese takeout in the Capitol After an appearance on the Sunday talk shows he shopped at his local Harris Teeter and invited some lawmakers to his Capitol Hill town house for burgers manning the grill himself He assumed the role of battlefield commander admonishing the president in public in the sternest of terms Mr Boehner has also sought solace in his routines He still takes long walks in the morning before heading to his office in the Capitol and often eats breakfast alone at the counter of Petes Diner not far from his house This month shortly after the shutdown began Mr Boehner huddled in his Capitol suite with a group of allies and loyal members  Representatives Tom Cole of Oklahoma John Kline of Minnesota and Pat Tiberi of Ohio among others  known as Team Boehner The strategy has largely worked so far satisfying the most unmanageable of Mr Boehners restive conservative members But the next 48 hours may prove the biggest test of Mr Boehners career and determine his future at the top of House Republicans Its tough said Senator Saxby Chambliss the Georgia Republican who is one of the speakers closest friends in Congress Trying to find 218 votes is never easy But right now its harder than ever Senator Lindsey Graham Republican of South Carolina who as a House member in the late 1990s was part of a successful coup to unseat Speaker Newt Gingrich described Mr Boehners tenuous state more bluntly worrying aloud that if Mr Boehner is unable to pass some proposal out of the House the speaker may find himself in a compromised situation I was involved in taking one speaker down Mr Graham said Id like to be involved in keeping this speaker because quite frankly I think he deserves it A major source of Mr Boehners limitations as speaker is simple math Republicans control 232 seats and 218 are required for a majority when there are no vacancies meaning that in most instances he can afford to lose only 14 Republican votes For much of the 113th Congress that has meant that the only bills guaranteed to pass are simple nonpartisan matters like renaming a federal building or ones that strongly reflect conservative policies like the ban on abortion 20 weeks after fertilization Because Mr Boehner can almost never guarantee Senate leaders that his conference will vote with him he has greatly diminished bargaining power in the current fight as his members pass one deadend bill after another Theres a silent majority in the conference said Representative Devin Nunes Republican of California We have too many guys who dont understand that without 218 you have no leverage At the end of the day thats the problem That has not stopped Mr Boehner from trying He has been in near constant contact with Republican leaders in the Senate who have conveyed to Mr Boehner what they believe their moderate Democratic counterparts might be willing to accept He has also been carefully soliciting the views of his own members bringing in at least two small groups of moderate legislators for private meetings and buttonholing other colleagues on the House floor and in the cloakroom He is a really good listener said Representative James Lankford of Oklahoma the chairman of the House Republican Policy Committee So hes constantly trying to figure out is this one person or is this a group that thinks this And how large is that group I just think he has a really unique skill of being able to hear people and where they are Mr Boehner may be unable to corral his maverick members but they still rely on him heavily to bring in money for their reelections On Tuesday in a telling reminder of his bigdollar prowess Mr Boehners campaign committee filed its thirdquarter fundraising report Boehneraffiliated committees transferred 41 million to the National Republican Congressional Committee during the third quarter making him its largest source of member money by far

California Sees Gridlock Ease in Governing,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/us/california-upends-its-image-of-legislative-dysfunction.html,LOS ANGELES  Before Washington California was the national symbol of partisan paralysis and government dysfunction This was the place where voter initiatives slashed the power of state lawmakers runaway deficits and gridlocked budgets were the rule of the day and a circus of a recall election forced a governor out of office 10 months into his second term  But in the past month California has been the stage for a series of celebrations of unlikely legislative success  a parade of bill signings that offered a contrast between the shutdown in Washington and an acrimonyfree California Legislature that enacted laws dealing with subjects including school financing immigration gun control and abortion The turnaround from just 10 years ago  striking in tone productivity and at least on fiscal issues moderation  is certainly a lesson in the power of oneparty rule Democrats hold an overwhelming majority in the Assembly and Senate and the governor Jerry Brown is a Democrat The Republican Party which just three years ago held the governors seat and a feisty minority in both houses has diminished to the point of near irrelevance But the new atmosphere in Sacramento also offers the first evidence that three major changes in Californias governance system intended to leach some of the partisanship out of politics  championed by reform advocates  may also be having their desired effect in a state that has long offered itself as the legislative laboratory for the nation You see Republicans voting for immigration reform you see Democrats voting for streamlining environmental regulations said Dan Schnur the director of the Jesse M Unruh Institute of Politics at the University of Southern California You never would have seen that before Lawmakers came into office this year representing districts whose lines were drawn by a nonpartisan commission rather than under the more calculating eye of political leaders This is the first Legislature chosen under an election system where the top two finishers in a nonpartisan primary run against each other regardless of party affiliations an effort to prod candidates to appeal to a wider ideological swath of the electorate And California voters approved last year an initiative to ease stringent term limits which had produced a Statehouse filled with inexperienced legislators looking over the horizon to the next election Lawmakers can now serve 12 years in either the Assembly or the Senate The other day Anthony Cannella a Republican state senator joined Democrats as Mr Brown signed a bill cosponsored by Mr Cannella permitting unauthorized immigrants to obtain drivers licenses Mr Cannella said his district which was 35 percent Republican when he was elected in 2010 will have considerably fewer Republican votes under district lines drawn by the independent commission for the next election Unlike Republicans in other parts of the country Mr Cannella is far from insulated from the demographic shifts in California where growing Latino and Asian populations favor Democrats Mr Cannella who described himself as a longtime supporter of the immigration bill said the redistricting and nonpartisan election changes were freeing lawmakers from obedience to their party bases Its given more courage to my Republican colleagues he said They were afraid of getting primaries Now its not just their base they have to appeal to Adam Mendelsohn a former senior adviser to Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger a Republican who championed the ballot changes said they were altering the nature of the Legislature but also his own party It gives Republicans the chance to break from their caucus on certain issues he said It is very different than it was four or five years ago Democrats may also be changing The state Chamber of Commerce reported last month that 39 of the 40 bills it had described as jobkilling  regulatory legislation that typically was supported by Democrats  had been defeated this year In the freshman class a lot of the folks had moderate voting records said Anthony Rendon a Democrat who was elected to the State Assembly last year evidence of the need for many legislators to appeal beyond the Democratic base But Mr Rendon who is also a political scientist said that of the three changes term limits were having the most immediate effect Mr Rendon said he had held back a child care bill that would have permitted unions to represent homebased child care workers this year so he could draft a bill that would draw a broader coalition of support next year We dont need to solve all the states problems in the first year out he said The fact that these reforms are kicking in at the same time that Democrats enjoy ironclad control of the government makes it difficult to draw longterm conclusions about their effectiveness Some critics of state governance argued that Democratic dominance and the fact that Mr Brown has proved to be a moderating force on his party vetoing certain bills on gun control and immigration were as much driving factors Its sort of like the good government community and political elite are doing an endzone dance at the 45yard line said Joe Mathews a longtime critic of Californias governance system Weve been in this box for so long theres such a natural hunger to say things are doing better that things are going better Senator Kevin de Len a Democrat from Los Angeles said the chorus crediting the reforms for a turnaround came from the same government reform groups who advocated them  over not incidentally the opposition of many political leaders Some years we are the cover of Time magazine as the model state that can teach the country what to do he said The next cycle its The California Dream has popped Its too premature As Mr Mathews noted ballot initiatives continue to be a force for disruption in California governance  the most notable example being Proposition 13 which severely limited the ability of governments to raise taxes Two years ago voters rolled back the requirement that twothirds of lawmakers approve any spending increase removing a major impediment in Sacramento but there remains a twothirds requirement for raising taxes J Stephen Peace a former Democratic legislator who is head of the Independent Voter Project which pressed for the toptwo voting system said the very fact of Democratic dominance was actually evidence of how the reforms were changing the way business is done Only with a toptwo majority would you have an overwhelming Democratic Legislature which is also the most moderate Legislature in 30 years he said Look at the Chamber of Commerce job kills list  every measure on it was defeated except the increase in the minimum wage The sunny assessment of the changes has widespread support voiced by people inside and outside the government They have already started to create a more functional Legislature said Kathay Feng the California executive director of Common Cause In light of the shutdown on the federal level what happened in California has provided even more of a contrast There is reason to think that changes in legislative behavior might get more pronounced with turnover and as incumbent legislators who have not faced competitive elections before begin confronting a more competitive electoral landscape We can already see that these reforms are improving the function of the Legislature and forcing people to come out of their partisan boxes and talk to the broader electorate said Sam Blakeslee head of the California Reform Institute and a former Republican member of the Assembly Were seeing almost against the odds a more centrist Legislature at least when it comes to jobs and budget issues
A Ted Cruz on Every Corner,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/19/opinion/collins-a-ted-cruz-on-every-corner.html,Have you noticed how many lawmakers from Texas were doing crazy things during the government shutdown debacle We need to discuss this as a matter of simple justice These days when you say Texas in the context of heavybreathing Republican extremism everybody immediately thinks of Senator Ted Cruz Which is really unfair when there are so many other members of the state delegation trying to do their part  I am thinking for instance of Representative Randy Neugebauer who harangued an innocent park ranger about a shutdownshuttered war memorial insisting that the ranger and her colleagues should be ashamed of themselves  Or Representative Louie Gohmert who created a mild diversion when he charged that John McCain an opponent of the shutdown supported Al Qaeda in Syria McCain said that he did not take offense because if someone has no intelligence I dont view it as being a malicious statement Or Representative Steve Stockman who accused the president and House Democrats of curbstomping veterans  Or Representative John Culberson who cried Lets roll in an apparent belief that shutting down the government was equivalent to resisting 911 terrorists Or Representative Pete Sessions who summed things up rather neatly with Were not French We dont surrender  See Share the credit  The nation keeps searching for signs of a resurgent political center but there arent many hopeful peeps coming out of Texas The pragmatic Texas Republican establishment is pretty much on its back hyperventilating  The old centerright standardbearer Lt Gov David Dewhurst is desperately trying to wipe out his reputation as a mainstream politician while he runs for reelection  I dont know about you but Barack Obama ought to be impeached he told a Tea Party gathering recently with more fervor for the cause than for grammatical construction Texas Democrats who havent won a statewide race in a generation spent the last decade whimpering and waiting around for all the Hispanic children to grow up and start voting However this year they have an exciting candidate for governor Wendy Davis the state senator who starred in that famous 11hour filibuster against antiabortion legislation this past summer  Some people think Davis who is canny energetic and attractive might actually have a chance to win But anybody who could just raise money and get 45 percent of the vote would be the partys biggest star since Ann Richards Daviss opponent will probably be the states attorney general Greg Abbott who has already amassed enough cash to buy Nebraska Abbott once provided supporters with his vision of the attorney generals duties I go into the office I sue the federal government and then I go home So theres that  Even the bottom of the ticket is going to have little sparks of strange Next year the race for Texas land commissioner will feature a newgeneration Bush Jebs son George P The singer Kinky Friedman says hes running for the Democratic nomination for agriculture commissioner on a legalizemarijuana platform The rest of us will just sit here and mull the fact that Texans feel the need to make these jobs elective Meanwhile back at the ranch Gov Rick Perry appears to be planning to run for president again And since Ted Cruz is pretty clearly planning a run too there could be two Texans in the Republican primary debates Maybe an allTexas ticket  While Cruz has been trying to win the hearts of American voters by spreading fear terror and economic chaos Perry has been wandering around the country criticizing other states for their high taxes and bragging about job growth in Texas  Economic development has indeed been impressive thanks mainly to the states plentiful land and cheap housing On the downside a large part of Texas seems to be running out of water Once the presidential debates kick off perhaps Perrys opponents could lift their water glasses and make sloshing sounds every time he talks about growth Ross Ramsey a columnist for The Texas Tribune suggested the governors critics might carry bags of gravel to remind the world that Texas undermaintained roads have deteriorated to such an extent that the highway department has let some of them revert from pavement to pebbles This week Perrys in Israel burnishing his foreign affairs credentials and promoting the Texas economy Do not expect a critique of the Israeli tax code In Texas theres so much craziness its hard for a normal crazy to get attention Imagine an election year with both Perry and Cruz on television every night To get any airtime the Texas guys in the House of Representatives would have to call for impeachment while bungee jumping While waving Secede signs While carrying unconcealed weapons  Remember the Alamo 
A Touch of Glamour Through Timepieces,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/23/fashion/a-touch-of-glamour-through-timepieces.html,LONDON  Hollywood stars like celestial ones can be seen shining brightly long after burning out James Dean and Ava Gardner have come back into focus recently he in a highprofile auction and a planned film she in a bestselling autobiography  The objects owned by Hollywood stars also often shine in their reflected light Watches associated with Dean and Gardner are a case in point symbols of a certain movie glamour A gold Elgin pocket watch that Dean wore in East of Eden and referred to as his lucky watch sold for nearly 42000 at auction this summer in Hong Kong about triple the estimate  The Ava Gardner Museum in Smithfield North Carolina owns a watch that Gardner gave Frank Sinatra her third husband many years after the end of their tumultuous relationship That and her many other affairs are revisited in detail in a new book Ava Gardner The Secret Conversations published this summer and based on conversations Gardner had late in life with the British journalist Peter Evans who died last year  James Deans life was so short so there arent that many items that are left from his lifetime said Evan Zimmermann president and chief executive of Antiquorum the Swiss specialist vintage watch auction house that sold the Dean watch He also wore this watch in an unusual way clipped to his belt in East of Eden and offscreen  Watches really represent a persons taste and their story and they often are the only piece of jewelry that men carry Mr Zimmermann added For a fan or collector to own a watch that a famous person has handled and used to tell time on a daily basis is of particular interest  The pocket watch which was purchased by an anonymous Asian collector had a sentimental connection for Dean He bought it in New York in 1951 for good luck as a struggling stage actor and he often said it helped him get his big break in Hollywood The chain was a gift from his father with whom he had a difficult relationship and was intended to keep him from losing the watch  and the luck Elia Kazan who directed East of Eden reluctantly allowed Dean to wear the watch and chain in the film After filming Dean gave the watch to Tillie Starriet an employee on the set whom he called Mom Deans mother had died of cancer when he was 9 years old It was Starriet who apparently in a moment of whimsy created the upswept hairdo that became Deans signature  In the letter of authentication that accompanies the watch Ms Starriet who has died writes that she cherished the watch and a letter from Dean that began with To Mom  The nonfunctioning watch has been set to 543 pm the time of Deans death Dean was wearing another watch a LeCoultre Powermatic Nautilus when he crashed his Porsche 550 Spyder in 1955 on a rural highway in central California at the age of 24 Dean who starred in only three films in his brief career will be played by the actor Dane DeHaan in a film called Life with Robert Pattinson as the Life magazine photographer Dennis Stock who befriended Dean on a trip across the United States  The watch at the Ava Gardner Museum in the tobacco country of North Carolina where she grew up in poverty is not ornate Gardner who died in 1990 at the age of 67 had a reputation of being stingy and was more accustomed to receiving jewelry than to giving it Still the watch embodies a moment in one of the great offscreen romances of the 20th century which was so scandalous in the early 1950s that it cost Sinatra his contract at MGM and sent Gardner into selfimposed exile in Spain where she socialized with matadors and became headline fodder for gossip magazines Though the watch is mentioned in the book Gardner cherished her jewels and watches and gave many such gifts to her male companions I either write the book or sell the jewels she told Evans in 1988 explaining that she wanted to write a book because she needed the money and Im kind of sentimental about the jewels  She approached Evans in the late 1980s hoping to make some money from her life story because she was nearly broke while living in Ennismore Gardens neighborhood of London Mr Evans died in 2012 and never released the recorded conversations with Gardner Nearly 25 years later the estates of Evans and Gardner agreed that the recordings should be made public Gardners glamorous but not always happy life is what draws about 8000 to 10000 visitors a year to the museum which features many of her letters and memorabilia as well as movie costumes and posters The watch she gave to Sinatra in addition to two other watches currently or formerly on loan have been favorites among visitors I think a watch is a gift that symbolizes a particular point in time that people remember said Todd Johnson executive director of the museum When Frank and Ava were dating and married they had a getaway It was a place they would sneak away to They were madly in love but knew they couldnt live together  An engraving on the watch To Frank and desert nights Ava most likely refers to their time together at Sinatras home in Palm Desert California in the early 1950s Mr Johnson said It is most likely a gift from Gardner when she was living in London where she moved in 1968 Made by Lucien Piccard in the 1960s it has a 17jewel Swiss manualwind movement and is made of 14karat yellow gold with a silver frost dial signed by the maker This watch dates from the 1960s during the time between his marriages to Mia Farrow and Barbara Marx Mr Johnson said I once received a note from Tina Franks daughter and she referenced fond memories of accompanying her father to visit Ava in the late 60s and early 70s in London Its certainly possible that Ava gave the watch to him on one of those visits  Now on loan at the museum from an unnamed private collector is a Tiffany watch that the director John Ford gave to Gardner during the filming of Mogambo the 1953 movie that was partially shot on location in Africa The filming of Mogambo was very difficult for Ava because she was pregnant when she arrived on set and decided to have an abortion and John Ford had to work with her and must have given her tremendous support Mr Johnson said Frank Sinatra whom she was married to at the time visited her in London where she probably had the abortion and she apparently had a second pregnancy and a second abortion all during the filming of the movie  The small watch with a narrow black doubletwisted cord band in either silver or white gold with a row of diamonds at the top and bottom of the watch face is inscribed To Ava A Class Act John Ford  A watch on loan to the museum from a North Carolina publisher in 2009 was a popular favorite too Mr Johnson said and was part of that years annual Ava Gardner Festival which celebrated her friendship with Ernest Hemingway  Gardner gave Hemingway a watch for his 55th birthday after befriending him during her years living in Spain when she left Hollywood She and Hemingway were both fleeing many demons and broken marriages and drowning their sorrows in alcohol Gardner also played perhaps Hemingways most famous heroine Brett Ashley in the 1957 film adaptation of The Sun Also Rises  The Hamilton watch from around 1908 is engraved Happy Birthday Papa from Ava Madrid 2171954  Ava had recently befriended Hemingway and his wife Mary through her lover in the early 1950s the Spanish bullfighter Luis Miguel Dominguin Mr Johnson said He became a father figure to her and she called him Papa like everyone else did At Antiquorum which made headlines last year when it auctioned the Swiss Heuer watch worn by Steve McQueen in the 1971 film Le Mans for 800000 Mr Zimmermann acknowledged that watches were becoming more rare for auction houses as collectors held on to their treasures from Hollywood history We would love to acquire more items and to be able to offer them but in the past weve gone outside of timepieces for other celebrity items because the demand for watches is so high he said Once a movie or a bestselling book about their lives comes out a whole new generation becomes a fan 
Vatican Suspends German Bishop Accused of Lavish Spending on Himself,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/world/europe/vatican-suspends-german-bishop-known-for-spending.html,BERLIN  Pope Francis who has made humility and modesty his hallmarks sent a swift and clear message to Roman Catholics around the world on Wednesday suspending a German bishop accused of spending millions on lavish renovations to his residence and forcing the chief administrator of the bishops diocese into early retirement The bishop FranzPeter Tebartzvan Elst 53 of Limburg was said to have let the cost of renovating his residence and other church buildings balloon to more than 41 million The projects drew ridicule in the German news media for luxuries like a 20000 bathtub a 11 million landscaped garden and plans for an 800squarefoot fitness room  as well as a cross to be suspended from the ceiling of a personal chapel which necessitated the reopening of a renovated roof The pope acted just two days after receiving Bishop Tebartzvan Elst in Rome where the bishop had gone to explain himself The Vatican issued a statement saying that Francis had been comprehensively and objectively informed about the events in the diocese and that Bishop Tebartzvan Elst currently cannot exercise his office The statement said the Holy See thought it advisable for the bishop to spend an unspecified time away from Limburg His duties will be assumed by Msgr Wolfgang Rsch who was scheduled to become the dioceses chief administrator at the end of the year The current chief Franz Kaspar 75 a confidant of the bishop will retire immediately two and a half months early The popes decision lifted spirits among Germanys Catholics and reinforced indications that he will enforce his values throughout the church hierarchy Francis has chosen to live in a spartan guesthouse in the Vatican rather than in the opulent apartments his predecessors used and he has said that bishops should not live like princes His decision signals that the pope deems pastoral life and moral examples important not an accessory said Alberto Melloni a Vatican historian and the director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies a liberal Catholic research institute in Bologna Italy Francis is signaling that living the right kind of humble life is more important than managing the Curia in a more efficient way Mr Melloni said referring to the Vatican bureaucracy It pertains to the reform of the church not just of the Curia he said A manager could have reformed or reengineered the Curia but the conclave chose a man who distinguishes himself for his human values Commentators noted that Franciss immediate predecessor the Germanborn Benedict XVI removed several bishops some of whom were involved in financial scandals But Pope John Paul II who preceded Benedict took no public action when Bishop William Murphy of Rockville Centre NY drew criticism for a luxurious residential suite he had built in 2002 displacing six nuns The Limburg scandal first reached the Vatican in August and a cardinal Giovanni Lajolo was sent to look into it The German Bishops Conference appointed a commission to investigate amid conflicting reports on the chain of responsibility for approving expenses for the project and disagreement about how much blame rested with the bishop The spending prompted outrage among the 682000 Roman Catholics in the diocese which includes much of rural Rhineland as well as Frankfurt Germanys financial center It has also led to renewed questions about church wealth in Germany the home of the Reformation and a country where established religions are supported by taxes collected by the government Carlo Marroni a Vatican expert at the Italian newspaper Il Sole 24 Ore said in a telephone interview that the pope was intervening personally and swiftly on issues that worry his faithful Francis has made simplicity an emblem of his papacy He chose the name of the medieval saint known in Italy as the poverello poor man and he has said that along with St Augustine St Francis is closest to his soul In a recent trip to Assisi where St Francis lived he called for sobriety and urged the church to strip itself of the sense of comfort The Catholic Church in Germany as in many other countries has grappled for years with declining membership and allegations of sexual abuse by priests as well as many Catholics rejection of its more conservative stances on abortion remarriage after divorce and the role of women German church experts said Bishop Tebartzvan Elst was unlikely to return to his post even though the Vatican presented his suspension as temporary Had he directly forced the bishop to step down or removed him from office that would have been swiftly condemned Thomas Schller a theologian at the University of Mnster told the German news agency DPA If the bishop did return trust might be hard to regain He never had a good connection with people a local journalist Joachim Heidersdorf of Nassauische Neue Presse said in an email His predecessor regularly walked around Limburg Tebartzvan Elst had himself driven even for short distances In his sermons too he just reached the heads but never the hearts of the people Bishop Tebartzvan Elst became Germanys youngest bishop when he was installed by Benedict in January 2008 He was ordained in 1985 and studied in France and at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana His leadership style created dissent in his diocese and several thousand congregants had already signed a petition asking for his removal before the spending scandal broke The bishop has said in his defense that the reported spending covered 10 projects some of them involving buildings governed by landmark preservation laws that drove up costs and that his private quarters were a relatively small part of the work
Case Explores Rights of Fetus Versus Mother,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/24/us/case-explores-rights-of-fetus-versus-mother.html,JACKSON Wis  Alicia Beltran cried with fear and disbelief when county sheriffs surrounded her home on July 18 and took her in handcuffs to a holding cell She was 14 weeks pregnant and thought she had done the right thing when at a prenatal checkup she described a pill addiction the previous year and said she had ended it on her own  something later verified by a urine test But now an apparently skeptical doctor and a social worker accused her of endangering her unborn child because she had refused to accept their order to start on an antiaddiction drug Ms Beltran 28 was taken in shackles before a family court commissioner who she says brushed aside her pleas for a lawyer To her astonishment the court had already appointed a legal guardian for the fetus I didnt know unborn children had lawyers recalled Ms Beltran now six months pregnant after returning to her home north of Milwaukee from a courtordered 78day stay at a drug treatment center I said Wheres my lawyer  Under a Wisconsin law known as the cocaine mom act when it was adopted in 1998 childwelfare authorities can forcibly confine a pregnant woman who uses illegal drugs or alcohol to a severe degree and who refuses to accept treatment Now with Ms Beltrans detention as Exhibit A that law is being challenged as unconstitutional in a federal suit filed this month the first in federal court to challenge this kind of fetal protection law Its opponents are hoping to set an important precedent in the continuing tug of war over the rights of pregnant women and legal status of the unborn Wisconsin is one of four states along with Minnesota Oklahoma and South Dakota with laws specifically granting authorities the power to confine pregnant women for substance abuse But many other states use civilconfinement childprotection or assorted criminal laws to force women into treatment programs or punish them for taking drugs This is what happens when laws give officials the authority to treat fertilized eggs embryos and fetuses as if they are already completely separate from the pregnant woman said Lynn M Paltrow executive director of National Advocates for Pregnant Women in New York of Ms Beltrans arrest and confinement The Wisconsin law according to the suit filed in United States District Court in Milwaukee deprives women of physical liberty medical privacy due process and other constitutional rights It is also based on faulty information about the risks to newborns and ultimately does more harm than good the suit argues by scaring pregnant women away from prenatal care Bonnie Ladwig a retired state representative who helped write the law called it an appropriate effort to prevent harm Its the same as abuse of a child after its born she said If the mother isnt smart enough not to do drugs weve got to step in The law is intended to help both the woman and her baby said Susan Armacost the legislative director of Wisconsin Right to Life whose group lobbied hard for the measure Similar policies have won strong support from antiabortion groups around the country in part because they advance the goal of granting independent personhood and rights to the unborn child The suit is being argued by National Advocates for Pregnant Women along with the Reproductive Justice Clinic of the New York University School of Law and Linda S Vanden Heuvel a Wisconsin lawyer who was eventually hired by Ms Beltrans mother Wisconsin officials have not yet responded in court and declined to comment Ms Paltrows group has documented hundreds of cases nationally over the last decade in which women were detained arrested or forced to accept medical procedures in the name of fetal protection with lowincome and minority women affected disproportionately In the most extreme example Alabama has applied a 2006 chemical endangerment of a child law originally passed to protect children from methamphetamine laboratories to prosecute about 100 women whose newborns tested positive for drugs sending several new mothers to prison Courts in more than 20 states have blocked the use of criminal childabuse or related laws against pregnant women But in January the Alabama Supreme Court upheld use of the endangerment law from the moment of conception In Wisconsin because childwelfare proceedings are confidential no one knows how often the 1998 law has been used but anecdotal evidence suggests it may happen a few times each year at least Many medical experts say that these laws are based on exaggerated perceptions of the risks to newborns and are medically counterproductive In 2011 the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists said that incarceration and threat of incarceration have proved to be ineffective in reducing the incidence of alcohol or drug abuse and that mandated testing and reporting lead women to avoid prenatal care that greatly reduces the negative effects of substance abuse during pregnancy Dr Cresta W Jones an obstetrician and a fetal medicine specialist at the Medical College of Wisconsin who sees many women with histories of drug or alcohol abuse said that even sporadic detentions had sowed fear The women are scared to come in if they have dependency problems she said When you allow them to be honest you get better outcomes in their pregnancies She and other experts said that while fetal alcohol syndrome is a proven but unpredictable threat the impact of illegal drug use on newborns is generally less serious and more treatable than is popularly believed Ms Beltran thought she was being helpful when in her first prenatal visit on July 2 to a clinic at St Josephs Hospital she discussed her medical history Ms Beltran who worked as a bartender and waitress and became pregnant by a boyfriend who remains close told the physician assistant that she had become addicted last year to Percocet a painkiller But she had willed herself off it the previous fall even going to the hospital in November for withdrawal symptoms She said she was unable to afford a prescription for Suboxone which blocks other opiates and is widely used in treatment including during pregnancy So she obtained some from a friend and on her own reduced the dosage over time stopping altogether three days before her appointment at St Josephs She said that in May before she knew she was pregnant she had taken one Vicodin tablet for a toothache The physician assistant apparently skeptical said she should get a prescription for Suboxone because withdrawal could be hard on the fetus Ms Beltran recalled But I told her Id already tapered off and quit she said A urine test that day found traces of Suboxone but no signs of other opiates and later tests found her clear of both drugs Two weeks after that prenatal visit the social worker showed up unannounced at Ms Beltrans home telling her to restart Suboxone treatment or face a court order to do so I told her Im off this stuff and I dont want to go back on it she recalled admitting that she lost her temper and shut the door on the social worker after saying Maybe I should just get an abortion Two days later the sheriffs arrived to take her to the county jail and the initial hearing The case against Ms Beltran was bolstered by the statement of Dr Angela Breckenridge an obstetrician at the West Bend Clinic South at St Josephs Hospital In a letter dated July 16 Dr Breckenridge said that Ms Beltran had openly admitted taking opiates during pregnancy and was still using Suboxone She exhibits lack of selfcontrol and refuses the treatment we have offered her wrote Dr Breckenridge who according to Ms Beltran had not personally met or examined her She recommended a mandatory inpatient drug treatment program or incarceration adding The childs life depends on action in this case Dr Breckenridge did not respond to requests for comment A hospital spokeswoman said We are confident that our medical staff acted in good faith On threat of jail Ms Beltran remained at Casa Clare a treatment center two hours north in Appleton Wis until Oct 4 when the center sent her home She lost her job and now hopes to find temporary work over the holidays Her due date is Jan 15 and she already has a handmedown crib in her bedroom Im scared they can just come back after my babys born she said This is supposed to be the happiest part of my pregnancy and Im just terrified
"Would-Be Virginia Governors Spar, Continuing Bitter Tone",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/25/us/would-be-virginia-governors-meet-in-debate-and-continue-bitter-tone.html,BLACKSBURG Va  Trailing in polls and outspent on the airwaves Kenneth T Cuccinelli II who has sought to capture the swing state of Virginia by building on his Tea Party base faced his last best chance to reboot the race for governor in a debate here Thursday Mr Cuccinelli Virginias attorney general criticized the platitudes not plans of his Democratic opponent Terry McAuliffe who has consolidated a lead since the 16day federal government shutdown which hit hard in Virginia with its many government employees and contractors Mr Cuccinelli has sought to blister Democrats for the troubled rollout of the Affordable Care Act this month emphasizing its impact on Virginians The Obamacare disaster is unfolding he said early in the debate adding that Mr McAuliffe favors expanding Medicaid under the health care law Why would we expand failure The debate took place on the campus of Virginia Tech the site of a 2007 shooting by a mentally disturbed student who killed 32 people It was no surprise that gun violence was an emotional centerpiece as the two candidates faced off in the student union Outside on the steps about three dozen young protesters held signs reading Hokies for Responsible Gun Laws A smaller group of adults faced them with Guns Save Lives signs Mr Cuccinelli noted that his opponent had earned an F from the National Rifle Association None of the gun restrictions Mr McAuliffe supported Mr Cuccinelli said would have prevented the Virginia Tech tragedy He called himself the leading expert on mental health in the General Assembly and cited a record of increasing financing for treatment programs Mr McAuliffe said he had visited a campus memorial to the victims This is a real difference in the race he said describing his support for universal background checks for gun buyers which Mr Cuccinelli opposes I dont care what grade I got from the NRA he added Im standing on the stage at Virginia Tech where we experienced one of the most horrific events with a gun in American history Its time we stood up Since the races beginning Mr Cuccinelli has been hurt by a Virginia version of the civil war in the Republican Party that burst into the open over the federal shutdown with party elders blaming the Tea Party wing for a loss of support nationally Prominent Republicans have crossed party lines to endorse Mr McAuliffe including Boyd Marcus once an adviser to Representative Eric Cantor of Virginia the House majority leader Outsiders who pumped millions of dollars into the race have sought to paint Mr Cuccinelli as extreme on issues like abortion the environment and gun rights The latest is Mayor Michael R Bloomberg of New York whose super PAC began an advertising campaign this week attacking Mr Cuccinelli over gun rights Outside groups supporting Mr Cuccinelli including the NRA and antiabortion groups have tried to go tit for tat But Mr Cuccinelli has fallen far behind his rival a former leading Democratic fundraiser on the financial front Mr McAuliffe has raised 263 million while Mr Cuccinelli has raised 168 million according to the Virginia Public Access Project The totals reflect how the race one of only two contests for governor this year has drawn intense national attention being viewed as a possible bellwether of the midterm elections across the country next year The other race is in New Jersey where Gov Chris Christie is expected to win reelection easily Both candidates have run scorchedearth advertising campaigns with no shortage of material to draw on The Democrat has attacked his rival for ties to a gift scandal involving Gov Bob McDonnell also a Republican Mr Cuccinelli has criticized Mr McAuliffe a leading Democratic fundraiser who has never held elected office for selling sleepovers in the Lincoln Bedroom under President Bill Clinton and for his connection to troubled business deals including an electric car company that is under federal investigation Most of the charges were repeated in the debate Mr McAuliffe said his opponent would make Virginia hostile to business because of his conservative positions on gay marriage and climate science Mr Cuccinelli accused his rival of proposing programs that would cost taxpayers more every year My opponent is always attacking the federal government but he was quiet on one issue Mr McAuliffe replied citing Mr Cuccinellis opposition to the federal Violence Against Women Act He is one of only three state attorneys general not to sign a letter of support for the measure Mr Cuccinelli said Mr McAuliffe spun out many policy goals but had no way to pay A McAuliffe plan to add 500 million by expanding Medicaid was magic money he said I like education Mr Cuccinelli said mocking the other mans talking point I like puppies But I dont bring a puppy home if I dont have a plan for how Im going to deal with that puppy Hes all puppy and no plan It may have been the best zinger of the night But in fact the negative tone and especially the deluge of television attack ads have driven up Mr Cuccinellis unfavorable ratings more than Mr McAuliffes and seem the chief reason for the Democrats advantage Cuccinelli supporters are voting for him but McAuliffe voters are voting against the other guy said Harry Wilson director of the Institute for Policy and Opinion Research at Roanoke College The one hope Cuccinelli has is that McAuliffe support is really soft and people dont bother to show up In the home stretch Mr Cuccinelli has abandoned reaching out to independent voters to fire up his base He has campaigned with the hardright radio host Mark Levin and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas Senator Rand Paul of Kentucky is to appear in the days before the election Nov 5 Mr McAuliffe has drawn support from his old friend Mr Clinton who will stump with him next week Polls suggest Mr Cuccinelli is facing an enthusiasm gap A Quinnipiac poll this week of likely voters showed 92 percent of Democrats in favor of Mr McAuliffe but only 81 percent of Republicans rallying for Mr Cuccinelli If Cuccinelli cant bring more Republicans home he is likely to be toast said Peter A Brown assistant director of the Quinnipiac University Polling institute
Museums Draw on Events That Shaped the World,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/arts/artsspecial/museums-draw-on-events-that-shaped-the-world.html,MOST curators strive for novelty when they are putting together an exhibition Museums nearly always want to boast that a show is the first the largest the longest or the fillintheblankest For the NewYork Historical Societys latest attraction The Armory Show at 100 however a measure of success is how closely its curators can recreate the experience of this seminal 1913 exhibition The challenge is not in gathering as many of the roughly 1350 works that hung at the 69th Regiment Armory on Lexington Avenue and 26th Street a century ago but rather to get contemporary visitors to understand just how much it jolted New Yorks cultural sensibilities The shock of the new as the critic Robert Hughes titled his 1980 documentary on modern art is almost impossible to come by in this tabooshattering world  So it is essential to remember that the original show which introduced European modernists like Van Gogh Gauguin Duchamp Czanne Matisse and Edvard Munch to Americans did not just present new art It required a new way of seeing Imagine Mozart hearing Metallica  In a room that serves as an epilogue to the societys exhibition curators have tried to underscore the contrast between the familiar and the revolutionary by juxtaposing refined Gilded Age portraits that represented the epitome of taste at the time with the riotous colors and geometric patterns that many Americans encountered for the first time on 26th Street  For further context the Historical Society presents information and images  silent film excerpts a snippet from a performance of Stravinskys Rite of Spring which caused disturbances at its opening night in Paris in 1913 as well as newspaper clips about the growing radicalism of workers and women seeking suffrage and access to birth control and abortions  To some vocal critics at the time the seeming anarchy on the canvas was a counterpart to a feared anarchy on the streets The primitive lines in Matisses Blue Nude Souvenir of Biskra and the bloodred paint in The Red Studio yielded particular outrage Art students in Chicago where the show later traveled went so far as to burn copies of his works in effigy Thanks to a newspaper photograph the societys curators were able to replicate the original installation of these two works and two other Matisse paintings The cubists section was called the Chamber of Horrors but the most common response was probably puzzlement and amusement Duchamps Nude Descending a Staircase No 2  which became a symbol of the show  elicited outlandish metaphors and parodies One newspaper ran a cartoon Rude Descending a Staircase as a way of depicting rush hour in the subway  Among the more than 100 works assembled for this retrospective which runs through Feb 23 are other wellknown gems from masters like Brancusi and Picasso as well as less familiar modernist experiments from American artists like Robert Henri Marsden Hartley Maurice Prendergast and John Sloan that shared the cavernous Armory hall back in 1913  The Historical Society tries to correct some misconceptions that have grown up around this legendary exhibition including the notion that there were no homegrown modernists For the Americans modernism was less about form and color than about subject matter These members of the Ashcan School sought to portray urban realities with social and political undertones Henris large realist portrait of a nude woman unashamedly staring out from the canvas for example would have been as scandalous to some eyes as Matisses Blue Nude Across the park from the Historical Society at the Guggenheim Museum where Robert Motherwells pathbreaking early collages are on display through Jan 5 visitors need a different sort of key to help them recreate the experience Fortunately it can be seen at the shows start  an untitled collage owned by the French art dealer Jeanne Bucher Placed in a portfolio for more than 60 years this collage is a rare exception to the fading that has occurred to Motherwells others on lightsensitive paper The startling magenta for instance that was used to create central shapes in the artists compositions has blanched into an etiolated flesh color in works that include Mallarmes Swan and The Displaced Table In some collages cut purple forms are all but indiscernible  The originality and composition of the nearly 60 collages exhibited all created during 1941 and 1951  a seminal decade in Motherwells artistic development  still impress One can follow as Motherwell cut tore and pasted a path from Surrealism to Abstract Expressionism The show makes clear the debt that the artist owed to his patron and collector Peggy Guggenheim the first to suggest he experiment with collage His initial attempt done with Jackson Pollock is on display Pollock quickly abandoned the medium But the experience permanently changed Motherwell who devoted much of his career to cutandpaste creations Through collage he said he found my identity Over time he incorporated ink gouache paint slogans fabric and military training maps  a sign of his everpresent political consciousness He later described the technique as the greatest of our discoveries Unlike the skepticism that greeted many of the Armorys exhibitors critics and collectors shared Motherwells delight  The Museum of Modern Art bought a bold 1943 work Pancho Villa Dead and Alive even before it was formally unveiled at Ms Guggenheims avantgarde gallery Art of This Century In 1944 the influential critic Clement Greenberg wrote that the 29yearold Motherwell has already done enough to make it no exaggeration to say that the future of American painting depends on what he and only a comparatively few others do from now on Certainly Motherwell was aware of the fading in his collages and according to the curators he accepted change as inevitable Our appreciation is no less the catalog assures readers Still as the Guggenheims paper conservator Jeffrey Warda explains Motherwell purposely used commercially coated papers in a search for more vivid colors That vibrancy is one reason that his ink drawings from the period  where the brilliant hues have soaked into the page  are so compelling Fading inevitably shifts the relationship among a collages component parts One of the catalogs most fascinating features sadly not part of the exhibition itself is a series of digital recreations of what the originals looked like For visitors to the International Center of Photography in Midtown Manhattan the question of what exactly someone saw decades ago is answered by the photographs on the wall JFK November 22 1963 a Bystanders View of History which runs through Jan 19 presents the snaps that ordinary people along the presidents fatal motorcade route took on that November morning in Dallas 50 years ago  The center has the iconic images the original stills from the 268 seconds of film shot by Abraham Zapruder Mary Moormans Polaroid of John F Kennedy being hit by a bullet and the backyard photograph that appeared on the cover of Life magazine showing Lee Harvey Oswald cockily displaying a rifle  The very lack of professionalism in many of these blackandwhite and washedout color photos is what gives viewers a visceral sense of what it was like standing in the crowd that day  The fact that these pictures are already so well known underscores one of the shows themes that these personal photos now constitute the nations collective memory The assembled prints serve as both an official record and historical artifacts  Thus the exhibition is not so much about the history of the Kennedy assassination but rather the history of photography Brian Wallis the centers chief curator sees it as the opening chapter of the citizen journalist now a commonplace figure in an age of handheld digital devices While youre at the Photography Center make sure to stop by the pair of exhibitions on Lewis W Hine whose extraordinary photos have come to embody New York in the early 20th century Hine was originally drawn to photography as a way of promoting social and political change only engaging the medium as an artist in his later years But his sense of composition and extraordinary eye are evident in all his photos Consider the symmetry of Mechanic at Steam Pump in Electric Power House 1920 which captures Americas growing industrial might the slashing lines of Icarus Atop Empire State Building 1931 where a worker confidently hangs onto a cable or the seemingly infinite perspective of Street Scene New York City 1910  Those seeking a refuge from such historical tumult can journey to the Arthur M Sackler Gallery one of the Smithsonian Institutions museums of Asian art in Washington Yoga The Art of Transformation on display through Jan 26 features monumental stone yogini goddesses from a 10th century Indian temple devotional icons several folios from an illustrated manuscript of yoga positions or asanas created for a Mughal emperor in 1602 as well as Hindoo Fakir a film about India that Thomas Edison made in 1906 The exhibition also includes material on how the British and other Westerners denigrated the practice and philosophy during the colonial period  an effort that ultimately failed given yogas extraordinary global popularity After its sojourn in the nations capital the exhibition will travel to the San Francisco Asian Art Museum Feb 21 to May 25 and the Cleveland Museum of Art June 22 to Sep 7  The Sackler will hold a number of celebrations and events that include music storytelling games and an expert symposium And even infrequent museumgoers might find themselves lured inside by the chance to take a 90minute yoga class in the gallery itself

Single Mothers With Family Values,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/27/opinion/sunday/single-mothers-with-family-values.html,WHEN Jennifer Maggio was in her early 20s she was raising two children by herself on the 750 per month that she earned as a manager at a furniture store in Vidalia La She went to college at night and was living in subsidized housing when she felt God urge her to make an unexpected choice I started tithing To tithe while I was living on food stamps  that was a tough decision she said The conversation I had with God was Youve got to be kidding me This is about the pastor wanting a new truckÂ   She dropped a 75 check in the offering bucket I kept doing it and the bills continued to get paid Within a year she got a job offer from a bank in Baton Rouge and went from food stamps to a sixfigure income she said Ms Maggio credits God not government assistance with helping her climb out of poverty She later married and founded Life of a Single Mom Ministries to help other women She hates talking politics but says she has always been an extremely conservative Republican  Politically speaking Ms Maggio is unusual in 2008 and 2012 threequarters of single mothers voted for President Obama Its tempting to dismiss a Republican single mom as a dupe persuaded to vote against her own interests a victim of what Thomas Frank called the politics of selfdelusion  This assessment is misguided One polling firm called single mothers the largest progressive voting bloc in the country but Democrats should not take single moms for granted even as Republicans have shown that they would rather sabotage the basic functions of government than extend the social safety net  The single mothers who reject the politics of their peers tell us something about the limits of the liberal effort to redefine cultural ideals The left has recast marriage not as a lifelong contract but as a civil right a choice one of many paths to empowerment An oldfashioned covenant that binds two people in mutual submission sits uneasily in a secular ideology that holds personal autonomy as the highest good  But that covenant still means something to many Americans  including single moms who have every reason to be cynical about traditional marriage Some have been persuaded by evangelicals that they have a stake in defending conservative ideas about gender and family Others have found their own way to a rejection of the lefts vision of social welfare Feminism fails to resonate with many of the women who seem most likely to embrace it  Since the rise of homes for fallen women and unwed mothers in the early 19th century American Christians have worried about their plight with a mixture of compassion and contempt If some of these women  widows and deserted wives  were the epitome of the deserving poor others were a pox on their community a sign that Gods law had been broken by divorce or extramarital sex Maternity homes for unwed mothers concealed residents names to protect the honor of their families The Christians who ran these charities believed that seclusion from the sinful world combined with tutelage in child care and Gods word could rescue these women and return them to respectable society  Today conservative Christians see that Godfearing communities are not immune to unplanned pregnancy or divorce The president of Focus on the Family Jim Daly candidly tells journalists that his alcoholic father was absent for most of his youth The antiabortion ethic has motivated outreach to single mothers and a new movement is beginning that is distinct from the familiar network of adoption organizations and crisis pregnancy centers Evangelicals are assuring single moms that God has a plan for them and it still includes marriage  just not in the way they expected Rita Viselli found herself pregnant at age 35 with the child of a man she was casually dating She was a recovering drug addict the troubled daughter of a single mother herself and a recent convert to evangelical Christianity In 2000 she began a Bible study for single mothers in her living room in Southern California She taught them what she had realized I have a husband His name is Jesus Christ I have decided that he will be my daughters father and she has grown up being told that God is her father He is real in our house she told me He has provided for me and my child better than 10 husbands could have  This connubial language pervades the small but growing world of evangelical single mothers ministries It has deep roots in Christian spirituality In mystical marriage to Jesus medieval nuns and laywomen found one of the few paths to spiritual authority open to them an escape from repressive reality When Margery Kempe an English mystic born around 1373 heard Jesus say I take you Margery for my wedded wife she felt the fire of love burning in her breast Evangelicals are creating a theology of single motherhood that allows the church to embrace single moms without relinquishing heterosexual marriage as the sacred cause of the culture wars Pastors are beginning to acknowledge single mothers in their Fathers Day sermons and offer practical help like free car tuneups Pam Kanaly one of the founders of Arise Ministries in Edmond Okla said many pastors worried that outreach to struggling single moms would drain their coffers What they fail to understand is that it doesnt take much to help a single mom and when a single mother is whole and healed she is the strongest member in the church She is the best worker a leader an icon in the church The new evangelical single mom is no Hester Prynne but a Christian heroine who surpasses married women in her suffering and service A similar shift is happening among AfricanAmerican Protestants as they grapple with the fact that more than twothirds of black children are born to single mothers Black pastors  aware of the persistence of damaging claims about black sexual promiscuity  have traditionally emphasized marriage and condemned sex outside wedlock A lot of single mothers dont attend church because they dont feel welcome said LaVeda Jones who founded Praying Single Mothers in Grayslake Ill north of Chicago But churches are getting better now Ms Jones opposes abortion and shares many of white evangelicals values but there are limits to the rights appeal to single moms like most black Americans she votes Democrat  Single mothers who tilt Republican do not toe the party line perfectly They often object to the relentless attack on public welfare Most of the women I spoke to had received public assistance at some point in their lives But they worried about the spiritual costs of longterm reliance on the state Single mothers main challenge is not income inequality but their relationship with the Lord Ms Maggio said  Not too many single mothers identify as libertarian but those who do are passionate about it Sharon Secor is a minarchist libertarian an anarchist who acknowledges that there is a small role for government she told me Her views owe much to a history of nasty encounters with the state from adolescent trauma in the foster care system to more recent runins with Child Protective Services A college dropout who has read deeply in history and psychology she fled upstate New York for South Texas with her three daughters There she could homeschool without state interference She earns a living as a freelance copywriter and is writing a survivalist cookbook I despise the Democratic Party she said The Republicans just take your money and let you go about your business while the Democrats want to take your money and get into your business and run your life By no measure is Ms Secor a typical single mom if there is such a thing She wears dreadlocks past her waist has nose rings and tattoos on her ankles and back and converted to Hinduism because its doctrines helped her cope with the death of her infant son She has a radical view of personal responsibility that compels her to reject child support and accept blame for domestic violence she endured No dude can do anything to you if you dont allow him to  Yet she shares at least one conviction with other mothers I encountered All reject the rhetoric of modern feminism which they hear as shrill selfpity mingled with a false portrayal of feminine ambition When I mentioned Sheryl Sandbergs recent advice to young women to consider the selection of a spouse their most important career decision they cringed The left runs its mouth about choice but doesnt respect a womans choice to stay home Ms Secor said  A persons politics form the rickety bridge between aspirations and real life For these single mothers feminism insults both they see it as a cult of selflove that denies womens basic yearning not to be free but to be secure It is not Gods design for a woman to raise children on her own said Jennifer TurpinMiller a single mother involved in Rita Visellis ministry Feminism says were so independent we dont need anybody  and I dont want to be associated with that because I cant do it on my own  No woman has articulated this viewpoint more forcefully than Maggie Gallagher the past president of the National Organization for Marriage and once a single mom herself Ms Gallagher grants that single motherhood doesnt prompt a conservative awakening in most women  a teenage encounter with Atlas Shrugged did it for her  but she suggests that all single moms long for a husband and provider Most single mothers vote Democrat because they are women who are raising children alone and need help Obama in particular and Michelle too offers her husband as a kind of psychological father and husband figure  Surveys reveal a growing marriage gap between affluent and poorer Americans and Ms Gallagher points to this as evidence that liberal elites see the importance of the binding marital contract even if they are not willing to preach what they practice When the marriage rate differs between classes ideals may not Though the scholars Kathryn Edin and Maria Kefalas interviewed poor unwed mothers in Philadelphia they found that these women saw delaying marriage sometimes indefinitely as proof of their high regard for the commitment contained in those vows Ideals persist long after the reality of a culture changes They provide a language for critiquing modern life They reflect the human desire to bind ourselves to institutions and make hard promises Conservative single mothers understand the family as a set of binding relationships crucial to human identity Their commitment to traditional family values is all the stronger because they are raising children alone 
"De Blasio in Position to Win Mayorâ€™s Race by Historic Margin, Poll Shows",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/28/nyregion/de-blasio-in-position-to-win-mayors-race-by-historic-margin-poll-shows.html,Bill de Blasio is poised to win the race for mayor of New York City by a historically large margin powered by optimism that he will bring about change and by overwhelming voter disapproval of the Republican Party Mr de Blasio a Democrat who is currently the public advocate leads his Republican opponent Joseph J Lhota a former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority by 45 points among likely voters according to a New York TimesSiena College poll That lead which has remained remarkably consistent in multiple polls over the last six weeks suggests that Mr de Blasio could win the most sweeping victory in a mayors race since 1985 when Edward I Koch was reelected to a third term with a crushing 68point margin of victory over his opponents Mr de Blasios overwhelming lead in poll after poll has sent students of local politics scrambling for the history books Although Mr de Blasio is unlikely to surpass Mr Kochs reelection margin he is flirting with a record win for a nonincumbent that record is currently held by Abraham D Beame who won election in 1973 with a 40point victory margin the largest in an open race since fiveborough elections began in 1897 There is one more televised debate this week and still a little more than a week until the Nov 5 election but voters seem to believe the race is over a whopping 87 percent of likely voters say they expect Mr de Blasio to win Fewer than 1 in 10 likely voters are still uncertain about their vote choice according to the poll A victory by Mr de Blasio would usher in a significant shift at City Hall despite the fact that Democrats vastly outnumber Republicans in New York City no Democrat has won a race for mayor since 1989 This election shapes up to be a perfect storm for that streak to be swamped said Donald P Levy director of the Siena Research Institute who added that the outcome seems almost certain Throughout this years campaign Mr de Blasio has missed few opportunities to remind voters that Mr Lhota is a Republican and to suggest that despite Mr Lhotas support for abortion rights and samesex marriage and even the legalization of marijuana he is a sympathizer with the Tea Party movement The poll makes clear why that message which Mr Lhota says is misleading is effective as a campaign tactic in New York City threequarters of likely voters including 4 in 10 Republican voters view the Republican Party unfavorably Mr Lhota has repeatedly tried to portray himself as progressive on social issues and conservative on fiscal issues His first television commercial in the general election campaign noted his common ground with Mr de Blasio while criticizing the Democrat for wanting to raise taxes and supporting reckless government spending But the poll suggested that likely voters saw little difference between Mr Lhota and other members of his party Fiftyfive percent said he was a typical Republican while just 32 percent said he was a different kind of Republican The recent federal government shutdown did not help Mr Lhota 47 percent of likely voters said that the shutdown made them more likely to vote for a Democrat while only 6 percent said it prompted them to back a Republican But Mr de Blasios party affiliation is not his only strength the poll found His campaign themes emphasizing income inequality improving public education and creating housing seem to be resonating He continues to enjoy ratings that any elected official would envy with 62 percent of likely voters viewing him favorably and only 22 percent unfavorably Nearly half of likely voters said Mr de Blasios greatest strength was his ability to understand the needs and problems of people like them And more than half said they thought that he would bring about change that would make the city better while only 13 percent thought that change wrought by a de Blasio administration would make the city worse As is always the case for any election an unexpected lastminute event or revelation could alter the dynamic shift the momentum or dampen turnout But nothing Mr Lhota has done including television commercials and a strong performance in last weeks debate has improved his standing with voters thus far In fact the poll suggested that the more voters get to know Mr Lhota the less they like him his unfavorable rating has climbed at a faster rate than his favorable rating since the last TimesSiena poll in early October There is also an apparent enthusiasm gap most Democratic voters say the race for mayor has been interesting while most Republican voters say it has been dull Mr de Blasio won the Democratic primary by running as the most liberal of the major candidates in the field he has proposed raising taxes on highincome New Yorkers and has supported greater oversight of the Police Department Nonetheless one in five Republicans are supporting him for mayor suggesting in followup interviews that they are looking for change after eight years with Rudolph W Giuliani as mayor followed by 12 years with Mayor Michael R Bloomberg I think de Blasios policies will be a change for the better from the Bloomberg era said Duane Dowden a 33yearold Brooklyn Republican who is a student in social work Oswald Ramotar a 51yearold Queens Republican agreed saying Im voting for de Blasio because I think he would bring better changes than Lhota would like creating more jobs And Erick Washington a 59yearold Brooklyn Republican said Im not voting for Lhota because I feel that would be the same as voting for the Giuliani administration Over all the poll found that Mr de Blasio held a lead over Mr Lhota of 68 to 23 percent among likely voters with Adolfo Carrin Jr the Independence Party candidate receiving 2 percent The citywide TimesSiena College poll was conducted on landlines and cellphones from Oct 21 to 26 with 701 likely voters The margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points Regardless of how they said they intended to vote those surveyed consistently said that they believed that Mr de Blasio would have more of a positive impact on most issues Nearly 6 in 10 said his policies would increase the amount of affordable housing in the city and would improve public education while only 13 percent said Mr Lhotas policies would increase affordable housing and only 25 percent said his policies would make public education better Mr Lhota who has been more supportive of current police practices than Mr de Blasio does have a slight edge on crime While only about 3 in 10 voters think the city would be safer under either mayor 1 in 4 believe the city would be less safe under Mr de Blasio while only 1 in 10 believe it would be less safe under Mr Lhota Voters appear to be so willing to embrace a Mayor de Blasio that they are even willing to forgive his outoftown sports allegiances Mr de Blasio who grew up in Cambridge Mass is a proud fan of the Boston Red Sox and also roots for the Boston Celtics and the New England Patriots despite having lived in New York for more than three decades But asked whether Mr de Blasio if he is elected mayor should switch his loyalty to New York sports teams voters said resoundingly that he should remain true to the fandom of his childhood 59 percent said he should stick to his Boston teams while only 26 percent said he should change Actually I think its wonderful that hes loyal to his boyhood teams said Terry Delis a 64yearold Queens Democrat and avowed Yankees fan And Joe Morgan a 56yearold Manhattan Democrat said a mayors sports loyalties were not important I dont care about that he said Thats silly
Judge in Texas Partly Rejects Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/us/judge-blocks-part-of-texas-abortion-law.html,A federal judge in Texas on Monday blocked an important part of the states restrictive new abortion law which would have required doctors performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital The decision one day before the provision was to take effect prevented a major disruption of abortion clinics in Texas It was a victory for abortion rights groups and clinics that had said the measure served no medical purpose and could force as many as onethird of the states 36 abortion clinics to close But the court partly upheld a second measure requiring doctors to use a particular drug protocol in nonsurgical medicationinduced abortions Doctors have called that protocol outdated and too restrictive Judge Lee Yeakel of United States District Court in Austin declared that the acts admittingprivileges provision is without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus  Gov Rick Perry who has said he hopes to make abortion a thing of the past signed the legislation in July It had been temporarily derailed when Wendy Davis a Democratic state senator mounted an 11hour filibuster in the Republicancontrolled Legislature Ms Davis is now running for governor with abortion rights as one of her planks Texas officials quickly said they would appeal the decision to the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans and Judge Yeakel said that at the end of the day these issues are going to be decided definitively not by this court but by either the Circuit or the Supreme Court of the United States  Courts in Alabama Mississippi North Dakota and Wisconsin have blocked similar admittingprivilege requirements as part of the continuing battles over how much states may restrict the right to abortion granted by Roe v Wade in 1973 Mondays ruling was hailed by the chief executive of Whole Womans Health a private group that had warned that it could be forced to close its clinics in McAllen Fort Worth and San Antonio because those clinics use visiting doctors who cannot obtain admitting privileges locally We are very relieved said the chief Amy Hagstrom Miller  In bringing the suit against two parts of the sweeping antiabortion law adopted in July abortion rights groups said that the provisions would have dramatic and draconian effects on womens access to the procedure But lawyers for the state argued that these predictions were exaggerated and that the measures served the states interest in protecting fetal life Mr Perry responded swiftly to the decision on Monday vowing in a written statement to appeal We will continue fighting to implement the laws passed by the duly elected officials of our state laws that reflect the will and values of Texans the statement said The lawsuit did not challenge two other central provisions of the Texas law a requirement that all abortion clinics meet the costly standards of ambulatory surgery centers which does not take effect until September 2014 and a ban on nearly all abortions starting at 20 weeks after conception which will take effect on Tuesday Antiabortion groups while expressing disappointment with the finding on admitting privileges said they looked forward to an appeal and described the imminent 20week ban as a victory In three days of hearings before Judge Yeakel last week lawyers for the state argued that it was impossible to know in advance how many clinics would have to close as a result of the admittingprivilege rule and that in any case the rule would not pose an undue burden on women seeking abortions which would remain available in the state The Texas solicitor general Jonathan Mitchell also asserted that the law served the states interest in protecting fetal life The plaintiffs said the disputed provisions did not serve any medical interest and were intended to prevent women from exercising their constitutional right to an abortion The legal challenge was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union the Center for Reproductive Rights Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas and the owners of several other Texas clinics In the hearings the owners explained why many clinics could not meet the admittingprivilege requirement and described the hardships patients would face especially in sparsely populated West Texas if clinics closed  Many clinics particularly in smaller cities use visiting doctors who rarely send patients to local hospitals and therefore cannot meet admittingprivilege requirements Also some hospitals are unwilling to court antiabortion protests by making formal arrangements with abortion clinics But in the rare case of a medical emergency experts testified patients are sent to the nearest emergency room and treated in any case Doctors described a professional consensus that nonsurgical medication abortions were safe and effective through nine weeks of pregnancy and with a lower dosage than that used in the earliest trials They said the Texas laws mandate that doctors use the protocol approved by the Food and Drug Administration in 2000 which approved the use of higher doses through only seven weeks of pregnancy would expose women to unnecessary risk Courts in North Dakota and Oklahoma have struck down laws imposing the earlier drug protocol for medication abortions but one remains in effect in Ohio Judge Yeakel ruled on Monday that requiring the earlier protocol did not pose an unconstitutional obstacle except in cases where the new regimen appeared necessary to save the life or health of the mother It remains to be seen how that will be interpreted but the plaintiffs expressed concern While this ruling protects access to safe and legal abortion for women in many parts of the state it puts ideology over science by banning a safe method of abortion for many women said Cecile Richards president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America referring to the rules on medication abortion Texas was the 12th state to adopt a 20week ban which legal experts say is in conflict with Supreme Court decisions granting a right to abortion until the fetus is viable outside the womb usually around 24 weeks Courts have blocked such measures in the three states where they have been challenged but they remain in effect in others Abortion rights groups said they were still studying when and how to challenge the ban
Ohio Governor Defies G.O.P. With Defense of Social Safety Net,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/29/us/politics/ohio-governor-defies-gop-with-defense-of-social-safety-net.html,COLUMBUS Ohio  In his grand Statehouse office beneath a bust of Lincoln Gov John R Kasich let loose on fellow Republicans in Washington Im concerned about the fact there seems to be a war on the poor he said sitting at the head of a burnished table as members of his cabinet lingered after a meeting That if youre poor somehow youre shiftless and lazy You know what he said The very people who complain ought to ask their grandparents if they worked at the WPA Ever since Republicans in Congress shut down the federal government in an attempt to remove funding for President Obamas health care law Republican governors have been trying to distance themselves from Washington Gov Scott Walker of Wisconsin schooled lawmakers in a Washington Post opinion column midway through the 16day shutdown on What Wisconsin Can Teach Washington Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey with a record of bipartisan support at home remarked after a visit to the nations capital If I was in the Senate right now Id kill myself But few have gone further than Mr Kasich in critiquing his partys views on poverty programs and last week he circumvented his own Republican legislature and its Tea Party wing by using a littleknown state board to expand Medicaid to 275000 poor Ohioans under President Obamas health care law Once a leader of the conservative firebrands in Congress under Newt Gingrich in the 1990s Mr Kasich has surprised and disarmed some former critics on the left with his championing of Ohios disadvantaged which he frames as a matter of Christian compassion He embodies conventional Republican fiscal priorities  balancing the budget by cutting aid to local governments and education  but he defies many conservatives in believing government should ensure a strong social safety net In his three years as governor he has expanded programs for the mentally ill fought the nursing home lobby to bring down Medicaid costs and backed Clevelands Democratic mayor Frank Jackson in raising local taxes to improve schools To some Ohio analysts those moves are a reaction to the humiliating defeat Mr Kasich suffered in 2011 when voters in a statewide referendum overturned a law stripping public employees of bargaining rights Before the vote Mr Kasichs approval in this quintessential swing state plunged Now as the governors image has softened his poll numbers have improved heading into a reelection race next year against the likely Democratic nominee Ed FitzGerald the executive of Cuyahoga County He still angers many on the left he signed a budget in June that cut revenues to local governments and mandates that women seeking an abortion listen to the fetal heartbeat Democrats see his centrist swing as mere calculation a prelude to a tough reelection fight This is someone who realized he had to get to the center and chose Medicaid as the issue said Danny Kanner communications director of the Democratic Governors Association That doesnt erase the first three years of his governorship when he pursued polices that rewarded the wealthy at the expense of the middle class Ohioans earning in the top 1 percent will see a 6000 tax cut under the latest budget passed by the Republicanled legislature while those in the bottom fifth will see a 12 increase according to Policy Matters Ohio an independent research group The governor dismissed the notion that his Medicaid decision was political I have an opportunity to do good to lift people and thats what Im going to do he said You know what he added using a phrase he utters before aiming a jab Let the chips fall where they may The son of a mailman who grew up outside Pittsburgh Mr Kasich pronounced KAYsik has said he didnt meet a Republican until he arrived as a freshman at Ohio State He has often showed an independent streak He supported President Bill Clintons assault weapons ban while in Congress in 1994 and he teamed with Ralph Nader to close corporate tax loopholes In the interview in his office he criticized a widespread conservative antipathy toward government social programs which regards the safety net as enabling a culture of dependency Mr Kasich who occasionally sounds more like an heir to Lyndon B Johnson than to Ronald Reagan urged sympathy for the lady working down here in the doughnut shop that doesnt have any health insurance  think about that if you put yourself in their shoes He said it made no sense to turn down 25 billion in federal Medicaid funds over the next two years a position backed by state hospitals and Ohio businesses Yet at the same time Ohio under Mr Kasich refused to run its own state insurance exchange as encouraged by the health care law known as the Affordable Care Act The governor said he did not believe that the law which mandates that people buy insurance will work To the contrary he said Its going to throw people out of work and not control costs Expanding Medicaid which became an option for states after the 2012 Supreme Court ruling upholding the health care law is different Mr Kasich asserts The governor argued all year that extending eligibility beyond poor mothers and children to include childless adults earning up to 15860 will help thousands of the mentally ill and drugaddicted The governor whose brother is mentally ill spoke of how Medicaid would get more people into treatment decreasing the homeless and prison populations For those who live in the shadows of life for those who are the least among us Mr Kasich said in a February speech echoing the Bible I will not accept the fact that the most vulnerable in our state should be ignored In some ways his balancing act has scrambled the usual ideological alliances A Wall Street Journal editorial last week mocked his religionbased explanation for expanding Medicaid and labeled him the Apostle Kasich But mental health groups that usually find Democrats more sympathetic are cheering Its been an astonishing thing to watch said Terry Russell executive director of the National Alliance for Mental Illness in Ohio Since hes become governor weve received more for mental health care than any time in the past 20 years Still the governor got nowhere with the legislature where Republicans hold majorities in both houses and many conservatives are rankled with his halfembrace of Mr Obamas law The right flank had dealt him an earlier defeat refusing a proposal to raise taxes on oil and gas companies and use the money for an income tax cut  which Tea Party supporters called redistributing wealth Ohios legislative districts have been drawn to create safe seats a dynamic that increasingly pulled the General Assembly to the right So many of these legislators are really concerned about a Tea Party challenge said John C Green a political scientist at the University of Akron The Ohio Liberty Coalition a network of Tea Party groups threatened a primary challenge to any lawmaker supporting the governor on Medicaid expansion We said Youre supposed to be about limitedgovernment and free markets and were here to hold you accountable said Ted Stevenot president of the Tea Party coalition As a result Medicaid expansion never came up for a vote in the General Assembly The budget that lawmakers sent the governor in June even prohibited the expansion of Medicaid But Mr Kasich vetoed the item and last week he did an endrun through a special committee known as the Controlling Board which approves daytoday adjustments to the budget He also used his leverage to stack the board in his favor A senior member of the Kasich administration acknowledged in interviews that it pressed Republican leaders of the legislature  the House speaker and Senate president  to assure a majority of yes votes on the board Hours before the vote on Oct 21 two no votes were replaced with other members one of whom voted for expansion increasing the margin in favor to 52 The fix was in said one disgruntled Republican in the House Representative Matt Lynch Tea Party leaders acknowledge that Mr Kasich won the round Although some grassroots activists may refuse to help him next year he seems unlikely to face a serious primary challenger on his right flank Our governors numbers among Republicans are very good said Matt Borges chairman of the Ohio Republican Party The governor cast a cold eye on hardliners in his party especially in Washington Nowhere in life do we not compromise and give he said

State Court Deems Law Wide Attack on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/us/oklahoma-court-deems-law-a-wide-attack-on-abortion.html,WASHINGTON  Responding to questions from the United States Supreme Court the Oklahoma Supreme Court ruled Tuesday that a 2011 state law violated the Constitution by effectively banning all medicinal nonsurgical abortions The case already accepted for review by the United States Supreme Court may be decided this term The court has not decided a major abortion case since 2007 when it upheld the federal PartialBirth Abortion Ban Act The new case Cline v Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice No 121094 concerns a state law that restricted the use of abortioninducing drugs to a protocol approved by the Food and Drug Administration The agency in 2000 approved the use of mifepristone sometimes called RU486 to induce abortions in combination with a second drug Since then the state court said Tuesday in an unsigned opinion additional research has refined the proper use of mifepristone calling for a lower dose fewer visits to clinics and use later in the pregnancy Ninetysix percent of medication abortions in the United States are now provided according to a regimen different from the one described in mifepristones FDAapproved label the court said An Oklahoma trial judge struck down the law last year saying that it was so completely at odds with the standard that governs the practice of medicine that it can serve no purpose other than to prevent women from obtaining abortions and to punish and discriminate against those women who do In December the State Supreme Court affirmed the trial judges decision but its decision was brief and cryptic Even as the United States Supreme Court agreed in June to hear the states appeal it asked for clarification from the State Supreme Court In essence the justices wanted to know what the state law meant Did it merely require adherence to the FDAapproved protocol for mifepristone Or did it do more The State Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the broader answer saying the law effectively bans all medication abortions It rested its decision in large part on language in the state law that it said applied not just to mifepristone but also to misoprostol a second drug used in combination with it E Scott Pruitt Oklahomas attorney general said the court had now twice gone astray The Oklahoma Supreme Court erred in striking down the law he said in a statement We believe they have erred yet again by interpreting the law more broadly than the Legislature intended The Oklahoma Supreme Courts interpretation of the state law is authoritative But its answer could make the case less attractive to the United States Supreme Court which may have wanted to consider only the narrower issue of whether states may require adherence to the FDA protocol for mifepristone Having learned that the state law does more than that the justices may decide to dismiss the case and await another one presenting the narrower question If they do they may not have to wait for long On Monday a federal judge largely sustained part of a Texas law that tied the use of mifepristone to aspects of the agencys protocol
A Mixed Decision on the Texas Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/opinion/a-mixed-decision-on-the-texas-abortion-law.html,Under a phony guise of protecting the health and safety of women states with Republican governors and state legislatures have been keeping busy enacting one burdensome scheme after another designed to radically curtail access to safe and legal abortion care  On Monday a federal judge in Texas rejected one of the most underhanded of these legislative efforts by blocking an important part of the states new abortion law which would have required doctors performing the procedure to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital  Ruling the provision unconstitutional Judge Lee Yeakel of the United States District Court in Austin declared that the laws admittingprivileges provision is without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion  Coming a day before the provision was to take effect the judges rejection of the hospitalprivileges rule was an enormous victory for women and an important vindication for principled defenders of reproductive rights including Wendy Davis the Democratic state senator who is now running for governor She tried unsuccessfully to block the measure by leading an 11hour filibuster that attracted major national attention  Had Judge Yeakel ruled the other way as many as onethird of the states 36 licensed abortion facilities would have had to have stopped offering the procedure Similar provisions have been kept from going into effect by courts in Alabama Mississippi North Dakota and Wisconsin Unfortunately Judge Yeakel largely upheld a second bogus safety measure He allowed to stand the provision in the law limiting medication abortions to an outmoded protocol for the use of abortioninducing drugs The protocol was established years ago by the Food and Drug Administration Current medical practices now use a safer and more effective protocol  His misguided conclusion will have the practical effect of leaving many women who might safely opt for a medication abortion with only a surgical option  Judge Yeakel recognized that the old protocol requires at least one additional visit to a clinic and allowing less control over the timing and convenience of the medically induced miscarriage but nevertheless he said it did not impose an undue burden on abortion rights because surgical abortion is still available He did however allow a small number of medication abortions to occur for health reasons between 50 and 63 days after a womans last menstrual period which is a longer time period than allowed under the FDA rules  Judge Yeakels decision will not be the final word on the new statute Texas has already filed an appeal of the judges decision with the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit And on Tuesday the Oklahoma Supreme Court responding to questions from the United States Supreme Court explained that it found Oklahomas restriction on medication abortion unconstitutional because it restricts the longrespected medical discretion of physicians and effectively bans medication abortions and the nonsurgical treatment of women with ectopic pregnancies  The justices must now decide whether to proceed with their tentative plan to hear the Oklahoma case If they do they should affirm the Oklahoma courts decision that prohibiting women and their doctors from using the latest forms of medication abortion is unacceptable
Was Rate Shock Necessary?,https://douthat.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/10/30/was-rate-shock-necessary/,"Something thats floating around in the discussion of Obamacares apparent losers is the idea that the kind of
                                        regulatory changes driving rate shock for many consumers were essential to the design of health care reformÂ  with the implication being that whether or not they were the absolutely ideal
                                        policy and whether or not the president was completely honest about their impact once the White House settled on its mandate regulate subsidize approach to health care reform they became essentially
                                        inevitable Heres Josh Barro for instance in a post I linked to on Monday making the
                                        case that what were seeing is the necessary consequence of the way the law brings insurance to the currentlyuninsurable Its a lot cheaper to provide health insurance coverage if you exclude a lot of the people who need it most Making insurance available to people with preexisting health conditions costs money Obamacare
                                            funds this transfer to the chronically ill in part by raising premiums on healthy people There are other ways this transfer could have been funded For example we could have a single payer health care system  [But]Â I dont think conservatives would like that solution or other solutions
                                            that have the government directly take on the cost of insuring the chronically ill Republicans in the House of Representatives haveÂ shown no enthusiasmÂ for
                                            highrisk pool plans sometimes touted by conservative health wonks which would use government subsidies to provide care to people with expensive chronic conditions who get left behind by current insurance
                                            markets
                                         In the absence of a direct subsidy approach Obamacares crosssubsidy approach is a pretty good way to get care to people who need it This is a fair criticism of the Republican Partys health care approach as many such criticisms are But it seems insufficient as a defense of the unavoidable necessity of what the White House has wrought
                                        Yes mandateregulatesubsidize made some rate increases inevitable and Barro cites an estimate for how much of this years rate shock is driven by guaranteed
                                        issueÂ  27 percentÂ Â that sounds plausible enough But that still leaves a lot of what were seeing unaccounted for which suggests that the rate shock issue would
                                        be a much smaller political deal if the administration hadnt been so intent on seeking not only accessibility but comprehensiveness even if it meant sacrificing some achievable affordability along the wayÂ Especially
                                        since on the specific issue of insurers actuallyÂ canceling existing plans as opposed to just raising ratesÂ  which is what has made the White Houses if you like your plan
                                        you can keep it mantra look like an outright lie rather than a fudgeÂ  its the regulatory requirements that are doing all of the work Nobodys plan is getting eliminated for Obamacare
                                        noncompliance because there are more sick people in the risk pool The plans are getting eliminatedÂ  throwing people into ahem currently nonworking exchangesÂ  because theyre
                                        failing the White Houses comprehensiveness test In other words while the administration clearly had its reasons for pushing new coverage regulations and requirements and while yes the creation of a mandate required some legal definition of acceptable insurance
                                        these regulations werent just inevitable outgrowths of the administrations desire to fold more people into the insurance market ContraÂ Barros headline while some rate shock
                                        was essential to reform this much rate shock was not Instead a bill without most of the new regulations on catastrophic coverage could still have achieved its primary aim of expanding
                                        coverage and its official secondary aim of restraining costs would have actually been advanced in direct and indirect ways by leaving some of those regulations out Which is why given the White Houses obviously acute understanding of the political cost of rate increases and plan cancellations otherwise why would they have said if you like it you can keep it
                                        so many many times Im actually quite interested in why they didnt consider compromising a bit more on comprehensiveness I was an outsider to what was mostly just an intraDemocrat argument
                                        but in my memory of the 2009era debates it doesnt seem like the fate of catastrophic insurance ever really came up as a point of potential negotiation between the left and the center Red state and moderate
                                        Democrats were focused on flashpoints like abortion onÂ pushing back against the possibility of a public option or a Medicare buyin and on well protecting their own state interests But
                                        to the best of my recollection these what counts as insurancewho should keep their plan debates were never really on the political radar screenÂ There were Republicans like
                                        thenSenator Judd Gregg who raised the possibility of some sort of compromise around catastrophic rather than comprehensive insurance but there
                                        was little interest in that idea on either side of the aisle So why werent they on the radar screen given the entirely predictable political problems the new regulations have created Was it just a matter of bedrock principle Is greater comprehensiveness such
                                        a consensus leftofcenter goal that nobody questioned it everyone took it for granted and the White House just assumed that any backlash would be worth enduring for the greater liberal good Thats the
                                        implication of this Sarah Kliff post which calls comprehensiveness the whole
                                        idea behind the Affordable Care Act Or was there a political calculation that being able to say now your hated insurer has to cover Benefit X had a populist upside that was worth
                                        the potential downside of looking mendacious eventually on the keep your plan front Or were the benefit requirement helpful in keeping some of the medicalindustry interest groups at the table
                                        because they promised to push more money into the system Im not being rhetorical here Im genuinely interested in the answers Was there anyone at the White House who looked at the presidents rhetoric compared it to the actual policy reality and
                                        said You know we wouldnt have as a big a problem here if we grandfathered in more plans and loosened our definition of insurance
                                        If not why not And if so why exactly didnt someone listen to them"
"In Reversal, Court Allows Texas Law on Abortion",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/us/most-of-law-on-abortion-is-reinstated-in-texas.html,Only three days after a federal judge blocked a new Texas law that threatened to shut down many of the states abortion clinics the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans reversed the decision saying the rule should take effect while the case is argued in the months to come Abortion clinic owners and womens health advocates said the decision would have catastrophic effects because as many as 13 of the 36 clinics providing abortions in the state would have to stop doing so immediately forcing women in large swaths of Texas to travel several hours on at least two days to obtain abortions The clinics forced to halt abortions have been unable to satisfy a new requirement part of a broader antiabortion law adopted in July that doctors performing the procedure must have formal admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the clinic Greg Abbott the state attorney general and a Republican candidate for governor next year filed an emergency appeal to the threejudge circuit court on Monday asking it to overrule the lower court He said in a statement Thursday This unanimous decision is a vindication of the careful deliberation by the Texas Legislature to craft a law to protect the health and safety of Texas women Gov Rick Perry who has said he hopes to abolish abortion in Texas said in a statement Todays decision affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of Texas In blocking the requirement on Monday Judge Lee Yeakel of United States District Court in Austin accepted the argument of the clinics and many doctors and national medical associations that requiring admitting privileges had no bearing on safety because in the rare event of an emergency patients will be rushed to the nearest hospital and treated the same way regardless The requirement is likely to be unconstitutional he declared because it is without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion But the appeals panel found just the opposite that the rule is likely to be constitutional because it serves a legitimate state interest in regulating doctors and does not impose an undue burden on the right to abortion The appeals court said that the admitting privilege rule might increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions But it cited a Supreme Court statement in an earlier abortion case that if a regulation serves a valid purpose the fact that it has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an abortion cannot be enough to invalidate it In Texas and other states especially in smaller cities and rural areas abortion clinics often use visiting doctors who may be highly qualified but do not meet the rules of local hospitals for admitting privileges Many hospitals for example grant privileges only to doctors who admit a certain number of patients a year while emergency hospitalizations after abortions are rare Some hospitals are unwilling to make formal arrangements with abortion providers because of religious reasons or because they fear protests The challenge to the admitting privilege rule was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union the Center for Reproductive Rights Planned Parenthood and other abortion clinic owners in Texas They were apparently surprised by the sudden turn and warned of dire consequences We believe there are currently 36 health centers in Texas that provide abortions and onethird will be forced to stop those services tomorrow Amanda Harrington a spokeswoman for the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said on Thursday Four of seven Planned Parenthood clinics in Texas have not been able to find doctors with local admitting privileges and will halt abortions immediately but they will remain open to provide other womens services Ms Harrington said Some other private clinics may shut down mostly in West and South Texas Courts in Alabama Mississippi North Dakota and Wisconsin have temporarily blocked similar admittingprivilege requirements as unconstitutional obstacles With Thursdays ruling by the Fifth Circuit it appeared likely that the issue will eventually be decided by the Supreme Court part of the continuing battles over how much states may restrict the right to abortion granted by Roe v Wade in 1973
Homeownership Has Crucial Role in Westchester Race,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/01/nyregion/homeownership-has-crucial-role-in-westchester-race.html,In Westchester a county of both horse farms and homeless shelters property taxes not surprisingly are at the heart of the race for county executive  Despite the countys mounting ethnic diversity and welter of urban problems Westchester is mostly about owning a house in the suburbs even if property taxes there are higher than in any other county in the United States according to a 2010 study by Forbes the median tax bill is 8404 a year seven times the national average  Rob Astorino the Republican incumbent won four years ago by skewering his opponent for raising taxes He is trying to paint his challenger Noam Bramson the Harvardeducated mayor of New Rochelle for the past eight years as a taxdrunk liberal He raised taxes by 109 percent Mr Astorino said in an interview this week adding that Mr Bramson would try the same tactic should he win election on Nov 5  Mr Bramson who can claim credit for enlivening New Rochelles ragged downtown with skyscrapers and luxury housing responded that Mr Astorino was engaging in dishonesty and hypocrisy by counting a decade in which Mr Bramson was just a New Rochelle city councilman He countered that Mr Astorino avoided raising taxes during his fouryear tenure by borrowing a charge Mr Astorino said was misleading since the loans were needed to pay pension obligations negotiated by previous administrations  And Mr Bramson 43 a son of Holocaust survivors parried by pointing out that Mr Astorino had allowed gun shows to return to the county cultural center after a 10year hiatus and vetoed a bill prohibiting the harassment of women entering abortion clinics This is a contest between a commonsense Clinton Democrat and a Tea Party Republican Mr Bramson said in an interview  Mr Astorino 46 contended that he opposed militarystyle assault rifles but that gun shows where background checks for buyers are required are popular at the county center He said he opposed the abortion bill as duplicative since access was already guaranteed by federal and state laws  Lee Miringoff a political scientist who directs the Marist College polling operations said that since most Westchester residents think the county is moving in the right direction Mr Astorino is exploiting that sentiment in his appeals to voters But Mr Bramson he said is taking another shrewd tack because of the recent revulsion with congressional Republicans over the federal shutdown in a county where there are twice as many registered Democrats as Republicans He has been trying to nationalize the context given the damaged Republican brand Mr Miringoff said The electoral dynamics are counterintuitive County taxes take only a small bite of a homeowners purse  roughly 18 percent of the tax bill The big bite is taken by school taxes and suburbanites who left cities for better schools seem perennially willing to spend heavily on them however sour their mood  Despite Mr Bramsons liberal credentials Mr Astorino has won the endorsement of two NAACP leaders from Yonkers and New Rochelle Some AfricanAmericans resent Mr Bramsons participation in a New Rochelle council that redistricted seats in a way that they felt made it harder to elect a black representative Mr Bramson feels that argument has been debunked With 4 million in his war chest Mr Astorino has raised more than twice as much as Mr Bramson but whether that has put him in the lead is in question since there have been no independent polls  In recent days Mr Bramson visited senior centers in Mount Vernon and Yonkers while Mr Astorino stopped in to talk to shopkeepers in Mount Vernon and Port Chester Comments like one Blanche Schaffer made about Mr Bramson were typical in an area where residents passion for politics is expended more on the New York City mayoral race than on the race for county executive Hes got nice hair Ms Schaffer 92 said in between bites of her chicken lunch at the Sinai Free Synagogue in Mount Vernon Im a Democrat but its too difficult for me to vote In Port Chester Mr Astorino sometimes speaking Spanish arranged to be shown around by Adelo Ramirez a tortilla maker who was grateful to Mr Astorinos staff for introducing him to the CTown supermarket chain that now carries his tostadas  Not everyone does that he said of Mr Astorinos staff Usually they give you a number and blow you off One issue that could play out in unpredictable ways is a federal fairhousing settlement that requires 31 municipalities to build a total of 750 units of affordable housing Residents in a largely white county of 950000 people that is now one third Hispanic and AfricanAmerican have a maze of feelings Mr Astorino has been fighting the remaining federal requirements because he says they would encroach on local zoning authority needed to protect against overbuilding and overcrowded schools Mr Bramson argues that Mr Astorinos losing battle has cost taxpayers over 20 million in lost grants and legal expenses  On taxes Mr Bramson said Mr Astorino had avoided raising them by cutting back child care subsidies and gutting the countys planning department Mr Astorino said he had made smart cutbacks getting members of seven of eight unions to contribute to their health insurance And he said the county has added 27000 jobs 7000 of which were either created or saved by persuading firms like Pepsico not to move workers elsewhere Richard Brodsky a state assemblyman who ran unsuccessfully for county executive faults the candidates for divergent campaigns with Mr Astorino stressing taxes and jobs as Mr Bramson stresses guns and abortion  Theyre not arguing with each other he said Theyre having separate conversations with the electorate
Star Turns Amid a Winter Flurry,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/movies/jared-leto-veerle-baetens-and-other-standout-performances.html,Jared Leto Dallas Buyers Club After five years away from film and after ignoring five emails from the producers of Dallas Buyers Club which opened Friday Jared Leto was in Berlin when he finally decided to Skype with that films director JeanMarc Valle I was playing a show with 100000 people in the audience said Mr Leto the frontman of the rock band 30 Seconds to Mars Its easy to say no to a film with that kind of a dream coming true in front of you Mr Leto became a 1990s TV teen idol in My SoCalled Life and by 2000 he was a rising Hollywood star featured in films by Terrence Malick David Fincher and most notably Darren Aronofsky But in the mid2000s a few indie films in which he was featured flopped I had my heart broken by these small films Mr Leto said He took a sabbatical from Hollywood to embrace pop superstardom I watched the sunrise in Lebanon he said I shot music videos in the Arctic Circle and made the firstever rock video in China Yet despite the millions of records sold and a fanatical online fan base Mr Leto missed acting So backstage in Berlin he applied pink lip gloss and sat down for his Skype audition with Mr Valle I unbuttoned this black heavy pea coat and I had this pink sweater on underneath he said I just started to flirt The next day Mr Leto was cast as Rayon above an HIVpositive transgender person who joins forces with an electrician and rodeo cowboy played by Matthew McConaughey in Reaganera Texas to make HIV drugs available and affordable Given Mr Letos theatrical rockgod persona viewers might expect hyperbolic camp but his performance is sweetly charming and selfdeprecating Though Rayon takes her name from a synthetic disco fabric she feels as gritty and tragic as an old Texan ballad So many times in film we see this role and its stereotypical and full of clich said Mr Leto who interviewed transgender teenagers while touring with his band Weve all seen that guy dressed up in womens clothing standing up on some table shouting out some sort of punch line and then running out of the room in a flash of color and feathers Rayon is no wallflower She has some of the films wittiest lines but the humor is grounded by a constant sense of immediate threat Levity Thats her artillery Mr Leto said Youre in Texas in 1985 and you walk through the supermarket in drag you learn how to be funny very quickly as a survival mechanism Mr Leto is virtually unrecognizable in the part and not just because of the feathered wigs Like Mr McConaughey he lost dozens of pounds to play a character ravaged by illness and addiction I took all of my body hair off lost weight and was just kind of stripped with nothing to hide behind Mr Leto said But he added even with hair and makeup and lashes and nails I still felt raw and vulnerable Oscar Isaac Inside Llewyn Davis The life of the unheralded folk singer at the heart of Inside Llewyn Davis Dec 6 seems to have begun with a downbeat and stalled there As created by the writerdirectors Joel and Ethan Coen and embodied by a sosoulfulithurts Oscar Isaac Llewyn Davis is as stuck as a skipping record in a scratched groove Shortly after we meet this authenticityobsessed grouse outside a Greenwich Village folk club he is clocked by a mysterious cowboy and ends up flattened face first in the dank alleyway Its all downhill even from there He cant help messing everything up He insults the generous older woman who feeds him dinner He sleeps with his best friends wife and then asks that friend for money to pay for her abortion He records a hit but declines the royalties that could make him rich Given a chance to impress a bigtime producer he plays his most depressing song Llewyn even loses a friends cat above A Juilliard graduate Mr Isaac 33 has proved himself capable of warm charm in films like The Nativity Story and 10 Years He has played dangerous tough guys in Drive and The Bourne Legacy and a ravenously passionate Romeo in a 2007 Shakespeare in the Park production If those performances were often electric in this film Mr Isaac is unplugged Wielding his soulful singing voice and guitar he strums quietly in a lead role that thrives in a minor key Its a mature take on a character who immobilized by the death of his singing partner seems incapable of maturing Given his range Mr Isaac must have been tempted to give this poor guy some extra jolt of magnetism or some shot of romantic swagger But the actors quiet detailed mumbling stumbling performance feels admirably determined not to please Its a restraint that Llewyn might appreciate Mr Isaac never sells him out Veerle Baetens The Broken Circle Breakdown The chemistry either works or it doesnt the Belgian actress Veerle Baetens pronounced VAIRluh BAWtins said of working with her Broken Circle Breakdown costar Johan Heldenbergh Sometimes you can even have that spark on the street with an another actor but you see yourselves on the screen and its not there Johan and I had that electricity from the beginning In Felix Van Groeningens film which opened Friday based on Mr Heldenberghs play and set in Belgium Ms Baetens 35 plays Elise an uninhibited tattoo artist who falls for Mr Heldenberghs Didier an Americanaobsessed bluegrass musician In a nonlinear crosscut decadelong romance the two fall into lust then love and finally into a morass of recriminations over their ailing young daughter Their chemistry ranges from passionate physicality and aching tenderness to dumbstruck grief and reckless cruelty Whether teasing on the hood of a truck in her Americanflag bikini or breaking down into wrenching sobs Ms Baetens never less than bristles with intensity as if the tattoos that cover her skin are not just rendered in ink but filigreed with raw nerves We rehearsed for months which Ive never done Ms Baetens said It was necessary for this movie We couldnt just get to set and in two days seem like wed been together 10 years Ms Baetens set up play dates with her own 5yearold daughter and the actress Nell Cattrysse who plays her child The cast rehearsed by day and at night studied the emotional violence of the choreographer Pina Bauschs Caf Mller the swoony heartbreak of the Belgian chanson Jacques Brel and of course the American bluegrass that courses through the film I didnt try to copy the sound of the bluegrass voice said Ms Baetens who fronts the Belgian electropop band Dallas I focused on the simple emotion of the music On occasion that raw emotion startled her Broken Circle Breakdown crew Johann had said Use my body Hit me Push me So in one scene I was filled up with all this frustration over not knowing where Elise and Didier were going and if youre going to end up together and what to do that I just started hitting him  and myself she said They were all very afraid after that She paused for a second then added Maybe they should have been Tiger Chen Man of Tai Chi The path to stardom is a tough climb for any actor But for a martial arts stuntman it can be unusually painful Tiger Chen was just 6 and living in Chengdu China when he first saw Jet Li in The Shaolin Temple and decided to become an action star He eventually became a regional wushu champion and years later found work as a martial arts instructor in Atlantic City which led to work as a stuntman with the stunt choreographer Yuen Wo Ping on The Matrix the Kill Bill movies and Crouching Tiger Hidden Dragon I broke both ankles twice and dislocated my shoulder many times and had to get surgery he said A lot of broken fingers hurt back lots of bruises When Mr Chen now 36 finally got his break as the star of the nonstop Bmovie fightfest Man of Tai Chi which opened Friday choreographed by Mr Yuen it didnt get easier Mr Chen developed the film with his former Matrix student Keanu Reeves who makes his directorial debut but he still did all his own stunts It was my dream come true but it was painful he said We did 108 shooting days 12 hours of fighting every day and we didnt use a double I would wake up in the middle of the night because of the pain and then in the morning there is another opponent waiting for you fresh and strong In the film Mr Chen plays a quiet shaggyhaired tai chi student named yes Tiger Chen who is recruited by a mysterious impresario Mr Reeves to compete in an underground fight club against increasingly brutal competitors The role requires Mr Chen to adapt his fluid tai chi to conquer each opponent and showcases his athletic versatility both his acrobatic technical grace and his capacity for nasty brutish violence Mr Chens performance thrives in his zerotohero transformation as his shy bike messenger erupts into a ragefilled dervish of flying head butts flashing fists and eyegouging thumbs On the set of the Matrix movies Mr Chen was the master teaching Mr Reeves martial arts Neos muchquoted line I know kung fu is thanks to Mr Chen On Man of Tai Chi Mr Reeves taught Mr Chen to act with Mr Reevess signature avatarlike blankness Some people dont like that style Mr Chen said In China some say Your face is too still But thats the style of Keanu acting Like Keanu I want to make contact with the audience through my eyes and my heart
Dick Cavett and Alec Baldwin Start the Conversation,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/fashion/Dick-Cavett-and-Alec-Baldwin-Start-the-Conversation.html,The 21 Club was packed when Dick Cavett the longtime television talkshow host and a regular contributor to the Opinionator blog for The New York Times and Alec Baldwin star of TV 30 Rock film Blue Jasmine theater Orphans on Broadway and most recently his own talk show on MSNBC Up Late With Alec Baldwin arrived  The matre d led the men through the dining room into the kitchen and down a narrow flight of stairs with a perilously low ceiling Wait a minute How are people going to ask for our autographs down here Mr Cavett asked The stairwell was lined with special bottles of wine reserved for special patrons T Boone Pickens and Chelsea Clinton to name two After one final hurdle they were seated in the private wine cellar at a long table with bottles of wine from floor to ceiling  Over lunch  an omelet for Mr Baldwin and Dover sole for Mr Cavett  and after some debate about who would sit where Mr Baldwin I think Cavett should sit at the head of the table Mr Cavett I couldnt possibly just because Im your senior by three years the men spoke of talk shows Richard Nixon being chased by the paparazzi and dealing with depression PHILIP GALANES When I first heard that you were hosting a talk show Alec I thought I must not understand how celebrity works I thought the whole point of being the host of one was access to people who wouldnt normally sit down with you But youre a star You could set up nice dinners with any of your guests Why add the cameras and the pancake makeup What about a talk show appealed to you ALEC BALDWIN When Dick was in his big run at ABC I watched his show and I couldnt watch other things I turned off the TV when Gilligans Island and F Troop were cresting and I never got into the Aaron Spelling shows But I liked talk shows and I loved Cavett How he wasnt all preproduced and let the conversation breathe So when I started doing my podcast   PG Do you know that Alec did a podcast for WNYC [Heres the Thing] DICK CAVETT Oh yes I was on it  AB On the talk show I want to introduce or reintroduce the viewers to people I appreciate I want Herb Alpert to tell them what it was like to have a successful career as an instrumentalist Or talk with Leonard Bernsteins kids about what it was like to grow up in that world Or introduce you to somebody whos relatively new like Lena Dunham  PG Now you on the other hand Mr Cavett grew up in the world of talk shows correct Your first job was writing material for Jack Paar DC I never missed a Jack Paar show until I made my ludicrously ballsy move and got myself hired by him I was a copy boy for Time magazine and someone left The Herald Tribune open on the copy boy desk and I read Marie Torres column about Jack Paar It said he worried more about his monologue than anything else So I went home and typed one up then took it to the bowels of the RCA Building and sneaked up to NBC Of course if there was security like there is now Id never be here today AB This is back when security was a guy named Pat and he was 80 years old DC So here comes Jack Paar walking out of the mens room and I had the wits to put the monologue in a Time magazine envelope and that caught his eye I hand it to him I wrote a monologue for you Mr Paar Oh yeah he says And I think thats that for my monologue But that night he adlibbed three of my lines on the show  PG Had comedy writing been your goal DC I was a starving actor And I wanted to be a comic I thought vaguely But most of all I wanted to be on a talk show  as a guest  and even if Id done it only once I could go back to Nebraska and say I made it just like Johnny [Carson] who left Nebraska 12 years before me  PG Of course you went on to write for Johnny Carson when he took over the Tonight show from Jack Paar Have you read the new tellall about Carson by Henry Bushkin  DC I rather liked it I thought it must be true There were sides of Johnny that I didnt know But I know he was one of the unhappiest men in the world But he loved me so I felt good about him AB Why do you think he was so unhappy DC Oh God he had a wretched mother One time Johnny wins some great prestigious award and she says I guess they know what theyre doing  AB The mother said that DC Yeah She never encouraged him And when I worked for him there was an awful lot of tension He was like a wire a tight wire PG You can see it in the early clips  DC You can And he had a wife on the ledge and drinking troubles His happiest hour was when he was out there on the set and the rest of his life was really horrible  AB Once someone told me about the exwife of a famous television star He was the star of a family show he played the dad and the exwife said that he went to work and he gave everything he had to give to his TV children and when he came home there was nothing left for his own child I thought to myself Thats absurd Now I see how that happens all the time The curtain opens and they say Heres Johnny And thats the moment youre free and alive and know exactly whats going to happen for the next 90 minutes  DC You dont have to make any decisions about what to do next  AB Someone said to me Why do you like doing theater so much Though after my last experience [a troubled and shortlived Broadway production of Orphans] I dont like it as much as I used to Trust me PG I thought it was quite good  you and Ben Foster  AB It was a horrible experience and it took years off my life But to answer that question why do I love theater its because its the only place in life where you walk out onstage and by and large you know whats going to happen What youre going to say what the other people are going to say to you whether the audience is going to laugh or feel deeply moved You dont have to figure anything out  DC I remember being in a play once and there were just 30 minutes left and I thought I dont want this ever to end Its like being in a protective womb for a couple hours then the poor actor has to go home PG Its interesting how in tune you are on performing It brings me back to your talk shows Physically and temperamentally youre very different We have Cavetts Mr Sly and TwinklyEyed and   AB I cant wait to hear what youre going to say next PG And Alecs more fullthroated upfront delivery But the tone of your talk shows is very similar I watched Dicks interview with Marlon Brando  in 1973 maybe the most beautiful man Ive ever seen But he didnt want to give anything away He spoke in monosyllables But you just waited and waited and finally he opened up and gave the best interview Ive ever seen with him  AB There must be some technique PG And I saw the same thing in your interview of Debra Winger Alec She launched a few stories and I thought She has no idea how to land this plane But you gave her room and were so kind that she found her way to a beautiful point about processing disappointment that she wouldnt have if youd rushed her AB What I find is that when you push or try to take something from them it doesnt work But when you let it breathe when you let your segments run a little longer they give it to you They give it to you if you let it be their choice DC Some people thought it was zany to do 90minute shows with one person Youre doing 90 minutes with George Harrison [shortly after the Beatles had broken up] I dont envy you I didnt envy myself for the first couple segments AB But by the time its over they look at you and go Were done  PG He was quite funny  DC I remember saying to him Yoko Ono sat in that chair And he knew to jump out of it horrified And by the end of the show he was as interesting as anyone I had met If you can convince them that youre not going to hurt them that security led people to say Ive never felt this good on a talk show My God I dont know how you got me to talk about my abortion And that was a man  PG So have you got a tip for Alec DC Well I guess its obligatory to rehearse the advice Jack Paar gave to me Hey kid dont do interviews I thought What do I do then sing read poetry to the audience Dont do interviews kid Whats your favorite this or that like David Frost and his clipboard He meant make it a conversation I didnt get it right away but I realized thats what Jack did And he was the most electric personality Ive ever known on TV PG Did you have any reluctance about doing your show on MSNBC Alec Cable news channels are so tribal now Are you kissing off half of your audience AB First of all theres a certain part of the American public that if I walked out onto the ice and Barbara Bush had just fallen through and I saved her from drowning and carried her to shore and performed mouthtomouth resuscitation and saved her from hypothermia people would say He rumpled her coat My original conversations were with NBC but they didnt have a slot for me and may not have a slot for some time Theyre shuffling their whole late night with Jimmy Fallon and Seth Meyers Then Phil Griffin [the president of MSNBC] popped up and said Ill give you a slot now PG Do you think MSNBC was hoping for a more combative Alec Baldwin than theyre getting AB No I told Phil what I wanted to do They want to explore some different programming  PG How about your famous TV combat Dick  the near fistfight between Norman Mailer and Gore Vidal Did the network say More of that please DC The network never said anything good AB Lets get Liz Ashley and George Peppard on there  DC Exactly All they said was Cant you get more big stars And I got every big star there was that I wanted Katharine Hepburn Bette Davis Groucho Marx Orson Welles Lucille Ball Alfred Hitchcock The only ones I didnt get were Cary Grant and Mike Nichols But all they ever said was Why do you keep booking authors PG Lets talk about your famous opponents Did you ever find out what you did to make poor Richard Milhous Nixon so angry with you DC Well apparently the White House was furious about a show I did with John Kerry and John ONeill debating the Vietnam War That started it Then your friend and mine John Lennon asked if Id come down to court and assert that he should not be deported by the Nixon administration That really did it PG They wanted to deport John Lennon DC Oh yes You can even go to YouTube after lunch and listen to Nixon asking Haldeman What can we do to screw Cavett And years later I learned from several members of my staff that he had used one of his favorite illegal hobbies and had the IRS audit all of them which was just hurting the little people in the words of Joan Crawford  AB What enemies do you suppose I possibly have PG The New York Posts coverage of you is so operatic What did you ever do to them  AB No 1 you have to have some rap sheet that they can come at you with You cant be crystal clear and pure And yes I left an angry voice mail message for my daughter that my wife and her attorneys decided to release on the Internet So theres that And as we all know the Internet is the death of forgetting You cannot reinvent yourself because its always there You hit Google and your cavalcade of misdeeds comes rolling back to the top of the page  DC Like the Great Pyramid  PG I live around the corner from Alec and every week its a mosh pit of TV crews and paparazzi Why do they want walltowall coverage of you  AB I dont have any proof of this and thats important to say but I think theyre there for harassment Im not J D Salinger Im out and about having my picture taken So when they come to my house and stake it out for days theyre there to provoke Then they ask Why are you so angry You need counseling  DC As a talkshow host recently said to Anthony Weiner Whats wrong with you  AB Which I would understand if I was having altercations with FedEx deliverymen or meter maids My bad luck is Im having these altercations with people who just happen to have still and video cameras theyre ready to capture on film DC There was an age when they didnt exist and it must have been wonderful  PG Speaking of this other age that Dick mentioned I grew up in the 70s And there wasnt a moment I didnt know who Dick Cavett was But I can remember as clear as day when I really honed in on you It was just after my father killed himself and you spoke out publicly about your own depression I wonder if you know how much your words helped people including me  DC At one point I thought Im not so sure I want to become the poster boy for depression But I still get mail about it even today You saved my dads life You helped me acknowledge my own depression If Cavett can have this then I guess its all right for me to  AB But dont you believe that the overwhelming majority of people are depressed at some time in their lives and theyre just not honest about it  DC Depression is epidemic because its still so undiagnosed And even my analyst made the mistake of saying to me  after Id told him I wished he knew for a minute what my depression felt like  he said Oh thats all right I was pretty low when my dad died I sat up and said You think grief is even close to this He apologized  AB When I wrote a book about my divorce I can remember writing about depression and wanting to kill myself I felt like I was walking and walking in the woods or in this vast open place like Saskatchewan and all of a sudden you come to this abyss that goes as far as the eye can see And looking into it its like death is inevitable  PG Ive led us into a really cheery culdesac havent I DC Sort of an Ingmar Bergman image  PG Lets end on something cheerier philanthropy I dont think Im cheap But I have a hard time giving money away Im afraid there wont be enough But your philanthropy is so large scale Alec Has it always been easy for you AB Before 30 Rock I had always given a percentage of my income to charity Im not blowing my horn about it Most people give I think But when I learned that 30 Rock was going into syndication I entered into a very lucrative agreement with Capital One and I gave nearly every dime to charity Thats why I did the commercials I got addicted to giving the money away DC Put down at this point Cavett said What a guy
Texas Clinics Stop Abortions After Court Ruling,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/us/texas-abortion-clinics-say-courts-ruling-is-forcing-them-to-stop-the-procedures.html,McALLEN Tex  The day after a federal appeals court cleared the way for Texas restrictive abortion law to take effect while it faces legal challenge many clinics across the state said they had stopped providing abortions and were preparing to shut down leaving women seeking their services distraught  Patients are walking through the door they are crying  they are freaking out said Amy Hagstrom Miller chief executive of Whole Womans Health which operates six abortion facilities in Texas and she said expects to close locations in Fort Worth McAllen and San Antonio We cant stay open without any sources of income The Texas law passed by the Legislature in July requires doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at a hospital within 30 miles of the facility where the procedure is performed among other new rules In September a coalition of abortion rights groups including Planned Parenthood the American Civil Liberties Union and the Center for Reproductive Rights as well as clinics and doctors sued to stop the law On Monday Judge Lee Yeakel of United States District Court in Austin blocked enforcement of the laws requirement of physicianadmitting privileges saying it is without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion  On Thursday three judges on the Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans  Priscilla R Owen Jennifer Walker Elrod and Catharina Haynes  allowed enforcement to begin A 20page opinion stated there was a substantial likelihood that the state will prevail and that Planned Parenthood and the other plaintiffs had not proved that the restrictions would place an undue burden on women seeking abortions All three appeals court judges were appointed by President George W Bush as was Judge Yeakel  Gov Rick Perry of Texas praised the ruling saying that it affirms our right to protect both the unborn and the health of the women of Texas Ms Hagstrom Miller said she and her staff were planning to help patients get transportation or provide gas cards so they could get to clinics that still provide abortions She has been trying to get doctors accredited by hospitals but said that the process is slow Some 30 miles away in Harlingen Dr Lester Minto the physician and owner of Reproductive Services said that in three decades of providing abortions he has stood up to protesters at times numbering in the hundreds who have picketed the clinic and frightened his patients  The new law however is a bigger obstacle He said he has not been able to get admitting privileges from nearby hospitals You cant fight Austin Dr Minto said On Friday patients came into the clinic for counseling and sonograms They were all quite desperate and scared he said Â Some told him they would travel to Houston more than 300 miles away others told him they would go to Mexico where abortioninducing drugs are widely available at pharmacies At Planned Parenthood a spokesman Eric Ferrero said that four of the organizations health centers  in Austin Fort Worth Lubbock and Waco  would not be able to provide abortions under the new rules but that those clinics will keep their doors open to provide other health services The groups said they would continue to fight the Texas law This is far from over Mr Ferrero said  Those opposing the law could petition the Fifth Circuit to ask that all of its judges reconsider the decision in a process known as en banc or they might take the case directly to the Supreme Court Elizabeth Graham the director of Texas Right to Life said in a statement applauding the Fifth Circuit decision Our attorney general and his team have done a masterful job in defending House Bill 2 and pursuing the law taking effect immediately Marni J Evans a consultant on green building in Austin said she was scheduled to get an abortion on Friday morning but got a call from Planned Parenthood canceling her appointment  Ms Evans said that she would fly to Washington State where she will stay with friends and get the procedure done If Im going to go through this process which is pretty emotionally challenging Im going to go through it with the best possible care and the most supportive environment she said Until the case works its way through the courts much is uncertain Ms Hagstrom Miller said Im not going to put a for sale sign up on my building when I still have a patient in my parking lot  but there will be a for sale sign going up in McAllen very soon
Ex-Governor of Florida Seeks Old Job in New Party,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/us/politics/ex-governor-of-florida-seeks-old-job-in-new-party.html,ST PETERSBURG Fla  As Charlie Crist the newly minted Democrat and former Florida governor sat outside his waterfront condominium here in his hometown recently the Go Charlie shoutouts never let up A Lincoln Town Car pulled up and Mr Crist leaned in and shook hands doing what he does best Hey bro whats happening the driver asked Im good man Mr Crist replied When a Duke Energy worker recognized Mr Crist the former governor gave him an earful about solar energy You got my vote buddy the man said Theres our next governor right here Whether Mr Crist a man who sprinted from Republican to independent to Democrat in three years can wrest the governorship away from Rick Scott is anybodys guess But on Friday he filed his paperwork to run for governor And on Monday with the enthusiastic backing of most leading Democrats Mr Crist 57 is expected to formally announce his intention to reclaim the governors office in 2014  Mr Crists announcement is all but certain to kick off one of next years most expensive contentious and rancorous governors races pitting betrayed Republicans out for revenge against hopeful Democrats out for redemption In an interview last week Mr Crist who governed as a centrist from 2007 to 2011 before leaving after his unsuccessful bid for the United States Senate said Floridians were heartbroken over issues like education the environment voter rights and Medicaid funding I know we can right the wrongs said Mr Crist with his trademark tan and easygoing style I know it can be done I know it in my heart I know Floridians want it They are very hopeful for a bright future And I believe its coming But he said he has no doubt about the intensity of the brawl that lies ahead Governor Scott a Republican and a multimillionaire is expected to counter Mr Crists charm offensive by focusing on claims that he helped turn around the Florida economy and raising a record 100 million to protect his job a sum that he will begin spendingÂ on Monday when the first attack ads are scheduled to air Its kind of a daunting task to face said Mr Crist explaining why it has taken so long to come to a decision on the race Its kind of like looking at a 100 million meat grinder face first Much of that money will be spent trying to portray Mr Crist as an opportunist a man willing to switch parties and positions on issues to suit his political ambition Mr Crist as governor fled the Republican Party in 2010 to become an independent after it was clear he would not win the Senate primary against Marco Rubio Last year he became a Democrat The Republican Party of Florida did not wait for Mr Crist to join the fray It began its assault weeks ago highlighting his shift over the years on issues like gay rights and Obamacare To that end it opened up a Tumblr account and a Twitter feed titled This day in Cristory Charlie had more positions than a gymnast said Rick Wilson a Republican political consultant who once worked for Mr Crist He will tell Democrats what they need to hear and he will tell Republicans what they need to hear  But Mr Wilson added Mr Crist has peerless skills in the actual game of politics which makes him a formidable candidate The campaign one in which former foes are now friends and former friends are now flamethrowers promises to be anything but dull It comes readymade with a history of slights and grievances on both sides toward both candidates And it undoubtedly will offer up a vivid contrast in personalities one man a centrist and inveterate crowdpleaser who sidesteps dogma the other a Tea Party conservative a shy executive who prefers to steer clear of prying eyes and cameras Mr Crist also will face an alreadydeclared candidate Nan Rich a former State Senate Democratic leader who reminds voters at every turn that she is a lifelong Democrat But after months of campaigning Ms Richs candidacy has not gained much traction For most Florida Democrats any misgivings they may have had about Mr Crist evaporated in a burst of pragmatism Once Mr Crist joined the party he quickly became the most viable candidate to take on Mr Scott and the conservative wing Recent polling has shown Mr Crist consistently ahead of Mr Scott in a headtohead race Mr Scott has struggled with low approval ratings throughout his tenure In many ways Mr Crist is wellsituated for a run Although he was a Republican who once characterized himself as conservative as governor he kept mostly to the center which is where Florida sits on the political spectrum He worked with Democrats on a variety of issues and in a state with a growing number of independents 28 percent he eschews ideology and embraces populism A number of moderate Republicans also support him Floridians really liked him because Crist is instinctively not a partisan official said Dan Gelber a former State House Democratic leader when Mr Crist was governor He was a fiscally pragmatic socially moderate Republican and that person is no longer welcome in the Republican Party Regarding his floating stance on certain issues Mr Crist said he did not consider changing his mind a foible It shows a willingness to listen and if needed to compromise he said I dont think we need closeminded leaders he said adding Judge me by my deeds As governor Mr Crist did much that satisfied Democrats He expanded early voting in 2008 when lines grew too long and lifted the voting ban on nonviolent exfelons He is against abortion but has not pushed an agenda in 2010 he vetoed a bill that required ultrasounds for women seeking abortions He supports gun rights but recently spoke in favor of background checks and banning 30round ammunition clips He will also promote his environmental record including his investments in replenishing the Everglades  On gay rights Mr Crist said he followed the lead of President Obama  a man he once hugged in 2009 and paid a dear political price for it  in deciding he has no right to tell people who to love or marry Still some Democrats remain skeptical I just think he is an opportunist and I think the only reason he switched to being a Democrat was that he was not rightwing enough to be a successful Republican these days said Linda Rosenthal the president of a Palm Beach County Democratic club and a Nan Rich supporter Would she support Mr Crist if he won the primary 100 percent Ms Rosenthal said Back in front of his condo Mr Crist exchanged more greetings and then a business card with a Republican friend who suddenly remembered I still have your old card the card when you were a governor Is that right Mr Crist said amused Save it
Court Rules Contraception Mandate Infringes on Religious Freedom,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/us/court-rules-contraception-mandate-infringes-on-religious-freedom.html,WASHINGTON  A federal court on Friday ruled that the health care laws mandate that employers provide free coverage for contraception infringed on individual religious liberty  The case Gilardi v the Department of Health and Human Services was the latest setback for the Obama administration as it struggles to fix the crippled insurance enrollment website HealthCaregov However the fight over the mandate long preceded the laws enactment and will most likely go to the Supreme Court The mandate trammels the right of free exercise Judge Janice Rogers Brown wrote for a divided threejudge panel of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit  The ruling was largely in line with most others around the country so far Of nearly 40 challenges only a handful of courts have upheld the governments requirement that employer health plans provide free birth control emergency contraception and sterilization  Francis A Gilardi Jr and Philip M Gilardi brothers from Sidney Ohio should not have to provide contraception coverage to employees of the companies they own if it goes against their Catholic faith the court ruled However those companies themselves Freshway Foods and Freshway Logistics do not have the right to challenge the mandate on religious grounds the court said As a result the ruling was only a partial victory for mandate opponents according to a statement from the American Center for Law and Justice which represented the Gilardis The organization said it planned to ask the Supreme Court to settle the question  While this is a victory for the individual plaintiffs said Francis J Manion who argued the case the appeals court rejected a critical argument that the rights of the companies be protected as well However the question of companies rights is just a procedural technicality said Eric Baxter a senior counsel at the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which has represented other highprofile challengers to the ban including the craft store chain Hobby Lobby The Supreme Court is expected to decide before Thanksgiving whether to review that or other cases about the mandate Mr Baxter said Judge Harry T Edwards wrote a dissent to the main part of the ruling calling the Gilardis claim that a requirement on their companies imposed a burden on their freedom of religion specious Judge Edwards continued It has been well understood since the founding of our nation that legislative restrictions may trump religious exercise The Department of Health and Human Services referred questions to the Justice Department which declined to comment  The contraception mandate has been one of the most controversial aspects of the health law since the Obama administration first announced the mandate in mid2011 along with other requirements it characterized as preventive care Religious opponents of abortion have objected especially strongly to the requirement to provide emergency contraception pills like Plan B although most studies show that the drug works by preventing fertilization not by inducing abortion  In an effort to compromise the administration has said that women who work for churches and nonprofit religious groups that object to birth control would receive separate coverage not paid for by the employers It refused however to offer accommodations to secular businesses whose owners have religious objections to contraception  On Monday Luther Strange Alabamas Republican attorney general joined the Catholic broadcaster Eternal World Television Network as a plaintiff in its challenge against the mandate in United States District Court in the Southern District of Alabama 
Court Fight,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/opinion/blow-court-fight.html,One thing that often gets lost in the momenttomoment measurements of a presidents efficacy and his legacy is one of the most enduring and resilient effects he can have on American life court appointments This week we were reminded once again of how much sway federal judges hold as they dealt several setbacks to liberal causes The conservative Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia struck down the birth control mandate in the Affordable Care Act which required employers to offer contraceptive coverage to their employees The conservative Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit reinstated most of Texas new abortion restrictions that a federal district judge Lee Yeakel had struck down as imposing an undue burden on women seeking abortions  And the Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit halted sweeping changes to New York Citys outrageous stopandfrisk policy changes called for by Judge Shira A Scheindlin of Federal District Court in Manhattan who found The city acted with deliberate indifference toward the NYPDs practice of making unconstitutional stops and conducting unconstitutional frisks  Supreme Court justices as well as federal court of appeals and district court judges are presidential appointees This is where a president can exert power long after he has officially faded from power And that is exactly what President Obama is doing  The federal judiciary  long the province and priority of Republicans  is turning more Democratic USA Today reported Friday The number of fulltime federal judges named by Democratic presidents will draw even Friday with the number named by Republicans following two retirements The next of President Obamas nominees to replace a Republicannamed judge will tilt the balance in Democrats favor that majority will grow for the remainder of his term And then theres the Supreme Court dominated by conservatives which strangely more people have deemed too liberal than too conservative since Obama was elected according to Gallup In fact the Supreme Court has not been dominated by Democratic appointees since the 1960s The current split is five Republican appointees to four Democratic appointees two of whom were named by President Obama Four justices are now 75 or older That means that the direction of the highest court could fall to the next president Federal judgeships must be a paramount consideration in the picking of the next president  Consider the judicial leanings of the leading Republican contenders for president in 2016 and the effects they could have on the future of the nations courts Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey has been blunt and unapologetic as is his wont about his judicial philosophy in regard to his states Supreme Court In August he reiterated Even before I officially became governor I made clear it was my intention to reshape the court And in 2010 he refused to reappoint New Jerseys only black Supreme Court justice The New York Times editorial page called that move a case of political overreach and a national disgrace  In Louisiana Gov Bobby Jindal last year challenged a federal court ruling that allowed Bernette Johnson to become the courts first black chief justice Part of what was at issue was that she was initially appointed to the State Supreme Court in a settlement with the federal government over discrimination on the court Johnson was elevated in spite of Jindals challenge  When the United States Supreme Court affirmed Obamacare last year Rand Paul issued a statement saying Just because a couple people on the Supreme Court declare something to be constitutional does not make it so Um sir thats exactly what it means After the courts rulings on the Defense of Marriage Act and Californias Proposition 8 this summer Senator Marco Rubio issued a statement saying the court had overstepped on DOMA But he added I do not believe there exists a federal constitutional right to samesex marriage Therefore I am glad the Supreme Court did not create one in the Proposition 8 case Senator Ted Cruz is the former solicitor general of Texas and has argued before the Supreme Court nine times including once to persuade the court not to release Michael Haley who had been sentenced to 14 years in prison for stealing a calculator from a Walmart even though the maximum was two years under state law according to The Times Cruz understands the judicial stakes well saying last year at the Values Voter Summit that the country was only one justice away from a radical five justice liberal majority on the Supreme Court 
A Bad Reversal on the Texas Abortion Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/02/opinion/a-bad-reversal-on-the-texas-abortion-law.html,A threejudge panel of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit has dealt a grievous blow to the reproductive health and rights of Texas women On Thursday the court allowed Texas pending the courts final resolution of the case to enforce a provision in the states new abortion law that requires doctors who perform the procedure to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital As a result a third of the states 36 licensed abortion clinics have stopped providing abortions  Just three days earlier a federal district judge quite correctly rejected the provision as unconstitutional finding that the admitting privileges rule serves no medical purpose and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion The judge issued an injunction blocking the provision and the state appealed that ruling immediately  The appellate panel acknowledged that the provision may increase the cost of accessing an abortion provider and decrease the number of physicians available to perform abortions But ignoring voluminous evidence its ruling accepted the phony claim that the rule advances medical safety and mischaracterized the burden the requirement places on women seeking safe and legal abortion care in much of the state It wrongly described the limitation as a permissible incidental effect that was not designed to strike at the right itself  In fact striking at abortion rights is the laws whole purpose as anyone who followed the raucous proceeding in the Texas Legislature in June when the law was debated surely knows Abortion rights advocates may ask the United States Supreme Court to stop the enforcement of the hospital affiliation rule while the case moves through the judicial process The justices should be ready to grant their request 
I.O.U.â€™s Give the Democrat an Edge in Virginia,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/us/politics/in-virginia-ious-give-the-democrat-an-edge.html,CHARLOTTESVILLE Va  Their cheeks brushed as they whispered into each others ears Bill Clinton and Terry McAuliffe together again I love Terry McAuliffe and his wife and their kids the former president croaked hoarsely last week explaining why he was on this threeday ninecity swing through Virginia on behalf of Mr McAuliffe the Democratic candidate for governor Theyve been great friends to Hillary and to Chelsea and to me for a very long time  After many years as Mr Clintons chief fundraiser and then as the chairman of the Democratic National Committee Mr McAuliffe has amassed one of the largest favor banks in American politics And now as he reaches for elected office himself Democrats are returning the favors with endorsements strategic advice and of course an avalanche of money  It was all part of the family if you will said Jennifer M Granholm a former governor of Michigan who came to Virginia to campaign with Mr McAuliffe recently Hes been very good to all of us Armed with a much larger war chest Mr McAuliffe has battered his opponent Attorney General Kenneth T Cuccinelli II with a barrage of negative ads and has put himself in a position that would have surprised many Democrats just a year ago ahead in the polls just two days from the election  To close the gap Mr Cuccinelli was ending his campaign with a whirlwind of events campaigning alongside a roster of Republican governors and presidential hopefuls Mr McAuliffe meanwhile was keeping a low profile in preparation for an event on Sunday with President Obama Mr McAuliffe has gained frontrunner status despite having to answer ethical questions arising from decades in politics and business  as old as his 1994 innovation of offering major campaign donors access to the president which evolved into overnights in the Lincoln Bedroom and as new as a federal investigation this year into whether he used political ties to benefit his troubled electric car company Mr Cuccinelli calls him Tricky Terry wherever he goes but so far the label has not quite stuck But Mr McAuliffe also seems to have learned from his first run for governor of Virginia in 2009 when he was tagged as a carpetbagger and lost in the Democratic primary In the years since he has applied his famously effective scratchmyback skills to the states Democratic hierarchy which rewarded him by preventing a primary challenge this year  Hes been the highlight of fundraisers hundreds of them all over the state in the last four years said Richard Saslaw the Democratic leader in the State Senate As a political moneyman Mr McAuliffe was known for a Barnumlike exuberance with Al Gore once lightly mocking him as the greatest fundraiser in the history of the universe This year he has far outdone his rival His campaign has collected 344 million compared with Mr Cuccinellis 197 million according to the nonpartisan Virginia Public Access Project  Mr McAuliffes list of top donors is a roll call of former business partners and politicians he has helped elect The top tier of Clinton associates Fred Eychaner a Chicago media mogul Douglas J Band a longtime adviser to Mr Clinton Ron Burkle a Los Angeles billionaire has poured hundreds of thousands of dollars into Mr McAuliffes campaign exploiting Virginias nolimits contributions policy The lobbying firm founded by Richard A Gephardt a former House majority leader for whom Mr McAuliffe toiled during the 1988 presidential campaign kicked in 25000 Labor unions have also stepped up contributing a total of 25 millionÂ to Mr McAuliffes campaign during the election cycle But his largest individual contributor is Sean Parker a billionaire and early Facebook investor who was introduced to Mr McAuliffe by another Virginia politician just this year and quickly became a donor writing a 500000 check to his campaign  Jerry Lundergan a former chairman of the Kentucky Democratic Party recalled that when the organization was left for dead in 2005 Mr McAuliffe sent a check for 150000 from the Democratic National Committee This year Mr Lundergan gave Mr McAuliffe 100000 I believe in Terry McAuliffe he said  Campaigning Mr McAuliffe has largely buried the goofily exuberant side of his personality which once led him to wrestle an alligator for a party donation In search of a sober image he visited all 23 of Virginias community colleges where he could be found talking with a handful of professors and students about clean energy jobs and studiously taking notes  Mr McAuliffe has found himself well positioned to exploit the growing split between Tea Party conservatives and the Republican Partys business wing A number of Virginia business leaders some prominent Republicans among them have abandoned Mr Cuccinelli to back Mr McAuliffe arguing that he would be more effective at creating a positive business climate in the state In an onslaught of negative campaigning Mr McAuliffe is ahead According to Kantar MediaCMAG a company that tracks advertising 72 percent of the ads supporting Mr McAuliffe attack Mr Cuccinelli primarily as being out of the mainstream on abortion gay rights and climate science Mr Cuccinellis unfavorable rating with voters has climbed in the last months of the race with 52 percent of likely voters viewing him negatively up from 41 percent in August according to a Quinnipiac University poll released on Wednesday The same poll showed Mr McAuliffe narrowly ahead of Mr Cuccinelli though his advantage was within the polls margin of sampling error Other polls have given the Democrat a more comfortable lead But both campaigns are doing their best to tune out the polling numbers and turn out supporters on Tuesday Asked how the fundraising imbalance was affecting the race Mr Cuccinelli said in a telephone interview on Friday We all knew very well when Terry McAuliffe got in the race the one thing hes very good at is fundraisingÂ He recited a line from Mr McAuliffes 2007 memoir What a Party about how raising money for governors was easy because they could offer donors so many goodies I memorized it Mr Cuccinelli saidÂ  Â  After his humiliating defeat in the 2009 Democratic primary Mr McAuliffe sought to ingratiate himself with party officials statewide writing checks from his own fortune for about 140000 to scores of state candidates The amounts were not huge  500 to 15000  but they made an impact  It tells people I care enough to do the little things the important things and to let you know Im watching and I care about what happens to youÂ  said David Marsden a state senator who was a beneficiary When your birthday comes around its just a matter of when hes going to call you Even so early polls last winter showed Mr Cuccinelli leading Mr McAuliffe whom many Democrats viewed as a weak candidate Other contenders heard from supporters that they should get in the race One was Tom Perriello a former congressman and a progressive star among Democrats  Several Virginia Democrats said friends of Mr McAuliffe helped persuade Mr Perriello not to run in a primary against him One longtime Democrat who declined to be identified while talking about private discussions said it was made clear to Mr Perriello that Mr McAuliffe would have the strong backing of the Clintons Mr Perriello considered running but passed  Mr McAuliffes relationship with the Clintons is far more intimate than those typical of political moneymen He shared cigars with Mr Clinton on the Truman Balcony of the White House and played cards late at night with the president Both families vacationed together So it was no surprise that Mr and Mrs Clinton showed up as Mr McAuliffes closers  Mrs Clinton made her first public return to the political stage since stepping down as secretary of state to endorse Mr McAuliffe at a rally in the Northern Virginia suburbs Terry has always been there for me and I am pleased to be here for him she told the crowd She may well expect him to be there for her again as governor if she runs for president in 2016  The Cuccinelli campaign is pulling out all stops to prevent that The Republican has mustered a brigade of his own surrogates in the final getoutthe vote push They include Gov Scott Walker of Wisconsin Senator Marco Rubio of Florida and former Representative Ron Paul  All are Tea Party favorites who should motivate Mr Cuccinellis base to turn out in the offyear election when voters tend to be older and whiter than the coalition that again put Virginia in Mr Obamas column last year It is a trend that favors Mr Cuccinelli and it may be his best hope against Mr McAuliffe  Mr Cuccinelli is also hoping that the appearance of the ultimate Democratic surrogate Mr Obama with Mr McAuliffe on Sunday will bring attention to what he has tried to make the chief issue in the final days the disastrous debut of the federal health insurance marketplace We are perfectly happy to have that debate because we believe Obamacare is bad for Virginians Mr Cuccinelli said It shouldnt be expanded and this is clearly what is on the ballot this Tuesday 
G.O.P. Pursues Hispanic Votes With Abortion Stance,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/us/gop-pursues-hispanic-votes-with-abortion-stance.html,Following this summers divisive abortion debate in the State Legislature Texas Republicans see an opening for the 2014 election as they work to reach out to Hispanic voters who could be spurred to the polls by the partys antiabortion stance But Democrats see the plan as a losing proposition for Republicans arguing that the reputation of most Hispanics as socially conservative is inaccurate and that Hispanics tend to side with Democrats on the issues that matter most to them As Texas demographics continue to shift it is easy to see why both sides covet the Hispanic vote The states population is 38 percent Hispanic Although less than onethird of eligible voters in Texas today are Hispanic according to the Pew Hispanic Center Hispanics are expected to make up a plurality of the population by 2020 Enrique Marquez a Republican political consultant said that when it come to the question of abortion Democratic organizations and candidates in Texas were completely out of sync with Hispanics who are predominantly Roman Catholic Mr Marquez added that if Texas Republicans discussed their antiabortion views and religious beliefs while still placing a priority on the economy they could have a winning formula in 2014 Family values is a very powerful issue among the Hispanic electorate but jobs still remain the top concern he said The Republican National Committee recently announced its own efforts to connect with the states Hispanic electorate by creating targeted outreach teams to knock on doors and educate voters on the partys stances on several issues including abortion But if abortion is a crucial part of such efforts Republicans will find the strategy an exercise in futility said State Representative Mary Gonzlez a Democrat from Clint This is one of those issues where stereotypes are problematic she said referring to the assumption that Hispanics oppose abortion But Ms Gonzlez acknowledged that many Hispanics supported the Democratic Party on issues like immigration education and health care not necessarily because of most Democrats support for abortion rights If Republican efforts to reach Hispanics during the 2014 campaign do put a focus on abortion they will be breaking new ground Politicking on that issue has so far been uncommon among Hispanics Culturally Hispanics see abortion as largely a private matter and there is not a formidable group of political activists in the Rio Grande Valley who are outspoken about abortion rights according to Kathryn Hearn the community services director at the Planned Parenthood Association of Hidalgo County Planned Parenthood clinics in South Texas serve a predominantly Hispanic population and do not perform abortions There are two abortion facilities operated by other providers in McAllen and Harlingen that serve residents in South Texas Patients sometimes struggle to discuss abortion and commonly use euphemisms to talk about the procedure even when talking to clinicians Ms Hearn said When it comes to our patients and this community this is not a soundbite issue Ms Hearn said Its so personal that sometimes even after someone has had an abortion its sometimes difficult for them to tell us Amber Salinas a community organizer for the Texas Organizing Project a grassroots political advocacy group in the Rio Grande Valley said abortion was not a mobilizing issue in the region For the people here there are so many other things that impact them more on a daily basis  living paycheck to paycheck and being able to put shoes on their kids Ms Salinas said According to a June poll by the University of Texas and The Texas Tribune 60 percent of Hispanics in Texas said they supported a ban on abortions after 20 weeks such a ban was passed this summer and 49 percent said abortion laws were strict enough or should be made less strict The University of Texas at Austin is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune Of the 58 percent of Hispanic respondents who identify as Democrats most said they identified with without strictly holding uniformly Democratic attitudes Some Republicans say that is an important point to remember as the party plans strategies for the 2014 election If you listen to talk radio and the pundits in many instances those who speak the loudest for the Republican Party are offensive to the Hispanic community said State Representative Jason Villalba a Dallas Republican He said the key was engaging with Hispanics individually helping them realize they stand on the same side of several issues with Republicans including abortion and not treating Hispanics as a monolithic voting bloc The abortion issue is sure to come up often in the top 2014 Texas race the faceoff for governor Since announcing his candidacy for governor Attorney General Greg Abbott has repeatedly linked Hispanic ideals on family values to the Republican Partys position against abortion while courting the Hispanic vote On the Democratic side State Senator Wendy Davis whose 11hour filibuster of an omnibus abortion bill propelled her and the issue onto the national stage this year has mostly avoided the subject since declaring her candidacy Democrats have largely painted the abortion battle as a Republican war on women and have expanded the debate into a fight over womens health and access to health care which they hope resonates with Hispanic voters But Mr Abbotts efforts to highlight the differences in beliefs between the Republican and Democratic parties have been matched by rightwing organizations that have aired bilingual radio spots in South Texas that paint Ms Davis as an abortion zealot who is backed by extremist groups Wendy Davis puts lateterm abortion ahead of our faith our families and Texas values the script of one ad read The debate could prove harmful for Republicans Following a court ruling to lift an injunction on restrictions set in place by the abortion law the only two abortion clinics in South Texas discontinued abortion services Friday But the Hispanic community is not a singleissue voting group and immigration and education continue to be among their top concerns  two issues that Republicans do not usually spin positively according to Calvin C Jillson a political scientist at Southern Methodist University Republicans dont have much to offer them on those two issues so they push limits on abortion knowing that Hispanics are more conservative than most Democrats on that issue he said Until Republicans connect with voters on immigration and education policy Mr Jillson says they will not improve their share of the Hispanic vote despite promoting their antiabortion platform
Names Invoked on the Stump May Shift Votes,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/03/us/names-invoked-on-the-stump-may-shift-votes.html,Ross Ramsey the executive editor of The Texas Tribune writes a column for The Tribune Barack Obama and Ted Cruz arent running for Texas governor in 2014 But the candidates who are running are invoking Mr Obamas and Mr Cruzs names in ways that could raise some longdormant tendencies of Texas voters Theres the tendency of voters to recoil from candidates who run too far left or right during a primary to remain attractive in a general election And the inclination of voters to reject candidates who cant assemble a primary election victory with different factions within the same party This kind of thinking makes little difference in races that do not feature serious Democratic candidates The bigtime candidates for lieutenant governor and attorney general are all Republicans so far They can bash the president and the Democrats all they want run as far to the right as they deem necessary and never check their rearview mirrors for trouble from behind For them winning the Republican primary is tantamount to election Unless the Democrats show up Republican candidates will not have to return to a political position that is attractive to moderate Republicans and swing voters And the president is in the first or second paragraph of many of their speeches and fundraising letters serving as the unpopular foil for a conservative audience that does not like Democrats or the federal government Democratic candidates are sprinkled among the contestants in downballot statewide races but the challenge for them and for their Republican opponents alike is ginning up sufficient interest to make any impression at all Running in the shadows is not the same as running in the spotlight candidates in shadow races have to rely on famous names party affiliation or rivals bloopers At the top it is a bit more like a twoparty state Maybe the Republicans are right and Texas is still firmly theirs to lead But the Democrats are arguing with that and sooner or later they will win an election So the Republican nominee for governor  Tom Pauken Greg Abbott or someone else  will have to execute a strategy familiar to candidates who ran in twoparty Texas a couple of decades ago Step 1 is to prevail in a primary dominated by very conservative voters Step 2 is to win a general election where independent voters and others who did not vote in the primary are needed Simple unless Step 1 takes the candidate past the comfort level of those general election voters Think of George McGovern too far left or Barry Goldwater too far right So here comes Wendy Davis talking about Mr Cruz and his role in the government shutdown I think he demonstrated that being the loudest person in the room isnt necessarily equivalent to being a leader she said recently A spokeswoman for Mr Cruz shot back saying his long talk against federal health care was more laudable than Ms Daviss filibuster against an abortion bill So Mr Cruz used to work for Mr Abbott Ms Davis intentionally or not is putting that link together for voters a year before the general election It wont make a difference probably with the primary voters who picked Mr Cruz for the United States Senate 15 months ago but it might make a difference with independents Between now and then Mr Abbott has to navigate a primary in which he has most of the advantages He can thank his protg for his wariness about Mr Pauken Mr Cruz was supposed to be a pushover too and look how that came out Unlike the other Republicans in other races the attorney general has to keep an eye on his own rearview mirror just to make sure the Democrat from Fort Worth isnt gaining on him Right now in Texas the federal government is unpopular Congress is unpopular the president is unpopular with Republicans Mr Cruz and Ms Davis are both riding waves of favorable news coverage and the health care rollout has made everyone forget how mad they were about the federal shutdown That scorecard is sure to change over the next year if not before the primaries The candidates will still be trying to tar each other with unpopular associations Ms Davis might be running from Mr Obama Mr Abbott  if its Mr Abbott  might be shunning Mr Cruz Thats how youll know the birdsofafeather thing is working
Justices Decline an Appeal on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/us/justices-decide-not-to-hear-oklahoma-abortion-case.html,WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court decided on Monday not to hear an appeal from a decision striking down an Oklahoma abortion law after all dismissing as improvidently granted a case it had agreed to consider in June The move followed an Oklahoma Supreme Court ruling last week that the law enacted in 2011 violated the Constitution by effectively banning all medicinal nonsurgical abortions The ruling came in response to questions from the United States Supreme Court seeking clarification of the scope of the law The Oklahoma Supreme Courts broad answer apparently made the case Cline v Oklahoma Coalition for Reproductive Justice No 121094 less attractive to the justices who had voted to hear it and who probably wanted to consider only the narrower issue of whether states may require adherence to the protocol from the Food and Drug Administration for an abortioninducing drug Other cases presenting versions of that narrower question including one concerning a Texas law may soon reach the court Also on Monday several clinics that offer abortions filed an emergency application asking the court to block another part of the Texas law this one requiring doctors who provide abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital Allowing the law to stand the clinics said would require onethird of the 36 clinics providing abortions in the state to stop forcing many women to travel several hours to obtain abortions This forced cessation of services and reduction in capacity will prevent each year approximately 20000 Texas women who would have otherwise had an abortion from accessing this constitutionally protected health care service the application filed Monday said The application was addressed to Justice Antonin Scalia the member of the court assigned to handle emergency matters from federal courts in Texas He instructed state officials to file a response by Nov 12 The Oklahoma case concerned a 2000 protocol from the FDA which approved the use of mifepristone sometimes called RU486 in combination with a second drug to induce abortions The Oklahoma law at issue in the case dismissed on Monday restricted the use of abortioninducing drugs to that protocol In December the State Supreme Court struck down the law in a brief and cryptic decision Even as the United States Supreme Court agreed in June to hear the states appeal it asked for clarification from the State Supreme Court about whether the law merely required adherence to the FDAapproved protocol for mifepristone or did more The State Supreme Court on Tuesday gave the broader answer saying the law effectively bans all medication abortions It rested its decision in large part on language in the state law that it said applied not just to mifepristone but also to a second drug used in combination with it misoprostol The court explained in an unsigned decision that new research since 2000 had refined the proper use of mifepristone calling for a lower dose fewer visits to clinics and use later in the pregnancy Ninetysix percent of medication abortions in the United States are now provided according to a regimen different from the one described in mifepristones FDAapproved label the court said

The Texas Abortion Emergency,https://takingnote.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/04/the-texas-abortion-emergency/,"Outside the chambers of federal appellate judges Priscilla Owen Jennifer Elrod and Catharina Haynes virtually everyone understands that HB 2 the new Texas law that places various restrictions                                        on a womans ability to obtain an abortion is not about protecting womens health  its about stopping abortion And yet on Friday those three judges who sit on the US Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans ruled that the law could go into effect
                                        since it was not designed to strike at the right itself and wasnt invalid simply because it has the incidental effect of making it more difficult or more expensive to procure an

                                     That ruling led to the immediate closure of onethird of clinics in Texas where abortions are performed  several in rural areas that serve women without the means to travel hundreds of miles to another clinic
                                         On Monday morning Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia allowed the charade to continue for at least another week when he declined to grant an emergency request by the laws challengers                                        to stay the appeals courts ruling and ordered the state to file a response by Nov 12 Justice Scalia hears all emergencystay applications out of the Fifth Circuit The law requires among other things a doctor to have admitting privileges at a hospital no more than 30 miles from where he or she performs abortions On Oct 28 US District judge Lee Yeakel ruled that this provision                                        was without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus The state appealed immediately and on Friday the Fifth Circuit panel issued its stay of Judge Yeakels ruling But no matter what the panel says the law is intended precisely to strike at the right itself  only dishonest politicians pretend otherwise Making it harder for women to get an abortion is

A Plea for Catholic Schools to Ignore New Guidelines,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/05/education/a-plea-for-catholic-schools-to-ignore-new-guidelines.html,A group of Roman Catholic scholars has called on Catholic schools to ignore the new educational standards known as the Common Core a set of guidelines on what students should know and be able to do from kindergarten through 12th grade opening a front with parallels to the fight over using the guidelines in public schools In a letter to the nations bishops last month the group including more than 100 professors and university administrators argued that the Common Core would actually lower standards that it would move parochial schools away from their grounding in the church and that its emphasis on increased nonfiction reading across many subjects would translate into less focus on literary and philosophical classics and moral teaching  With more than half of the nations dioceses saying that their schools will adopt curriculum informed by the Common Core the critics asked bishops to repudiate the guidelines The letter written by Gerard V Bradley a law professor at the University of Notre Dame said that in the Common Core reading would be strictly utilitarian rather than explore the creativity of man the great lessons of life tragedy love good and evil the rich textures of history that underlie great works of fiction and the tales of selfsacrifice and mercy in the works of the great writers that have shaped our cultural literacy over the centuries But some leaders in Catholic elementary and secondary education say the criticism reflects basic misconceptions that the Catholic schools are bound by the Common Core rather than merely guided by it and that it sets a ceiling on standards as well as a floor We see the Common Core as a minimum just as weve seen other state standards in the past as a minimum and we intend to go way beyond that said Sister John Mary Fleming the executive director for Catholic Education at United States Conference of Catholic Bishops The letter arrived as the bishops conference prepared for its annual assembly to be held next week in Baltimore The letters signatories include several prominent conservatives Mr Bradley is affiliated with conservative policy groups including the Heritage Foundation and the Hoover Institution and he has written extensively on politically charged issues like samesex marriage and abortion Sister M Paul McCaughey the superintendent of schools for the Chicago archdiocese said she did not believe the Common Core would lower standards but understood the concern about the classics getting less attention especially in schools with few resources I think we have to be very careful about that she said But in the Catholic system we will never lose Shakespeare or Huck Finn or Thomas Aquinas Its not an eitheror The Common Core standards were written by a panel of experts convened by a bipartisan group of governors and superintendents to emphasize critical thinking over memorization to better prepare students for college and jobs and to ensure that students in all states meet similar standards It lays out broad standards for achievement  and testing to measure it  but gives each state leeway in deciding how to meet those The standards were first introduced in 2010 Fortyfive states and the District of Columbia have adopted the Common Core standards in math and English for use in public schools though most have not yet fully implemented them Minnesota has endorsed only the English standards and Alaska Nebraska Texas and Virginia have accepted none But the standards have come under attack primarily from conservatives who call them a nationalization of what had been statelevel decision making Indiana has suspended implementation conservatives have introduced repeal legislation in other states and Georgia and Oklahoma have withdrawn from a consortium developing tests based on the standards Last spring the Republican National Committee passed a resolution criticizing the Common Core Some on the left have also raised objections arguing against increased emphasis on standardized testing and questioning whether students or teachers were adequately prepared for the changes Those critics gained new ammunition this year when New York first gave standardized tests based on the Common Core and students fared much worse than on the previous tests
Court Ruling on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/opinion/court-ruling-on-abortion.html,To the Editor Re In Reversal Court Allows Texas Law on Abortion news article Nov 1 My medical colleagues and I quickly moved from elation to anger when the courts in Texas first struck down and then again mandated hospital admitting privileges for doctors who provide abortion care Restrictions requiring doctors in clinics to seek hospital admitting privileges are medically unnecessary and do nothing to improve health and safety for women Worse these restrictions cause harm when they force safe clinics to close Women who had appointments are being turned away from clinics that could care for them but now cannot because of a ruling that makes no medical sense The Texas courts did women further harm by prohibiting doctors from providing medication abortions using the most uptodate protocol based on a decade of sound research Instead of offering what we know to be the best care doctors are forced by politics to use an outdated approach Both rulings deny women care they need It is unsound medicine undermines doctors training and puts womens wellbeing second to political interference ANNE DAVIS New York Nov 1 2013   The writer is consulting medical director for Physicians for Reproductive Health
Chris Christie Coasts to 2nd Term as Governor of New Jersey,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/nyregion/chris-christie-re-elected-governor-of-new-jersey.html,Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey won reelection by a crushing margin on Tuesday a victory that vaulted him to the front ranks of Republican presidential contenders and made him his partys foremost proponent of pragmatism over ideology Mr Christie declared that his decisive win should be a lesson for the nations broken political system and his feuding party In a state where Democrats outnumber Republicans by over 700000 Mr Christie won a majority of the votes of women and Hispanics and made impressive inroads among younger voters and blacks  groups that Republicans nationally have struggled to attract  The governor prevailed despite holding positions contrary to those of many New Jersey voters on several key issues including samesex marriage abortion rights and the minimum wage and despite an economic recovery that has trailed the rest of the country  He attracted a broad coalition by campaigning as a straighttalking even swaggering leader who could reach across the aisle to solve problems I know that if we can do this in Trenton NJ then maybe the folks in Washington DC should tune in their TVs right now and see how its done Mr Christie told a packed crowd at Convention Hall in Asbury Park where his musical idol Bruce Springsteen holds holiday concerts and where red and blue lighting gave the gathering a presidential campaignlike glow  The governor all but lectured Republicans about how to appeal to groups beyond their base We dont just show up in the places where were comfortable we show up in the places were uncomfortable he said adding You dont just show up 6 months before an election Around the country Republicans alarmed by the surging grass roots support for the Tea Party wing were cheered by Mr Christies success saying they hope their party will learn not only from the size of Mr Christies margin over Barbara Buono a Democratic state senator but also from the makeup of his support  Well be led back by our governors and Chris Christie is now at the forefront of that resurgence said Ed Gillespie a former chairman of the Republican National Committee  Hes proved that a conservative Republican can get votes from Hispanics and AfricanAmericans that a prolife governor can get votes from women This means that those voters are available to us that were not shut out demographically or geographically  that its worth the effort Mr Christies strategy of bipartisanship and outreach deliberately echoed that of another Republican governor who seized the White House after eight years of Democratic control George W Bush  We work together and they dont Mr Christie said in an interview on Tuesday morning contrasting Trenton and Washington Its not like we like each other any more than they do I got plenty of Democrats I dont like here and that dont like me But weve made the decision that were going to work together In the interview Mr Christie said intelligent voices were being drowned out in Washington and described the effort led by Senator Ted Cruz of Texas to cut off funding for President Obamas health care program as a monumental failure The swell of national attention around Mr Christie had grown in the runup to Election Day as network cameras filmed his every move  he had a CNN microphone clipped to his tie as he campaigned on Tuesday morning at the Peterpank Diner in Central New Jersey His campaign bus had been swarmed by people seeking autographs on photos of the governor at the White House on the cover of Time magazine and even with his wife Mary Pat on their wedding day Some clearly hoped to offer the souvenirs later for sale Mr Christies national profile will only increase later this month as he assumes leadership of the Republican Governors Association which gives him sway over which state candidates the party will support allowing him to rack up favors with other Republicans and create relationships with local leaders in key presidential states In the interview Mr Christie said he would be appearing frequently in places like Ohio and Michigan and Florida all states with incumbent Republican governors up for reelection next year He has also told South Carolina Republicans that he wants to help Senator Lindsey Graham who is facing a conservative primary challenge next year And in New Hampshire which has the countrys first presidential primary the national committeeman Stephen Duprey said he was inviting Mr Christie to the state to discuss policy and to raise money for the party  Still Mr Christie has to be governor of New Jersey and that may complicate his plans to run for the presidency He has benefited in his first term from having one of the most powerful governorships in the country But in a campaign for the presidency that power also puts him in conflict with rules forbidding him to raise money from Wall Street His advisers think he could get around that rule by allowing independent political groups to raise the money But he will also face challenges in running the state  His signature accomplishment of his first term was working with Democrats who have majorities in both houses of the State Legislature to commit to a schedule to pay down pension costs In his second term he will have to actually make the payments which balloon over the next three years Numerous commissions reports and ratings agencies have warned that he may be unable to do this without raising taxes or making deep cuts His inyourface style has won over New Jersey so far but not everyone is at ease with it Over the weekend Mr Christie was caught on camera wagging his finger at a teacher who challenged his cuts to classrooms a moment reminiscent of the presidential campaign of 2012 when Mitt Romneys advisers were alarmed by a video of Mr Christie shaking an ice cream cone at a critic he encountered on the Jersey Shore I am who I am and thats why people react to me differently Mr Christie said in the interview Im not going to be giving these soundbitetype of answers Mr Christies gains among black and Hispanic voters at the polls are the result of an aggressive yearslong effort He has held more than 100 town hallstyle meetings including several in predominantly black areas that he lost in 2009  For example he won over Michael Blunt a black Democrat and mayor of Chesilhurst a largely black borough in South Jersey with relentless wooing Mr Blunt who recalled how Mr Christie held a town hall in his community steered more municipal aid to it and invited him to a Juneteenth celebration marking the end of slavery at the State House impressing him with his knowledge of the holiday And the governor invited black elected officials to Drumthwacket the governors mansion near Princeton and told them how a black friend in college took him to a historically black campus to demonstrate how it felt to be in the minority If a person has no problem going in enemy territory to explain his policies that person we really need to look at said Mr Blunt who was a delegate for Mr Obama last year  Mr Christie nominated a Hispanic justice to the State Supreme Court and in recent weeks he told Hispanic students that he might reverse himself to support allowing students who were brought to the United States as children to pay instate tuition at the states colleges and universities He ended his final campaign swing with a rally in Union City which has the highest Hispanic population in the state He also spent his last day campaigning with Susana Martinez of New Mexico the first Hispanic woman to be elected a governor Exit polls showed that those strategies paid off Exit polling conducted by Edison Research showed that Mr Christie won the Hispanic vote and won over a significantly higher proportion of black voters than in 2009  Mr Christie increased his margin to win among women despite running against two women Ms Buono and her candidate for lieutenant governor Milly Silva His running mate also is a woman Lt Gov Kim Guadagno Unlike some ambitious politicians Mr Christie who is 51 has not been coy about his interest in higher office and New Jersey residents seem comfortable with it One man proclaimed to the governor on Tuesday morning that the next time they shook hands it will be Mr President A woman was even blunter as the governor passed her at the diner We need a Jersey attitude in the White House said Irene Fulton a retiree from Old Bridge who added We dont put up with any crap During the governors victory speech at Convention Hall an audience member screamed out Chris Christie for president setting off cheers The governor deadpanned I guess there is an open bar tonight  welcome to New Jersey
"Terry McAuliffe, Democrat, Is Elected Governor of Virginia in Tight Race",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/us/politics/mcauliffe-is-elected-governor-in-virginia.html,TYSONS CORNER Va  Terry McAuliffe a longtime Democratic fundraiser and ally of Bill and Hillary Rodham Clinton was elected governor of Virginia on Tuesday narrowly defeating the states conservative attorney general Kenneth T Cuccinelli II and confirming Virginias evolution as a state increasingly dominated politically by the Democraticleaning Washington suburbs  Mr McAuliffe 56 ran as a social liberal and an economic moderate focused on job creation Mr Cuccinelli a Republican who was the first attorney general to sue over President Obamas health care law ran as a hardline social conservative and aimed his campaign almost exclusively at the Tea Party wing of his party  Still despite substantially outraising Mr Cuccinelli 344 million to 197 million Mr McAuliffe won by a margin  just over two percentage points  that was smaller than some preelection polls had suggested  Mr McAuliffe benefited from an electorate that was less white and less Republican than it was four years ago He drew about as large a percentage of AfricanAmericans as Mr Obama did last year Blacks accounted for one in five voters according to exit polls conducted by Edison Research Mr Cuccinellis strong antiabortion views also brought out opponents with 20 percent of voters naming abortion as their top issue Mr McAuliffe overwhelmingly won their support The top issue for voters was the economy cited by 45 percent in exit polls  In a victory speech here Mr McAuliffe thanked the historic number of Republicans who crossed party lines to support me and invoked a tradition of bipartisanship in Richmond the capital In a checklist of recent governors who had moved the economy forward he included the incumbent Bob McDonnell a Republican  Over the next four years most Democrats and Republicans in Virginia want to make Virginia a model for pragmatic leadership that is friendly to job creation Mr McAuliffe said His tone was notably more conciliatory than that of Mr Cuccinelli who struck a defiant note at a rally in Richmond interpreting the closeness of the race to a rejection of Mr Obamas health care law Despite being outspent by an unprecedented 15 million this race came down to the wire because of Obamacare Mr Cuccinelli said adding We were lied to by our own government  That Mr McAuliffe was elected in a onetime Republican stronghold while unapologetically supporting gun restrictions samesex marriage and abortion rights will no doubt be scrutinized by both parties particularly by Republicans concerned about the appeal of the Tea Party in swing states and districts ahead of the 2014 midterm elections And Mr Cuccinellis defeat in a Southern state will no doubt be contrasted with the Republicans great success of the day the dominating reelection of Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey who appeals to swaths of Democrats But the close result after a race in which Mr Cuccinelli was substantially outspent could make it difficult to draw firm conclusions Mr Cuccinelli 45 whose passionate base seemed to give him an early edge in a race between two flawed candidates rattled businessoriented Republicans A surprising roster of the partys establishment  including Will Sessoms the mayor of the largest city Virginia Beach  endorsed Mr McAuliffe  Mr McAuliffes career as a wealthy business investor yielded many unflattering and critics said possibly unethical details But he neutralized the issue by arguing that Mr Cuccinellis social agenda which included hostile comments about homosexuality staunch opposition to abortion and an attempt to discredit a climate scientist at the University of Virginia would give the state a retrograde image that would deter businesses from moving here  A key issue was Mr McAuliffes embrace of a roads bill championed and signed by Mr McDonnell which Mr Cuccinelli opposed because it raised taxes In rapidly growing Northern Virginia snarled traffic is the chief concern of chambers of commerce and Mr McAuliffe was able to portray himself as probusiness and bipartisan  Although a majority of female voters chose Mr McDonnell four years ago Mr Cuccinelli trailed Mr McAuliffe among women by nearly 10 percentage points Nearly seven in 10 unmarried women supported Mr McAuliffe Both Planned Parenthood and the Susan B Anthony List an antiabortion group poured money into the race Abortion rights groups created graphic television ads linking the Republican ticket to a failed state bill in 2012 that would have required vaginal ultrasounds for women seeking abortions  The McAuliffe campaign pounded on Mr Cuccinellis support for failed personhood bills that could have banned some common forms of birth control and for being one of only three attorneys general in the country to oppose the federal Violence Against Women Act Six months ago the race seemed Mr Cuccinellis to lose He was a conservative of impeccable credentials and a national figure because of the lawsuit over the presidents health care law in 2010 Mr McAuliffe had drawn an unserious selfportrait in his 2007 memoir What a Party including a story about leaving his wife Dorothy in the car with their newborn child to duck into a Democratic fundraiser Mr McAuliffes previous bid for governor in 2009 ended in a humiliating defeat in the primary after he was accused of being a carpetbagger His effort to strengthen his business ties to Virginia through an electric car company GreenTech backfired when he set up production in Mississippi and news reports revealed the company was the target of federal investigators  But Mr Cuccinelli was unable to profit from the tarnishing of Mr McAuliffe because the attorney general had his own problem with a political gifts scandal emanating from the governor A benefactor of Mr McDonnells who lavished him and his wife with a Rolex watch and other favors also gave Mr Cuccinelli and his family vacations at a lake home  Mr Cuccinelli secured the Republican nomination in May by packing the state party with his supporters who chose to skip a primary in favor of a nominating convention ensuring a more ideological slate of candidates  In the middle of the federal government shutdown which hit hard in Virginia with its many federal workers and its defense industry Mr Cuccinelli appeared at a family values rally with Senator Ted Cruz of Texas the architect of the shutdown In exit polls about a third of voters said the shutdown had affected someone in their household and most of them voted for Mr McAuliffe Mr Cuccinelli spent the final weeks of the campaign barnstorming with national Tea Party stars He appeared on election eve with the former presidential candidate Ron Paul meant to call home votes from a thirdparty candidate Robert Sarvis a libertarian  Meanwhile with money pouring into Mr McAuliffes campaign thanks to his ties to major donors including supporters of the Clintons he set off an avalanche of negative ads Mr McAuliffe outspent his opponent by nearly 75 percent and beginning in late summer drove up Mr Cuccinellis unfavorable ratings where they remained Mr McAuliffe ran a disciplined campaign touring all 23 community colleges in the state to highlight work force development and keeping his message tightly on job creation  In the last week Mr Cuccinelli seized the chance to pivot to the disastrous debut of the federal health insurance marketplace The issue may have narrowed Mr McAuliffes victory margin but in the end it was not enough  Mr McAuliffe broke a 36year pattern in which Virginias governor picked the year after the presidential election came from the party out of power in the White House The political scientist who first remarked on the trend Larry J Sabato of the University of Virginia ascribed it to a natural tendency toward buyers remorse But this year as unpopular as Mr Obama and his health care law may be with many Virginians dislike of Cuccinelli is even stronger Mr Sabato said 
Two New York Counties Re-elect G.O.P. Executives,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/06/nyregion/two-wealthy-new-york-counties-re-elect-gop-executives.html,Two of the wealthiest counties in the nation both with voters worried about property tax increases decided in Tuesdays elections to stick with Republican county executives who held the line on taxes keeping Rob Astorino in Westchester and Edward P Mangano in Nassau With 56 percent of the precincts reporting the Republican incumbent in Westchester Rob Astorino was leading his Democratic challenger Noam Bramson by 53136 votes or 549 percent to 43670 votes or 451 percent Mr Bramson conceded defeat at 1030 In Nassau County with 89 percent of the election districts reporting Mr Mangano the incumbent held a lead of 140884 votes or 591 percent to 97344 votes or 409 percent for Thomas R Suozzi a former county executive there Mr Suozzi conceded around 11 pm and told a television interviewer minutes later Their message was better and simpler to understand It was about taxes and they won In a third suburban county Rockland which is facing a 128 million budget deficit Ed Day 62 a Brooklynbred former police detective and Republican county legislator defeated David Fried 34 a locally raised lawyer and former county legislator who has worked as a volunteer campaign aide to Bill Clinton Mr Day will replace C Scott Vanderhoef a Republican who has served as county executive for almost 20 years With just about all of the vote counted Mr Day had 36542 votes or 519 percent to 32311 or 459 percent for Mr Fried Democrats hold a sizable edge in registration in both Westchester and Nassau Counties but in the malaise of the 2009 economy and the Tea Partyinspired revolt against taxes many Democrats stayed home and both Mr Mangano and Mr Astorino edged out victories This time strategists for Mr Suozzi and Mr Bramson were hoping for a heavy turnout that could throw the elections to their candidates Were pleased with what we see Michael Florio a spokesman for the Suozzi campaign said late Tuesday afternoon The turnout looks to be better than in 09 If the vote comes in at the 250000 range its difficult for Suozzi Anything around 270000280000 looks better for him The fact that Mr Mangano a 51yearold lawyer with a Long Island accent refused to distance himself from Tea Party positions on abortion immigration and gun control were expected by Suozzi forces to stimulate more voting by Jewish AfricanAmerican and Hispanic Democrats and independents Gun control was a surprisingly resonant issue in Westchester where Mr Bramson 43 the Harvardeducated mayor of New Rochelle hammered home Mr Astorinos resumption of gun shows at the county cultural center after a 10year hiatus That struck a nerve with voters like Mady Edelstein a retired lawyer as she cast her ballot at the Chatsworth Avenue School in Larchmont Bringing gun shows to the county center is deplorable she said You pick up the paper every day and someone mentally disturbed or sufficiently angry is picking up a gun and has the capacity to wreak havoc But Mr Astorino a 46yearold former radio host resisted that depiction projecting himself as a pragmatic Republican out of step with the national party on many issues He stressed his record in creating jobs while not boosting the countys share of a residents property tax bill I was impressed with Astorino what hes got to say regarding safety and jobs that we need more people who are skilled said Ethan Heller a retired event planner as he voted at the Chatsworth School Key to Mr Astorinos chances was a large turnout in Yonkers where workingclass Democrats have a habit of voting conservatively and supporting Republicans But Barry Caro a spokesman for Mr Bramson said in the afternoon that overall turnout was high which he said bodes well for Mr Bramson In Nassau Mr Suozzi a 51yearold lawyer who was county executive from 2002 to 2009 and who hungered for a rematch after losing to Mr Mangano by 386 votes emphasized what he said was Nassaus decline His message was that it was bad fiscal management by Republicans that had put the county under a stateappointed control board  One of the chief remedies he proposed was to expand the tax base by enlivening downtowns near railroad stations with office buildings and restaurants and shops that would entice young people and keep them from moving to the city He spent much of Tuesday afternoon at Penn Station shaking hands with commuters as they headed home on the Long Island Rail Road Mr Mangano portrayed Mr Suozzi as addicted to tax increases and trumpeted his own record at paring the county work force to 7300 from over 9100 in 2009 while creating more than 15000 privatesector jobs and keeping the countys unemployment rate at a low 58 percent
"Despite Fumbles, Obama Defends Health Care Law",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/us/politics/obama-affordable-care-act-texas.html,DALLAS  President Obama strongly defended his signature health care law on Wednesday in the largest state that has refused to participate as rattled Senate Democrats called for changing or delaying key parts of the new health coverage Against a backdrop of closerthanexpected election results in Virginia that some attributed to opposition to the health law Mr Obama again expressed regret for the troubles at the federal website that have prevented many people from enrolling for insurance But he said the Texas government  by refusing to take federal funds and expand Medicaid eligibility  had left more than a million people uninsured He promised to get problems with the health program fixed  As challenging as this may seem sometimes as frustrating as HealthCaregov may be sometimes we are going to get this done Mr Obama told about 150 volunteers and paid navigators helping in enrollment who had gathered to meet him at Temple EmanuEl here Were on the right side of history The president made his remarks as leaders of both parties carefully examined the results of Tuesdays elections searching for indications of what went wrong and how they could perform better next year In trying to rebuild confidence in the new health care law Mr Obama must also appeal to Democratic officials worried about the poor rollout one year before members of Congress must face voters  The increasing concern of Democrats combined with steady criticism from Republicans over the laws rollout has the White House caught in political crossfire The administration has tried to reassure allies that the flaws will be corrected and that it is reaching out to consumers whose plans are being canceled because they do not meet the new laws requirements  Before flying to Texas Mr Obama and Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr met privately with 16 Democratic senators many in tough reelection bids next year to hear their frustrations Senator Mark Begich Democrat of Alaska and one of next years most embattled incumbents emerged from the meeting to blast the administrations mismanagement Its absolutely unacceptable in this day and age that the administration cant deliver on the promises it made to all Americans because of technical problems with a website he said That the Democratic victory in the Virginia governors race was by a smaller margin than predicted in polls is likely to exacerbate those party tensions According to exit polling conducted by Edison Research 53 percent of voters there opposed the health care law Of those 81 percent voted for the Republican candidate Kenneth T Cuccinelli who lost to Terry McAuliffe 48 percent to 455 percent You have to wonder what would have happened if there was another week of this Obamacare fiasco said Brian Moran a former state legislator and past Democratic Party chairman in Virginia Mr Moran said Democrats would have to embrace changes to the presidents health care law in the months ahead There are political dangers if there are not some changes made he warned Testifying again on Capitol Hill the secretary of health and human services Kathleen Sebelius said she and her colleagues had identified a couple of hundred functional fixes that must be made to HealthCaregov But she turned aside calls for a delay in major provisions of the law despite a flurry of legislative proposals from Democrats Senator Mary Landrieu of Louisiana introduced legislation this week to force insurance companies to reissue the health plans they have been canceling by the thousands Senator Joe Donnelly of Indiana is gathering supporters for a bill to redefine parttime workers under the law On Wednesday Mr Donnelly along with Senate cosponsors Susan Collins Republican of Maine Joe Manchin III Democrat of West Virginia and Lisa Murkowski Republican of Alaska wrote to budget negotiators calling on the bill to be included in a budget plan due by Dec 13 Mr Manchin is drafting his own bill to delay the levying of penalties on individuals who fail to purchase insurance Senator Jeanne Shaheen Democrat of New Hampshire is pressing the White House to extend the insurance enrollment period Even Democrats who have kept largely quiet are beginning to vent Senator Mark Udall Democrat of Colorado left the White House meeting and promptly aired his concerns about the website about the administrations reluctance to extend the enrollment period and about online security and privacy protections I urged the president again to extend the enrollment period to give consumers enough time to make an informed decision about their familys health insurance options Mr Udall said I also told the president that for the Affordable Care Act to succeed consumers need to be confident their personal information is secure We need to do everything in our power to protect the online marketplace from hackers and cyberattacks Republicans relished the Democratic frenzy after both parties have refused to tamper with the law for different reasons  Republicans not wanting to be seen as improving a law they want overturned and Democrats reluctant to open the law to Republican attacks We have here a bunch of shall I say foxhole conversions said Senator Mitch McConnell of Kentucky the Republican leader Whatll be really interesting to see in the Senate is the number of Democrats in red states who are up in 14 and what they start demanding from the majority leader and the administration In the wake of the Virginia election national Democratic Party officials flatly dismissed Republican assertions that the results were close because of the health care law According to the exit poll 27 percent of Virginia voters identified health care as the most important issue in the race and of those Mr Cuccinelli won 49 percent to Mr McAuliffes 45 percent a fairly close margin Far more voters 45 percent said the economy was the top issue and they broke for the Republican by about the same spread By contrast the 20 percent who identified abortion as the most important issue went for Mr McAuliffe by 25 points The health care law is not as toxic as they want people to believe said Mo Elleithee a spokesman for the Democratic National Committee Attitudes toward the Affordable Care Act as the health care law is known have held fairly stable over the past two years with slightly more Americans holding a negative view The latest Kaiser Health Tracking Poll conducted Oct 1723 showed 44 percent of Americans holding an unfavorable view and 38 percent a favorable view  nearly the same numbers as in September before news reports of the troubled rollout of the federal health insurance exchange began Democratic campaign veterans in Virginia said the results should serve as a warning to candidates next year about the staying power of the health care issue One strategist said the health care problems softened up Democrats in the suburban areas and definitely took the wind out of our sails at the end 
Presidential! Season! Soonish!,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/opinion/collins-presidential-season-soonish.html,Chris Christie He won Lets talk about his presidential prospects incessantly for the rest of the month Then we will take a short break for the holiday season Then ring in 2014 which means just two years until Chris Christie goes to the Iowa caucuses Christies sweeping victory in New Jersey was certainly the big story of Tuesdays elections Although I personally think it was interesting that Boston picked a new mayor whos working on his 19th year of sobriety on the same day that the mayor of Toronto admitted he had smoked crack probably in one of my drunken stupors Who knew that Toronto would turn out to be more enthusiastic than Boston when it comes to substance abuse  And lets take a quick look at Virginia where Democrat Terry McAuliffe narrowly defeated Republican Ken Cuccinelli How do you feel about that one people Are you surprised the margin wasnt wider given that Cuccinelli had expressed wildly rightwing views on issues ranging from climate change to abortion leading to a campaign that forced voters to mull their views on global warming sodomy and transvaginal ultrasounds  Or are you amazed that the Democrats won this one at all with a candidate who admitted  practically bragged  that while driving his newborn son home from the hospital he stopped to make a 15minute appearance at a political fundraiser while infant and weeping wife sat in the car I felt bad for Dorothy but it was a million bucks for the Democratic Party McAuliffe said in his autobiography Honestly it was a miracle anybody in Virginia showed up to vote I did like Cuccinellis breakout attack theme All puppy and no plan Lets hope that one resurfaces during the presidential race Which is just around the corner presuming the corner lasts for 26 months Presidential That brings us back to Chris Christie the man of the hour Even though hes a Republican in a deep blue state he won a huge victory against  um the Democrat Who was  named  Barbara Buono Buono was battling odds that made the Alamo look like a quick game of Parcheesi Shes a 20year veteran of the State Legislature a rsum that always inspires excitement among the electorate She had about a quarter of Christies budget for ads Nobody from the Clinton family went to New Jersey to campaign for her Some days it seemed as if nobody from New Jersey was showing up either The Democratic political bosses  made a deal with this governor despite him representing almost everything theyre against They didnt do it for the state They did it to help themselves politically and financially Buono said on election night in a speech that centered on the terribleness of her own state party In a place thats dominated by one political party like New Jersey the electorate often picks somebody from the other side to be governor in hopes that he or she will keep a lid on things Christie is sort of a larger and louder version of New Yorks George Pataki who I believe has been in New Hampshire trying to drum up presidential primary interest since 2006  Christie sees himself as a scrappy guy fighting against impossible odds but hes actually been wildly lucky Politically hes in a perfect position To his left the New Jersey State Legislature and the county bosses To his right the crazy national Republican Party He gets everything in between  The people of New Jersey rewarded me last night for the personal relationship that we have he told a press conference on Wednesday Christie has been suggesting very very frequently that his success is all about personality That certainly makes sense since his major actual achievement as governor was to get everyone to agree on a plan to bail out the public employee pension fund  soon Is he the toughtalking truthteller the nation is yearning for Critics in New Jersey say the governors main administrative talent is for balancing a budget with imaginary revenues But even if Christie was really the candidate he claims to be were not the electorate we imagine we are Who was the last person to get to the White House without a public persona that was smooth and affable Richard Nixon Harry Truman I hear John Adams was kind of prickly  Could Christie survive a presidential race when he couldnt even get past the Mitt Romney vice presidential vetting process Theres all that stuff about exploding expense accounts and his prior career as a lobbyist for the securities industry True the people of New Jersey have looked into his past and come away satisfied But really in New Jersey youre just happy to know a candidate is not currently under indictment We have so much to discuss Thank God weve got 790 more days until the Iowa caucuses

rolls A few days later state Senator Wendy Davis a Democrat who became a national celebrity after her filibuster over a new abortion law had the same problem in early voting So did her likely Republican opponent in next years governors race Attorney General Greg Abbott They were all able to vote after signing affidavits attesting that they were who they claimed to be But not Jim Wright a former speaker of the House in Washington whose expired drivers license meant he could not vote until he went home and dug a certified copy of his birth certificate out of a box On Tuesday Texas unveiled its tough new voter ID law the only state to do so this year and the rollout was sometimes rocky But interviews with opponents and supporters of the new law which required voters for the first time to produce a stateapproved form of photo identification to vote suggest that in many parts of the state the laws first day went better than critics had expected There was a relatively limited number of cases during early voting in which voters with improper IDs were required to submit provisional ballots which will be counted only if the people come back with a valid ID within six days Officials said that statewide 2354 provisional ballots were cast this election which is about 02 percent of voters In the last offyear election in 2011 there were 738 or 01 percent of the ballots cast that year Officials also said that there was little traffic at the offices set up by the state to provide free voter ID documents for those without another approved form of identification By Election Day only 121 voter identification documents had been issued statewide But the laws opponents and some county elections officials warned against judging its effectiveness on the basis of this years relatively minor statewide election The real tests they say will come next year when Texas will elect a new governor and in 2016s presidential race This kind of offyear election draws the more experienced voters who turn up all the time Dana DeBeauvoir the Democratic clerk of Travis County said This is not the more casual voter who turns out for a presidential election Critics also raised concerns that the law might disproportionately affect women because of name changes from marriage or divorce But there were no hard figures on how many women were actually affected versus men  and there were many instances of men who were stopped for the same reason The nonpartisan League of Women Voters of Texas which opposed the new law said that it was concerned more about voters who do not have the proper documentation at all and might stay away from the polls altogether as a result We have always felt there was anywhere from 500000 to 800000 voters who would not be able to present the proper identification Linda Krefting the groups president said The concern we have is that all this flap in the news may have discouraged people from turning out at the polls Republican leaders who had pushed for the new law said that for an offyear election which included several mayors races and statewide constitutional proposals voting was robust Election officials said Wednesday that 1144844 people had voted compared with 690052 in 2011 the previous such offyear election This was our first statewide election with a photo ID requirement in place and it was smooth secure and successful Secretary of State John Steen said Wednesday in a statement Voter ID laws and other statutes that cut back on early voting or make it more difficult to register have proliferated in states dominated by Republicans since the partys wave of governor and statehouse victories in 2010 Proponents say they are needed to curtail voter fraud Opponents point out that such fraud is extremely rare and say the laws actually target groups that have proven less likely to have the statemandated identification the poor students AfricanAmericans and Hispanics all of whom tend to vote more Democratic Under the new Texas law the list of acceptable identification includes a drivers license a passport a military ID and a concealed gun permit but not a student photo ID Voters who showed up at the polls with no acceptable IDs were allowed to cast provisional ballots Voters whose names were significantly similar on their IDs and the official voter rolls could sign an affidavit which involved checking a box next to their name then were allowed to vote normally More than 30 states have passed laws with varying degrees of strictness that either require or request that voters produce some form of identification But there have been recent signs of a backlash The Brennan Center for Justice said 10 states passed 13 bills to expand voting compared with eight states that passed nine restrictive bills this year
Virginia G.O.P. Assesses Loss to Rival It Saw as Weak ,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/us/politics/virginia-gop-asks-why-it-lost-to-rival-deemed-weak.html,WASHINGTON  Republicans in Virginia awoke Wednesday with the knowledge that a bad streak had been extended With the election of a Democratic governor Terry McAuliffe Republicans have lost seven of the past eight statewide topoftheballot races including those for governor senator and president  a run of misery dating to 2005  While Mr McAuliffe called for a spirit of bipartisanship in his first news conference as governorelect Republicans who viewed him as a flawed beatable candidate were engaging in recriminations about how the party had gone wrong by nominating an outspoken social conservative Kenneth T Cuccinelli II At the Republican Partys election night gathering in Richmond the state party chairman Pat Mullins told the crowd that Mr Cuccinellis loss by less than three percentage points narrower than many polls had predicted occurred mainly because he had been outspent two to one Republicans reelected to their supermajority in the House of Delegates Mr Mullins added will block any crazy ideas the new governor may have  But for the partys moderate wing the loss of what it considered a winnable race was a lesson in how a candidate known mainly for promoting conservative social policies could not appeal in a state whose population is increasingly diverse  McAuliffe was probably the weakest Democratic nominee in a generation said Tom Davis a former Republican congressman from Northern Virginia noting that the Democrat had never held elective office and had made business investments that drew government scrutiny You have to ask yourself maybe we did something wrong  To him the something wrong was nominating a candidate whose calling card was a social conservatism that pushed away mainstream businessoriented Republicans  Lt Gov Bill Bolling a Republican who pointedly withheld his endorsement from Mr Cuccinelli said the party needed to do better at reaching out to a more diverse and moderate population Virginia is changing Mr Bolling said Clearly an issue that hurt us very badly was the issue of abortion We are a prolife party but if were going to be the party of fetal ultrasounds were going to have a problem He was referring to measures the party promoted in the General Assembly that failed and that abortionrights groups seized on in the campaign  Speaking to reporters in the State Capitol in Richmond Mr McAuliffe said his first priority would be prohibiting discrimination across state government based on sexual orientation As attorney general Mr Cuccinelli had written an order to state universities that they could not include sexual orientation in their bans on discrimination  Mr McAuliffe said he would institute a ban on gifts of more than 100 to elected officials a response to a scandal around the sitting governor Bob McDonnell a Republican for accepting hundreds of thousands of dollars in gifts from a political patron The episode cast a shadow over Mr Cuccinellis campaign since he too accepted gifts from the donor  The race for attorney general was unsettled on Wednesday with the candidates in a statistical tie and the race probably headed for a recount which could take weeks State Senator Mark R Herring a Democrat held a 32vote lead out of 22 million ballots cast over State Senator Mark D Obenshain a Republican  Republicans who rejected the calls of moderates that the party needed to rethink its policies after its defeat pointed to the competitiveness of Mr Obenshain whose positions are as conservative as Mr Cuccinellis though he was not the lightning rod that his running mate on top of the ticket became  Even Will Sessoms the Republican mayor of Virginia Beach who crossed party lines to endorse Mr McAuliffe because he thought Mr Cuccinelli was too extreme praised the Obenshain campaign I think the Republican Party can come up with a very positive message he said We do believe in limited government but that means we dont want government in the bedroom For Democrats the great lesson of the night was that they had the ability to reassemble significant parts of President Obamas coalition even when he was not on the ballot Virginia has a history of younger voters and minority voters who provided a surge for the president one year ago dropping away in nonpresidential elections  Turnout on Tuesday by white and older voters did not significantly rise compared with last November The same percentage of AfricanAmericans one in five voters went to the polls according to exit polling conducted by Edison Research They overwhelmingly picked Mr McAuliffe  Voters 18 to 29 years old represented 13 percent of the electorate lower than for the presidential race but not as much of a dropoff as in previous offyear elections said Ashley Bauman a spokeswoman for the Democratic Party of Virginia The fact is the womens health issue reproductive rights issue that continued to come in the Tea Partytype candidates talking points really motivated young women to come out and vote Ms Bauman said  Harry L Wilson a political scientist at Roanoke College said the closeness of the vote in the race for governor narrower than almost all public polls predicted meant both parties could credibly argue they nominated candidates who had the potential to win After a narrow loss you can spin this any way you want he said
G.O.P. Weighs Limiting Clout of Right Wing,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/07/us/politics/gop-weighs-limiting-clout-of-right-wing.html,Leaders of the Republican establishment alarmed by the emergence of farright and often unpredictable Tea Party candidates are pushing their party to rethink how it chooses nominees and advocating changes they say would result in the selection of less extreme contenders The push comes as the national Republican Party is grappling with vexing divisions over its identity and image and mainstream leaders complain that more ideologicallydriven conservatives are damaging the party with tactics like the government shutdown The debate intensified on Wednesday after Kenneth T Cuccinelli II the deeply conservative Republican candidate for governor of Virginia lost a close race in which Democrats highlighted his opposition to abortion in almost all circumstances his views on contraception and comments in which he seemed to liken immigration policy to pest control  The party leaders pushing for changes want to replace state caucuses and conventions like the one that nominated Mr Cuccinelli with a more open primary system that they believe will draw a broader crosssection of Republicans and produce more moderate candidates Similar pushes are already underway in other states including Montana and Utah and last week Mitt Romney said Republicans should consider how to overhaul their presidential nominating process to attract a wider range of voters He suggested that states holding open primaries be rewarded with more delegates to the partys national convention  While the discussion may appear arcane it reflects a fierce struggle for power between the activist often Tea Partydominated wing of the Republican Party  whose members tend to be devoted to showing up and organizing at events like party conventions  and the more mainstream wing which is frustrated by its inability to rein in the extremist elements and by the fact that its message is not resonating with more voters Conventions by nature force candidates and campaigns to focus on a very small group of party activists said Phil Cox executive director of the Republican Governors Association and a longtime Virginiabased strategist He grimaced at the successful movement by conservative activists in his state earlier this year to switch from a primary system to a convention system If the goal is actually to win elections holding more primaries would be a good start With control of the Senate expected to turn on a handful of races around the country next year Republican leaders are worried about the outcome in Iowa where a crowded field of GOP candidates has taken shape including several untested ones If no one receives 35 percent of the primary vote the nominee will be selected by a convention Conventions have a flimsy track record of selecting the most electable candidates David Kochel an Iowabased Republican strategist said in an interview on Wednesday Theres just no good substitute for a fullscale vetting by a large universe of primary voters Nowhere is the debate over how to limit the influence of the partys most hardline activists more intense than in Utah where in 2010 conservatives cheered as the Tea Party toppled one of the veteran Republican centrists in the Senate Bob Bennett The state partys caucus and convention system helped elevate Mike Lee a littleknown lawyer who replaced Mr Bennett  Now Mr Lee is a patriarch of sorts to Tea Party conservatives in Congress Though Senator Ted Cruz of Texas was the public face of the government shutdown fight it was Mr Lee who largely conceived the strategy in an effort to block funding for President Obamas health care law Back home Mr Lee is now at odds with Republican stalwarts like former Gov Mike Leavitt who are leading a campaign for a ballot initiative that would shift the state to a primary system where party conventions have no role in picking candidates and instead all Republicans can participate  If you look at the place where the aggregate heart of the Republican Party is in this state it is not represented by the aggregate of folks who attend conventions  demographically or ideologically Mr Leavitt said in an interview this week The Republican Party in Utah picks its candidates for statewide office like United States Senate at a convention of about 4000 delegates who are chosen at a series of caucuses all over the state Supporters of the current system argue that representation is ample on the front end when thousands of people are involved in selecting convention delegates whom they get to know through the intimacy of local caucuses Candidates for office in turn have to campaign directly to those delegates Efforts to dismantle the convention system they say are elitist and undemocratic You have these politicians who really think theyre above everybody else said Paul T Mero president of the Sutherland Institute a research organization in the state What they want certainly isnt the kind of direct democracy that really requires responsible citizenship They want to get rid of that and move straight to a primary where its all about money and name recognition In Virginia last year Republican leaders switched their system for selecting a nominee for governor from a primary to a convention a decision that all but guaranteed Mr Cuccinellis selection and doomed the more moderate candidate Lt Gov Bill Bolling  Mr Bolling and his allies in the party had persuaded their state board to hold a primary that would be open to all voters Outraged conservatives many of them loyal to the former presidential candidate Ron Paul successfully captured slots on the board and reversed the decision Their maneuver resulted in a slate of farright candidates at the top of the ticket including the lieutenant governor nominee a minister named E W Jackson who has a history of inflammatory remarks such as when he compared Planned Parenthood to the Ku Klux Klan and associated homosexuality with pedophilia  To revert back to a primary system would be difficult but not impossible Republicans in the state said this week especially given the soulsearching that Mr Cuccinellis loss has inspired The convention method is political arsenic pure and simple said Mike Murphy a veteran consultant It incentivizes our candidates to appeal to the base voters they already get for free not the swing voters they need Republican leaders in Montana struggling with how to manage their states farright elements have put an initiative on the ballot that would replace their current primary process with a system that would allow only the top two candidates to move on to the general election regardless of party  Last year Republicans narrowly lost a hardfought Senate race after a former Republican local committeeman ran on the Libertarian ticket and many believe drew votes away from the GOP tipping the race to Senator Jon Tester a Democrat  The goal Republicans said is the same as in Utah and Virginia Art Wittich the majority leader in the State Senate said that if approved the measure would stop fringe candidates You will get I think the most serious and widely embraced philosophy that advances he said

"After a Break, Turkeyâ€™s Prime Minister Again Courts Controversy ",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/world/europe/turkey-coed-dormitories-.html,ISTANBUL  In his time in power more than a decade now Turkeys prime minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan has alienated large portions of the population for his seeming intrusions into private lives He has told women how many children they should have has sought to outlaw abortion and adultery and to limit alcohol consumption and once oddly went on a public tirade against white bread Many Turks who had once supported Mr Erdogans democratic overhauls like securing civilian control over the military came to see such pronouncements as grating and abrasive even evidence of a rising authoritarian style That contributed to the sweeping antigovernment protests over the summer that presented the gravest crisis to the leadership of Mr Erdogan and his Islamistrooted Justice and Development Party known by its Turkish initials AKP Now Mr Erdogan who had largely tempered his divisive language in the months after the unrest has raised a storm of protest saying this week that he wants to outlaw coed dormitories at state universities and even extend the crackdown to offcampus housing shared by male and female students Once again Mr Erdogan with his words has pushed Turkeys culture wars to the fore underscoring deep divisions between the secular and the religious and prompting the sort of controversy many even within his own party had hoped to avoid in the aftermath of the protests and just before Turkey enters an election cycle Invoking his credentials as a conservative and saying that the government receives intelligence about what goes on inside coed housing facilities Mr Erdogan was quoted in the Turkish news media as saying to a weekly meeting of his partys lawmakers Anything can happen Then parents cry out saying Where is the state These steps are being taken in order to show that the state is there As a conservative democratic government we need to intervene On Tuesday political talk shows that normally take on a number of issues devoted much of their broadcasts to the dispute set off by Mr Erdogans comments Some newspaper columnists seemed to relish the topic and the return after the withering of the protest movement of Mr Erdogans words whipping up the cultural currents We are face to face with a prime minister who thinks it is his right to impose his moral sentiment into our homes and control our personal space with his governors and his police wrote Ezgi Basaran a columnist in the leftleaning Radikal In setting off another cultural controversy Mr Erdogan risks reenergizing the emotions of his critics that drove the summers protests But given how divided Turkish society is he could also galvanize his conservative supporters ahead of elections I live in an allgirl dorm its my choice and Im happy about it said Ezgi Kurtal a history student at Bosporus University here But I do not support Erdogans comments What business does a prime minister have in dictating what sex an adult can live with We thought he got the message not to interfere with peoples lives at Gezi she added a reference to the park that was at the center of the summers protests I guess we were wrong The latest controversy comes as Turkey renews longstalled negotiations to join the European Union Its foreign policy effort to influence the Middle East also seems in disarray given its previous support to the ousted Egyptian president Mohamed Morsi and its policy of supporting the rebel opposition in Syria as the international community seeks a diplomatic solution Mr Erdogan emerged from the protests seemingly as powerful as ever domestically  his religiously conservative base which makes up nearly half of the electorate stuck with him  even as Turkeys image abroad was tarnished But the protests also set off debate within the upper reaches of the AKP about the partys direction and the future of Turkish democracy just as the country heads into an election cycle that begins next year with a vote for municipal governments that is seen as a test of Mr Erdogans grassroots support Recent interviews with party officials Western diplomats and outside experts with close ties to the government all of whom spoke anonymously to discuss internal party deliberations suggest sharp divides within the party There is a decided split between those who support Mr Erdogan unconditionally and those who are more moderate who line up behind the more conciliatory president Abdullah Gul and share some of the concerns voiced by the protesters  Those concerns have been highlighted by the furor over the prime ministers comments on coed dormitories and his style Another AKP constituency followers of the Islamic preacher Fethullah Gulen is said to be deeply ambivalent about backing Mr Erdogan in future elections The protests last summer were set off by plans to raze Gezi Park one of the last green spaces in central Istanbul for a mall They grew into a broader rebuke of the government one consequence of which is that an effort pushed by Mr Erdogan to broaden the powers of the presidency seems impossible at least for now But Mr Erdogan is still likely to run for president next year even without the expanded powers That would raise the question of who would secure the more powerful post of prime minister One possibility being discussed within and outside the party is a swap between Mr Gul and Mr Erdogan similar to the one that took place in Russia between Vladimir V Putin and Dmitri A Medvedev But Mr Erdogan hopes to avoid that according to interviews as some polls show that Mr Gul is a more popular figure than Mr Erdogan among the public  The municipal elections especially a muchanticipated mayoral contest in Istanbul are shaping up as a test for Mr Erdogan and his longheld ambition to stay in power another decade until 2023 the 100th anniversary of the modern Turkish republic A strong showing by the AKP could lay the path for an Erdogan presidency and eventually a renewed effort to institute a presidential system analysts say Polarizing the electorate with controversies such as the one about dorms is a wellworn electoral strategy of Mr Erdogan experts say One analyst described the tactic as ripped from the playbook of Karl Rove an adviser to former President George W Bush and the Republican Party Like many of the controversies Mr Erdogan generates this one seemed to be a cultural non sequitur not linked to any current public debate To be honest despite the outspokenness on this matter I really did not understand anything wrote Eyup Can the editor in chief of Radikal Where did this come from If anyone cares to explain please do
Senate Bill on Bias Against Gays Finds Support in Mormons,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/08/us/politics/senate-bill-on-bias-against-gays-finds-support-in-mormons.html,WASHINGTON  At nearly every critical juncture the Senate bill that passed Thursday banning workplace discrimination because of gender identity and sexual orientation has had an unconventional and powerful ally Mormons reflecting shifting attitudes inside their church have stepped in to provide the political muscle the additional momentum or the decisive vote And more often than not they were not just Mormons but Republicans The bill which passed by a vote of 64 to 32 with 10 Republicans joining was a priority of Senator Harry Reid the majority leader who as the Mormon Churchs highestranking member in the government put the nondiscrimination measure at the top of the Senates agenda once the government reopened last month People shouldnt be able to fire them because of their sexual orientation any more than you can fire them if theyre Mormon Mr Reid said Thursday in an interview  Senator Orrin Hatch of Utah who at 79 is one of the Senates longestserving members became the first Republican to signal he would reverse his opposition as the bill faced a crucial vote in committee He voted against a similar bill the last time it came up in the Senate  17 years ago  but changed his mind earlier this year after Gordon H Smith a fellow Mormon and former Republican senator convinced him there was nothing in it that violated church doctrine The church does want to be helpful where we can be without violating our own conscience Mr Smith a former bishop said in an interview  And as the bill approached a vital vote earlier this week Senator Dean Heller the Nevada Republican who has taught Sunday school at his Mormon church provided the crucial 60th vote to break a filibuster In the end all but two of the Senates seven Mormons voted yes Their support for including civil rights protections for gay lesbian bisexual and transgender people is the latest example of a broader evolution by some of the most visible members of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints who have come to cautiously embrace gay rights It is a remarkable turnabout from just five years ago when the church faced a maelstrom of criticism for backing the initiative in California that took away the right of samesex couples to marry Unlike the issue of marriage which the church views as an inviolable doctrine nondiscrimination law has become one subject that Mormons of all political stripes can safely seem to support Indeed the church publicly backed a provision in Salt Lake City in 2009 that extended many of the same workplace protections as the Senate bill It did not however take a public position during the Senate debate The church has also embarked on a public relations campaign to soften the perception that it is homophobic It has even created a website called MormonsandGaysorg which points out that while acting on samesex attraction is a sin With love and understanding the Church reaches out to all Gods children including our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters Mr Heller who voted against a similar nondiscrimination measure in 2007 when he was a member of the House said he was typical of members of his faith who had come around on the issue  Where American families are becoming more inclusive I think the same is true of the LDS faith he said We believe we should treat people with dignity and you saw that on the immigration reform issue as well Its an issue of fairness Success in the Senate guarantees nothing in the House where the measure faces serious Republican resistance Speaker John A Boehner has made no commitment to put it to a vote a prospect that drew criticism from President Obama after the Senate vote on Thursday One party in one house of Congress should not stand in the way of millions of Americans who want to go to work each day and simply be judged by the job they do the president said in hailing the Senate vote Building support among the Senates Mormons had always been part of the strategy for the bills sponsor Senator Jeff Merkley Democrat of Oregon who reached out to the man he beat in 2008  Mr Smith  for help He can speak from a perspective that I might not be able to replicate Mr Merkley said of his former rival When Mr Smith asked how he might help Mr Merkley suggested he reach out to Mr Hatch Of all the Republican senators who came around to supporting the bill Mr Hatch was in some ways the least obvious He is solidly conservative on social issues like abortion and samesex marriage He is one of the oldest members of the Senate But Mr Smith who cosponsored the hate crimes bill named for Matthew Shepard said he appealed to Mr Hatchs constructive conservatism  Shortly before the committee vote in July he said he reminded Mr Hatch about the churchs support for the Salt Lake City initiative and impressed on him that this was an issue of conscience These are positions that I came to as a matter of my own conscience long ago he said  Its just the right thing Mr Hatch said as he walked into the Senate chamber to vote Religion should be respected and so should people More so than his Republican colleagues Mr Reid has distanced himself from some of his churchs attitudes toward homosexuality most notably saying its involvement in the California samesex marriage fight was wrongheaded  But he has not always been so openminded and in 1996 voted for the Defense of Marriage Act  In an interview on Thursday he recalled how he once considered sexual orientation kind of an environmental thing but said he later realized that orientation was not in fact a choice He has a lesbian niece who he said had helped us work our way through the issues He recalled having two neighbors in Nevada he always called the bachelors Thinking of them now he said he realizes they must have been gay Lets assume they got married What difference would it make to me and my family Zero None None Mr Reid said He has already been to two samesex weddings this year including one where he gave a toast to the grooms  Mormons who have seen their own share of bias should be especially sensitive he said I would think that members of the church should understand that one of the things that should be paramount in their minds he said is how theyve been treated
Sunday Dialogue: How the Justices Shape Our Democracy,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/opinion/sunday/sunday-dialogue-how-the-justices-shape-our-democracy.html,Readers discuss how court rulings have changed US politics Â  To the Editor Fifty years of Supreme Court tinkering with our political system has resulted in a democracy so dysfunctional that no rational person would choose it The people through their elected representatives gave us an effective Voting Rights Act to protect minority voters The Supreme Court told us that we dont need it anymore The people gave us a campaign finance law limiting the expansive political power of the rich The Supreme Court told us that unlimited campaign spending by the 1 percent doesnt corrupt the democratic process The people gave us a practical way to allow underfunded candidates to compete with rich ones The Supreme Court told us that it was unfair to the rich The people walled off the vast trove of corporate wealth from our elections The Supreme Court told us that unlimited corporate electioneering was good for us The people drew legislative lines to help racial minorities recover from centuries of political exclusion The Supreme Court told us that it was a dangerous form of racism But when todays politicians entrench themselves in power by putting hurdles in the way of poor people voting gerrymandering district lines to assure the reelection of incumbents and stacking the electoral deck in favor of the majority party the Supreme Court just stands by In the dysfunctional democracy the justices have made the Supreme Court can even pick a president The extreme wings of each major party control the nominating process Poor people have to jump through hoops to vote The party in power controls the outcome in too many legislative elections And the superrich have turned too many of our elected representatives into wholly owned subsidiaries and most of our elections into auctions Madison would weep BURT NEUBORNE New York Nov 4 2013 The writer is a professor of civil liberties at New York University Law School Â  Readers React The people through their elected representatives created schools segregated by race The Supreme Court told us that was unconstitutional The people through their elected representatives created a criminal system in which the accused were not told of their most basic rights The Supreme Court told us that was unconstitutional The people through their elected representatives created laws making consensual sexual conduct in the privacy of the home a crime The Supreme Court told us that was unconstitutional The people through their elected representatives are constantly trying to restrict free speech establish the equivalent of state religion and expand the power of the federal government The Supreme Court tells us that is unconstitutional I could go on A professor of civil liberties knows these things The Supreme Court doesnt always get it right but it usually does The people through their elected representatives can and do crush the minority Thats why we have a Bill of Rights and thats why we have a Supreme Court The people by the way dont always get it right but they usually do eventually Democracy is messy It is supposed to be ZAN BLUE Nashville Nov 6 2013 The writer is a lawyer Â  Professor Neuborne describes this dysfunctional democracy very well but he does not give the real reason for that dysfunction  the reverence for the United States Constitution Each of the Supreme Courts iniquities he lists is based on the interpretation by five of nine high priests of increasingly irrelevant documents written by wealthy white men in an unimaginably different and distant world In my native Britain little time is expended on what Pitt the Younger for example might make of todays funding of campaigns or of abortion and therefore legislation can proceed on the basis of rational examination of modern realities To take but one example the root cause of the United States lunatic gun laws is worship of the Constitution Based on that worship those who believe in irrational doctrines like original intent can influence our lives It is curious how often that intent is found to coincide with the opinions and prejudices of those who believe in it MICHAEL GORMAN Chicago Nov 6 2013 Â  I agree with Professor Neuborne about the sorry state of our democracy but Im not sure I agree with his thesis that the Supreme Court is to blame It is probably more a symptom of the disease than its cause in that the troubled system itself chooses the justices Also sometimes it is a matter of whose ox is being gored Back in the day many complained that the justices were too liberal Roe v Wade various civil rights rulings Now the complaint is that the court is too conservative Difficult issues end up at the Supreme Court because they need to be resolved and the political system the people is too gridlocked to resolve them JAMES McDONALD Cranston RI Nov 6 2013 Â  Perhaps its time to rethink how the Supreme Court is set up What if justices were appointed to serve for a term of six years What if half the justices had to be female to better represent half of the population What if the number of justices were increased With term limits gender equality and more justices there would at least be a better chance of more diversity of thought and opinion and less entrenchment ALANNA FAGAN Milford Conn Nov 6 2013 Â  The whole Supreme Court is not to blame The bad decisions were 5 to 4 and the five in the majority were appointed by Republican presidents STANLEY C SIMON Olympia Wash Nov 6 2013 Â  I wholeheartedly disagree with Professor Neubornes assertion that democracy in America is dysfunctional America itself is downright dysfunctional who could argue with that But our democratic process is healthy and thriving and we can look at this past weeks election results to back that up Here in New York City an unapologetic liberal who until recently was de Blasio Who won the mayors race in a landslide In New Jersey a Democratic stronghold Gov Chris Christie the antithesis of a Ken doll politician and someone who rubs everyone the wrong way at least some of the time decisively won because he is strong and smart Across much of the nation the old guard is falling and being replaced by the Tea Party politicians and say what you will about their politics they really know how to shake things up Politics is nasty and brutal frustrating and pathetic but I have never seen Americans so engaged and passionate about the process Democracy is thriving here PIETRO ALLAR Forest Hills Queens Nov 6 2013 Â  In the United States legal system judicial decisions are in their nature episodic oneatatime events Trends and tendencies are difficult for the casual reader to see It is helpful for a scholar like Professor Neuborne to connect the dots brush away the microdetails that lawyers will endlessly debate and show us the general picture that is emerging This is especially useful when the picture is as dismaying as this one Mr Neuborne has given us a needed wakeup call WILLIAM R ANDERSEN Seattle Nov 6 2013 The writer is emeritus professor at the University of Washington School of Law Â  Perhaps the members of our current Supreme Court have forgotten the timeless warning of Justice Louis Brandeis We can have democracy in this country or we can have great wealth concentrated in the hands of a few but we cannot have both Either that or they have a different definition of democracy JACK KINGSTON Trumbull Conn Nov 6 2013 Â  I think Professor Neuborne makes very good points about the negative results of Supreme Court tinkering with our political system The one sentence in his letter that I question is The extreme wings of each major party control the nominating process If hes referring to the extreme right wing of the Republican Party I have no argument On the other hand if hes also referring to an extreme left wing of the Democratic Party I ask where that can be found among mainstream Democratic elected officials or party leaders Its hard enough to observe a left wing of the Democratic Party in action these days let alone an extreme left wing RICHARD BARR New York Nov 6 2013 Â  Professor Neuborne is right to bemoan the exclusionary attitude of the Supreme Court toward the participation of the poor and minorities in the electoral process However the Roberts court is also denying access to justice for those without deep pockets It has made it harder for victims of employment discrimination to sue Those injured by generic drugs cannot now bring suit against the manufacturer for inadequate warnings or for defects in product design Class actions against companies have also been greatly limited in effect

Blues letter does a fine job of defending the Supreme Court but he confuses my criticism of the courts democracy track record with an attack on the court itself I dont question the courts value I question its methodology If an architect designed windows doors and walls but didnt worry about how the parts fit together nobody would want to live in her accidental house Thats just what the Supreme Court has done with American democracy A narrow majority of the justices has built an accidental democracy that no one wants to live in As some guy named Lenin asked What is to be done As Mr Simons letter suggests a shift of one justice will enable us to begin rebuilding a democracy that Madison would recognize That means electing presidents willing to appoint reformminded justices I cannot agree with Mr Gorman Without a judicially enforceable constitution as a check Britains legislative districts ignore one person one vote freezing the Liberal Party out of its fair share of representation British newspapers are subject to government censorship and British authorities in Northern Ireland ran nojury courts and operated appalling dungeons that make Guantnamo Bay look like a

Conservative U.S. Catholics Feel Left Out of the Popeâ€™s Embrace,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/10/us/conservative-us-catholics-feel-left-out-of-the-popes-embrace.html,SMYRNA Ga  When Pope Francis was elected in March Bridget Kurt received a small prayer card with his picture at her church and put it up on her refrigerator at home next to pictures of her friends and her favorite saints  She is a regular attender of Mass a longtime stalwart in her churchs antiabortion movement and a believer that all the churchs doctrines are true and beautiful and should be obeyed She loved the last two popes and keeps a scrapbook with memorabilia from her road trip to Denver in 1993 to see Pope John Paul II at World Youth Day But Ms Kurt recently took the Pope Francis prayer card down and threw it away  It seems hes focusing on bringing back the left thats fallen away but what about the conservatives said Ms Kurt a hospice community educator Even when it was discouraging working in prolife you always felt like Mother Teresa was on your side and the popes were encouraging you Now I feel kind of thrown under the bus  In the eight months since he became pope Francis has won affection worldwide for his humble mien and common touch His approval numbers are skyrocketing Even atheists are applauding  But not everyone is so enchanted Some Catholics in the churchs conservative wing in the United States say Francis has left them feeling abandoned and deeply unsettled On the Internet and in conversations among themselves they despair that after 35 years in which the previous popes John Paul II and Benedict XVI drew clear boundaries between right and wrong Francis is muddying Catholic doctrine to appeal to the broadest possible audience  They were particularly alarmed when he told a prominent Italian atheist in an interview published in October and translated into English that everyone has his own idea of good and evil and that everyone should follow the good and fight evil as he conceives them  a remark that many conservatives interpreted as appearing to condone relativism He called proselytizing solemn nonsense They were shocked when they saw that Francis said in the interview that the most serious of the evils today are youth unemployment and the loneliness of the old It compounded the chagrin after he said in an earlier interview that he had intentionally not spoken much about abortion samesex marriage or contraception because the church could not be obsessed with the transmission of a disjointed multitude of doctrines Steve Skojec the vice president of a real estate firm in Virginia and a blogger who has written for several conservative Catholic websites wrote of Francis statements Are they explicitly heretical No Are they dangerously close Absolutely What kind of a Christian tells an atheist he has no intention to convert him That alone should disturb Catholics everywhere  In an interview on Friday Mr Skojec said he was overwhelmed by the positive response to his blog from people who said they were thinking the same things but had not wanted to say them in public He said he had come to suspect that Francis is a selfstyled revolutionary who wants to change the church fundamentally There have been bad popes in the history of the church Mr Skojec said Popes that murdered popes that had mistresses Im not saying Pope Francis is terrible but theres no divine protection that keeps him from being the type of guy who with subtlety undermines the teachings of the church to bring about a different vision  Most American Catholics do not share Mr Skojecs objections A poll released last month by Quinnipiac University found that two in three agreed with Francis that the church was too obsessed with a few issues  In parsing Francis statements in recent weeks other conservative Catholics are concluding that nothing he has said contradicts the Catholic catechism with some of his language even echoing Benedicts But in interviews the words that conservatives used most often to characterize Francis were nave and imprudent They believe that he is saying things in ways that the news media and the churchs enemies are able to distort and that there are consequences Some pointed to a vote on gay marriage just last week in Illinois Two Catholic state legislators who voted to approve samesex marriage there cited the words of Pope Francis Who am I to judge The pope said those words in response to a question about gay people during a long freewheeling interview on an airplane in July But Francis has not changed Catholic teaching which holds that marriage is between only a man and a woman and that gay sex is wrong but gay people are worthy of mercy and respect Matt C Abbott a Catholic columnist in Chicago with Renew America a politically conservative website said in an interview on Friday I wish that he could have chosen some different words expressed himself in a different way that wouldnt have been so easily taken out of context For orthodox and conservative Catholics he said the last few months have been a rollercoaster ride He added in an email Im not a big fan of roller coasters  Some conservative Catholics are sharing prophecies online that foretell of tribulations for the church In one an Irish woman predicted that Benedict would be held hostage Others cite the German mystic Anne Catherine Emmerich who wrote of a relationship between two popes one who lives in a palace other than before which some now see as a reference to Benedict who resigned as pope early this year but still lives in Vatican City During this time there arises a false church of darkness  But some Catholics initially alarmed by Francis remarks are now trying to calm others down Judie Brown the president and cofounder of the American Life League a Catholic antiabortion group said Prolifers are upset because they feel the pope is selling out the prolife movement And thats not at all correct If you read everything hes been saying especially in his Wednesday sermons theres no question that where he stands is consistent with what the church has been teaching At the Pregnancy Aid Clinic in Hapeville Ga a Catholicrun nonprofit center where women who come for pregnancy tests are counseled against abortion staff members gathered around a kitchen table last week and cautiously said they had been grappling with the popes message and were trying to take it to heart  Alexandra P Shattuck the clinics director said she had studied the popes interview in her parishs Bible study class and concluded that the news media had taken Francis warning not to obsess about abortion out of context She said he was really trying to teach about mercy I think he was completely right added Katie Stacy the development coordinator The focus should be not only on love and mercy but on treating the women in these crisis situations with love and mercy  The room was crammed with baskets of empty baby bottles to be distributed to Atlanta parishes to fill with coins and bills as donations The staff members said that most priests are far from obsessed with abortion or contraception preaching against it only during Respect Life Sunday When a pope makes a statement off the cuff or in an interview its not an infallible statement said Chris Baran the president of the clinics board What he said in a statement does not change any teaching of the church thats been around over 2000 years 
Conservative Republicans Recoil at the Notion That Christie Is the Partyâ€™s Savior,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/nyregion/conservative-republicans-recoil-at-the-notion-that-christie-is-the-partys-savior.html,Time magazine splashed Chris Christies profile on its latest cover Highprofile Republicans including the only female Hispanic governor in the nation are urging him to run for president MSNBCs Morning Joe program seems to be anointing him the savior of the Republican Party  Everyone it seems is celebrating the ascent of Mr Christie the governor of New Jersey Except people like Scott Hofstra Were so frustrated with all this Christie talk we cant see straight said Mr Hofstra who is active in the Tea Party movement and lives in Vine Grove Ky He and his friends were especially furious when the governor on television last week described himself as a conservative given his recent expansion of Medicaid under the Affordable Care Act among other positions Hes no more conservative than Harry Reid Mr Hofstra said referring to the Senate majority leader a Democrat Mr Christies landslide victory in New Jersey was just days ago but the conversation about him is moving swiftly beyond the borders of his state Three years before the presidential election a governor who was almost a complete unknown until he became a YouTube sensation in 2010 has become not only a political celebrity but also a deeply polarizing force within his party To many in the conservative movement Mr Christie represents the kind of candidate the Republican establishment has foisted on the base in recent presidential elections  a media darling whose calling card is that elusive quality of electability and whose adherence to the partys principles is suspect The more the news media and the establishment cheer on Mr Christie the more grassroots activists  especially members of the Tea Party  resent it Mr Christie appeared this weekend on four of the Sunday morning talk shows Chuck Henderson a Tea Party activist from Manhattan Kan nearly shouted into the phone when asked by a reporter about the idea of Mr Christie as a presidential candidate  He won his reelection bully for him but for him to make the jump up the next rung of the ladder well hes not going to find any support from the people I mix with Mr Henderson said A national poll conducted in September by Quinnipiac University underscored the pattern While 46 percent of selfdescribed moderates have a positive view of Mr Christie and only 15 percent have a negative view among conservatives 33 percent view him favorably and 25 percent have an unfavorable impression Those around Mr Christie are aware of the unease among conservatives and are beginning to emphasize his positions on issues like abortion  he is opposed to it except in cases of rape incest and the life of the mother  and state spending to try to blunt those concerns The governors standing among conservatives is important because Iowa and South Carolina two of the first three states in the Republican presidential nominating contest are dominated by ideologydriven activists In addition grassroots activists are providing much of the passion and energy for the Republican party right now In an interview last week Mr Christie said if conservatives had questions about his principles they ought to examine his record Watch me govern he said Ive cut taxes cut spending reformed pensions and benefits Believe me if Washington were able to do that theyd have a parade for them My record is my record Im proud of it And it is a conservative record governing as a conservative in a blue state But Mr Christies record can be read a number of ways Some conservatives have already raised questions about his actions on gun control He vetoed several bills last summer including one that would ban the 50caliber Barrett rifle but has approved others such as a measure that requires the police to provide the state with more information about guns used in crimes And while he has made known his opposition to samesex marriage he abandoned an appeal of a court decision that legalized it in his state During his reelection campaign he also suggested he may support providing instate tuition to illegal immigrants With a civil war underway inside the Republican Party what conservatives fear most is that Mr Christies nomination would effectively mean that the party establishment had won the internal struggle  and that Mr Christies force of personality trumped ideas Asked in an interview whether Mr Christie could unite the partys factions Newt Gingrich the former House speaker responded flatly No I dont think Chris Christie has any interest in bridging that divide because hell run as an aggressive Northeastern moderate who can get something done I dont see him using conservative language He might be able to get nominated but it will be running as a personality leader not a movement leader To an influential bloc of the Republican establishment of course Mr Christie is nothing short of a savior  a charismatic governor with not a whiff of Washington on him with a proven ability to get votes from the constituencies that have proved resistant to the Republican Party in recent elections like women and Hispanics  The excitement is especially noticeable among many party operatives contributors and insiders who see Mr Christie as perhaps their only bet to defeat Hillary Clinton if former Gov Jeb Bush of Florida does not run  I think he should definitely consider running for president and I think he will find theres an enormous an enormous amount of pressure from people who want to support him said former Gov Haley Barbour of Mississippi Gov Susana Martinez of New Mexico who spent the final days of Mr Christies reelection campaign stumping for him in New Jersey said I love his authenticity I love who he is and added an unprompted endorsement I will support Governor Christie in anything he decides to do in life But Mr Christies foes have clout too Rush Limbaugh the conservative talk show host has mockingly suggested that Mr Christie will run for president as a Democrat and the conservative website impresario Matt Drudge has made clear he has little regard for him McAuliffe De Blasio and Christie Triple feature in a Republicans nightmare Mr Drudge said in a Twitter post after the results of Tuesdays elections grouping Mr Christie with the Democratic governorelect of Virginia and the Democratic mayorelect of New York City For all the grumbles about Mr Christies positions on issues like samesex marriage for example or even griping about his embrace of President Obama after Hurricane Sandy the underlying issue with the right wing appears to be trust Many are skeptical that he is committed to advancing the conservative movement much as they came to be about President George W Bush They also worry that any campaign by Mr Christie is destined to be centered entirely on his pugnacious style rather than a broader Republican agenda Personality campaigns that get the political establishment all hot and bothered tend not to work in the GOP primaries said Craig Shirley a conservative historian who has written about Ronald Reagans campaigns At least not for very long Christie needs a signature issue and he needs to resist the temptation to go to war with the conservatives and the Tea Party Mr Shirley said To many in the partys grass roots though it may not matter what Mr Christie does We want somebody special a real limitedgovernment conservative said Eric Stamper a Tennessee Tea Party activist I dont think thats him
"For 2014, G.O.P.â€™s Challenges Stem From Within",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/11/us/politics/in-2014-primaries-challenges-for-gop-stem-from-divides-within.html,BEDFORD Pa  Art Halvorson makes for an unlikely Republican primary challenger to a sixterm incumbent like Representative Bill Shuster He is a newcomer to this quiet corner of southcentral Pennsylvania who retired here after a long Coast Guard career But in the throwoutthebums anger percolating in the election cycle now underway Mr Halvorson 58 believes he might have a shot to displace a name that has occupied this House seat since Mr Shusters father won it in 1972 After two House elections dominated by the smallgovernment philosophy of the Tea Party 2014 may be driven by a less ideological but more emotional sentiment clean house People dont remember a time before the Shusters Mr Halvorson said They created an aristocracy and people are so accustomed to thats the way politics is done around here they dont see how he can be toppled Ive got to show leaderships whats important not seniority and longevity is not leadership The outcome of this and at least 17 other primaries next year may have a negligible impact on Republican control of the House Few would suggest that Pennsylvanias Ninth Congressional District is in danger of slipping into Democratic hands But in the heated battle over the ideological future of the Republican Party races like this one could alter the complexion of the Republican caucus in the House  and Washingtons ability to govern in President Obamas final years in office Thats the narrative everybody wants to know Whats the Republican Party going to look like after Ted Cruz Tea Party people get done with it Mr Halvorson asked eschewing the Tea Party label even as he adopts many of its campaign tropes Whos going to have the ascendancy From Tennessee to Michigan to Oregon House Republicans are facing an onslaught of primary challenges But unlike the last two election cycles there is almost no ideological pattern to the contests  Representatives Justin Amash and Kerry Bentivolio of Michigan and Scott DesJarlais of Tennessee  all Tea Party lawmakers in good standing  are threatened by potential challengers backed by business groups and their more traditional Republican allies Those challenges are not so much from the partys left but more from a new breed of candidates hoping to professionalize a House Republican caucus whose image has been battered by the turmoil in Washington  Even the chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee Representative Greg Walden of Oregon has drawn a credible challenger from the partys right Dennis Linthicum the chairman of the Klamath County Board of Commissioners  Somebody has to get serious about looking at spending the growth of government the regulatory aspects that discourage business and risktaking said Mr Linthicum who called Mr Walden a statist who would prefer to keep government in the size shape and fashion in which it currently exists How such contests resolve themselves could leave the House Republican caucus either more uncompromisingly conservative in 2015 or more committed to governance and compromise Its an offshoot of the decline in competitive districts because of redistricting said David Wasserman a House analyst at the nonpartisan Cook Political Report There are fewer fights to pick with the other party so there are going to be more fights within your party In some sense the fight for the heart of the House Republican caucus began last Tuesday in Alabama when Bradley Byrne a businessbacked former state senator fought off a Tea Partysupported firebrand to win a special House election in Mobile  In Tennessee Mr DesJarlais has maintained his Tea Party bona fides since the 2010 wave swept him into Congress But the taint of scandal has followed him since divorce records exposed accusations of violent behavior as well as a telephone transcript indicating that as a practicing doctor he had an affair with a patient and encouraged her to get an abortion Another former patient emerged last year to say that she too had had an affair with Mr DesJarlais and had smoked marijuana with him The hits have kept coming since then and State Senator Jim Tracy is now considered the favorite in the primary fight in August In Michigan businessbacked candidates are challenging Mr Amash and Mr Bentivolio two black sheep of the House Republican conference Mr Amash has electrified the libertarian wing of the Republican Party with his crusade against domestic spying his willingness to challenge his partys defense hawks and his opposition to even the most austere budget plans of his leadership which he invariably condemns as timid taps at the Big Government edifice  But his showy image as the Houses Dr No has angered the buttondown business community of Grand Rapids long used to the quiet conservatism of Vernon J Ehlers a physicist who held the seat for 16 years without making much of a ripple Brian Ellis a Grand Rapids businessman has won the support of several highprofile businesspeople  Hes not a conservative Republican hes a libertarian Mr Ellis said of his opponent insisting that a district that turned in 2010 to a Ron Paulinspired provocateur from Mr Ehlers has not changed as much as its representation has Im putting my campaign on the line to say thats not the case and were going to find out Mr Amashs campaign is ready for the fight  Brian Elliss proearmark procorporate welfare and proNSAsurveillance positions are out of touch with most Americans especially Republican primary voters said Will Adams a spokesman for the congressman On the other side of Michigan Mr Bentivolio is an accidental congressman elected last year after the popular Republican incumbent Thaddeus McCotter resigned suddenly because most of the signatures his campaign had collected to put him on the ballot were proved fraudulent  Mr Bentivolio who once raised reindeer starred in a homemade movie that accused George W Bush of planning the Sept 11 attacks and once said in court he sometimes could not tell whether he was Kerry Bentivolio or Santa Claus But as the only Republican left on the ballot he won In his year in office he has kept a low profile But the Eastern Michigan establishment is still seeking to oust him and its members are backing a lawyer and businessman Dave Trott In Bedford Pa the division between Tea Party and establishment candidates lay bare as Mr Halvorson went door to door As he sipped a drink at the HeBrews Coffee Company Linda McElroy 66 and two friends eyed the candidate warily They were never big fans of Mr Shuster but after the recent government shutdown Ms McElroy from New Paris Pa said she had a new appreciation for establishment figures like her congressman Before I wouldve never voted for Shuster she said I probably will this time I think the Tea Party is frightening But other voters were receptive to Mr Halvorsons pitch for change Tim Sotirokos 48 lamented Mr Shusters bigspending ways Gilbert Davis 54 seethed about the hint of aristocracy in the Shuster name We need something more conservative something more like what the Tea Partys all about low taxes less government he said On Jodi Baraniaks stately front porch not far from the Bud Shuster Byway Mr Halvorson made his appeal for smaller government Ms Baraniak a 44yearold lab technician fretted about a straining middle class I dont understand why were hurting our own people she said worrying that the government was trying to support too many people on the backs of too few taxpayers Were not communists are we Mr Halvorson was only mildly encouraging Not yet he said
A New Firm Sets Out to Secure Womenâ€™s Votes for a Vulnerable G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/us/politics/a-new-firm-sets-out-to-secure-womens-votes-for-a-vulnerable-gop.html,WASHINGTON  After months of deliberating over how to better appeal to Hispanic and other minority voters some Republicans believe their party is overlooking another dire demographic challenge women One year after President Obama carried female voters by an 11 percentage point margin in his reelection Republican officials are again grappling with another competitive race lost in large part because of women  In the Virginia governors race last week Terry McAuliffe defeated Kenneth T Cuccinelli II the state attorney general by only 25 percent but won by nine percentage points among women The Republicans challenge is even more acute with unmarried women Mr Obama won this often younger voting block by 36 percent Mr McAuliffe  who blitzed Mr Cuccinelli with a multimilliondollar barrage of negative ads on abortion contraception and divorce  carried single women by a staggering 42 percentage points There were something like 53 million unmarried women eligible to vote in 2012 but on campaigns you dont hear a specific strategy discussed of How are we going to reach unmarried womenÂ  said Katie Packer Gage who served as deputy campaign manager for Mitt Romney in 2012 Given Democrats repeated and successful efforts to portray Republicans as hostile to women Ms Gage and two other consultants are starting a political strategy firm to help the partys candidates better tailor their messages to women Ms Gage Ashley OConnor and Christine Matthews this week are opening what appears to be the first Republican firm aimed specially at wooing female voters They are calling it Burning Glass Consulting  a reference to what they see as the need for a focus on appealing to women that is so laserlike that it can burn glass  We want to get smarter about how we communicate the Republican message specifically to women said Ms Gage Certainly there are challenges with other demographic groups but women represent 53 percent of the electorate The three strategists will undertake public opinion research TV ads and general consulting for Republican candidates about how to better reach that majority The idea for the firm came about when Ms Gage and Ms OConnor worked together on the Romney campaign The pair would find themselves among just a few women at meetings of about a dozen staff members We started to see things we felt werent being accomplished Ms Gage said citing Mr Romneys message and tone After the campaign they discussed their frustrations with Ms Matthews a pollster and decided to create a new approach to both voter research and the campaign ads that are derived from such polling and focus groups Ms Matthews said that instead of commissioning a single poll or focus group among women she was seeking longerterm engagement with a group of women creating a relationship with them over a period of time to better assess what shapes their political views Democrats dismiss such tactics asserting that a consulting firm cannot change the core challenge that Republicans have difficulties with female voters because of their partys policies and language Democrats refer to the Republicans approach as the war on women The lesson for candidates in 2014 is unmistakable Dismiss and demean women at your peril Cecile Richards the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said last week after the Virginia race What is unmistakable is that Democrats think that in depicting Republicans as hostile to women they have found a winning message In Kentucky home to perhaps the highestprofile Senate race next year Democrats recruited Alison Lundergan Grimes 34 the secretary of state to run against Mitch McConnell the Senate minority leader and are already taking after him on genderrelated issues  And if Republicans nominate a man in Georgia Democrats will surely do the same there where they wooed Michelle Nunn daughter of former Senator Sam Nunn to run for an open Senate seat
Bishops Are Urged to Expand Priorities,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/12/us/bishops-are-urged-to-expand-priorities.html,BALTIMORE  Cardinal Timothy M Dolan in his final address as president of the nations Roman Catholic bishops called on them Monday to take up the cause of Christians in places like Iraq Syria Nigeria and India who are persecuted and killed for their faith  It was a notable shift in priorities For the last two years the bishops have poured their time and resources into a campaign to fight what they saw as serious threats to religious liberty in the United States Their prime concern has been a provision in President Obamas health care overhaul that would force even some Catholic employers to provide contraception in their insurance plans when Catholic teaching prohibits the use of artificial contraception But Cardinal Dolan the archbishop of New York said that the struggles over religious liberty in the United States pale in comparison to the persecution of Christians abroad  Now we are being beckoned  by history by our Holy Father by the force of our own logic he said to extend those efforts to the dramatic front lines of this battle where Christians are paying for their fidelity with their lives  The shift in emphasis was the clearest sign that eight months after Pope Francis was elected his priorities were beginning to trickle down to the organization that Cardinal Dolan leads the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Francis provoked widespread discussion in the church with an interview published in September in which he said that the church should not be so obsessed with issues like abortion gay marriage and contraception  but should instead lead with the Gospels message of love and mercy  He has said the church must be for the poor and has visited with refugees and washed the feet of juveniles in prison cameras in tow  Archbishop Carlo Maria Vigan the Vaticans ambassador to the United States told the bishops that he had met with Francis in June in the popes simple apartment in the Vatican and that Francis made a special point of saying that he wants pastoral bishops not bishops who profess or follow a particular ideology Noting the churchs diversity Archbishop Vigan added We must take care that for us as a church this diversity does not grow into division through misrepresentation or misunderstanding and that division does not deteriorate into fragmentation  The bishops religious liberty campaign has put them in a direct and sustained confrontation with the Obama administration  contributing to criticism that the bishops conference has become enmeshed with the Republican Party More than 70 lawsuits have been filed against the administration by Catholic universities hospitals and other entities and by other Christian churches and institutions as well as by private employers  At a news conference Cardinal Dolan said that the bishops are not abandoning the religious liberty campaign and that it had been very successful But he said that in the interest of justice and the bishops own credibility the bishops should heed the pleas that they have heard from Christians overseas to turn their attention to those who are being killed and persecuted for their faith  He said We dont have tanks at our door we dont have people being macheted on their way home from Mass In an interview Archbishop William E Lori of Baltimore the chairman of the bishops ad hoc committee on religious liberty said This doesnt represent a backing away It represents an amplification He said that since the lawsuits have resulted in contradictory rulings by various courts he hoped the Supreme Court would take up the issue In the meantime he said the bishops were pursuing creative solutions to the health care mandate that may be announced later The Rev Thomas J Reese a senior analyst for The National Catholic Reporter a liberal Catholic newspaper and website said he perceived Franciss effect in the bishops new approach to religious liberty Theyre not withdrawing that agenda item but so far in this meeting theyre just not obsessing The bishops however did spend part of their afternoon session hearing an update on their efforts to stop samesex marriage One bishop asked whether it was possible to come up with a slogan sufficiently short and memorable to compete with the term marriage equality used by gay rights advocates  Archbishop Salvatore J Cordileone of San Francisco the chairman of the bishops committee that works on marriage said We speak about marriage as the union of one man and one woman I dont think weve come up with a twoword phrase Several liberal Catholic groups held news conferences outside the bishops meeting calling for a focus on poverty and economic injustice  Fred Rotondaro the chairman of Catholics in Alliance for the Common Good said I want to see the bishops take a role in fighting poverty and inequality in this country and I dont think theyre doing it
Justices Weigh Role Drug Played in a Fatal Cocktail,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/us/supreme-court-oklahoma-ultrasound-requirement.html,WASHINGTON  Joshua Bankas prodigious appetite for drugs killed him On Tuesday the Supreme Court considered whether to hold a drug dealer who had sold heroin to Mr Banka responsible for his death In 2010 just before Mr Banka was scheduled to enter a courtordered drug rehabilitation program he decided to go on one last bender He smoked marijuana crushed cooked and injected OxyContin took a variety of prescription drugs and topped them off with heroin he had bought from Marcus A Burrage Mr Burrage was convicted not only of selling the heroin but also of being responsible for the death That second charge carried a mandatory minimum sentence of 20 years in prison At his trial medical experts said the heroin had been a contributing factor in Mr Bankas death But they could not say given the other drugs he had ingested that he would not have died anyway On Tuesday Justice Elena Kagan distilled the testimony this way Using heroin made it more likely that he would die but we cant say that using heroin killed him The question for the justices was the meaning of a federal law that requires a mandatory sentence if death or serious bodily injury results from drugs sold by a defendant Did results from mean the drugs contributed to the death Or did it require more Angela L Campbell a lawyer for Mr Burrage said the words of the law required a straight line from her clients drugs to Mr Bankas death Marcus Burrage is serving a 20year mandatory minimum sentence for selling heroin that according to the jury instruction that was given to the jury at the time of the trial was not the primary cause of the death but rather merely played a part in the death she said That was not enough Ms Campbell said and several justices seemed prepared to agree One little grain of heroin that you discover is in the body and that persons going away for whatever it is 20 years Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr asked a lawyer for the federal government The lawyer Benjamin J Horwich said there was an exception for quantities of drugs that are too insignificant or not important enough or too insubstantial But as a general matter he said prosecutors need only show that illicit drugs contributed to the victims death Requiring prosecutors to prove more he said would have pernicious consequences A but for test he said could mean that nothing and nobody was the cause of the victims death But Justice Antonin Scalia said the words of the statute might mean just that It says it has to result in the death he said of the law And I take that to mean at least at least butfor causality The chief justice appeared to agree This statute does not say if you die from taking drugs then the person who gave you drugs who gave you any kind of drugs is responsible he said It says the death has to result from the heroin Justice Stephen G Breyer urged caution saying the court should not issue a broad decision in light of the complexity of the case Burrage v United States No 127515 Its so complicated to talk about he said that you are going to mix everybody up once we start to write on this Why not just say substantialÂ   meaning the mandatory sentence would be proper if the defendants drugs played a substantial role in the death  and let the lower courts figure it out so we dont confuse the entire bar and the entire Congress and everything he asked Justice Scalia responded Because of that imprecision some poor devils will have to go to jail for a longer period than otherwise You know tough luck In other action at the court on Tuesday the justices declined to hear an appeal from a decision striking down an Oklahoma abortion law that required women to have an ultrasound image placed in front of them and to listen to a detailed description of the fetus before the procedure The ultrasound typically required a vaginal probe and had to be performed even if women objected Some doctors said the requirement that they recite the description was a violation of medical ethics The Oklahoma Supreme Court struck down the law in December saying it conflicted with a 1992 United States Supreme Court decision protecting the constitutional right to abortion In their brief to the justices state officials said the law was consistent with the decision which upheld part of a Pennsylvania law calling for informed consent from women seeking abortions In urging the court not to hear the case Pruitt v Nova Health Systems No 121170 operators of Oklahoma abortion clinics said the law was rare if not unique This is no gardenvariety informed consent law their brief said It does not merely make information available to a woman who wishes to

Republicans Again Reject Obama Pick for Judiciary,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/us/politics/senate-blocks-judicial-nominee-with-filibuster.html,WASHINGTON  President Obamas latest choice to fill one of the vacancies on a powerful appeals court went down in a filibuster on Tuesday as Senate Republicans blocked another White House nominee  the third in two weeks  and deepened a growing conflict with Democrats over presidential appointments By a vote of 56 to 41 the nomination of Cornelia T L Pillard a Georgetown law professor fell short of clearing the necessary 60vote threshold Ms Pillards liberal record on issues like abortion has troubled many conservatives who are concerned about her attaining a position on a court widely considered second in stature to only the Supreme Court But Senate Republicans have tried to frame their opposition to her not in terms of her views on social issues instead focusing on the caseload at the court the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which is lower than that of other federal appeals courts The disagreements carried over onto the Senate floor on Tuesday as Democrats accused Republicans of blocking a perfectly qualified woman for political purposes while Republicans said Democrats were desperately looking for a wedge issue Looming underneath their disagreements about Ms Pillard is the likelihood  which appeared to grow considerably on Tuesday  that the fight will escalate and result in a change to the Senate rules to limit the minority partys ability to filibuster judicial nominees Senator Richard J Durbin the chambers No 2 Democrat warned Republicans that they were pushing the Senate dangerously close to a tipping point  There reaches a point where we cant allow this type of injustice to occur he said all but threatening that Democrats would be forced to change the rules Its not fair to these nominees he added to be given the back of the hand by a Republican filibuster on the floor of the United States Senate Senator Charles E Grassley Republican of Iowa who is a senior member of the Judiciary Committee dared Democrats to change the rules saying it would come back to haunt them if they lost the majority Go ahead Mr Grassley said There are a lot more Scalias and Thomases that wed love to put on the bench referring to Justices Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas of the Supreme Court  Democrats have made much of the fact that two of the three nominees whom Republicans have rejected recently  and three of the filibustered nominees the president has submitted for the District of Columbia appeals court over the last year  were women Mr Grassley rejected the idea that sex played any role in opposition to the nominees When the other side runs out of legitimate arguments their last line of defense is to accuse Republicans of opposing nominees based upon gender or race he said Its a wellworn card And they play it every time The dispute has brought the Senate to the point of crisis twice this year But this latest round has become especially intense because of the power of the court in question It regularly decides cases that determine whether White Houseissued regulations are constitutional Just last week it ruled that the mandate in the Affordable Care Act for employers to provide free coverage for contraception infringes on individual religious liberty Social conservatives have seized on Ms Pillards published writings on abortion and motherhood in which she has staunchly defended a womans right to terminate a pregnancy as constitutionally protected One writer for The National Review Online called her a proabortion extremist The nomination of one more judge to the appeals court could move to the Senate floor soon Robert L Wilkins a Federal District Court judge for the District of Columbia has already cleared the Senate Judiciary Committee and is awaiting a floor vote Â But Republicans have shown no willingness to approve him either Speaking after the vote on Tuesday Senator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont and chairman of the Judiciary Committee said he believed it had come to the point when Senate filibuster rules must be changed because Republicans were holding the presidents nominees to such a blatant double standard Slamming his fist on a lectern he shouted Their credibility is shredded
Donâ€™t Call Her a First Lady; Brownâ€™s Wife Is His Top Aide,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/13/us/dont-call-her-a-first-lady-browns-wife-is-his-top-aide.html,SACRAMENTO  Anyone who spends time with Gov Jerry Brown is familiar with his penchant for referring to philosophers Latin or an obscure tome he has recently read often in the same sentence A speaker who uses what he deems an imprecise word should be prepared to listen to a soliloquy on its meaning Do not expect his wife to do the same Anne Gust Brown petite and polished speaks with the directness of someone who has little patience for theoretical colloquiums She is the first person to whom advisers turn if they need to anticipate the long list of questions the governor is likely to pepper them with After more than 20 years as his partner  and nearly a decade as his top aide  she is one of the few people who can predict his often unpredictable thinking And she is the one most likely to tell the governor it is time to end the Socratic seminar and make a decision I would say sometimes hes exhausting Ms Gust Brown said in a courtyard just outside the governors office Sometimes I have to foist him onto other people and say you go talk to someone else about that because he has a sort of insatiable appetite about these things From the first day her husband a Democrat began his third term as governor in 2011 Ms Gust Brown has occupied an office just around the corner from his And as he decides whether to run for reelection next year  as many expect he will  no ones counsel will be more highly valued than hers One of the quickest decisions the couple made after he won a governorship he had previously held decades earlier was to eschew the use of the term first lady and give her a different title special counsel to the governor She helped run the campaign for a successful ballot measure to raise taxes last fall and has played a key role in amassing Mr Browns 10 million war chest Ms Gust Brown 55 and a lawyer has not embraced the ceremonial role that governors wives usually play Instead she functions as a confidante quietly consulting with the governor on matters as expansive as the states criminal justice system and mundane as hiring and firing staff members She reads scores of bills each year helping sort through countless legal and political implications the legislation may have I figure out what needs additional hands and do that Ms Gust Brown said in the recent interview one of few she has given since her husband took office Sitting in the courtyard where former Gov Arnold Schwarzenegger once kept his smoking tent she rubbed the ears of Sutter the Browns dog a corgi who is more widely recognized in the capital than she is Ms Gust Brown does not have her own staff or policy priorities She shelved the long tradition of a governorsponsored conference on women which had been a prominent part of the job for her predecessors Particularly for Maria Shriver who like Ms Gust Brown had left her own successful career when her husband ascended into office Friends describe Ms Gust Brown as someone who shuns formality she has been known to make an offcolor joke on a staff call or wear jeans to the office But few think that her casual demeanor means she should not be taken seriously While she described little droppings of thick books her husband leaves strewn around the house she said she had been too wrapped up in reading legislative bills to spend much time on anything else Thats what were debating from the moment we wake up to the moment we go to sleep and sometimes hes waking me up in the middle of the night Ms Gust Brown said He doesnt have hobbies My husband thinks about this all the time she said drawing out the last three words with a mock exasperation For much of her career Ms Gust Brown worked as a top lawyer for the Gap the San Franciscobased clothing giant After a mutual friend introduced her to Mr Brown then several years past his first two terms as governor and his first failed presidential bid the two dated for over a decade before they married in 2005 Several friends worried aloud that if he did not propose Ms Gust Brown would leave I wrote him a letter saying youre going to be old sick and alone someday because Anne is not going to put up with this and there is nobody that is better for you than her said Senator Dianne Feinstein a Democrat who is a longtime friend of the governor The next Easter Sunday he called me and said Were engaged would you marry us  She did Mr Brown who is 20 years older than his wife planned an elaborate wedding with nearly 600 guests writing the vows and arranging for a customdesigned dress for her At the time Ms Gust Brown left her job and began running her husbands campaign to become the state attorney general Then the mayor of Oakland Mr Brown had parted ways with Jacques Barzaghi his Frenchborn aide who was at his side for decades The Browns have navigated the working relationship for their entire marriage she has never been paid for her position as his top aide Shes a damn good lawyer and it turns out she is a very good political operative and strategist Mr Brown said as he briefly joined his wife When asked for examples where she was particularly helpful he demurred That would then limit her ability to advise me on certain controversial issues He continued She is certainly dubious of  but Ms Gust Brown quickly cut him off Dont go there she said with a laugh Her role in the past few years has evolved During budget negotiations in 2011 Ms Gust Brown often sat in meetings with legislators bristling when she believed they were not showing her husband enough respect These days such meetings are left to other aides Still she has become deeply involved on many of the most vexing issues facing the governor the state budget gap and the ensuing campaign to raise taxes as well as the continuing demands from the federal courts to overhaul the state prisons As the governor sorted through hundreds of bills last month Ms Gust Brown was the one helping him to decide whether he would veto some gun control measures he did approve an expansion of abortion rights he did or allow noncitizens to serve on juries he did not Aides and legislators show a mixture of admiration and frustration about the governors tendency to muse philosophically on every bit of policy minutia Theres a certain point where you cant continue to analyze and you have to decide said Jim Humes who was a top aide in the attorney generals office and governors office before he was appointed as a state judge She focuses on the pragmatic impact and is decisive and she can be much more direct with him because she is his wife My experience with Jerry Brown is he can be pretty unpredictable but she more often than not can channel him and get it right When the governor took office Ms Gust Brown handed over what had once been the first ladys wing to the press staff In what many viewed as a shrewd move she led the effort to trim the governors staff by 25 percent Like her husband Ms Gust Brown seems to take delight in their reputation of frugality When a reporter for The San Francisco Chronicle featured the governor as the greatest bald man in the Bay Area Ms Gust Brown proudly told him that she had cut his hair herself for years with an electric razor Ms Gust Brown often sees their home in Oakland as a sanctuary from Sacramento where working dinners with aides are regularly held in the studio apartment the Browns rent and she is obliged to declare the night over so that she can get to bed She has helped the governor sustain a strict diet and exercise regimen  the two run or lift weights almost daily and dinners out usually mean a split entree salad and one glass of chardonnay During an interview just after lunch one recent afternoon Mr Brown declared that his half of a chicken sandwich Ms Gust Brown had brought to him was a little too much before ticking off a list of reasons other than hunger that drive people to eat Ms Gust Brown a graduate of Stanford University and the University of Michigan Law School has done much to soften the image of her husband who as a bachelor in his first two terms as governor had a reputation as aloof and unapproachable After the governor went on one particularly long digression Ms Gust Brown chimed in with a chiding that only a spouse could offer smiling Didnt I tell you he was exhausting
China to Ease Longtime Policy of 1-Child Limit,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/16/world/asia/china-to-loosen-its-one-child-policy.html,HONG KONG  The Chinese government will ease its onechild family restrictions and abolish reeducation through labor camps significantly curtailing two policies that for decades have defined the states power to control citizens lives the Communist Party said Friday The changes were announced in a party decision that also laid out broad and potentially farreaching proposals to restructure the economy by encouraging greater private participation in finance vowing market competition in several important parts of the economy and promising farmers better property protection and compensation for confiscated land Senior party officials led by President Xi Jinping endorsed the 60 initiatives at a fourday Central Committee conference that ended Tuesday but details were released Friday Mr Xi described the document as a bold call for economic renewal social improvement and patriotic nationbuilding  all under the firm control of oneparty rule We must certainly have the courage and conviction to renew ourselves he said in a statement accompanying the decision Both were issued by the official news agency Xinhua Mr Xi who assumed Chinas top party leadership post a year ago and the presidency eight months ago has tried to project an image as a leader who can pursue a potentially conflicting agenda making Chinas economy more responsive to market forces and giving its people greater social and economic freedom while fortifying traditional oneparty rule For months analysts have speculated about the economic policies that could be introduced at the meeting But the planned changes to population policy and punishment two areas where overhauls have been debated and delayed for years gave the decision significance beyond the economy They could stir public expectations of even bolder changes under Mr Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang in the decade they are likely to spend in office Xi Jinping may have the most concentrated power of any Chinese leader since Deng Xiaoping said Xiao Gongqin a professor of history in Shanghai who closely follows Chinese politics and advocates neoauthoritarian rule to protect the march of market overhauls Politically he has pursued an ideological tightening because he wants to prevent the kind of explosion in political demands that could come in a relaxed environment Thats the biggest danger for any government entering a period of reform For decades most urban couples have been restricted to having one child That has been changing fitfully with rules on the books that couples can have two children if both parents are single children But that policy will now be further relaxed nationwide Many rural couples already have two children and some have more This is the first time that a central document has clearly proposed allowing two children when a husband or wife is an only child said Wang Guangzhou a demographer at the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences in Beijing Now its just talking about launching this but the specific policies have to be developed at the operational level If carried through the relaxation would be the first significant nationwide easing of family size restrictions that have been in place since the 1970s said Wang Feng a demographer who teaches at both the University of California Irvine and Fudan University in Shanghai He estimated the policy could lead to one million to two million more births in China every year on top of the approximately 15 million births a year now This step is really I think the middle step toward allowing all couples to have two children and eventually taking away the states hand Professor Wang said But this shift is historical Its fundamental To change the mentality of the society of policy makers has taken people more than a decade The onechild restrictions were introduced to deal with official fears that Chinas population would devour too many resources and suffocate growth But they have created public ire and international criticism over forced abortions and have created a population of 134 billion according to a 2010 census that is aging relatively rapidly even before China establishes a firm foothold in prosperity Experts have for years urged some relaxation of the controls The party leaders also confirmed an announcement made earlier this year and then abruptly retracted that they intend to abolish reeducation through labor which since the 1950s has empowered police authorities to imprison people without any real judicial review Experts and officials have debated whether to adjust or abolish the system of camps since the 1980s Now abolition is closer Abolish the system of reeducation through labor said the decision which proposed expanding community corrections to partly replace the system This is a significant step forward said Nicholas Bequelin a senior researcher who specializes in China with Human Rights Watch an advocacy organization based in New York It doesnt mean that China is going to be kinder to dissent and to its critics Mr Bequelin said But its an important step to do away with a system that not only profoundly violated human rights but was also standing in the way of any further legal reform Reeducation through labor was introduced under Mao Zedong to lock away those considered political opponents and it expanded into a system of incarceration holding more than 100000 people many of them working in prison factories and on farms Sentences are determined by the police and defendants have scant chance to appeal imprisonment that can last up to four years The document gives no date for bringing labor reeducation to an end or for introducing the changes to family planning policy And there is the possibility that the government will delay or dilute the changes or introduce similar restrictions under another name Mr Bequelin said The decision also leaves in place labor camps that are part of the general penal system for those convicted in court In a country that carries out more executions than the rest of the world combined the document pledged to gradually reduce the number of crimes that can result in the death penalty But it gave no details about which crimes may be affected Under Mr Xi the government has pursued a broad crackdown on political dissent critical opinion and rumors on the Internet and perceived ideological threats But the decision promised fairer and more predictable treatment from the police and the courts hinting at support for longdiscussed measures intended to make judges more independent of the local officials in their jurisdictions Improve the transparency and public credibility of the judiciary Mr Xi said in his statement But he also promised more stringent controls on the Internet Ensuring order national security and social stability in the dissemination of information on the Internet has become a real and pressing problem facing us The bulk of the Central Committee decision dwelt on economic changes intended to rejuvenate growth by encouraging private investment more efficient use of bank capital and the leasing of land by farmers into larger more viable holdings Reform of the economic system is the focal point of comprehensively deepening reform the decision said The core issue is properly handling the relationship between the government and the market The most important changes propose to reduce risks and distortions in government finances which give local administrations many tasks but relatively few sources of revenue forcing them to rely on taking land from farmers for relatively little compensation Other proposals include introducing more marketbased pricing into areas such as energy and water But these changes could encounter resistance from government ministries large stateowned companies local governments and consumers potentially hurt by price rises Theyve gone a long way to meet market expectations and everyone is going to look at implementation said Stephen Green head of Greater China research for the banking and financial services company Standard Chartered
Blood Debt,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/books/review/death-of-the-black-haired-girl-by-robert-stone.html,Robert Stone lapidary in his prose is continent also in his output Graham Greene is in some ways his most natural antecedent but Stone has produced far fewer books Almost all are memorable Dog Soldiers A Flag for Sunrise Outerbridge Reach Damascus Gate He tackles a genre  frequently the thriller but in the case of his latest book the campus novel  and twists it to his purposes in ways that surprise and provoke A subtle writer he demands an attentive reader as he explores through superficially familiar narratives substantial themes At first glance the plot of Death of the BlackHaired Girl might form the basis of a television police procedural At a fancy college in an economically underprivileged town in New England Maud Stack the daughter of a widowed policeman from Queens is having an affair with her professor Steven Brookman Upon learning that his beloved wife Ellie raised as a Mennonite in rural Saskatchewan is pregnant Brookman calls a halt to the relationship sending Maud into a tailspin One winter night she appears at his door shouting and obviously drunk In front of the disbanding crowd from a sporting event down the block the couple struggle Maud breaking away is hit and fatally injured by a passing car Lou Salmone the policeman assigned to the case happens to be an old friend of Mauds father Eddie and is keen to seek justice for Maud Eddie meanwhile has tortures of his own the moral agonies of an upright man once compromised by the criminal activities of his crooked brotherinlaw He now worries that Mauds fate may be his punishment There is moreover the complicating factor that only days before her death Maud published an inflammatory article in the university newspaper deriding the antiabortion demonstrators outside the local hospital an article that dismayed even her supporters and prompted death threats from her opponents In addition to Brookman and her father Maud is watched over by her roommate a flamboyant actress turned drama student named Shelby Magoffin and by a college counselor Jo Carr a middleaged former nun whose perspective has been shaped by her distant youth as a radical Roman Catholic ministering to the faithful in South America Salmone must determine whether Brookman is responsible for Mauds death or whether Shelbys unstable exhusband John Clammer is involved or whether an antiabortion extremist has made good on the groups threats Jo Carr frightened by the glimpse of a face from her past suspects a shadowy and violent priest These machinations seem from the first halfhearted The outlandish and implausible Shelby nicknamed Shell Magoffin must prove to be a MacGuffin as does Clammer her exhusband a clamorer Each of the other central characters has a preferred suspect and in each instance this chiefly pertains to the history or neurosis of the individual character It soon becomes clear that Stone isnt really interested in a whodunit  this very structure proves a MacGuffin  but rather is addressing greater even spiritual questions When asked about his lapsed Catholicism in a 1985 Paris Review interview Stone observed Somebody has said that its almost as hard to stop being a Catholic as it is to stop being a black This is the position of Jo Carr although she has come to despise both the Catholic Church and its archenemies Mauds violent animosity toward the antiabortion demonstrators is born in part of her rebellion against her abnormally devout adolescence Eddie Stack feels sympathy with the young man at his AA meeting who announces that Ive been in eternal pursuit of my childhood faith Crazy John Clammer is under the sway of the again suggestively named Dr Russell Fumes pastor of the Church of the Savior in rural Kentucky If this were Shakespeare these guys would be the comic relief complete with regional accents The only two characters in the novel who appear firmly grounded are Steven Brookmans wife Ellie a woman of such faith that as she puts it I    still believe that God wills what I must do and Mary Pick a British Catholic now married to the college dean whose first husband was killed and son blinded by an IRA bomb she cites the medieval mystic Julian of Norwich All shall be well and all shall be well and all manner of thing shall be well Everyone  with the possible exception of Brookman who sees Ellie as the source of his salvation  is searching And faith then would seem to be the answer for those who can find it But faith may also be born of isolation or at least detachment from the world It is not insignificant that Ellies hometown White Lake Saskatchewan is far removed in both space and in some ways time In contrast the college town of Amesbury in which the novel largely unfolds and which bears some resemblance to New Haven where Stone has taught might prompt Stones characters to observe  quoting Marlowes Mephistopheles in Doctor Faustus the subject of an essay Maud writes for Brookman  Why this is hell nor am I out of it Stone turns his considerable powers of concrete evocation to describing Amesburys almost mythically dystopian landscape populated by the indigent and the mentally unstable This is a place where some people are afraid to walk even a few blocks and the college barricades itself with countless gates and locks Here is a typical Amesbury vista Along the curbs of Camp Street stood ridges of soiled snow refrozen after a thaw being layered over once again by the falling flakes There was black ice scarred with skid marks near the curb and frozen dead leaves that clogged the streets drains peeled rubber in the gutter blackened chunks of tailpipe wands of aluminum siding In this real world of considerable ugliness Maud  beautiful intelligent idealistic young and full of promise  would seem inexorably doomed But Maud herself is barely present as a realized character just as Ellie is only dimly perceptible through her halo Even Jo Carr despite powerful recollections of her time in Latin America proves in emotion and motivation difficult to discern The novels conflict resides chiefly in Steven Brookman and Eddie Stack lover and father each veined with a narcissism that prompts him to claim Mauds loss At first Stack had cried over the violence of his daughters death But the more he thought about it the more it seemed connected to his own fate and nature and he cried no longer And for Brookman He did not believe that he had killed Maud by loving her through what had happened between them Still there was some kind of blood debt something to be endured as a result of what had happened Brookman suffers an ancient anger that must bring about some unknowable retribution  His yielding to the spell of Maud the pain he had caused Ellie his coming into the path of the unfortunate old mans revenge all were mysteriously part of it It doesnt really matter that the two mens narratives of guilt are projections They are certainly residually Christian narratives but theyre ultimately examples of our human need to find meaning in what threaten to be incomprehensible events to frame the worlds brutality in some ennobling fashion Stone isnt known as a humorist but a dark comedy permeates this novel culminating most strangely in Eddie Stacks battle to place his daughters ashes with her mothers inside the crypt of the Holy Redeemer Church Just as theres no evading our fundamental moral formation theres no escape from its bureaucratic absurdities Brookman on the other hand as befits his greater good fortune is granted a more exotic near Chekhovian illumination some time later and far away on the Kamchatka Peninsula

Donâ€™t Mess With My â€˜Sacred Valuesâ€™,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/dont-mess-with-my-sacred-values.html,ACCORDING to news reports a key factor in last weekends diplomatic impasse over Irans nuclear program was Irans insistence on what President Hassan Rouhani has called its right to enrich uranium National interests are our red line he declared echoing earlier statements by other Iranian leaders Western officials appear flummoxed Why would Iran refuse to budge even when offered the considerable financial incentive of lessened sanctions They shouldnt be surprised Researchers who study sacred values  moral imperatives were unwilling to compromise on be they political religious or personal  have detected just such a pattern of intransigence When sacred values are in play studies show any proposal of economic incentives to make a deal is liable to backfire And for the Iranian leadership nuclear power has evidently become such an issue  The study of what are now called sacred values began in the mid90s with two psychologists Jonathan Baron at the University of Pennsylvania and Philip Tetlock then at the University of California Berkeley In both economics and game theory the conventional assumption is that we humans are rational actors  that we respond to a given situation by weighing our options and picking the one that seems to offer the greatest benefit But psychologists who study actual people as opposed to abstractions of people have long been aware that humans dont always exhibit behavior an economist would consider rational Professors Tetlock and Baron both challenged the assumption that anything can be had for a price Faced with mundane choices people will readily alter their behavior in response to money You can pay someone to clean your house or defend you in a murder trial But with issues like gun control or abortion a fundamentally different calculus seems to be at work Economic tradeoffs  like lifting an embargo in exchange for concessions  suddenly become unacceptable As Professor Tetlock now also at the University of Pennsylvania has observed even to suggest such a tradeoff is to invite moral outrage along with feelings of contamination and a need for moral cleansing  Sacredvalue conflicts can be lessened sometimes just by reframing the issue When Professor Tetlock and a colleague asked people about President Bill Clintons practice of rewarding big campaign donors with a night in the Lincoln Bedroom they got varying reactions depending on how the question was phrased If they presented it as an economic transaction  pay 250000 or more and get a night in the White House  even Clinton supporters were indignant But when the practice was painted as the kind of thing youd do for a friend much less outrage ensued  Not every issue can be so easily finessed  but whatever the circumstance money seems a subject best avoided When Scott Atran of the French National Center for Scientific Research and Jeremy Ginges of the New School for Social Research asked people in the Middle East about potential solutions to the IsraeliPalestinian conflict they found that the mention of money frequently incited moral outrage Among Palestinian refugees those who were open to compromise responded favorably to the idea of giving up their right of return to Israel in exchange for financial support for the new state of Palestine But when moral absolutists among the refugees were offered this solution they greeted it with anger disgust and increased support for violence Symbolic gestures  like Israels giving up of its claim on the West Bank  had the opposite effect The same pattern held with Jewish settlers in the West Bank As the West Bank is to Israelis and Palestinians nuclear power is becoming to many Iranians Powerful figures there have linked the issue to the history of foreign exploitation of Irans oil resources in an effort to reframe it as a matter of national pride A recent online survey led by Morteza Dehghani of the University of Southern California suggests that this may be working 14 percent of Professor Dehghanis respondents treated nuclear power as a sacred value For some observers this raises a troubling question How do you know for sure if someone is expressing a deeply held belief  or just bluffing as a negotiation strategy  Neuroscience just might hold an answer As psychologists examine what we think brain scientists are trying to figure out where we think it The results suggest we have radically different ways of processing ordinary and sacred beliefs In one recent experiment Gregory Berns a neuroeconomist at Emory University took MRI images of participants brains as he asked them to consider changing their personal beliefs in exchange for money Would they trade their preference for dogs over cats What about their belief in God Would they be willing to kill an innocent person When participants were questioned about issues of the dogorcat variety their brain scans showed activity in the parietal cortex  a region thats thought to be involved in making costbenefit calculations But when asked about issues on which they declined to make a trade entirely different parts of the brain were activated  systems that are associated with telling right from wrong and with storing and retrieving rules The result Professor Berns observes could be a new way to gauge sacred values that is not solely dependent on selfreport  Are we going to start running international negotiators through an MRI machine to see where theyre processing the issues Highly unlikely But results like Professor Bernss might at least disprove the idea still held by many that every belief has its price Given the intensely negative emotions that financial incentives can trigger this might be a good lesson to learn 
Chinaâ€™s New Agenda,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/opinion/sunday/chinas-new-agenda.html,In one of several surprising and potentially welcome shifts in policy Chinas leaders announced Friday that they would relax Chinas draconian onechild policy and end its brutal reeducation through labor camps They also outlined several ambitious economic initiatives that could make the country more hospitable to private enterprise in the coming years Even so they were silent on when and how they would carry out these reforms and they made clear that the nation would remain under firm oneparty rule and that neither political dissent nor democracy would be tolerated much less embraced anytime soon In a long statement issued Friday following the Central Committee conference Beijing promised 60 reforms some of which could significantly change China The initiatives include plans to limit the use of the death penalty allow private investors to start banks give farmers more flexibility in leasing their land and crack down on pollution through new taxes and stricter enforcement of existing clean air regulations We must certainly have the courage and conviction to renew ourselves President Xi Jinping said As part of its new initiatives the government will create two new oversight groups one composed of senior officials charged with pushing through economic reforms another that would resemble the US National Security Council to oversee domestic security and foreign policy Since they took office last year Mr Xi and Prime Minister Li Keqiang have frequently spoken about the need for reforms in economic policy while also making clear that they intend to strengthen the Communist Partys authority Mr Xi has denounced Western constitutional democracy and his officials have harassed and mistreated human rights defenders and political dissidents The announcement of a new national security panel suggests that Mr Xi intends to strengthen his grip on the domestic security apparatus and the foreign affairs bureaucracy It is always unwise to make snap judgments about where Chinas leaders are headed since the system is so opaque But there could be an upside to a new national security committee of highlevel officials if it can rein in other Chinese officials eager for confrontation with neighbors like Japan or if it can help coordinate a more effective response to climate change But the greater fear now is that it will also serve as a vehicle for repression making it easier for the authoritarian government to persecute Muslim protesters in Xinjiang Buddhists in Tibet and critics in general Set against the governments authoritarian record the announcements on family size and labor camps are genuinely surprising Chinas onechild policy in particular has defined the states power to control individual lives China first restricted childbirths in the 1970s because it feared that an exploding population imposed an unsustainable burden on economic development From time to time the policy has been relaxed in some parts of the country and for certain ethnic minorities But it has often been brutally applied to force women into abortions The policy has been criticized not only by human rights advocates but by economists because it contributes to the aging of Chinas population and its shrinking labor forceÂ Under the new policy couples Â will be allowed to have two children if one parent is an only child As for forced reeducation introduced by Mao Zedong to lock away political opponents Beijing now promises to give smalltime criminals and political dissidents their day in court through communitybased corrections systems instead of dispatching them to labor camps Chinese leaders have used similar meetings of top officials to outline major policy changes that are then fleshed out over the next several years The leadership has not always succeeded in delivering on those promises The previous regime led by President Hu Jintao for instance failed to reduce the economys unhealthy dependence on exports and investment and give greater emphasis to consumer spending But if carried through some of the initiatives outlined in the latest meeting could significantly improve the lives of Chinese people
"In One County, the Stateâ€™s Political Future",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/17/us/in-one-county-the-states-political-future.html,FOREST HILL  As she entered a Lubys on Monday morning in this Democratic enclave southeast of Fort Worth State Senator Wendy Davis drew a warm welcome from the roughly 100 attendees at a Veterans Day breakfast Ms Davis Democrat of Fort Worth had filed to run for governor of Texas two days earlier The sacrifices youve made on behalf of each of us will not be forgotten she said I will make sure to fight that we do a better job a dramatically better job Nine hours later and 20 miles north in the conservative city of Bedford Attorney General Greg Abbott the leading Republican candidate for governor received a standing ovation as he unveiled new planks in his campaign platform to a church full of Tea Party conservatives It takes warriors Mr Abbott said It takes patriots who are willing to stand up and fight back against the liberal agenda You all are those patriots You all are those warriors The two scenes capture the split political personality that has emerged this year in Tarrant County  both the largest reliably Republican county in Texas and ground zero of Democrats efforts to shift the state The county home of the Dallas Cowboys and Texas fifth and seventhlargest cities Fort Worth and Arlington has become a focal point in the states political future  Houston Dallas Austin El Paso San Antonio  all of these are blue theyre all Democratic areas said Jim Riddlesperger a political science professor at Texas Christian University Fort Worth is the last holdout Republicans have of the big cities For most of the 20th century Democrats dominated politics across Texas Amid the Reagan revolution of the 1980s Republicans made inroads in Tarrant County and elsewhere By the mid1990s the Republican Party held a majority of the countys political offices and was well on its way to overtaking the political landscape statewide  Ms Davis whose filibuster of abortion legislation catapulted her into the spotlight this year is one of two rising political stars from Fort Worth drawing national attention to Tarrant County George P Bush the son of former Gov Jeb Bush of Florida is a Republican candidate for land commissioner  Political observers have cited Tarrant County as a bellwether arguing that if Democrats were to ever win the county again it would be a sign that the state is poised to flip politically as well But Republicans see nothing that will change Tarrant from red to blue in 2014 And Ms Davis has been careful to frame her run as aimed at increasing Democratic turnout statewide and not specifically in her home county Nonetheless her decision to base her campaign for governor in Fort Worth has energized Tarrant County Democrats Battleground Texas a Democratic group trying to make the state politically competitive again has recently relocated some staff members to Fort Worth to coordinate better with Ms Daviss campaign  Local party leaders predict that all the attention will persuade more Democrats to compete in local races Its been hard to get Democrats to run in these ballot positions because of the recognition that its a Republican county said Steve Maxwell a former Tarrant County Democratic Party chairman The attention Wendy is getting is going to result in more people running on the ballot in these spots than weve had in years In 2006 Democrats in neighboring Dallas County swept more than 40 local races upending the countys longstanding Republican leadership overnight The Tarrant County district clerk Tom Wilder a Republican who has been active in the local party for decades said Dallas Republicans got complacent They were just coasting off the top of the ticket and they never built a base Mr Wilder said We dont have that problem in Tarrant County Indeed Tarrant Countys geography has played a role in the areas Republican dominance Whereas many conservatives in Dallas and Houston left the cities for suburbs in neighboring counties Tarrant County has retained many of those voters in smaller suburban cities in its northeast quadrant an area in which Tea Party groups have moved the Republican Party further to the right in recent years It is an uppermiddleclass professional part of Tarrant County Dr Riddlesperger said Demographically they look like the Tea Party does nationally The NE Tarrant Tea Party the group Mr Abbott addressed this week has emerged as a key player In a few years the group has helped replace a handful of local Republican elected officials whom activists found to be insufficiently conservative  We know the Republicans are going to win in this area so the primaries are the key elections for us said Julie McCarty the groups president  An analysis of lawmakers votes from this years legislative session by Mark P Jones a political science professor at Rice University found the Tarrant delegation in the Texas House to be the most polarized in the state in part because of the rightward shift of freshman Republicans elected with Tea Party support  The sort of heart of this libertarianTeaPartymovement wing of the House delegation the epicenter is in Tarrant County Dr Jones said Rice University is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune Ms McCarty agreed that local libertarians and Tea Party activists have forged a productive partnership in recent years by finding common ground on concerns about state fiscal issues  I dont think the Tea Party can win without the libertarians and I dont think the libertarians can win without the Tea Party Ms McCarty said Former Representative Todd Smith a Republican from the northeast Tarrant city of Euless defeated a Tea Partybacked primary challenge in 2010 before failing in a State Senate bid last year He said the local Republican Party now felt dominated by activists who did not want elected officials who could think for themselves I dont know whether gubernatorial candidate Wendy Davis has a chance to win that election or not but I do believe that this Tea Party radicalism enhances her chances Mr Smith said  Representative Jonathan Stickland a Bedford Republican who replaced Mr Smith in the House and has strong ties to local Tea Party groups countered that both Democrats and Republicans play a role in the countys polarization The Tea Party gets credit for pulling the Republican Party to the right but the Democrats are eating some of their moderates alive too Mr Stickland said I think more than anything Tarrant County is kind of ahead of the game on both ends because their voters and activists are handson and very engaged
"Doris Lessing, Author Who Swept Aside Convention, Is Dead at 94",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/books/doris-lessing-novelist-who-won-2007-nobel-is-dead-at-94.html,Doris Lessing the uninhibited and outspoken novelist who won the 2007 Nobel Prize for a lifetime of writing that shattered convention both social and artistic died on Sunday at her home in London She was 94 Her death was confirmed by her publisher HarperCollins Ms Lessing produced dozens of novels short stories essays and poems drawing on a childhood in the Central African bush the teachings of Eastern mystics and involvement with grassroots Communist groups She embarked on dizzying and at times stultifying literary experiments  But it was her breakthrough novel The Golden Notebook a structurally inventive and loosely autobiographical tale that remained her bestknown work The 1962 book was daring in its day for its frank exploration of the inner lives of women who unencumbered by marriage were free to raise children or not and pursue work and their sex lives as they chose The book dealt openly with topics like menstruation and orgasm as well as with the mechanics of emotional breakdown  Her editor at HarperCollins Nicholas Pearson said on Sunday that The Golden Notebook had been a handbook for a whole generation As a writer from colonial Africa to modern London Ms Lessing scrutinized relationships between men and women social inequities and racial divisions As a woman she pursued her own interests and desires professional political and sexual Seeking what she considered a free life she abandoned two young children Still Salon in an interview with Ms Lessing in 1997 said that with her centerparted hair thats pulled back into a bun and her steely eyes she seems like a tightly wound earth mother It was this figure 10 years later who arrived at her house in sensible shoes to find journalists gathered at her door waiting to tell her that she had won the Nobel Prize for literature Oh Christ she said upon hearing the news adding I couldnt care less  The Nobel announcement called her the epicist of the female experience who with skepticism fire and visionary power has subjected a divided civilization to scrutiny And in the presentation speech at the Nobel ceremonies in Stockholm Ms Lessing was described as having personified the womans role in the 20th century She accepted the prize at a ceremony in London The cavalier and curmudgeonly Ms Lessing was making headlines again a few days after the announcement dismissing the Sept 11 2001 attacks in the United States as not that terrible compared to the toll from decades of Irish Republican Army violence   The Golden Notebook  The Golden Notebook which critics generally consider her best novel has been published in many languages and 50 years after it first appeared it is still in print It consists of a conventional novel Free Women and several notebooks each in a different color kept by the protagonist Anna Wulf a novelist struggling with writers block The black notebook deals with Africa and the novel Anna wrote from her experiences there the red notebook chronicles her Communist Party days the yellow is an autobiographical novel within the larger novel the blue is a diary of sorts The golden notebook at the end brings together ideas and thoughts from the other sections  Ms Lessing wrote that she had intended the novel to capture the chaotic period after the Soviet Union officially renounced Stalinism Under the pressure of the revelations about Stalins crimes the movement that had been the glue of her social and intellectual circle came undone She considered the novel to be a triumph of structure By fragmenting the story she said she wanted to show the danger of compartmentalizing ones thinking the idea that any kind of singlemindedness narrowness obsession was bound to lead to mental disorder if not madness But her book was seen as a feminist work a response that irritated her Even though her novels and stories were filled with the issues at the core of the feminist movement Ms Lessing had sharp words for feminists Speaking at the 92nd Street Y in Manhattan in 1970 during the Vietnam War she told her audience Ive got the feeling that the sex war is not the most important war going on nor is it the most vital problem in our lives In 1994 she was no less critical Things have changed for white middleclass women she said but nothing has changed outside this group While some ideas embraced by the womens movement came naturally to her she differed with the movement on some issues in Under My Skin the first volume of her autobiography published in 1994 On sexual harassment for example she wrote that contemporary women scream or swoon at the sight of a penis they have not been introduced to feel demeaned by a suggestive remark and send for a lawyer if a man pays them a compliment Doris May Tayler was born on Oct 22 1919 in Kermanshah Persia now Iran the first child of Alfred Cook Tayler a British bank official and the former Emily Maude McVeagh Mr Tayler was injured in World War I and lost a leg Miss McVeagh was his nurse  Ms Lessing wrote in Under My Skin that her birth was a disappointment to them and that the doctor who delivered her had to come up with a name because her parents had rejected the possibility that they might have a girl  Her descriptions of growing up are colored by resentment toward her mother who never let her forget how much she had sacrificed for her children She found an ally of sorts in her father but he also seeded her childhood with stories of World War I which Ms Lessing said imbued her with fatalism The family moved to Southern Rhodesia now Zimbabwe determined to make its fortune farming corn On the farm Doris was taught by her mother and read all the books she could find She was sent to boarding school and then to a convent school  Convent school turned her into a Roman Catholic but her conversion was merely a stop on the way to atheism  She left school at 14 and lived at home for a while But as the friction with her mother became unbearable she made two forays to Southern Rhodesias capital Salisbury and between those stints wrote and tore up two novels In Salisbury where there was a shortage of women Doris had her pick of partners for dancing films and drinks at the Sports Club Looking back she singled out the dance music as the most seductive influence but underlying it she wrote was nature preparing us to replenish the population between world wars The force exerted itself quickly She managed to disengage Frank Wisdom a civil servant from his fiance and married him in 1939 She wrote that she was pregnant at the time but did not know it She sought an abortion several times but each time some circumstance intervened she wrote When she finally was told the pregnancy was too far advanced she went home relieved In retrospect she said now it seems to me obvious I knew all the time I was pregnant was in alliance with nature against myself Her first child John exhausted her But she found solace when she drifted into a group whose members considered themselves revolutionaries She was excited by their ideas and became in effect a Communist  Ms Lessing began distributing the South African Communist Party newspaper and protesting the color bar laws that kept power in the hands of the white minority In 1943 her daughter Jean was born By this point the author was disillusioned with being a Salisbury matron and Jean spent much of her first year in the care of others  Striking Off on Her Own  Finally Ms Lessing decided to leave her children her husband and her home to pursue her ideals and life with her friends and comrades She moved out of the family home to a rented room took a job as a typist and kept up with news of the children through a relative This drastic step was accorded no more than a few pages in her autobiography and she dwelled on neither her reasons nor her regrets at any length in interviews I couldnt stand that life Ms Lessing said in the Salon interview Its this business of giving all the time day and night trying to conform to something you hate If she had stayed with her family she would have infected the children with the sense of doom she carried within her like a defective gene she explained in Under My Skin With this idea I was protecting myself because I knew I was going to leave she wrote Yet I did not know it could not say I am going to commit the unforgivable and leave two small children She also wrote that she was having an affair at the time but did not consider it to be an important factor in her decision Michiko Kakutani reviewing the first volume of the autobiography in The New York Times said Ms Lessings matteroffact tone in writing about this period leaves a vivid if somewhat chilling picture of the author as a selfabsorbed and heedless young woman The second volume Walking in the Shade covered the years 1949 to 1962 In 1943 she married Gottfried Anton Nicolai Lessing a German Communist because she said it was her revolutionary duty to protect him in a wartime environment hostile to Germans Their plan was to divorce after the war They had a son Peter It was during this marriage which was interlaced with affairs on both sides that Ms Lessing had what she called that classical love affair every woman should have just once When she began to fantasize about having a baby with her married lover she decided that she had to outsmart nature with sterilization surgery  Her divorce from Mr Lessing went according to plan In 1949 she departed for England taking her son Peter as well as the manuscript to her first novel The Grass Is Singing about the relationship between a white farmers wife and her black male servant It was published in 1950 to a warm reception and was later adapted as a film Her first volume of short stories This Was the Old Chiefs Country appeared the next year  Her fivenovel series The Children of Violence explores coming of age in British colonial Africa marrying and bearing children there and moving to London This weighty series of books  Martha Quest 1952 A Proper Marriage 1954 A Ripple From the Storm 1958 Landlocked 1965 and The FourGated City 1969  remolds some of the issues and situations treated in The Golden Notebook war Communism sex abortion domestic violence abandoning children psychoanalysis and breakdown But the series reaches forward to the next millennium and the destruction of the earth Many of Ms Lessings novels are long dense and complex Her prose one critic said can be indigestible J M Coetzee wrote that Lessing has never been a great stylist  she writes too fast and prunes too lightly for that  Into Science Fiction  When she entered the realm of science fiction she disappointed some of her staunchest supporters Her Canopus in Argos series which began with Re Colonized Planet 5 Shikasta in 1979 was greeted with both surprise and regret  John Leonard who classified The Golden Notebook among the sacred texts of our time reviewed The Making of the Representative for Planet 8 one of the books in the series in 1982 saying One of the many sins for which the 20th century will be held accountable is that it has discouraged Mrs Lessing She will transport herself no longer writing novels like a Balzac with brains but instead Books of Revelation charts of the elements and their valences She adapted that book and another work from the series as an opera The Marriages Between Zones Three Four and Five with Philip Glass In the 1980s she published what amounted to a joke on the publishing industry and on critics two books written  and submitted to publishers  under the pseudonym Jane Somers The Diary of a Good Neighbour and If the Old Could Both were rejected by Jonathan Cape which had long been her British publisher As she had predicted once they were published they received little critical attention Later they were rereleased in one volume under Ms Lessings name as The Diaries of Jane Somers a book praised for the way it portrayed growing old in Britain Alfred  Emily published in 2008 is halffiction halfmemoir  on the one hand recounting her parents lives as they eked out a living on a small farm in what was then Southern Rhodesia and on the other imagining what their lives might have been like if World War I had not occurred Among the major influences on her thought Ms Lessing named Communism and Sufism In between she embraced the psychiatry of R D Laing She also counted Central Africa World War I and her reading And of course there is her mother who keeps arising in one guise or another After reading the first volume of her autobiography Mr Coetzee commented There is something depressing in the spectacle of a woman in her 70s still wrestling with an unsubjugated ghost from the past On the other hand there is no denying the grandeur of the spectacle when the protagonist is as mordantly honest and passionately desirous of salvation as Doris Lessing Later in life she divorced herself from all isms stridently expressing opinions that were often contentious Her Nobel acceptance speech delivered for her by her editor contrasted traditional printed literature with the Internets inanities  Readers did not stop interpreting her work in ways that infuriated her In The Fifth Child published in 1988 Ms Lessing wrote of an attractive family with four children that is shattered by the birth of the fifth a monstrous aberration She said the book tapped a reservoir of inner grief and she was outraged at the response to the novel which she said was at once pigeonholed as being about the Palestinian problem genetic research feminism antiSemitism and so on In 2000 she published Ben in the World a sequel to The Fifth Child and in 2002 The Sweetest Dream a fictional account focusing on the 1960s that she said would stand in for her third volume of autobiography In her review in The Times Ms Kakutani called The Sweetest Dream a novel whose moments of brilliance are obscured by reams of tiresome exposition hokey plot twists and astonishingly opaque characters Ms Lessings survivors include her daughter Jean Cowen who lives in South Africa and two granddaughters Her son John Wisdom a farmer in Zimbabwe died in 1992 The Guardian of London reported that her son Peter died three weeks ago  After a stroke in the late 1990s Ms Lessing said she would no longer travel Constantly reminded of her mortality she said she became consumed with deciding what she should write in the precious time that remained But in discussing her writing in 2008 she said It has stopped I dont have any energy anymore This is why I keep telling anyone younger than me dont imagine youll have it forever Use it while youve got it because itll go its sliding away like water down a plug hole 
Cheney Family Values,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/19/opinion/bruni-cheney-family-values.html,If Liz Cheney whose bid for the Senate has always had a stench of extreme opportunism wants to discuss traditions and values Im all for it Lets start here Isnt there a tradition of closeknit family members taking care not to wound one another Is there not value in that From the moment that Liz decided from the perch of her longtime home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington to act the part of an honesttogoodness Wyoming resident and challenge an incumbent senator and family friend from that state she must have known that the issue of samesex marriage would come up It is after all a prominent thread in the news Its also a prominent thread in stories about her family given that her father Dick bucked his party to become an early Republican supporter of samesex marriage and given that her lone sibling Mary has a female spouse She must also have entertained speaking out against it because thats what she ended up doing on Sunday on Fox News saying that she believed in the traditional definition of marriage And she must have foreseen that this would pain Mary who was married last year and whose two children are being brought up with the understanding that their family has the same dignity as any other  But she plunged forward anyway disregarding the inevitable discord As Jonathan Martin reported in The Times Liz and Mary arent speaking to each other now and theres a long shadow over the Cheneys holiday gettogethers Is any political office worth that Would victory redeem the public message that Liz just sent to her niece and nephew Im imagining her awkwardness the next time that she goes to hug or kiss them and Im assuming that shes a hugger or kisser which may be a leap If theres not a knot in her stomach then theres nothing at all in her heart Having a lesbian sister doesnt compel her to support marriage equality Having a gay relative doesnt compel anyone to There are earnest divisions here often driven by deepseated religious convictions But Lizs decision to chart a course and publicize a view bound to offend her sister is entirely volitional Its also entirely different from airing other ideological disagreements within families Conflicting views on abortion or the death penalty dont challenge the very structure and foundation of a loved ones home Questioning the validity of a marriage does Youre not saying that you part with the way someone thinks Youre saying that you have qualms with who they are and this is a statement  a sentiment  you can keep to yourself Even once Liz had elected to run she could have chosen to say that the issue of gay marriage wasnt going to be part of her campaign Is she even being genuine in her opposition In a 2009 interview about gay marriage on MSNBC she said that freedom means freedom for everybody On Monday I talked with three people who worked with her in the Bush administration and all were very surprised by her current stance Theyd had the strong impression that she favored samesex marriage Perhaps Mary and her wife Heather Poe did as well because Poe wrote this on Facebook after Lizs appearance on Fox News Liz has been a guest in our home has spent time and shared holidays with our children and when Mary and I got married in 2012  she didnt hesitate to tell us how happy she was for us Happy back then selfserving and seemingly cowardly now This feels to me like a political maneuver tailored to a conservative electorate and an unnecessary maneuver at that with the risk of making her seem inauthentic and uncharitable to Wyoming voters whove had more than a decade to absorb her dads socially moderate views Gay marriage wont be those voters primary secondary or tertiary issue anyway In a statement released Monday Dick and Lynne Cheney insisted that Liz had always believed in the traditional definition of marriage I suppose thats the politically prudent tack at this point but now the Cheneys support for gay marriage so moving over the years is buried beneath a family feud Their statement paid less attention to Mary whos not running for anything not carrying her parents ambitions into a new era One word stood out They said that Liz had shown Mary compassion This echoed a statement of Lizs own in which she noted that she had always tried to be compassionate toward Mary and her family What a curious vocabulary It was as if they were all talking about some charity case I hope the Cheneys find their way out of this Its an ugly spot that Liz in all her compassion has put them in
Reid Preparing to Move for Limits on Filibuster,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/us/politics/senate-democrats-consider-move-to-curb-filibusters.html,WASHINGTON  Senator Harry Reid the majority leader is prepared to move forward with a vote that could severely limit the minority partys ability to filibuster presidential nominees possibly as early as this week Democrats said Tuesday Exasperated with the refusal of Senate Republicans to confirm many of President Obamas nominees Mr Reid has been speaking individually with members of his caucus to gauge whether there is enough support to change filibuster rules Given how much deference senators have traditionally shown to the rules and procedures of the institution  many of them in place since the 18th century  any modifications are a serious undertaking But among Democrats there is a strong consensus that Republicans have gone too far in their latest attempt to block White House appointments by denying Mr Obama any more judges for what is considered the most important appeals court in the country despite three vacancies On Monday they denied him his third pick in less than a month to the court the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit If Mr Reid determines he has the support he could schedule a vote before Friday an aide who has spoken with him directly said Tuesday If the votes are there we will probably do it this week the aide said speaking anonymously to divulge internal plans A second Democratic aide said Mr Reid would go ahead once the Senate had wrapped up debate on a contentious proposal to combat sexual assault in the military  Support has been building in the Democratic caucus to make the change which would most likely affect federal judges and executive branch nominees like cabinet members It would not affect the minority partys right to filibuster Supreme Court nominees or legislation Mr Reid of Nevada has picked up crucial support from some of his more reluctant members recently Senator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont and the longestserving member of the Senate today who is chairman of the Judiciary Committee has endorsed putting limits on the filibuster despite his history of being protective of Senate institutions The two senators from California Dianne Feinstein and Barbara Boxer said separately on Tuesday that they were leaning toward a rules change  Their support was seen as crucial because they are both supportive of abortion rights and have been leery of making any changes that could prevent them from standing in the way of an antiabortion judge Im for changing the rules Ms Feinstein said emphatically rejecting the argument that she and many other Democrats have made in the past that altering the nature of the filibuster could come back to haunt them Republicans say Well what goes around comes around Wait until were in charge I cant wait until theyre in charge The moment is now she added Ms Feinstein made the same case to her colleagues in a closeddoor lunch on Tuesday where Democrats discussed whether they should move forward with a step so controversial it is called the nuclear option Separately on Tuesday Ms Boxer said she was very open to a change But holdouts within the Democratic caucus remain among those who are worried about a future in which they find themselves powerless to block nominees from a Republican White House And Mr Reid can only afford to lose a handful of his 55 members To change the rules he would need 51 votes Conceivably if he could get 50 he could call on Vice President Joseph R Biden Jr  himself a protector of Senate traditions who recently indicated support for a filibuster change  to break the tie but Democrats would rather avoid that possibility Asked Tuesday how many votes he thought he had Mr Reid said Well see There are still many reasons a rules change might not go through not the least of which is that Senate Democrats have gone down this road before only to pull back at the last minute In July Mr Reid was threatening to end filibusters on nonjudicial appointments but he relented after Republicans agreed to confirm several nominees they had held up Ms Feinstein said Tuesday that she had hoped Republicans would show more flexibility after the compromise but that had not been the case We left with a very good feeling there would be a new day she said Well the new day lasted maybe for a week The stakes seem higher this time for many Democrats Many of them strongly believe that if Mr Obama is not able to appoint any judges to the court  Republicans have rejected four of the five nominees he has submitted  it will retain its conservative bent for decades It is a crucially important court for any White House because it often decides cases that relate to administration or federal agency policies Republicans have proposed permanently removing the three seats that are now vacant arguing that the president would stack an underworked court with judges to his ideological liking But since that idea has no chance of becoming law their backup plan has been to filibuster any nomination to the court that Mr Obama sends to the Senate Gregory Wawro a professor of political science at Columbia University who has studied use of the filibuster said Republicans were on precarious ground Without passing legislation theyre basically trying to change what the structure of the judiciary looks like and I think that sets a dangerous precedent he said  How far do you take this he added Do you not fill these positions because you think you can block a president until you get the White House back
Justices Reject Bid to Block Texas Law on Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/us/supreme-court-rejects-bid-to-block-texas-abortion-law.html,WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Tuesday turned away an emergency application asking it to block a Texas law that requires doctors performing abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital The decision was effectively 5 to 4 and split along ideological lines The effect of the ruling Justice Stephen G Breyer wrote for the four dissenters was to leave 24 counties in the Rio Grande Valley without abortion clinics It may he added substantially reduce access to safe abortions elsewhere in Texas Justice Antonin Scalia joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel A Alito Jr wrote that the challengers to the law had not met a heavy procedural burden in asking the Supreme Court to alter an appeals courts provisional decision to let the law go into effect while it considers an appeal Reasonable minds can perhaps disagree about whether the court of appeals should have granted a stay in this case Justice Scalia wrote But there is no doubt that the applicants have not carried their heavy burden of showing that doing so was a clear violation of accepted legal standards  which do not include a special status quo standard for laws affecting abortion Chief Justice John G Roberts Jr and Justice Anthony M Kennedy also presumably voted to reject the application and allow the law to go into effect but did not join Justice Scalias opinion Abortion rights groups and clinics said the law served no medical purpose and was forcing a third of the states 36 abortion clinics to stop performing the procedure preventing some 20000 women a year from access to safe abortions State officials told the court that the law which requires that doctors have hospital admitting privileges within 30 miles of where they perform abortions protects public health by fostering a womans ability to seek consultation and treatment for complications directly from her physician The officials added that the impact of the law was modest saying that more than 90 percent of women seeking abortions in the state will still live within 100 miles of an abortion clinic The law had been temporarily stalled when Wendy Davis a Democratic state senator mounted an 11hour filibuster in the Republicancontrolled Legislature Ms Davis is now running for governor The case may yet reach the justices The United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in New Orleans provisionally allowed the law to go into effect last month The appeals court will hear arguments in the case in January and either side may appeal its decision to the Supreme Court Justice Breyer wrote that the validity of the Texas law is a difficult question He added that he expected the Supreme Court to agree to hear an appeal regardless of how the appeals court rules The appeals courts ruling stayed one from Judge Lee Yeakel a federal district judge in Austin who had blocked the law Judge Yeakel said the laws admittingprivileges provision is without a rational basis and places a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus Justice Breyer joined by Justices Ruth Bader Ginsburg Sonia Sotomayor and Elena Kagan said Judge Yeakels ruling should have been allowed to stand while the appeal was considered  At bottom the two sides in Tuesdays ruling differed about what it means to maintain the status quo while a case proceeds through the courts Justice Scalia said that the status quo is upheld and federalism principles are vindicated when validly enacted state laws are allowed to stand while their constitutionality is definitively resolved Justice Breyer focused on the practical consequences for women in Texas seeking abortions I would maintain the status quo of allowing clinics in Texas to provide abortions he wrote while the lower courts consider this difficult sensitive and controversial legal matter The longer a given facility remains closed Justice Breyer wrote the less likely it is ever to reopen even if the admitting privileges requirement is ultimately held unconstitutional
Bringing an End to a Senseless Policy,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/opinion/chinas-one-child-rule-should-be-scrapped.html,SHANGHAI  CHINA announced last week that it would loosen its famous onechild policy enforced since 1980 The worlds most controversial birthcontrol policy initially imposed as an emergency measure at the start of the economic reforms of Deng Xiaoping seems to finally be on its way out more than a generation later This change however has come rather late and it is still highly limited Since its inception more than 30 years ago China has made only one set of adjustments to the policy In the mid1980s responding to a backlash of violence and abuse associated with enforcement of the policy the government allowed rural couples with only a girl to have a second child so the parents could try for a son and later on couples who are both only children could have a second child Now couples will be allowed to have two children if just one parent is an only child To justify the excessive measure of birth control Chinese officials have repeatedly made the claim that the policy prevented 400 million births and contributed to the global success in population control This is a wildly exaggerated claim In China the birthrate dropped to 156 per thousand in 1998 from 334 per thousand in 1970 In a comparison group consisting of 16 countries that had populations of over one million and a birthrate equal to or higher than Chinas in 1970 the average birthrate dropped to 22 per thousand in 1998 from 356 per thousand in 1970 This suggests that without a coercive and costly policy Chinas birthrate would have declined as well though maybe not as much One in three families in China  some 150 million households  now have only one child Whereas the economic arguments for modifying the policy centered on the shrinkage in the number of young ablebodied workers and the rapid aging of the population Chinese societys concerns have centered on the breakdown in social relations at a time of wrenching change China is missing in short not only workers and taxpayers but also sons and daughters who can provide physical and emotional support to their parents The policy has extracted tremendous sacrifice from the Chinese population over the years and the costs are only beginning to become apparent History will look back at Chinas onechild policy with bewilderment even disbelief Of all the countries in the world that faced the fear of population explosion in the latter half of the 20th century only China went to such extremes and for so long Moreover the policy was formulated and imposed on the population after China had already achieved most of its modern fertility decline with the number of children expected for each couple more than halved between 1970 and 1979 from 58 to 27 The leaders who succeeded Mao Zedong after his death in 1976 tended to associate political legitimacy with birth control as the paramount goal of increasing percapita income hinged on the rising ability of the government to provide food education and employment and on limiting the number of people sharing in the fruits of economic growth The onechild policy was seen as key to the promise of rapidly rising prosperity and improvements in living conditions  which to the governments credit lifted hundreds of millions out of poverty However Chinas long indecision and delay in phasing out the onechild policy has made its longterm demographic prospects only seem even more questionable For over two decades fertility levels in China have been very low below the level of replacement which is 21 children per couple In the last decade the level has been no more than 15 converging with Chinas neighbors in East Asia who are among the worlds lowestfertility societies In Shanghai where many young couples have been allowed to have two children because both husband and wife were only children the 2010 census found a fertility level of 07 onethird the replacement level Within 20 years for every elderly person receiving benefits there will be only two taxpaying workers down from five now  a challenge that advanced economies from Germany to Japan are struggling with The phasingout of the onechild policy has overshadowed all the other decisions coming out of the influentialÂ twiceadecade meeting known as the Third Plenum The public has embraced the change with unexpected enthusiasm and good will They see the change as a clear and irrevocable move a break from empty promises They see it as a regaining of personal freedoms And they see it as a sign that the government in Beijing is finally catching up with the times This seemingly small measure has generated enormous good will and political capital for Chinas new leadership It will also help blunt criticisms of abuses like forced abortions and sterilizations and of the practice of sexselective abortions But China has only begun to embark on the journey to end its onechild policy Couples in which both husband and wife have a sibling are still left out New onlychild families in other words are still being created The real test for China now is how quickly it can implement the new policy change  and then move on to phase out the policy completely To squander that hardearned political good will could be suicidal
Albuquerque Voters Defeat Anti-Abortion Measure,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/us/albuquerque-voters-defeat-anti-abortion-referendum.html,ALBUQUERQUE  Voters here on Tuesday defeated a ballot question that sought to ban abortions after 20 weeks of pregnancy delivering a critical setback to an antiabortion movement that had sought to use this progressive city to recalibrate the national debate around womens reproductive rights The referendum the first of its kind in the country for a municipality was marked by record turnout and aggressive tactics by volunteers on both sides who sought to capitalize on the controversy and passion surrounding the issue to drive voters to the polls For political strategists it also offered a chance to test the way their message on abortion resonated among Hispanics a key constituency that accounts for nearly half of the residents in Albuquerque and New Mexico and is one of the fastestgrowing populations in the country This was a clear counterpunch to the Republicans and rightwingers who came from out of state to push their agenda on us Sam Bregman chairman of the New Mexico Democratic Party which campaigned hard against the ban said in an interview According to the city clerks office about 87000 votes were cast in the election or 25 percent of Albuquerques registered voters The final tally was 55 percent of votes against and 45 percent of votes for the abortion ban The ban would have affected the entire state given that the only two clinics that perform abortion at that stage in the pregnancy are in Albuquerque One Southwestern Womens Options is perhaps one of the only in the country to openly admit it does abortions after 20 weeks outofstate license plates can often be spotted in its parking lot Tara Shaver 29 a selfdescribed Christian missionary from Kansas who spearheaded the push to get the question on the ballot said that regardless of the defeat Well walk away with thousands of people educated about what abortion is The referendum gave conservative religious groups a chance to test their strategy of bringing the abortion fight from states to municipalities They have successfully pushed for changes in zoning and for other rules that close abortion clinics or keep them from opening Virginias busiest clinic in Fairfax closed in July after the city denied it a permit citing inadequate parking under a recently amended ordinance Here the groups used churches and neighborhood organizations to drum up support among voters On Tuesday a group prayed outside Bibles Plus a Christian bookstore and carried signs with pictures of aborted fetuses outside the Albuquerque Museum a polling site startling children on a field trip Yes we are radical  radical in our love in our protecting said Grace Lardizabal pastor at Transformation Ministries a Christian nondenominational church in Albuquerque holding her daughter 6 outside the bookstore We believe its our mission to save lives Organizers made a robust attempt to turn out Hispanics amid tugofwar efforts to determine whether the longheld belief that they are conservative on social issues would hold true Theres not a model anywhere in the country to help us figure out whether a Catholic Hispanic woman thinks that an abortion ban that makes no exception for rape or incest has gone too far said Pat Davis the executive director of ProgressNow New Mexico a grassroots advocacy group That he said could be one of the big takeaways of this vote So far 12 states have enacted bans on abortion at 18 or 20 weeks after conception based on the notion that the fetus feels pain at that point That argument while the subject of debate among scientists is widely regarded as the driving force behind a more general effort to limit abortion options The bans have been suspended in three states  Arizona Georgia and Idaho  where courts have found them to be too restrictive or unconstitutional Arizona is the only one among the 12 to have prohibited abortions at 18 weeks Forty years ago in Roe v Wade the United States Supreme Court legalized abortions until fetuses could survive outside the womb which doctors say is around 24 weeks According to the Guttmacher Institute a research group that supports abortion rights nine out of 10 abortions happen in the first 12 weeks of pregnancy Abortion opponents are nonetheless undeterred they have found a solid measure of support among politicians and voters Here the campaigns were pushed into overdrive by a lastminute infusion of money from national groups from both sides like Planned Parenthood and the Susan B Anthony List an antiabortion political action committee in Washington Combined the bans opponents and proponents raised roughly 1 million covering the costs of television ads and ground operations of unprecedented reach and size in this city The Democratic National Committee sent emails and members of the Columbia University College Democrats made phone calls prodding voters to cast ballots against the ban Volunteers flooded several neighborhoods before sunrise leaving leaflets outside homes A trolley shuttled students from the University of New Mexico campus to polling places all day Eli Wilson 20 a sophomore majoring in English and philosophy who delayed a trip to the library to board a trolley said I believe women have the right to have an abortion if they choose to so Im voting against it Sharon Shero 63 who described herself as a devout Christian voted early then gave some of her friends rides to the polls to get the vote out for the protection of the unborn she said Albuquerques record for the number of votes in a municipal election was broken during the earlyvoting period which ended Friday and the total cast on Tuesday surpassed that of the mayoral election last month by 17000 according to the city clerks office
Lives of Rich and Poor Cross in Hong Kong,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/movies/21iht-bends21Lives-of-Rich-and-Poor-Cross-in-Hong-Kong.html,HONG KONG  For all of Beijings political control over Hong Kong in the city itself the tables are often turned Mainland Chinese provide lowcost labor that propels the booming economy and pregnant mothers have long flocked to Hong Kongs hospitals where giving birth is a childs ticket to permanent residency in the city with its better doctors and quality schools This tension is at the heart of Bends a film that opens here on Thursday and in Taiwan on Friday In it a wealthy Hong Kong woman finds herself enmeshed in the complicated life of a poor mainland couple Her driver  worried about facing penalties for violating Chinas onechild policy and wishing for a better life for his child  seeks to have his wife deliver her second baby across the border in Hong Kong From her lavish apartment on Victoria Peak the woman also sees her affluent lifestyle start to crumble as her businessman husband disappears her credit cards are frozen and her daughters boarding school tuition is left unpaid The movie which has echoes of Woody Allens recent Blue Jasmine is the bigscreen debut of the Hong Kong filmmaker Flora Lau who wrote and directed the film after receiving notice for her short films one examining the plight of the tens of thousands of foreign domestic helpers in the city The movie was shown at the Cannes International Film Festival in May the only Hong Kong work to get that honor this year Ms Lau 34 a Hong Kong native was educated at Columbia University majoring in economics and working at Morgan Stanley before going to film school in London As she returned to Hong Kong she saw a city constantly changing but one increasingly riven by economic inequality fueled by its growing prosperity At first it was the Filipino domestic helpers situation that interested me she wrote in an email about the university graduates who had to leave their country to take up domestic work in Hong Kong As I found out more she added it was their stories that touched me and I felt a need to study film as a language to express what I was observing Since film school I returned to Hong Kong once again and saw that the class divide  and the Hong Kong versus mainlander divide  was intensifying Her movie captures the opulent lifestyle of the tai tai the term for a prosperous married woman who need not work a figure who is alternately ridiculed and envied in Hong Kong In Bends that character Anna Li played by Carina Lau she is not related to the filmmaker spends her days lunching at pricey restaurants with friends downing wine at midday and being ferried about by her driver Fai played by Chen Kun Fai has a permit to work in Hong Kong while his pregnant wife raises their daughter across the border in Shenzhen As Annas life falls apart she keeps up appearances paying for an expensive lunch with friends as the money gets harder and harder to find She starts selling the house valuables The Filipino housekeeper one day announces she is leaving to return to her homeland and Anna barely raises her head showing her emotional distance from the people who share her home But Anna is unwittingly thrust into Fais life as he grows increasingly desperate to come up with the money to get his wife to Hong Kong to deliver the child He starts selling parts of her Mercedes to a mechanic who puts on cheap replacements When the cars airconditioning no longer works Anna complains While Ms Lau the filmmaker had a familiarity with Annas lifestyle in Hong Kong capturing life across the border in Shenzhen was more challenging I started to get to know families who are separated by the border and people who had to cross the border to get to work every day she said I went with a friend to the baby agencies pretending to be pregnant and wanting to go to Hong Kong to give birth In a sign of how quickly change happens in China the movie was almost overtaken by events Last week Beijing announced it was relaxing the onechild rule but officials later said the overhaul would be carried out by provinciallevel officials raising doubts about how quickly the policy would change The movie gives a gripping view of the fear held by a family facing the prospect of having a child in violation of the rule  where families are subject to ruinous financial penalties The wife suggests getting an abortion and Fai desperately schemes to get the documentation to have her give birth in Hong Kong as time runs out on her pregnancy But it is the portrayal of mainlandHong Kong relations that may strike a particular chord Ms Laus film which was several years in the making is being released as tensions have grown between the locals and the wealthy mainland Chinese who descend on the citys malls and draw scorn for what many view as their crass behavior Ms Lau shows another side to that caricature The struggling Chinese worker who greases Hong Kongs laborstarved economy and brings the mainlands vexing problems with him too
"23 Weeks Pregnant, With â€˜No Good Choicesâ€™",https://parenting.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/20/23-weeks-pregnant-with-no-good-choices/,"I was 23 weeks pregnant with my first child when we had our anatomic ultrasound here in Chile In a darkened examination room the doctor drew the wand over my belly and our beautiful baby appeared on screen His body
                                        flickered of his own volition and I squeezed my husbands shoulder in relief The doctor measured the circumference of our babys head drew digital white lines down each limb and examined the kidneys
                                        stomach and spine He confirmed the gender of our boy and sent his heartbeat to travel across the bottom of the screen at 142 beats per minute Then he said four words The heart looks abnormal A suitable amount of oxygen was no longer in the room where the only sound was our sons steady deceptively strong heartbeat Ryan and I soon heard another four words Hypoplastic Left Heart Syndrome Our son Lorenzo had two heart chambers instead of four and an impossibly small aorta Without treatment HLHS is always and quickly fatal
                                        When treated with a series of three openheart surgeries that attempt to prolong life and begin at one week old the baby faces long hospital stays and serious complications infection blood clots stroke heart
                                        failure
                                     While the heart is the first organ to form at five weeks gestation it takes several months to see it clearly Back home in California we likely would have seen our sons heart  a squat hourglass
                                        with a dividing line across its center  at 18 to 20 weeks when anatomic ultrasounds are scheduled in the United States for lowrisk couples as we were California law allows abortions up to fetal viability
                                        generally 24 weeks gestation This is also the limit set by the Supreme Court But in Chile where abortion is illegal without exception the timing is about ideal visibility for the scan not decisionmaking
                                        Our doctors advised that no matter what we chose we should return to the US for treatment We flew home the next day and I packed for all three of us because all we knew of the future was that it had profoundly changed Ryan and I met with several specialists to understand as
                                        much as we could about what Lorenzo was facing Our sons case was extreme giving him a 5050 chance of making it through the first surgery and making it might include brain damage That
                                        would be the beginning of what sounded like 5050 chances every step of the way Ultimately we made the most excruciating decision of our lives to spare him a harshly negotiated life and allow his body painlessly
                                        put to rest to go the way his heart was designed  not to survive outside of my womb I made a subsequent choice to be induced so that I could hold him even though he was already gone and tell him how much
                                        we loved him As of Nov 20 2013 12 states have passed bans on abortion at 20 weeks post fertilization or earlier Nine such bans are in effect three have been blocked in court If such a ban had affected us last year we wouldnt
                                        have been able to parent Lorenzo as we did Instead I would have begun preparing to carry him to term although many babies with HLHS are also born premature Once delivered he would have been taken immediately
                                        to theÂ  neonatal intensive care unit medicated and monitored until we sent him into a surgery he might never recover from According to the Guttmacher Institute terminations after 21 weeks represent 15 percent of the approximately 12 million abortions performed in the United States annually
                                        Among those 18000 terminations the percentage due to fetal anomalies is unknown but that number holds many mothers like me We have faces and stories and are grieving the babies we planned for and wanted In
                                        my story the narrow window of time I had to act may close altogether as these incremental laws go into effect or if one of the legal challenges advances to the Supreme Court and results in nationwide restrictions
                                        New measures have already advanced nationally a bill banning abortion 20 weeks after fertilization passed in the House in June  without an exception for pregnancies like mine A similar bill is expected
                                        from the Senate Many of these bans theorize about when a fetus can feel pain but what about the real pain my son would have experienced every day of his life Because as unimaginable as our choice once felt I made it precisely because
                                        I imagined watching helpless as he suffered for however long the doctors would have been able to keep a heart incompatible with life beating I imagined enduring as he underwent major bleeds compromised
                                        organ function developmental delays and additional surgeries to treat additional complications only to lose him very likely long before he was old enough to understand what it was that was happening Its
                                        hard for me to believe that anyone knowing what I now know would make me bring a baby into the world for such an end As Ryan often said as we were circling our decision There are no good choices here Whatever the choice its personal based on discussions with doctors and the beliefs of a family In our case
                                        we didnt know what we would do for our son until we spoke with three obstetricians two pediatric cardiologists a pediatric heart surgeon and a neonatologist and finally sat in two chairs pushed up against
                                        the wall in the Gynecology Clinic our hands clutched in a knot on cold metal armrests Only then feeling in our bones that we would lose our baby  it was just a matter of when  did we begin to

Texas Women and Abortion Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/21/opinion/texas-women-and-abortion-rights.html,In an alarming 5to4 ruling the Supreme Court turned away an emergency application to block a new Texas law that is impeding access to safe and legal abortion care in the state The ruling leaves in place an order by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit that allowed the law go into effect while it considers an appeal  The Texas law requires doctors who perform abortions to have admitting privileges at a nearby hospital A federal district judge Lee Yeakel ruled last month that this provision serves no medical purpose and improperly infringes on womens reproductive rights The requirement forces a third of Texas abortion doctors to stop offering the procedure Judge Yeakel issued an injunction blocking the provision which a threejudge panel of the appellate court promptly lifted  The justices should have blocked the law as the appeal proceeds The courts 1992 decision in Planned Parenthood v Casey forbids state regulations that have the purpose or effect of placing a substantial obstacle in the path of a woman seeking an abortion of a nonviable fetus  a principle this provision clearly violates  Justice Antonin Scalia joined by Justices Clarence Thomas and Samuel Alito Jr Chief Justice John Roberts Jr and Justice Anthony Kennedy did not join in the majority opinion but presumably voted to allow the law to go into effect wrote that the plaintiffs had not met the heavy procedural burden of showing that the appeals court ruling was a clear violation of accepted legal standards But as Justice Stephen Breyer rightly noted in his dissent The longer a given facility remains closed the less likely it is ever to reopen even if the admitting privileges requirement is ultimately held unconstitutional  The Supreme Courts procedural decision will affect thousands of women who would have sought abortions at the clinics no longer offering that service The justices should follow their own precedent and strike down the admitting privileges rule if and when they are asked to directly consider its constitutionality

                                        Boys worried that feminist progress was undermining masculinity and steering men toward ruin But in fact the movement toward equality stopped The labor force hit 46 percent female in 1994 and it hasnt changed much since Womens fulltime annual earnings were 76 percent of mens in 2001 and 77 percent in 2011 Although women do earn a majority of academic degrees their specialties pay less so that earnings even for women
                                        with doctorate degrees working full time are 77 percent of mens Attitudinal changes also stalled In two decades
                                        there has been little change in the level of agreement with the statement It is much better for everyone involved if the man is the achiever outside the home and the woman takes care of the home and family After two steps forward we were unprepared for the abrupt slowdown on the road to gender equality We can make sense of the current predicament however  and gain a better sense of how to resume our forward
                                        motion  if we can grasp the forces that drove the change in the first place Its difficult to imagine or remember American womens world in the early 1960s described to chilling effect by Stephanie Coontz in A Strange Stirring The Feminine Mystique
                                        and American Women at the Dawn of the 1960s Women responding to sexsegregated helpwanted ads including in The New York Times until 1968 faced rampant  and completely legal  employment
                                        discrimination on the basis of sex race age motherhood pregnancy and appearance They faced obstacles obtaining loans or buying property without their husbands approval Rape within marriage was not
                                        a crime and domestic violence was just barely one Divorce was relatively rare Birth control was illegal in many places and elective abortion was banned Women organized against these injustices with increasing success in the 1970s but one precondition for their gains was the postwar expansion of the market into new areas especially education health care child care
                                        and other services For women that meant the monetization of fields of work that were traditionally their unpaid responsibility spurring growth in jobs for which women were preferred and creating powerful incentives
                                        to enter the labor force This in turn generated greater demand for services from fast food to child care to couples therapy In response to an upward spiral of employment opportunities women pursued education in greater numbers married later if at all
                                        and had fewer children Rising demand in formerly maledominated industries also drew women into the labor force Consider the story of one woman whose workingclass family did not expect her to pursue a career With mediocre high school grades
                                        she went to a community college She decided to leave after a year to get a legal secretary certificate which led to a law firm job and finally a job as administrative assistant to a corporate executive where
                                        she eventually earned about as much as her husband an electrician This experience recorded in Sarah Damaskes recent book For the Family How Class and Gender Shape Womens Work was not an isolated occurrence In the 1980s the demand for legal assistants
                                        doubled so that when Angela finished high school in the early 1990s a quartermillion of these paraprofessionals were on the job about 80 percent of them women Opportunities she had not planned for  vocational
                                        training and a career track in a booming occupation  intervened to change her life plans Her cultural attitudes were upended by economic developments The entry of women into the labor force and into new fields of work  especially management  and the redivision of labor within families were seismic cultural shifts as well as economic ones Women developed
                                        new selfimages and the daughters of their generation  my students today  would never consider forgoing a career So why did progress stall in the 1990s First despite the removal of many legal and social injustices the movement away from traditional forms of gender segregation has remained decidedly unidirectional As the
                                        sociologist Paula England has shown this is most apparent in education If you look at female representation in the top fields of study since 1970
                                        the pattern is clear The most femaledominated majors remained that way the maledominated majors had continued increases in female representation through the early 2000s and some heavily maledominated ones
                                        saw dramatic spikes in womens share of degrees which have now slowed or stalled Strikingly absent is the substantial movement of men into even one femaledominated major The same is largely true of occupations with the most femaledominated  such as librarians and earlychildhood educators  remaining that way Even registered nurses remain nearly 90 percent female despite
                                        a decade of increasing male presence they were 92 percent female a decade ago And one of the most consequential
                                        gender divisions the residential custody of children remains stubbornly resistant to change In the past four decades the percentage of singleparent families                                        headed by men has risen to just 16 percent from 10 percent Men arent acting irrationally womens work pays less partly because of its cultural association with traditionally unpaid tasks And there is a deep social stigma that attaches to men who are perceived
                                        as feminine  much more than the reverse notice that social change means that women wear pants not that men wear dresses At the low end of the labor market where the men cant afford to be choosy
                                        some men have taken on traditionally female tasks such as cooks and cleaners where such jobs are majoritymale outside of private homes and lowskilled nurses aides But most men who can choose to avoid
                                        female arenas If more men dont  wont or cant  move into female fields we hit a ceiling on integration and with it gender equality The second hurdle we face is the failure to develop workfamily policies that promote gender equality by enabling women to become parents without sacrificing their engagement at work and encouraging men to work in ways
                                        that do not sacrifice their engagement as parents Unfortunately momentum for such policy reform is hampered by the resurgent narrative that women dont really want it The optout revolution story was that professional women  those who had gained the most from feminism and the new economy  gave up trying to make it on the career track Of
                                        course as long as there have been professional women some have ended up on the family side of the workfamily fork in the road But in the last few decades that hasnt involved a large or growing proportion
                                        of women Among married women in their 30s and 40s with children college graduates are the most likely to work  threequarters are in the labor force and that participation rate has been unchanged for
                                        two decades Of course stressed parents are concerned about their childrens future in what increasingly looks like a winnertakeall mobility contest They often cant find  or manage  good affordable
                                        child care that allows both parents to pursue their careers successfully and many dont even have a right to unpaid family leave When push comes to shove the mothers career is most often the first
                                        to go or at least to be compromised But despite the rhetoric of choice that has been adopted by many professional mothers who were actually forced out                                        of demanding inflexible and unsupportive work environments womens behavior belies the idea that they do not want to combine work and family Their movement into maledominated fields at work and school
                                        in the continued high labor force participation rates and the rejection of traditionalist gender roles by large majorities of women all suggest that they remain ready to respond to a more welcoming policy environment On the flip side moving men into the nomans lands in the division of labor is daunting Given the pay penalty for womens work some professions have begun recruitment campaigns especially in areas
                                        with labor shortages such as nursing They valiantly attempt to mobilize masculine imagery  comparing nursing to mountain climbing using phrases like adrenaline rush and asking Are you man enough to be a nurse
                                        But that path toward gender integration runs decidedly uphill Done right workfamily integration policies can promote gender equality Its not an easy formula  either practically or politically Too much paid family leave and women might end up weakening their
                                        professional status as years off the job undermined their experience One solution is the policy in Iceland which allocates paid leave
                                        separately to both mothers and fathers Similarly support for parttime work  such as wage protection  reduces workfamily conflicts but it risks ghettoizing mothers in traditional jobs We know that child care demands                                        are a major factor driving women out of the labor force But too much staterun child care frightens traditionalists  especially in the United States  who are more repelled than inspired by countries
                                        such as France Belgium and Italy where virtually every child is in preschool at age 3 But few rich countries do less to guarantee highquality child care than the United States so there has to be room to increase
                                        that approach as well even within our statephobic parameters Family leave reduced work hours and public child care wont directly reduce occupational segregation producing more male nurses teachers and day care workers But pushing on these policy fronts offers the
                                        potential to alter the gender logic of both family and workplace If you want a society in which men are welcome and willing to be day care workers you may need a workplace culture that accepts  or encourages
                                         fathers spending more time at home with their children To unblock the path toward gender equality these policies may be the best ideas we have The restrictions on womens lives that prevailed in the early 1960s today seem draconian removing them was an obvious extension of basic rights to half the population But there was fierce opposition to such
                                        reforms and their success was never guaranteed Someday we may come to see paid family leave reduced work hours and public child care as part of our natural suite of rights And with them gender equality may
                                        not be as far behind as it looks today Philip N Cohen is a professor of sociology at the University of Maryland and the author of the forthcoming book The Family Diversity Inequality and Social Change"
"Adrienne Asch, Bioethicist and Pioneer in Disability Studies, Dies at 67",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/23/nyregion/adrienne-asch-bioethicist-and-pioneer-in-disability-studies-dies-at-67.html,Adrienne Asch an internationally known bioethicist who opposed the use of prenatal testing and abortion to select children free of disabilities a stance informed partly by her own experience of blindness died on Nov 19 at her home in Manhattan She was 67 The cause was cancer said Randi Stein a longtime friend At her death Professor Asch was the director of the Center for Ethics and the Edward and Robin Milstein professor of bioethics at Yeshiva University in Manhattan She also held professorships in epidemiology and population health and in family and social medicine at Yeshivas Albert Einstein College of Medicine She certainly was one of the pioneers in disability studies Eva Feder Kittay a distinguished professor of philosophy at Stony Brook University and a scholarly colleague of Professor Aschs said in an interview She was a very strong voice always bringing in the disability perspective trying to change the view of disability as some tragedy that happens to someone rather than just another feature and fact about human existence Professor Asch who was trained as a philosopher social worker social psychologist and clinical psychotherapist produced scholarship that stood at the nexus of bioethics disability studies reproductive rights and feminist theory She maintained that the lives of disabled women should be as much a feminist concern as those of ablebodied ones Disabled women she argued had long been doubly marginalized first because of their sex and again because they failed to conform to a collective physical ideal  an ideal to which at least some ablebodied feminists subscribed Professor Aschs scholarship centered in particular on issues of reproduction and the family In an age of fastmoving reproductive technologies she found that those concerns dovetailed increasingly with issues of disability rights She became widely known for opposing prenatal testing as a means of detecting disabilities and abortion as a means of selecting babies without them Professor Asch supported a womans right to abortion She was a past board member of the organization now known as Naral ProChoice America But in her lectures writings and television and radio appearances she argued against its use to preempt the birth of disabled children She argued likewise for prenatal testing For her supporting abortion in general while opposing it in particular circumstances posed little ideological conflict The crux of the matter she argued lay in the difference between a woman who seeks an abortion because she does not want to be pregnant and one who seeks an abortion because she does not want a disabled child In the first case Professor Kittay explained youre not seeking to abort this particular childÂ  In the second she said when youre seeking to abort because of disability its not any potential child its this child with these particular characteristics Adrienne Valerie Asch was born in New York City on Sept 17 1946 A premature baby she lost her vision to retinopathy in her first weeks When she was a girl her family moved to New Jersey then one of the few states that let blind children attend school with their sighted peers She attended public schools in Ramsey in Bergen County On graduating from Swarthmore College with a bachelors degree in philosophy in 1969 she found employers unwilling to hire her  an experience her associates said that made her keenly aware of disability as a civil rights issue After receiving a masters degree in social work from Columbia in 1973 she spent much of the 70s and 80s working for the New York State Division of Human Rights where she investigated employment discrimination cases including those involving disability Trained as a psychoanalytic psychotherapist in the 1980s she maintained a private psychotherapy practice throughout that decade In 1992 she received a PhD in social psychology from Columbia Before joining the Yeshiva faculty Professor Asch taught at the Boston University School of Social Work and at Wellesley College where she was a professor of womens studies and the Henry R Luce professor in biology ethics and the politics of human reproduction Her publications include two volumes of which she was a coeditor Women With Disabilities Essays in Psychology Culture and Politics 1988 with Michelle Fine and Prenatal Testing and Disability Rights 2000 with Erik Parens  A resident of the Upper West Side of Manhattan Professor Asch is survived by a brother Carl and a sister Susan Campbell  In an article in The American Journal of Public Health in 1999 Professor Asch laid out her philosophy in no uncertain terms  If public health espouses goals of social justice and equality for people with disabilities  as it has worked to improve the status of women gays and lesbians and members of racial and ethnic minorities  it should reconsider whether it wishes to continue the technology of prenatal diagnosis she wrote  She added My moral opposition to prenatal testing and selective abortion flows from the conviction that life with disability is worthwhile and the belief that a just society must appreciate and nurture the lives of all people whatever the endowments they receive in the natural lottery
Ticket Led by Women Shows Where Democrats Pin Hopes,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/24/us/ticket-led-by-women-shows-where-democrats-pin-hopes.html,State Senator Leticia Van de Puttes announcement on Saturday that she is running for lieutenant governor adding a second woman to a ticket led by State Senator Wendy Davis is enhancing Texas Democrats hopes that they could see their first statewide victory since 1994  The Democrats are pinning their strategy in part on women particularly those in the suburbs who early polling numbers suggest might not have their minds made up and could be persuaded by the summers divisive debate over abortion legislation What we know from the outcome of this summer is that women were paying attention and women were watching Ms Van de Putte said It wasnt just about that bill It wasnt just about health care It was about not being valued But Republicans say they are holding fast to this demographic which has trended conservative in past elections  I think in Texas the majority of people are happy with how the state is doing said Steve Munisteri chairman of the Republican Party of Texas Thats one of the reasons why were winning by such a large margin That margin looked smaller in a fall University of TexasTexas Tribune poll which showed Attorney General Greg Abbott the leading Republican candidate for governor with a singledigit lead over Ms Davis whose 11hour filibuster of an omnibus abortion bill in June drew national attention But in that poll 25 percent of registered voters were undecided including 34 percent of suburban women  When youre looking at womens votes I just kind of discounted the undecided Mr Munisteri said because only political junkies or the media are paying attention to the candidates this early in the election He said that average voters would not tune in to the 2014 races until next year and that most would vote Republican Mr Munisteri said the Republican Party is well established among women with more than 160 Texas Federation of Republican Women groups meeting regularly across the state Texas Democratic Women lists 43 chapters statewide  He added that the idea that female voters might be persuaded to vote differently based on womens issues like reproductive health is a false assumption Women are just as interested in economic issues and that plays well for Republicans he said The partys outreach efforts cross all segments of the population and are not necessarily gender specific Mr Munisteri said But he added that Republicans would rely on active female party members to be ambassadors to other women The party will also more than double the number of socalled victory centers  volunteer hubs across the state  from four to nine by January to help get out the vote Mr Munisteri said staffers were working on their movers list following up with nearly 100000 past Republican voters who are new to their counties and not yet registered to vote Other workers were identifying swing voters Mr Munisteri said As part of our blockwalking and doortodoor survey were going to find out what issues are of prime concern to both genders of swing voters he said The state Democratic Partys outreach efforts include more targeted appeals to women The party has been building on the list of women who protested the abortion legislation during the summer at the Capitol said Tanene Allison a party spokeswoman While Ms Daviss filibuster helped defeat the bill during one special session it was passed in a subsequent session This month the Democrats began an online mobilization effort to reach out to female voters and get them to promote the partys platform to other women It will be a womantowoman project to reach out and explain why its important to vote in this next election cycle and what issues are at stake Ms Allison said adding that the party had a strong connection to womens priorities on issues like equal pay education and health care Sharon Hirsch president of Women Organizing Women Democrats a group in North Texas said having Ms Davis and Ms Van de Putte at the top of the 2014 ticket has been very empowering for women  She added that she was seeing more women working to register voters filling out weekly phone banks and blockwalking particularly in the suburbs  I really believe Wendy Davis has kind of lit the fire and adding Leticia Van de Putte to the ticket will only make that desire stronger to get these women elected Ms Hirsch said But Catherine Gibb an officer for Plano Republican Women said female voters should look at the whole candidate when deciding whom to support regardless of sex She said the Democratic candidates left a lot to be desired  I would be willing to stake my life that theres not a woman in my club that they would vote for her even if shes running for dogcatcher Ms Gibb said of Ms Davis James Henson a Tribune pollster and director of the Texas Politics Project at the University of Texas at Austin said he did not see a clear changing of the tide among female voters The university is a corporate sponsor of The Texas Tribune Its not as if suburban women are heading for the exits from the Republicans he said But he added that the potential risk for Republicans emanates from the necessities of competing in a GOP primary in a state where 39 percent of women identify as moderates  11 points more than Texas men  The four Republicans running for lieutenant governor are already working to prove they are the most conservative in the race which could present a challenge for the nominee in the general election Ms Van de Putte knows her campaign must have broad appeal to win the votes of small business owners veterans and conservatives I dont think Leticia and Wendy are going to be holding hands at every event were at Ms Van de Putte said If we campaign thinking just because were women other women are going to vote for us its a fallacy Its very condescending to women
Court Confronts Religious Rights of Corporations,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/25/us/court-confronts-religious-rights-of-corporations.html,WASHINGTON  Hobby Lobby a chain of crafts stores closes on Sundays costing its owners millions but honoring their Christian faith The stores play religious music Employees get free spiritual counseling But they do not get free insurance coverage for some contraceptives even though President Obamas health care law requires it  Hobby Lobby a corporation says that forcing it to provide the coverage would violate its religious beliefs A federal appeals court agreed and the Supreme Court is set to decide on Tuesday whether it will hear the Obama administrations appeal from that decision or appeals from one of several related cases Legal experts say the court is all but certain to step in setting the stage for another major decision on the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act two years after a closely divided court sustained its requirement that most Americans obtain health insurance or pay a penalty  The stakes here symbolically and politically are very high said Douglas Laycock a law professor at the University of Virginia citing the clash between religious teachings and the administrations embattled health care law  In weighing those interests the Supreme Court would have to assess the limits of a principle recognized in its 2010 decision in Citizens United which said corporations have free speech rights under the First Amendment The question now is whether corporations also have the right to religious liberty In ruling for Hobby Lobby the United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit said it had applied the First Amendment logic of Citizens United We see no reason the Supreme Court would recognize constitutional protection for a corporations political expression but not its religious expression Judge Timothy M Tymkovich wrote for the majority A dissenting member of the court Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe wrote that the majoritys approach was nothing short of a radical revision of First Amendment law But Judge Harris L Hartz in a concurrence said the case was in some ways easier than Citizens United A corporation exercising religious beliefs is not corrupting anyone he wrote Among Hobby Lobbys lawyers is Paul D Clement who led the 2012 Supreme Court challenge to the health care law The new case opened another front in a larger war on the law which as Hobby Lobby put it in its Supreme Court brief imposes massive obligations on individuals and corporations alike in the process of attempting to fundamentally reorder the nations health care system Mr Clements main adversary in the 2012 case Solicitor General Donald B Verrilli Jr told the justices that the 10th Circuits unprecedented ruling in this case would allow forprofit corporations to deny employees the health coverage to which they are otherwise entitled by federal law based on the religious objections of the individuals who own a controlling stake in the corporations The Supreme Court is generally receptive to appeals from the solicitor general especially when a lower court has effectively held a federal law unconstitutional The justices are also apt to step in when as here lower courts are divided on an important legal question Even Hobby Lobby which won in the appeals court agrees that the justices should hear the administrations appeal This is a perfect storm said Richard Garnett a law professor at Notre Dame adding that it is also a worrisome one Debates about campaign finance in Citizens United and abortion and Obamacare he said could distort the courts analysis of religious freedom  Hobby Lobby was founded in 1970 in Oklahoma City by David Green and it now has more than 500 stores and 13000 employees of all sorts of faiths Mr Green and his family own Hobby Lobby through a privately held corporation  The Greens told the justices in their brief that some drugs and devices that can prevent embryos from implanting in the womb are tantamount to abortion and that providing insurance coverage for those forms of contraception would make the company and its owners complicit in the practice They said they had no objection to 16 other forms of contraception approved by the Food and Drug Administration including condoms diaphragms sponges several kinds of birth control pills and sterilization surgery  But Hobby Lobbys failure to offer comprehensive coverage could it said subject it to federal fines of 13 million a day Dropping insurance coverage for its employees it added would be disruptive and unfair and lead to fines of 26 million a year Mr Verrilli countered that requiring insurance plans to include comprehensive coverage for contraception was justified by the governments interest in the promotion of public health and in ensuring that women have equal access to health care services Doctors rather than employers should decide which form of contraception is best he added  The administration has excluded many religious organizations from the laws requirements it has grandfathered some insurance plans that had not previously offered the coverage and under the health care law small employers need not offer health coverage at all In June a federal judge in Tampa Fla estimated that a third of Americans are not subject to the requirement that their employers provide coverage for contraceptives But the administration drew a line at larger forprofit secular corporations  Congress has granted religious organizations alone the latitude to discriminate on the basis of religion in setting the terms and conditions of employment including compensation the Justice Department told the 10th Circuit appeals court in Denver  No court has ever found a forprofit company to be a religious organization for purposes of federal law the brief went on To the contrary courts have emphasized that an entitys forprofit status is an objective criterion that allows courts to distinguish a secular company from a potentially religious organization without conducting an intrusive inquiry into the entitys religious beliefs The appeals court disagreed ruling that Hobby Lobby is a person for purposes of the relevant federal law the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 Religious liberty Judge Tymkovich wrote cannot turn on whether money changes hands Would an incorporated kosher butcher really have no claim to challenge a regulation mandating nonkosher butchering practices he asked Other federal appeals courts considering challenges to the health care laws socalled contraception mandate have ruled that the 1993 law does not apply to corporations After finding that Hobby Lobby was entitled to the laws protections the 10th Circuit went on to say that the companys sincere religious beliefs had been compromised without good reason noting the limited number of contraception methods at issue and the many employers exempt from the laws

"For a Professor, a Messy Affair",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/26/books/death-of-the-black-haired-girl-is-a-robert-stone-thriller.html,Robert Stones fastpaced new novel Death of the BlackHaired Girl does not take place in one of those hot volatile places Vietnam or Central America or the Middle East where so many of his earlier characters sought adventure oblivion or redemption It takes place in a small New England town where history is more personal than political This novel is not a big ambitious excavation of the American soul like A Hall of Mirrors Dog Soldiers or A Flag for Sunrise and it takes as its presiding muse not Conrad or Graham Greene but Nathaniel Hawthorne What BlackHaired Girl does have in common with the rest of Mr Stones work is a fascination with the existential and religious yearnings of the human heart and with what Melville called Hawthornes fascination with the great power of blackness rooted in mans capacity for sin After a melodramatic and embarrassingly overwritten novel Bay of Souls 2003 and a wobbly collection of stories Fun With Problems 2010 BlackHaired Girl also marks Mr Stones rediscovery of his voice  or rather a retooling of his voice for the purposes of creating a taut novel of psychological suspense The outward plot of BlackHaired Girl is a simple noirish tale of adultery gone awry A writer and professor named Steven Brookman is cheating on his wife with one of his students Maud Stack a beautiful blackhaired girl when Brookman learns that his wife is pregnant he attempts to break things off with Maud a drunken Maud decides to confront Brookman at home and moments after an argument with him is killed in a hitandrun accident in front of his house Brookman is suspected of pushing her in front of the car  Parts of this story might have been inspired by a 1998 case in which a Yale student was brutally killed and a Yale lecturer who had been her thesis adviser was named as a suspect This year the lecturer received a settlement in a lawsuit he had brought against Yale and the City of New Haven which claimed that he had been wrongly singled out and that his reputation and career had been damaged the investigation remains open  Brookman is not the only suspect in Mauds death There is also a mysterious and sinister man who was enraged by an incendiary article Maud wrote for the college paper attacking antiabortion protestors  a man who reminds Mauds school counselor a former nun named Jo Carr of a dangerous revolutionary priest who she knew had been involved in some of South Americas most violent atrocities In the opening pages Mr Stone heavyhandedly creates a portentous atmosphere around Maud and Brookman and the small college town in which they live making much of the homeless men and mental outpatients who hover around the fringes of the campus especially a schizophrenic whom Brookman will later realize he repeatedly saw in the weeks before Mauds death But Mr Stone has largely contained the purple prose that hobbled Bay of Souls And his gift for orchestrating suspense and dramatic scenes  so vividly on display in Damascus Gate his 1998 novel set in Jerusalem and Gaza  is deployed here with efficiency and lan As is his talent for charting his characters psychological and spiritual longings Like so many Stone characters Brookman and Maud like to push the envelope they enjoy the frisson of danger and are prone to equate heedlessness with freedom Maud does not think about the fallout that her article about abortion published online with gruesome photos of babies suffering from genetic disorders might have and while Brookman knows he should know better hes allowed himself to become involved in a passionate affair with the volatile Maud Even before he breaks things off with her he has intimations of the unforeseen consequences that their romance could have on his wife and daughter and unborn child After Mauds death he will wonder what role the choices he has made in his life may have played in shaping the trajectory of her short life Mauds father Eddie Stack a former New York City cop will also wonder about the connection between character and fate karma and destiny Though determined to confront Brookman for his role in his daughters death Stack will also blame himself for something he did on the job related to Sept 11 worrying that this lapse in honor has somehow brought misfortune upon his beloved daughter  Even as Death of the BlackHaired Girl barrels along toward its melancholy conclusion it explicates its characters hope that life is not completely random  people always want their suffering to mean something as one character puts it  and their contradictory awareness of the dangers of religious certainty their understanding that choices have moral consequences and that innocents frequently are tangled and hurt in the crossfire The result is at once a Hawthornelike allegory and a surefooted psychological thriller

"Pope Sets Down Goals for an Inclusive Church, Reaching Out â€˜on the Streetsâ€™",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/europe/in-major-document-pope-francis-present-his-vision.html,In his first nine months as leader of one billion Roman Catholics Pope Francis has parceled out glimpses of his vision for remaking the church  in homilies and news conferences interviews and offhand remarks to visitors On Tuesday he announced his agenda in his own unfiltered words reaffirming the impression that he intends to jolt the church out of complacency and enlist all Catholics in his ambitious project of renewing the church by confronting the real needs of people in need In a challenge to the Vatican hierarchy Francis called for decentralizing power in the church saying the Vatican and even the pope must collaborate with bishops laypeople and in particular women  I prefer a church which is bruised hurting and dirty because it has been out on the streets rather than a church which is unhealthy from being confined and from clinging to its own security Francis said in the first teaching document of his papacy that he alone composed  I do not want a church concerned with being at the center and then ends by being caught up in a web of obsessions and procedures he wrote The document called Evangelii Gaudium the Joy of the Gospel is an apostolic exhortation  less authoritative than an encyclical but an important pronouncement He drafted it in August in Spanish said a Vatican spokesman the Rev Federico Lombardi as a reflection on a synod of bishops last year that took up the new evangelization Francis prescription for the church is inextricably tied up with his analysis of what is wrong with the world He devotes many pages to denouncing the dictatorship of a global economic system and a free market that perpetuates inequality and devours what is fragile including human beings and the environment  How can it be that it is not a news item when an elderly homeless person dies of exposure but it is news when the stock market loses two points he wrote in the folksy language that has already marked his as a memorable papacy Vincent J Miller a theologian who writes on economic globalization at the University of Dayton a Catholic university said that while other popes have critiqued the economy Francis has perspective on economic injustice as the first pope from Latin America and is putting forward the church as the counterpoint  He talks about an economy of exclusion while hes been modeling and practicing inclusion publicly through his whole papacy Mr Miller said After months in which many have parsed his comments for hints of change the pope used the document to reiterate church teachings on abortion homosexuality and the ordination of women On abortion he said It is not progressive to try to resolve problems by eliminating a human life On the other hand it is also true that we have done little to adequately accompany women in very difficult situations who may seek abortions because of rape or extreme poverty  Nowhere in the document did Francis speak explicitly of homosexuality or samesex marriage However he said the church should not give in to moral relativism and cited with approval a document written by the bishops of the United States on ministering to people with homosexual inclination The pope said the American bishops are right that the church must insist on objective moral norms which are valid for everyone  even when the church is perceived by supporters of gay rights as promoting prejudice and interfering with individual freedom  Echoing his predecessors Francis said that ordaining women to the priesthood is not a question open to discussion He acknowledged that many women share pastoral responsibilities with priests and said We need to create still broader opportunities for a more incisive female presence in the church But he offered no specifics on doing so But the document dwells at length on how priests can preach better homilies which he said are the touchstone for judging how close a pastor is with his people Francis said that both clergy and laypeople suffer from homilies The laity from having to listen to them and the clergy from having to preach them It is sad that this is the case Francis criticized those within the church who foster division to the point of veritable witch hunts In recent years some bishops in the United States and Europe have advocated denying the eucharist or holy communion to Catholic politicians who support abortion rights or samesex marriage Francis did not take up this issue directly but he advocated open doors Everyone can be part of the community nor should the doors of the sacraments be closed for simply any reason Francis said The eucharist although it is the fullness of sacramental life is not a prize for the perfect but a powerful medicine and nourishment for the weak Francis proposed a vision of a decentralized church Bishops and priests have a better sense of the needs of the faithful he said Parishes should be the point of contact with the homes and the lives of its people not a useless structure out of touch with people or a selfabsorbed cluster made up of a chosen few Laypeople are put simply the vast majority of the people of God The minority  ordained ministers  are at their service Francis wrote John Thavis a former Vatican bureau chief for Catholic News Service who wrote The Vatican Diaries said Hes laying down some real markers about the kinds of reforms he expects to preside over including greater decentralization openness to diversity in the church and a greater emphasis on the gospel message of salvation as opposed to church doctrines and rules  The pope wrote that national bishops conferences can be fruitful sounding boards  Archbishop Lorenzo Baldisseri secretary general of the Synod of Bishops noted Tuesday that the document made repeated references to documents drafted by various bishops conferences  a first It signals the will to allow the bishops of the world to participate in the leadership of the church he said The Rev Antonio Spadaro editor of the leading Jesuit journal in Rome who interviewed the pope last summer just as Francis was writing the exhortation said It is an ample and profound document which finds its roots in the popes personal history  But it isnt complete he said I think well see more 
Justices to Hear Contraception Cases Challenging Health Law,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/us/justices-take-companies-cases-challenging-contraception-rule.html,WASHINGTON  The Supreme Court on Tuesday agreed to hear a pair of cases on whether corporations may refuse to provide insurance coverage for contraception to their workers based on the religious beliefs of the corporations owners The cases present a new challenge to President Obamas health care law The Supreme Court in 2012 upheld another part of the law one that requires most Americans to obtain health insurance or pay a penalty The Obama administration has exempted many religious groups from the laws requirements for contraception coverage But it said that commercial corporations could not rely on religious objections to opt out of compliance with the law Our policy is designed to ensure that health care decisions are made between a woman and her doctor Jay Carney the White House press secretary said in a statement The president believes that no one including the government or forprofit corporations should be able to dictate those decisions to women The lower courts are divided over whether corporations may object to generally applicable laws on religious liberty grounds In June the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit in Denver ruled for Hobby Lobby a corporation owned by a family whose members have said they try to run the business on Christian principles The company which operates a chain of artsandcrafts stores and has more than 15000 fulltime employees of many faiths objected to a requirement in the health care law that large employers provide their workers with comprehensive insurance coverage for contraception Hobby Lobby told the justices that it had no problem with offering coverage for many forms of contraception including condoms diaphragms sponges several kinds of birth control pills and sterilization surgery But drugs and devices that can prevent embryos from implanting in the womb are another matter and make it complicit in a form of abortion the company said The law presents companies with difficult choices Hobby Lobby told the justices Failing to offer comprehensive coverage could subject it to fines of 13 million a day it said while dropping insurance coverage for its employees entirely could lead to fines of 26 million a year The Tenth Circuit ruled that Hobby Lobby was a person under the Religious Freedom Restoration Act of 1993 and that its religious beliefs had been compromised without good reason Kyle Duncan a lawyer with the Becket Fund for Religious Liberty which represents Hobby Lobby said he was pleased that the justices had agreed to resolve the split among the federal appeals courts We hope the Supreme Court will vindicate the rights of family business owners he said Nancy Northup the president of the Center for Reproductive Rights said in a statement that the right to religious freedom belongs to individuals not forprofit institutions These forprofit companies she said are no more entitled to deny women insurance coverage for essential health care than they are to dictate how any of us can and cannot spend our paychecks In July the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Philadelphia ruled against the Conestoga Wood Specialties Corporation which makes wood cabinets and is owned by a Mennonite family that had similar objections to the law The Third Circuit concluded that forprofit secular corporations cannot engage in religious exercise David Cortman a lawyer with Alliance Defending Freedom which represents the company and its owners said the ruling was misguided The administration has no business forcing citizens to make a choice between making a living and living free he said The Third Circuit rejected an analogy to the Supreme Courts 2010 decision in Citizens United which ruled that corporations have a First Amendment right to free speech Though the First Amendment also protects the free exercise of religion Judge Robert E Cowen wrote for the majority of a divided threejudge panel it does not automatically follow that all clauses of the First Amendment must be interpreted identically But a fivejudge majority of an eightjudge panel of the Tenth Circuit in the Hobby Lobby case said that the First Amendment logic of Citizens United extended to religious freedom We see no reason the Supreme Court would recognize constitutional protection for a corporations political expression but not its religious expression Judge Timothy M Tymkovich wrote for the majority A dissenting member of the court Chief Judge Mary Beck Briscoe wrote that the majoritys approach was nothing short of a radical revision of First Amendment law The cases the Supreme Court agreed to hear on Tuesday Sebelius v Hobby Lobby Stores No 13354 and Conestoga Wood Specialties v Sebelius No 13356 are likely to be argued in March and decided by June two years after the courts last major encounter with the health care law
New Birth Control Label Counters Lawsuit Claim,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/us/shift-on-birth-control-pill-may-affect-court-cases.html,European health authorities have made two significant changes to the label of an emergency contraception pill that is equivalent to Plan B OneStep One of the changes could be relevant to two cases that the Supreme Court added to its docket on Tuesday  The new label of the drug Norlevo says it cannot stop a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb contradicting a claim by some abortion opponents that has fueled their objections to the Affordable Care Act  The new label also warns that Norlevo loses effectiveness in women weighing more than 165 pounds and does not work in women over 176 pounds  Norlevo is not sold in the United States but Plan B OneStep and two generic versions are identical to it This year the Food and Drug Administration made Plan B OneStep available to people of all ages without a prescription  The cases coming before the Supreme Court involve corporations that object on religious grounds to the health care laws requirement that employers provide insurance coverage for contraception including emergency contraception The cases are based on the claim that some types of contraception including Plan B OneStep prevent fertilized eggs from implanting in the womb tantamount to an abortion  While labels of Plan B OneStep and related pills which contain the drug levonorgestrel say they work mostly by blocking the release of eggs before fertilization they also say the drugs may inhibit fertilized eggs from implanting in the uterus  Last year The New York Times reported that scientific studies provided strong evidence that levonorgestrel does not block implantation References to the possibility of blocking implantation were then removed from the websites of the National Institutes of Health and the Mayo Clinic And an FDA spokeswoman Erica Jefferson said that the emerging data on Plan B suggest that it does not inhibit implantation  On Tuesday Ms Jefferson reiterated that view The drug agency has not moved to change the label saying manufacturers must request a change Plan B OneSteps manufacturer Teva Pharmaceuticals declined to comment It had previously said scientific evidence suggested that the pill did not disrupt implantation  Ms Jefferson also said that the drug agency was reviewing the scientific information concerning the effect of weight on the pills effectiveness  The European label change regarding weight reported on Monday by Mother Jones stemmed from a 2011 study  The results of the research could be significant to American women While there is no data on the percentage of overweight or obese women who use emergency contraception the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has reported that from 2007 to 2010 the average weight of women age 20 and over was 1662 pounds For nonHispanic black women the average weight was 1879 pounds  Experts said women over 165 pounds should use either a copper intrauterine device or a different pill Ella made by HRA Pharma Those methods are not as easy to obtain however because the device must be inserted and Ella requires a prescription A small amount of data also suggests that Ella may not work well in very obese women said Erin Gainer HRA Pharmas chief executive  Initially the 2011 study was not designed to look at weight but was intended to compare data on different types of emergency contraception  Ms Gainer said that after the study suggested Norlevo was less effective for women with a higher body mass index a ratio of height to weight further research was done revealing that the effect is really linked to body weight regardless of height She added We felt we needed to take the results to regulators and update the product label to get this information to consumers  Scientists said they did not yet know why weight would diminish levonorgestrels effectiveness Most drugs are affected by body weight and there have been suggestions that other hormonal contraceptives including the pill and the minipill may have higher failure rates in obese women the lead author of the 2011 study Dr Anna Glasier an honorary professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Edinburgh said in an email Diana Blithe a biochemist overseeing contraception research for the National Institutes of Health said some scientists think greater weight adversely affects how the drug is metabolized while others say the drug simply spreads out more in larger people diluting its effectiveness More research is important she said because pregnancy can be risky to an obese persons health and levonorgestrel is valued because it is a very safe drug  Research has not established whether increased doses of levonorgestrel would work for very heavy women Dr Blithe said But some health care providers have known for a while that the current pill may be ineffective for those women  Planned Parenthood already tells women with a body mass index over 30 that levonorgestrel is not recommended said Karen Shea its director of medical standards

Lust",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/27/world/asia/with-glut-of-lonely-men-china-has-an-approved-outlet-for-unrequited-lust.html,GUANGZHOU China  Slackjawed and perspiring Chen Weizhou gazed at a pair of lifesize female dolls clad just barely in lingerie and lace stockings Above these silicone vixens an instructional video graphically depicted just how realistic they felt once undressed A 46yearold tour bus driver Mr Chen had come earlier this month to the Guangzhou National Sex Culture Festival for fun which was not how he described intimacy with his wife who did not attend When youre young sex is so mysterious but once youre married it gets really bland he said barely taking his eyes off the screen With an official theme of healthy sex happy families the 11th annual exposition sought to remedy the plight of Chinese men like Mr Chen  and their wives if they are married  The overwhelming presence of men at the festival mirrored a demographic imbalance in China where decades of the onechild rule and a cultural preference for sons combined with illegal sexselective abortions have distorted the countrys gender ratio to 118 newborn boys for every 100 girls in 2012 rather than the normal 103 boys In Guangdong Province home to a migrant worker population of 30 million  Chinas largest  the scarcity of women leaves bachelors with limited options Filling an exhibition center here in the capital of Guangdong in southern China the festival was a threeday mating ritual between capitalism and hedonism all diligently observed by that most prudish of chaperones the Chinese government Erotic possibilities abounded including a transgender fashion show sliced deer antler marketed as an aphrodisiac naughty nurse costumes and some fleshcolor objects disconcertingly called Captain Stabbing Three decades after China began shedding its priggish Maoera mores sex is now a big business here Across the country pinklit hair salons staffed by provocatively garbed women compete with massage parlors and latenight paid companions who slip their business cards under hotel room doors Those looking to enhance their encounters can shop at countless adult health product stores and on the Internet Most of the inventory is made in China According to state news media more than 1000 Chinese companies manufacture around 70 percent of the worlds sex toys generating 2 billion a year as of 2010 The bounty of carnal titillation must contend with the firm hand of the Communist Party which bans pornography and punishes those guilty of group licentiousness in the name of protecting traditional Chinese values But the partys moral authority has frayed of late because of the publicized antics of its friskier members In June a government official was sentenced to 13 years in prison for corruption after a video surfaced showing him in bed with an 18yearold woman His fall came three months after photos depicting a coterie of six naked people including a party official and his wife exploded on the Internet In an attempt to give the sex festival a veneer of respectability governmentrun medical organizations sponsored booths in a side room which were unsurprisingly desolate The main draw was lust Thousands of visitors nearly all middleaged men wielding cameras poured through the aisles in search of any visible flesh Guys have been taking my picture all day said a bikiniclad model Liang Lin 23 who was hugging her bare midriff defensively as a throng of men jostled desperately to get a better shot Not far away a male crowd waited for a diminutive Japanese pornography star named Rei Mizuna to appear When she finally emerged from a dressing room to hand out racy autographed photos her frenzied fans surged forward with such zeal they shattered a glass display case Those unrequited desires have helped spawn a booming domestic sex toy industry A stuffed man doesnt know what its like to be hungry explained a salesman at one booth filled with inflatable dolls Just then an older gentleman approached and tried to bargain over an 8 figure with black tresses and a vacant stare Across the floor the Chinese chain Buccone sold higherend companionship These 6400 rubber dolls warm up just like a real person said an employee Nie Tai 23 and could be customized Some men come with photos of their late wives Huang Yulong who works for a lingerie company called Toylace was unfazed by the festivals libidinous fervor Chinese men have a fetish for tearing off a womans clothes so theyre not looking for romance said Ms Huang standing beside a mannequin wearing a fishnet body stocking that seemed to have run out of thread around the inner thigh At least not with their spouses she added Customers say theyre buying for their wives but we know its for their mistresses In a country where it is still taboo to discuss sex publicly creative packaging hinted at a multitude of personal tastes and private anxieties Among the condom brands were Freud packed in pink boxes and Tiger Teeth which lay beside a colorful assortment of prophylactics wrapped to resemble lollipops Perhaps because the domestic sex toy industry started with a focus on exports many items boasted of a foreign mystique like the handheld Great Rome 5 and King Kong  English mistranslations were particularly problematic among male sexual enhancement products many of which suggested unintended consequences like Black Widow One vendor failed to impress a potential customer when he vowed that the Casanova pills worked best The effects last a week he said To attract potential buyers some companies got creative hosting pole dancing shows and other activities Li Jianglin 42 a shoe factory manager won a contest in which participants raced to inflate condoms

"Doesnâ€™t Eat, Doesnâ€™t Pray and Doesnâ€™t Love",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/28/opinion/greenhouse-doesnt-eat-doesnt-pray-and-doesnt-love.html,The question of whether forprofit companies can claim a religious identity one that exempts them from obeying a generally applicable law is fully worthy of the attention the Supreme Court is about to give it But to the extent that much of the commentary about the challenges to the Affordable Care Acts contraceptioncoverage insurance mandate frames the issue as a debate about the rights of corporations  as a next step beyond Citizens Uniteds expansion of corporate free speech  I think it misses the point What really makes these cases so rich and the reason the courts intervention will dramatically raise the temperature of the current term lies elsewhere The religiousbased challenges that have flooded the federal courts from coast to coast  more than 70 of them of which the Supreme Court agreed on Tuesday to hear two  arent about the dayin dayout stuff of jurisprudence under the First Amendments Free Exercise Clause Sabbath observance employment rights tax exemptions They are about sex As such the cases open a new front in an old war I dont mean the overblown war on religion that some Catholic leaders have accused the Obama administration of waging Nor do I mean the war on women that was such an effective charge last year against a bevy of egregiously footinmouth Republican politicians I mean that this is the culture war redux  a war not on religion or on women but on modernity All culture wars are that of course the old culture in a goalline stance against a new way of organizing society a new culture struggling to be born Usually thats pretty obvious This time somehow it seems less so maybe because the battle is being fought in the complex language of law namely a 20yearold law called the Religious Freedom Restoration Act This tendentiously named statute aimed at overturning a 1990 Supreme Court decision that cast a skeptical eye on claims to religious exemptions from ordinary laws provides that the government shall not substantially burden a persons exercise of religion unless the burden serves a compelling government interest and is the least restrictive means of doing so Whats a substantial burden What governmental interest is sufficiently compelling And with particular respect to the two new Supreme Court cases is a forprofit corporation a person that can engage in religious exercise The lower courts are divided making it all but inevitable that the Supreme Court would step in One of the cases Sebelius v Hobby Lobby Stores Inc raises only the statutory questions The other Conestoga Wood Specialties v Sebelius presents the First Amendment issue as well the companys Mennonite owners who employ nearly 1000 people in their cabinetmaking business argued unsuccessfully in the lower court that the contraceptive coverage mandate violates both their own and their corporations right to the free exercise of religion Its of course a total coincidence that the Supreme Court granted these cases on the same day that The Times published a special section on the changing American family But Natalie Angiers fascinating statistical and narrative portraits of the contemporary American household  declining birth rates even more sharply declining marriage rates 41 percent of babies born to unmarried parents a fourfold increase since 1970  offer some context for the sense of dislocation and alienation that as much as anything else seems to be driving the resistance to making contraception coverage without a copay a required part of employerprovided health insurance The religiously committed owners of the companies whose cases the court will decide  Hobby Lobby employs 13000 people in its 500store chain  say they object not to all birth control but only to the methods they believe act after fertilization to prevent a fertilized egg from implanting and continuing to develop This belief is incorrect as a brief filed by a coalition of leading medical authorities demonstrates although there was once some confusion on this point the disputed hormonal methods are now understood to prevent fertilization from occurring in the first place European medical authorities recently reached the same conclusion and have changed the label on an emergency contraception pill to say it cannot stop a fertilized egg from attaching to the womb There is something deeper going on in these cases than a dispute over the line that separates a contraceptive from an abortifacient What drives the anger about this regulation is that as the opponents see it the government is putting its thumb on the scale in favor of birth control of sex without consequences In a revealing article published earlier this year in the Villanova Law Review Helen Alvar a law professor and longtime adviser to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops describes the contraception mandate as the culmination of what she calls the contraceptive project Professor Alvar writes The churches opposing the mandate hold and teach women and men to maintain an understanding of the sacredness of sexual intercourse and its intrinsic connection with the procreating of new vulnerable human life The government policy of covering contraception she says would have the effect in law of characterizing these teachings as violations of womens freedom and equality As Professor Alvar surely knows nearly all Catholic women use birth control at some time during their reproductive lives and they have abortions at the same rate as other American women And her article acknowledges a recent and widely reported study that found that the abortion rate dropped by as much as twothirds among women in St Louis most of them poor who volunteered for a twoyear project in which they received free birth control the women were able to choose the highly reliable longlasting contraceptives that are priced out of reach for many women who will now be able to receive them under the Affordable Care Act To the extent that the contraceptive project changes anything on the American reproductive landscape it will be to reduce the rate of unintended pregnancy and abortion The objection then has to be not to the mandates actual impact but to its expressive nature its implicit endorsement of a value system that says its perfectly OK to have sex without the goal of making a baby While most Americans surely share this view given the personal choices they make in their own lives many nonetheless find it uncomfortable to acknowledge From the Obama administrations point of view of course the contraception mandate is about health care The policy was based on a report by the Institute of Medicine that listed contraception as one of the preventive services along with immunizations and cholesterol and diabetes screening among dozens of other services that a comprehensive health insurance policy should provide The administration has framed this aspect of the Affordable Care Act as the implementation of evidencebased medicine which of course it is and should be But theres a missing piece One of the failures of the Affordable Care Act saga it seems to me has been the presidents unwillingness or inability to present universal health care as a moral issue a moral right in a civilized society Thus the administration meets the moral claims of its opponents in technocratic mode one hand tied behind its back Theres a powerful argument to be made both in policy and law that an employer of any faith or no faith who chooses to enter the secular marketplace cant pick and choose which rules to follow As some of the federal judges who have rejected the religious claims in these cases have pointed out no employer would have the right to tell employees that they cant use their wages to obtain contraceptives abortions or any other legal product or service By paying employees as the law requires neither a corporation nor its owner is endorsing the employees choice of what to spend their money on  no more than a local government endorses a parents choice to use a taxpayerfunded voucher for religiousschool tuition The Supreme Court for decades has embraced the notion that an intervening private choice of this sort even when a government program is clearly designed to channel public money to religious institutions avoids what would otherwise be a violation of the First Amendments Establishment Clause So now once again the court will have the last word A ruling against the contraception mandate wont kill the Affordable Care Act  much as some justices might fervently desire that result If the court grants the exemption the companies seek its decision will most likely come packaged as an exercise in statutory interpretation Only the old culture warrior Antonin Scalia can be counted on to acknowledge the deeper issues in play But those issues will be there nonetheless and thats what makes these cases so compelling

"As Fund-Raisers in Congress, Women Break the Cash Ceiling",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/us/politics/as-women-build-political-power-a-fund-raising-tide-turns.html,WASHINGTON  The first time Senator Patty Murray ran for local office she was so embarrassed to ask people for money for her campaign that she and her husband held a garage sale But her generous husband could not stop himself from giving away an expensive lawn mower she said leaving the fundraiser at a net loss By the time she ran for the Senate in 1992 she had gained the confidence to hold out the hat enthusiastically I learned that you have to ask people said Ms Murray Democrat of Washington adding The guys could go to the Chamber of Commerce I went to the moms who had kids in preschool For decades female candidates lagged behind their male counterparts in fundraising largely because donors most of them men did not have faith in their ability to win Women  the goto donors for female office seekers  were historically more interested in giving to causes than to candidates But over the last decade women running for Congress have raised on average more than their male counterparts and substantially more in the Senate in election cycles when prominent women like Hillary Rodham Clinton and Elizabeth Warren were in the game Ms Warren who has emerged as a fundraising powerhouse collected 421 million for her race last year in Massachusetts the most money a woman has ever raised in a Senate campaign Second place goes to Mrs Clinton who raised 387 million for her 2006 Senate reelection campaign The financial advantage among women is especially true for Democrats who have benefited from a fundraising machine for liberal female candidates the increase in female donors who tend to give to Democrats and the rise of small donations which have helped women in particular There has been a change in peoples perceptions of womens ability to run and the power they are able to accumulate once elected said Dee Dee Myers the author of Why Women Should Rule the World and a managing director at the Glover Park Group a Washington lobbying and communications firm In politics money follows the winners Women in the Senate who now hold a record 20 seats and lead some of the most powerful committees tell a lifetime of stories about running for office and being told they could not win  and therefore would not be getting a check Senator Dianne Feinstein Democrat of California recalled her race for governor in 1990 when people suggested that she get her rich husband to pay for the campaign and women were afraid to spend their own money One woman asked me How can I help Ms Feinstein said I said You can make a contribution and she said Ill need to ask my husband There was enormous bias against women by other women And thats been the biggest change Female Democratic candidates have been helped the most by other women The Center for Responsive Politics reports that Democratic women running for Congress in 2014 have received almost 40 percent of their money from women compared with 29 percent for female Republicans Many Democrats credit Emilys List a political action committee established in 1985 to help Democratic women who support abortion rights Since its founding it has raised over 350 million and has helped elect hundreds of women around the country Senator Barbara Mikulski Democrat of Maryland and the longestserving woman in the Senate said that when Emilys List paid for a poll in her first Senate race in 1986 it showed a base of support that indicated she could win It showed I had a core base in an area that was determinative she said Emilys List has just been an enormous force Republicans have sought to catch up There is a lot more money in the Democratic Party said Marjorie Dannenfelser the president of the Susan B Anthony List which supports candidates who oppose abortion Senator Susan Collins Republican of Maine said the men in her party often hurt contributions to Republican women There have been times when a few Republican candidates have made truly offensive and outrageous statements that unfortunately have splashed on other Republicans among women donors she said Once women accumulate power their fundraising ability grows much stronger Representative Nancy Pelosi Democrat of California who is one of the most robust fundraisers in the country recalled that when she first set out to raise money as a congresswoman I could not raise large sums for the party because people would say to me You dont have any decisionmaking power hereÂ  That is why I ran for whip she added When you call people and tell people what your purpose is youre likely to get something But women who still run for office at a far lower rate than men are stymied by the business groups and local boards that tend to give money more readily to firsttime male candidates than to firsttime female candidates But women have gotten better at employing social networks and fundraisers that focus on female guests Womens lunches with speakers aimed at female audiences have become important for female candidates who also work the neighborhoods We have great networking at the store and the PTA said Senator Claire McCaskill Democrat of Missouri Ms Collins said she once attended a workshop on fundraising and asked the women leading it whom to seek out for contributions The advice was to use my Christmas card list she said It was actually great advice Ms Collins and others said that women routinely asked for too little When running for the Senate in 1996 she declined to put a 1000 check box on an envelope for donors because she thought it seemed like too much sticking instead with a 500 cap The first thing her campaign manager did she said was throw out the donation envelopes and order new ones with a 1000 box to check Your ask can never be too big because nobody is insulted by that said Roz Wyman a major Democratic fundraiser in Los Angeles In small states they never ask for enough money But this has been offset for women by the increasing role of small donors especially via the web who have helped build war chests for candidates of both sexes The strength of our effort right now is our small donors said Ms Pelosi who would like to see legislation that provides matching funds for such donations Its a mobilizing tool as well as a fundraising tool Women still make up only 20 percent of donors to political action committees compared with 15 percent in 1990 Small donors started to turn the dollars toward women and the trend seems likely to continue Ms Murrays fortunes turned when she ran for the Senate and women would send her 10 bills with notes saying I know youll spend it wisely
Abortion Cases in Court Helped Tilt Democrats Against the Filibuster,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/us/politics/abortion-cases-in-court-helped-tilt-democrats-against-the-filibuster.html,WASHINGTON  Within hours of each other two federal appeals courts handed down separate decisions that affirmed sharp new limits on abortion and birth control One on Oct 31 forced abortion clinics across Texas to close The other on Nov 1 compared contraception to a grave moral wrong and sided with businesses that refused to provide it in health care coverage These are the kinds of decisions we are going to have to live with a blunt Senator Harry Reid the Democratic majority leader warned his caucus later as it weighed whether to make historic changes to Senate rules Those changes would break a Republican filibuster of President Obamas nominees and end the minority partys ability to block a presidents choices to executive branch posts and federal courts except the Supreme Court The moment represented a turning point in what had been until then a cautious approach by Democrats to push back against Republicans who were preventing the White House from appointing liberal judges All the more glaring Democrats believed was that they had allowed confirmation of the conservative judges now ruling in the abortion cases Republicans were blocking any more appointments to the court of appeals in Washington which issued the contraception decision Faced with the possibility that they might never be able to seat judges that they hoped would act as a counterweight to more conservative appointees confirmed when George W Bush was president all but three of the 55 members of the Senate Democratic caucus sided with Mr Reid The decision represented a recognition by Democrats that they had to risk a backlash in the Senate to head off what they saw as a far greater longterm threat to their priorities in the form of a judiciary tilted to the right The final tipping point was this month when the minority launched a campaign to block President Obama from appointing anyone regardless of experience and character to three vacancies on the DC circuit court said Senator Jeff Merkley Democrat of Oregon and one of the leading proponents of filibuster limits This constituted an attack on the balance and integrity of our courts The question of the composition of the federal judiciary has become even more pressing for liberals given the battery of abortion rights cases now making their way through the courts From Texas to South Dakota to Wisconsin federal courts across the country  many of them with vacancies that the president will now be able to fill  are seeing their dockets grow with challenges to restrictive new antiabortion laws Very quickly and unexpectedly abortion and contraceptive rights became the decisive factor in the filibuster fight First there were the two coincidentally timed decisions out of Texas and Washington Then momentum to change the rules reached a critical mass when Senator Barbara Boxer Democrat of California and a defender of abortion rights decided to put aside her misgivings in large part because the recent court action was so alarming to her Democrats said Mr Reid and many members of his caucus found it especially disquieting that in 2005 they agreed to confirm the two judges who wrote the recent decisions  Janice Rogers Brown of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and Priscilla R Owen of the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit  as part of a deal with Senate Republicans who controlled the chamber at the time and were threatening to limit Democrats ability to filibuster judges if some of Mr Bushs nominees were not approved Conservatives have always viewed the federal courts as a last line of defense in the countrys cultural and political fights Among their base it is a central tenet that electing Republican presidents is vital precisely because they appoint rightleaning judges who will keep perceived liberal overreach in check The issue has never been as powerful for liberals Consider for example how often Republican candidates laud Supreme Court justices like Antonin Scalia and Clarence Thomas compared with how relatively rarely Democrats mention liberal justices like Ruth Bader Ginsburg Republicans and conservatives have been better about the base understanding the significance of judicial nominations than the groups left of center said Jay Sekulow chief counsel of the American Center for Law and Justice which fights for conservative causes in the courts Partly for that reason conservatives say Republicans will not be afraid to force their preferred judges through the Senate should it and the White House flip back to Republican control There was this rule in place and itd been in place for a long time to prevent the kind of thing youre going to see now which is attempted court packing Mr Sekulow said Republicans wont be afraid to return the favor In the case before the Washington appeals court Judge Brown issued an opinion siding with Freshway Foods a produce company that opposes contraception and abortion so strongly that some of its delivery trucks have been emblazoned with signs declaring Its not a choice its a child In the opinion she likened the governments requirement that the company cover birth control for its employees to affirming a repugnant belief and wrote that the company would be forced to be complicit in a grave moral wrong  In the Texas case which is still in its early stages and set to be argued in January Judge Owen agreed that the state had a legitimate public health reason for requiring that doctors who perform abortions have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals and rejected the claim by Planned Parenthood of Greater Texas and other plaintiffs that the state was placing too high a burden on women who want the procedure Because many abortion doctors do not have admitting privileges clinics across the state have shut down since the courts ruling  A case challenging a similar law in Wisconsin will go before the federal appeals circuit court in Chicago next week and other cases challenge admitting privileges laws in Mississippi and Alabama Because these cases continue to move through the courts  and because antiabortion activists elsewhere are trying to make states like Michigan Pennsylvania and Georgia the next legal battlegrounds over abortion  Democrats focus on judges is expected to intensify The courts are critically important backstops for the protection of womens health and the ability of women to access abortion said Jennifer Dalven director of the reproductive freedom project at the American Civil Liberties Union which is fighting legal battles in several states But what we saw in Texas reminds us that we cannot be complacent and feel sure that the courts will be there to correct everything We must stop these laws before they pass
Dolan Says Church Is â€˜Caricaturedâ€™ as Antigay,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/11/30/nyregion/dolan-says-church-is-caricatured-as-anti-gay.html,Cardinal Timothy M Dolan said on Friday that the Roman Catholic Church was being caricatured as being antigay even as he lamented the continued expansion of samesex marriage in the United States and vowed to keep fighting it  The remarks were made in an interview with NBCs Meet the Press in which Cardinal Dolan the archbishop of New York discussed the churchs positions on abortion and the Affordable Care Act in addition to gay rights The interview is scheduled to be broadcast on Sunday excerpts were released on Friday  In the interview Cardinal Dolan said the church had been outmarketed on the issue of samesex marriage by Hollywood and by some politicians who have tried to paint the church in a negative light Were promarriage were protraditional marriage were not antianybody he said The cardinals comments on samesex marriage come amid a recalibration of tone in the church on the issue of homosexuality a move led by Pope Francis even as the substance of its position remains largely unchanged In July Pope Francis surprised many when he suggested that he would not judge priests for their sexual orientation He has since cautioned against succumbing to moral relativism and on Tuesday endorsed a document written by the bishops of the United States that insists that those with a homosexual inclination be held to objective moral norms even if this is perceived as prejudiced  With Illinois this month becoming the 16th state to legalize samesex marriage the host of Meet the Press David Gregory asked whether Cardinal Dolan thought that regardless of church teachings samesex marriage would soon be legal in every state I think Id be a Pollyanna to say that there doesnt seem to be kind of a stampede to do this he said I regret that Asked whether he thought the battle over samesex marriage in the United States was settled he said No I dont think it is Uhuh On the issue of the Affordable Care Act Cardinal Dolan reiterated the churchs opposition to requirements that insurance provide coverage for contraception He also criticized it for not including undocumented immigrants We Catholics who are kind of among the pros when it comes to providing health care do it because of our religious conviction and because of the dictates of our conscience he said And now were being asked to violate some of those He said that the Roman Catholic Church had been pushing for universal health care for decades but would not support the health care law without changes to address these concerns Mr President please youre really kind of pushing aside some of your greatest supporters here he said We want to be with you we want to be strong And if you keep doing this were not going to be able to be one of your cheerleaders
The Pope and the Right,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/01/opinion/sunday/douthat-the-pope-and-the-right.html,NOW its your turn to be part of the loyal opposition a fellow Catholic journalist said to me earlier this year as Pope Franciss agenda was beginning to take shape The friend was a political liberal and lifelong Democrat accustomed to being on the wrong side of his churchs teaching on issues like abortion bioethics and samesex marriage Now he cheerfully suggested rightleaning Catholics like me would get a taste of the same experience from a pope who seemed intent on skirting the culture war and stressing the churchs mission to the poor instead After Franciss latest headlinemaking exhortation which roves across the entire life of the church but includes a sharp critique of consumer capitalism and financial laissezfaire politically conservative Catholics have reached for several explanations for why my friend is wrong and why they arent the new cafeteria Catholics First they have pointed out that theres nothing truly novel here apart from a lazy media narrative that pits Good Pope Francis against his bad reactionary predecessors Many of the new popes comments track with what Benedict XVI said in his own economic encyclical and with past papal criticisms of commercial capitalisms discontents Second they have sought to depoliticize the popes comments recasting them as a general brief against avarice and consumerism rather than a call for specific government interventions And finally they have insisted on the difference between church teaching on faith and morals and papal pronouncements on economic issues noting that theres nothing that obliges Catholics to believe the pontiff is infallible on questions of public policy All three responses have their merits but they still seem insufficient to the Francis eras challenge to Catholics on the limitedgovernment freemarket right Its true that there is far more continuity between Francis and Benedict than media accounts suggest But the new pope clearly intends to foreground the churchs social teaching in new ways and probably seeks roughly the press coverage hes getting Its also true that Franciss framework is pastoral rather than political But his plain language tilts leftward in ways that no serious reader can deny Finally its true that there is no Catholic position on say the correct marginal tax rate and that Catholics are not obliged to heed the pope when he suggests that global inequality is increasing when the statistical evidence suggests otherwise But the churchs social teaching is no less an official teaching for allowing room for disagreement on its policy implications And for Catholics who pride themselves on fidelity to Rome the burden is on them  on us  to explain why a worldview that inspires leftleaning papal rhetoric also allows for rightofcenter conclusions That explanation rests I think on three ideas First that when it comes to lifting the poor out of poverty global capitalism faults and all has a better track record by far than any other system or approach Second that Catholic social teaching properly understood emphasizes both solidarity and subsidiarity  that is a smallc conservative preference for local efforts over national ones voluntarism over bureaucracy Third that on recent evidence the most expansive welfare states can crowd out what Christianity considers the most basic human goods  by lowering birthrates discouraging private charity and restricting the churchs freedom to minister in subtle but increasingly consequential ways This Catholic case for limited government however is not a case for the Ayn Randian temptation inherent to a capitalismfriendly politics There is no Catholic warrant for valorizing entrepreneurs at the expense of ordinary workers or for dismissing all regulation as unnecessary and all redistribution as immoral And this is where Franciss vision should matter to American Catholics who usually cast ballots for Republican politicians The popes words shouldnt inspire them to convert en masse to liberalism or to worry that the throne of Peter has been seized by a Marxist antipope But they should encourage a much greater integration of Catholic and conservative ideas than weve seen since compassionate conservatism collapsed and inspire Catholics to ask more  often much more  of the Republican Party on a range of policy issues Here my journalist friends loyal opposition line oversimplified the options for Catholic political engagement His Catholic liberalism didnt go into eclipse because it failed to let the Vatican dictate every jot and tittle of its social agenda Rather it lost influence because it failed to articulate any kind of clear Catholic difference within the bigger liberal tent on issues like abortion sex and marriage Now the challenge for conservative Catholics is to do somewhat better in our turn and to spend the Francis era not in opposition but seeking integration  meaning an economic vision that remains conservative but in the details reminds the world that our Catholic faith comes first
Bishops Sued Over Anti-Abortion Policies at Catholic Hospitals,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/03/us/lawsuit-challenges-anti-abortion-policies-at-catholic-hospitals.html,The American Civil Liberties Union announced on Monday that it had filed a lawsuit against the nations Roman Catholic bishops arguing that their antiabortion directives to Catholic hospitals hamper proper care of pregnant women in medical distress leading to medical negligence  The suit was filed in federal court in Michigan on Friday on behalf of a woman who says she did not receive accurate information or care at a Catholic hospital there exposing her to dangerous infections after her water broke at 18 weeks of pregnancy  In an unusual step she is not suing the hospital Mercy Health Partners in Muskegon but rather the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops Its ethical and religious directives the suit alleges require Catholic hospitals to avoid abortion or referrals even when doing so places a womans health or life at risk  The suit opens a new front in the clash over religious rights and medical care The Catholic Church has fought against requiring all health plans to include coverage of contraception and is likely to call the new lawsuit an attack on its core religious principles  Catholic hospitals account for about one in six of the countrys hospital beds and in many regions their influence is spreading as they forge alliances with nonCatholic medical groups This isnt about religious freedom its about medical care said Louise Melling deputy legal director of the civil liberties union in a telephone news conference on Monday  Both the Muskegon hospital and the bishops conference declined to comment Tamesha Means the plaintiff in the lawsuit said that when she was 18 weeks pregnant her water broke and she rushed to Mercy Health the only hospital in her county  Her fetus had virtually no chance of surviving according to medical experts who reviewed the case and in these circumstances doctors usually induce labor or surgically remove the fetus to reduce the mothers chances of infection  But the doctors at Mercy Health Ms Means said did not tell her that the fetus could not survive or that continuing her pregnancy was risky and did not admit her for observation  She returned the next morning bleeding and in pain and was sent home again That night she went a third time feverish and writhing with pain she miscarried at the hospital and the fetus died soon after  At the news conference Monday Dr Douglas W Laube an obstetrician at the University of Wisconsin Medical School described the care Ms Means received as basic neglect He added It could have turned into a disaster with both baby and mother dying  The ACLU said it had filed suit against the bishops because there had been several cases in recent years in which Catholic hospital policies on abortion had interfered with medical care  John M Haas president of the National Catholic Bioethics Center in Philadelphia and an adviser to the bishops said he could not speak about the current suit because he was unfamiliar with it But he said that the bishops directives were more nuanced than critics allege allowing for actions to treat a woman at risk even if that treatment might result in the loss of the fetus  He said some hospitals might have misinterpreted the bishops rules and added that doctors were required to tell patients of potential risks and alternatives though they may not provide direct abortion referrals  In 2010 the diocese of Phoenix stripped a hospital of its affiliation after doctors there said they performed an abortion to save a mothers life
Case Over Gun-Safety Ads Fosters Unlikely Alliance,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/us/case-over-gun-safety-ads-fosters-unlikely-alliance.html,PHOENIX  A state appeals court here heard arguments on Tuesday about whether Phoenix was within its rights to remove bus shelter ads that proclaimed Guns Save Lives which the city said constituted political speech The ads paid for by the owner of a business offering gunsafety lessons contained text in smaller type praising the State Legislature for allowing people to carry concealed weapons without a permit The case has fostered an unlikely alliance between groups more often found at opposite sides of the political spectrum the Goldwater Institute a libertarian research organization and the American Civil Liberties Union This is not about ideology said Dan Pochoda the legal director for the ACLU of Arizona which filed an amicus brief in support of the business owner Alan Korwin This is about important constitutional issues which matter to both of us In court Clint Bolick director of Goldwaters ScharfNorton Center for Constitutional Litigation said the case was also about the arbitrariness implied in the citys advertisement standards City officials have allowed another ad poster that reads Jesus Heals asserting that its purpose is clearly commercial because it lists the signal and frequency of a Christian radio station In 2010 city officials decided that the text of the gun ad inscribed in bold letters within a large heart sounded like political speech and ordered them removed from 50 cityowned bus shelters That prompted Mr Korwin to file a lawsuit claiming that his right to free speech had been violated A lower court ruled against Mr Korwin last year and the Goldwater Institute appealed on his behalf On Tuesday Judge Kenton Jones one of the three appellate judges hearing the arguments asked Mr Bolick of the institute Do you think theyre precluding your ad because it addresses guns No Your Honor Mr Bolick replied It was he said a question of placing boundaries where there should be none The argument challenges precedent In 1998 the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit affirmed a lower courts ruling that Phoenix could ban an antiabortion groups ad from the side of municipal buses because its main purpose was to promote a noncommercial message The ad read Before I formed you in the womb I knew you  God Choose life It also puts to test the Arizona Constitution whose freespeech clause did not figure in the 1998 ruling which was grounded on the principles of the United States Constitution The clause has taken center stage in Mr Korwins case though because of the more liberal protections it affords David Schwartz the lawyer for the City of Phoenix said the problem ultimately was not in the gunssavelives message Were OK with it he said But he went on you have to look at the entirety of the ad Nowhere does it explain what is being proposed he said You have to look at the text and when you look at the text youre met with all this political rhetoric He compared it to the Jesus Heals ad that the city deemed acceptable and which contained the image a cross telling the judges that while you can argue the cross by itself isnt commercial in the context of the advertisement it is appropriate because it tells the person who sees the ad that if they listen to the radio station they will hear religious conversation Mr Korwin who has written several books on gun laws listened from the front row flanked by supporters including a man in a red white and blue National Rifle Association tie Outside court Mr Korwin said the ad was meant to educate the public spread firearm training and safety information as broadly as possible The ads were displayed just after Gov Jan Brewer signed the concealedfirearms law in April 2010 making Arizona the third state at the time to eliminate permit requirements for concealed weapons This is about whether the city can tell people what they can say or not Mr Korwin said He recently bought space on 30 bus shelters to display a new version of the ad with the slogan Guns Stop Crime Judge Patricia K Norris another appellate judge said the court would issue a decision in due time
The Center Cannot Hold,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/04/opinion/edsall-the-center-cannot-hold.html,If you ask them Americans will tell you that they want constructive compromise and a more conciliatory political regime even though they are reluctant to reach agreement when it comes to the specific issues that they actually care about In Why American Political Parties Cant Get Beyond the LeftRight Divide three experts on voting behavior argue that proponents of a revival of a less divisive politics should keep their hopes down The core of the argument made at a conference last month at the University of Akron by the political scientists Edward Carmines of Indiana University Michael Ensley of Kent State University and Michael Wagner of the University of Wisconsin lies in the graphic representation in Figure 1 which shows the distribution of political orientations in the United States  According to their analysis of American National Election Studies poll data from the last 40 years the electorate is divided into five ideological categories liberals who make up 19 percent of voters conservatives 27 percent libertarians 22 percent populists 11 percent and in the lighter gray center moderates at 21 percent Carminess fivegroup analysis produces more finely grained results than traditional analyses of political identification that focus on just three variables conservative liberal or moderate These traditional surveys show a much larger bloc in the moderate center generally 35 percent or more This tripartite conservativemoderateliberal approach results in what Carmine and his collaborators contend is far too large a group in the middle Their method reveals a much weaker moderate core  This finding undermines the prospect of basing campaign strategy or a third political party on an imaginary centrist coalition Carmines expanded on this point by email In a separate email to The Times Wagner one of Carminess coauthors writes that most moderates are not pure centrists but a healthy mix of libertarians populists and centrists Attempting to unite populists and libertarians under one new banner is virtually impossible because they are just as different from each other as liberals are different from conservatives making it hard for a centrist to appeal to them In a followup email Ensley  Carminess other coauthor  provided an anecdotal example of the challenges faced by advocates of a centrist approach Ensley describes a stereotype of a populist an older white male voter who is probably of union family He is worried about Social Security and Medicare being there for him However he is also probably uncomfortable with issues like gay marriage He is probably uncomfortable with abortion on demand He is probably a churchgoing fellow Ensley argues that if this hypothetical voter is given a chance to cast a presidential ballot for Michael Bloomberg sometimes mentioned as a possible third party candidate he is probably indifferent between Bloomberg and the Democratic and Republicans options They are all equally unappealing Conversely Ensley suggests a typical libertarian RonPaul type voter looks at Bloomberg and celebrates the social liberalism progay marriage prochoice which is the exact thing that the populist does not like about Bloomberg At the same time however the libertarian sees in Bloomberg a nannystate proregulation sodataxing machine that repels him What then Ensley asks is the poor hypothetical third party candidate to do Any move to appease the populist side is likely to repel the libertarian side and vice versa As soon as a centrist candidate starts to take sides then the grand coalition of populists moderates and libertarians crumbles The CarminesEnsleyWagner analysis helps explain the roiling nature of contemporary politics what they call the deepseated ideological heterogeneity of the American electorate The heterogeneity lying just under the surface polarization has led to two seemingly divergent developments The relatively narrow voting groups that fit the traditional definition of liberal and conservative are entrenched in the twoparty system  conservatives strongly sharing the policy preferences of the Republican Party and liberals strongly sharing the policy preferences of the Democratic Party  and the very depth of this belief creates the gap that defines political polarization But there is another world of disaffection aswirl here too Populists and libertarians are disconnected from both parties often crosspressured issue by issue with libertarians gravitating toward the Republican Party on economics and to the Democrats on social issues while populists are propelled in the opposite direction Voters clearly have issue positions that do not fall neatly into welldefined leftright categories There are dozens of economic and social issues as the tables in their paper show on which a voter can fall into any one of Carminess five ideological categories Complexity and seeming contradiction is the rule not the exception Democrats and Republicans each have two alternative strategies available as they seek to build a majority coalition according to Carmines and his collaborators On the one hand the parties can focus on turning out core supporters This would lead to more polarization and weaken the appeal to voters falling in the populist libertarian and moderate camps On the other hand the parties can try to boost support among libertarians populists and those moderates who do actually exist For libertarians Democrats would have to move to the right on economic issues and Republicans to the left on social issues For populists the opposite would be true For moderates both parties would have to move to the center on economic and social issues weakening their core support among liberals for Democrats and among conservatives for Republicans In each case there is a tradeoff further bolstering the argument that a successful centrist movement is unlikely to materialize At the same time a separate trend appears to strengthen the Carmines thesis that centrism as a free standing movement is in trouble the decline in the percentage of the electorate composed of swing voters As John Sides a political scientist at Georgetown told The Timess Rebecca Berg There is so much pop psychology surrounding swing voters but there is very little evidence that there are key demographics in the population that are inherently swing voters Its possible Sides argues to drill down down down down and identify a group of swing voters But how big is that group really and is that group a swing group in a chronic sense Probably not Carmines and his collaborators aside populists and libertarians are now further subdivided into left and right populists and left and right libertarians There are at least two scenarios that could result in a reduction of polarization The first is that if presidential losses pile up the business wing of the Republican Party will try harder to marginalize the Tea Party wing and move the party back toward the middle The other and far less likely scenario is that the economically disadvantaged wing of the Democratic Party  the downstairs in the Democrats upstairsdownstairs coalition  gains ascendance forcing relatively affluent social liberals fearful of higher taxes into the arms of Republicans and shifting the balance of power back toward the historic center The lack of real moderates means that the most likely course of events is a continuation of partisan confrontation with Republicans holding their own in offyear elections and Democrats maintaining a fragile edge in presidential contests The vestigial idea of a center up for grabs will continue to play a marginal role in legislative calculations and campaign strategies but the dream of a moderate revolt against the parties will remain out of reach exposed as an illusion

Scholars Explore Christian Perspectives on Animal Rights,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/us/exploring-christian-perspectives-on-animal-rights.html,BALTIMORE  There was a time when Rebecca our eldest was desperate to have a pet David Clough told me when we met at the American Academy of Religion conference held in Baltimore before Thanksgiving And she was in the unhappy position of having a father who had reflected ethically on the question at some length  a father with misgivings about the human use of animals even for companionship Professor Clough had come from the University of Chester in his native England to speak about On Animals Volume 1 half of a twobook project situating animals in Christian thought Summing up his argument he said that human and otherthanhuman animals are created by God reconciled to God in Jesus Christ and will be redeemed by God in the new creation  and should be treated accordingly This belief has ramifications on everything from eating meat no especially from factory farming to keeping pets maybe Good theology ought to recognize one fundamental separation Professor Clough said between God and all God has created We belong with dogs and cats and hedgehogs and trees and rocks His project a Christian perspective on animal treatment is not unique Animal welfare is a lively topic among Christians in the United States and England including  surprisingly  some political or theological conservatives And as Christians ask how their faith requires them to treat animals they may force animal rights activists a mostly secular lot to reconsider their views on Christians Professor Cloughs book which came out in 2012 is one of two recent major Christian treatises on animal rights The other published this year is For Love of Animals Christian Ethics Consistent Action by Charles Camosy a Fordham professor and a Catholic who has given up meat  though he still eats fish half because Jesus Christ ate fish and half because I am too weak to give up my grandmothers tuna spaghetti sauce he told me In For Love of Animals Dr Camosy links his concern for animals to his beliefs on abortion arguing that the Catholic ethics of respect for life and care for the vulnerable should make us reconsider how we treat animals The Catholic catechism permits meat eating he told me but with two qualifications we owe animals kindness and its wrong to cause them to suffer needlessly The clear implication he said is that except for the poor who cant get food other ways everyone has a duty at least to avoid eating factoryfarmed animals Mary Eberstadt a political conservative and a Catholic wrote the introduction to Dr Camosys book and has praised it in National Review After being in and out of vegetarianism for decades as she said in an email this week she now eats fish Her choices were influenced she said by the vegetarian Leo Tolstoys 1909 essay about a slaughterhouse and by Dominion The Power of Man the Suffering of Animals and the Call to Mercy the 2002 book by Matthew Scully a conservative who was raised Catholic and wrote speeches for President George W Bush Although there is an old small tradition of Christian vegetarianism the modern field of Christian animal rights can be dated to 1976 when Andrew Linzey a theology student at Kings College London looked around at his fellow Christians and was struck by how little they cared about cruelty to animals I was puzzled by the indifference of my teachers to the issue and the general thoughtlessness of Christians Professor Linzey who now teaches at Oxford said in an email this week So he wrote Animal Rights A Christian Assessment which was published in 1976 while he was still a student Although Professor Linzeys book caused a sensation in Christian circles animal welfare became mainly a secular cause Christians focused on other battles  from the right abortion from the left war and poverty  while some secular animalrights activists were suspicious of Christianity concurring with Peter Singers claim in his 1975 classic Animal Liberation that Christian teaching about mans dominion had been an impediment to animal rights For several years Professor Singer and Dr Camosy have been in frequent communication and last year Dr Camosy wrote a book about his fellow ethicist Peter Singer and Christian Ethics Beyond Polarization Last month the two men spoke together in Maryland at the national headquarters of the Humane Society of the United States As a result of their conversations Professor Singer says he has become somewhat more charitable toward Christianity I think Charlies helped me to see that thats overly negative Professor Singer said referring to his depiction of Christianity in Animal Liberation Its not that the negative statements  giving humans permission to use and abuse animals  arent there because they are and were made by major figures from Augustine to Aquinas and so on But there is another side to it and other Christians have different interpretations of mans dominion That other side to it includes a shadow history of Christian support for animal rights Christine Gutleben who runs religious outreach for the Humane Society noted that Christian reformers including the antislavery activist William Wilberforce helped found what became the Royal Society for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals in 1824 Any serious look at the history will uncover examples of Christian concern for animals Ms Gutleben said Absolutely Christianity is part of the solution Of course these views are hardly mainstream For every Rod Dreher the Orthodox Christian blogger and meateater who recently wrote a respectful post about Dr Camosy and the others or Andrew Sullivan the Catholic blogger who also praised Dr Camosy there may be an Austin Ruse Writing in Crisis a Catholic magazine in October he called Dr Camosys views deeply offensive Its always offensive to lead the faithful astray Mr Ruse said when I called to ask about his choice of words But back to the important question Did Rebecca Professor Cloughs daughter get her pet She did Rebecca now 15 can thank Mary Midgley the English philosopher who wrote Animals and Why They Matter Riding a train with Professor Clough she suggested he consider a cat She said Surely a cat is OKÂ  Â  Professor Clough recalled If you allow them to go outside they can come and go as they please If they hate it they can pick someone else or go feral Of course one has to marvel at the cat foolish enough to abandon the Cloughs She  the cat is named Mitsy  is unlikely to find more considerate treatment
A Collector Bets His Eye and His Gut,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/arts/design/a-collector-bets-his-eye-and-his-gut.html,MIAMI BEACH  Eleven minutes into the 11 am preview of Art Basel Miami Beach on Wednesday Steve Wilson a Kentucky collector made his first purchase an installation made from dozens of bricks by the Italian artist Elisabetta Benassi And Mr Wilson was just revving up At 1120 he told a dealer to reserve a large collage for a couple of hours so his wife could take a look Seventeen minutes later at a different booth he bought a bust sculpted with a chain saw from a stack of Encyclopedia Britannicas by Wim Botha of South Africa Total time 37 minutes Total sticker price for the three pieces 117000 While the multimilliondollar auction prices for big names like Jeff Koons and Francis Bacon grab headlines throughout the world it is collectors like Mr Wilson that new artists and their dealers depend on adventurous enthusiasts who pay no attention to highpriced advisers market forecasts or buzz and will bet on unknown and emerging creators Mr Wilson relies on his eye and his gut snapping up gallerysized installations for four and five figures in less time than it takes most people to buy a pair of shoes A shopping trip with him can be a bit of a whirlwind spree with dealers rushing to explain the art and make the sale before his attention wanders I love him said Chris Dercon director of the Tate Modern in London Most people want to collect like their neighbors He wants to collect things he doesnt know yet Hes not afraid to make a mistake In the brief time before the fair ends on Sunday Mr Wilson wants to visit as many of the 258 dealers registered as possible He and his wife Laura Lee Brown an artist and a part of Kentuckys aristocracy  her grandfather was the founder of what is now BrownForman the maker of Jack Daniels and Southern Comfort  were among an estimated 50000 visitors perusing Art Basels 3 billion worth of art a mix of works by Modern and contemporary masters along with pieces by emerging stars The couple also want to take in the dozens of satellite fairs museum exhibitions and private open houses that are spread throughout downtown and northern Miami By Friday afternoon the two had bought more than 25 pieces The pairs taste and shopping techniques could not be more different Ms Brown is slow and deliberate Mr Wilson thin and lanky races along the aisles in his black Prada sneakers like a kid with only one day at Disneyland and a determination to try every ride I like things that are provoking that people have trouble talking about Mr Wilson said So he and his wife have a rule We dont say no to each other The couples interest in art came together in 2006 when they created 21c a combination museum and hotel in downtown Louisville their hometown It is filled with selections from their 1600piece collection by living artists Mr Wilson generally negotiates with dealers for a museum discount Weve only traded in one piece said Mr Wilson 65 and that was because the artist died Ms Brown finally arrives around noon with the curator of their museum Alice Gray Stites and Edward Heavrin a videographer tracking the couples artistic projects Mr Wilson is eager to get his wifes opinion on the collage on reserve and his other purchases but he is frustrated by the wait I dont like all this backtracking he says They return for the collage but discover that the dealer misunderstood which piece he wanted and sold it to another collector Beth Rudin DeWoody of New York Mr Wilson looks as if he had just heard that his dog ran away from home He stops at a favorite gallery and asks about a work combining several photographs and text Mr Wilson says with surprise 150000 Its just paper and cheap frames Taking his wife by the arm to hurry her along they return to look at the Benassi he bought earlier Ms Brown looks down at the 8by10foot rectangle of red bricks on the floor Each is etched with the name and registration number of a piece of space debris orbiting the Earth The information is from a survey compiled by the National Security Agency I dont get it she quietly says In another aisle they stop by a stack of bricks perched on a strippeddown bicycle So whats going on here Mr Wilson asks the dealer Luciana Brito of So Paulo Brazil She tells him that the bike is the kind that workers ride on the streets of So Paulo Its about equilibrium she says The class system Mr Wilson adds Ms Brito nods in agreement The gallery is asking 15000 for the work by Hctor Zamora There is a brief discussion Sold It is 105 I like this one Ms Brown says Mr Heavrin the videographer lowers his camera Can I just say this is the second pile of bricks that Steve has bought today After a quick lunch the group moves on to Untitled a fair under an enormous airconditioned tent on the beach There they examine large tapestries embellished with beads and flowers depicting the bling of Jamaican gangsters by a Kentucky artist they know Ebony G Patterson They ask about one panel priced at 18000 Sold All of them Mr Wilson asks in disbelief Then what are we doing here Next Within the hour they have bought five more works Zero Noon a statistical clock by Rafael LozanoHemmer that counts second by second dozens of statistics like the average number of abortions performed daily or Girl Scout cookies sold a mirror and refrigeration unit making reference to global warming by Mathias Kessler and three animal videos by Leslie Thornton Mr Wilson pauses by a pile of rice grains on the floor Above is a cage spitting out this bird feed Its a piece by Julian Charrire and Julius von Bismarck that debuted last year at the Architecture Biennale in Venice Pigeons flew in for a snack and were spraypainted with food dye in brilliant shades of red blue yellow and green the colors lasted about three weeks No harm was done to the birds the dealer promises A sly grin spreads over Mr Wilsons face We could change the color of the pigeons in Louisville he says Suddenly birds would begin to turn red and no one would understand why The asking price 80000 was on the high side but the dealer promised to contact the artist  and ask for a museum discount
Three Senators Try to Hold Off G.O.P. in South,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/us/politics/three-senators-try-to-hold-off-gop-in-south.html,NEW ORLEANS  Things traditionally get started a little late down here an inclination that runs from mealtimes to political races But with nearly a year to go before the 2014 election it is already open season on Senator Mary L Landrieu Democrat of Louisiana Why didnt she do her job protect us from Obamacare from the start asks a new ad from Americans for Prosperity a political nonprofit group founded by the billionaire industrialists Charles and David Koch And a post from a conservative blog that refers to her as MussoLandrieu with a picture of her face superimposed on the body of Benito Mussolini has been making the rounds on Twitter Republicans are so giddy about the prospect of winning her seat that their main problem is too many of them are trying to do so Its a different world than Louisiana was six years ago said Bernie Pinsonat a pollster in Baton Rouge We do not have Democrats who win anything in this state today  As Democrats look across the rest of the South the outlook does not get much better Ms Landrieu along with Senators Mark Pryor of Arkansas and Kay Hagan of North Carolina is pretty much all that is left of Southern Democrats in the Senate All three are up for reelection next year And the outcome of their races could determine whether the Southern Democrat once a formidable species in the Senate is headed for extinction Democrats are fighting against history in most of the South said Thomas F Schaller a professor of political science at the University of Maryland Baltimore County who wrote a book on Democrats and the South called Whistling Past Dixie You can still elect a Democrat to a statewide office in the South he added if you have the right candidate with the right biography in the right cycle And then hopefully you get some help from the Republicans nominating a bad candidate But thats a lot of ifs Next year Democrats will face not only a general hostility to the national party among Southern white voters but also a keen dislike of President Obamas Affordable Care Act Representative Bill Cassidy one of the Republicans opposing Ms Landrieu has an attack ad that calls her Barack Obamas rubber stamp She and her two Southern colleagues in the Senate voted for the health plan and have reiterated their support though they have also rushed to criticize the administrations handling of the rollout and pushed for modifications Republicans are trying to exploit the opening insisting that each of the incumbents muttered the decisive aye that allowed the law to pass which was approved 60 to 39 Pryor is the 60th vote Hagan is the 60th vote Landrieu is the 60th vote said Merle Black a professor of political science at Emory University in Atlanta Everybody is the 60th vote The Democrats peril is especially striking given the regions history Their party long dominated the old Confederacy a legacy of the Civil War Reconstruction and later resistance to civil rights and produced powerful Senate figures like Richard Russell of Georgia and James Eastland of Mississippi  The region has swung from total Democratic to almost total Republican control over the last halfcentury starting with voter defections from the Democrats in the 1960s emerging Republican congressional delegations in the 1990s and a wave of state legislative takeovers in recent years  Voting has increasingly become racially polarized John Barrow of Georgia is the only white Democrat in the House of Representatives from one of the Deep Souths five states If Republicans defeat Democratic incumbents in Arkansas Louisiana and North Carolina and hold on to the seat of Senator Saxby Chambliss of Georgia who is retiring they will control every Senate seat in the old Confederacy except in Florida and Virginia which have drifted culturally and politically from the rest of the South  Whatever bulwark Democrats had left in statehouses and governors mansions is mostly gone as well with Gov Mike Beebe of Arkansas finishing his last term In North Carolina Democrats lost control of the legislature in 2010 and last year the state elected a Republican governor for the first time in 20 years  Still despite their strategic edge and momentum Republicans have not sewn up any of the 2014 races For one thing all three Democratic senators have the advantage of incumbency And Ms Landrieu and Ms Hagan so far are facing fractured Republican opposition  Ms Hagans race in North Carolina is in many ways a local version of the larger problems both parties confront As a firstterm senator elected during the Democratic sweep of 2008 she is now challenged with differentiating herself from a national party that many independents feel has veered too far to the left To signal her unhappiness with the poorly executed rollout of the health care law she has called for an investigation into how HealthCaregov was designed and built But she may ultimately benefit from state Republican leaders prone to overreaching Her leading opponent is the speaker of the State House of Representatives Thom Tillis who has helped lead Republicans in Raleigh as they pushed through laws to regulate abortion clinics tighten voter identification requirements and reduce early voting Republicans this year also approved cuts to education while allowing people with concealedweapons permits to take their guns onto school property Democrats say those moves will make it easy to portray Republicans as reckless and extreme It hasnt been the best of times the past couple of cycles here conceded Robert Dempsey executive director of the State Democratic Party But this is a deeply purple state and in my humble opinion probably trends slightly blue Mr Cassidy Ms Landrieus opponent has attracted a more solid backing but struggled to unite Republican support A challenger to his right Rob Maness has drawn the endorsement of the Senate Conservatives Fund a Tea Partystyled group that helps conservative candidates topple moderate Republicans And Ms Landrieu is no fragile flower having won three times before In addition both Ms Landrieu and Mr Pryor of Arkansas are from respected political families Mr Pryors father was a governor and a senator and he has been making the case to voters that he represents the states tradition of pragmatic moderation particularly in contrast to his opponent Representative Tom Cotton a staunch conservative Not that it may matter that much said Rex Nelson a former Republican adviser and a former political editor of The Arkansas DemocratGazette Im not sure this is about the two men who are running for offices Mr Nelson said adding Its the Obama factor Arkansas was once quite different from other Southern states less raceobsessed and with a streak of mountain populism that kept it solidly Democratic well into this century The election of Mr Obama changed that practically overnight costing Democrats the seat of Senator Blanche Lincoln in 2010 and now imperiling Mr Pryor a classic Arkansas Blue Dog Facing these three tough reelections Democrats do see one slim possibility for a pickup in the South in Georgia There a fastgrowing minority population and a crowded Republican field give them hope Three Republican congressmen  Paul Broun Jack Kingston and Phil Gingrey  are battling one another in a contest that even some members of the party worry will result in a nominee who is too far to the right to be electable Others are not so sure that running as an unflinching conservative in Georgia is such a bad thing They point to Texas which despite a growing minority population has gone solidly Republican in statewide elections As for doubters who question the electability of such candidates Mr Schaller the Maryland professor said My threeword answer to that is Senator Ted Cruz 
When Bishops Direct Medical Care,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/09/opinion/when-bishops-direct-medical-care.html,Beyond new state efforts to restrict womens access to proper reproductive health care another if quieter threat is posed by mergers between secular hospitals and Catholic hospitals operating under religious directives from the nations Roman Catholic bishops These directives which oppose abortions inevitably collide with a hospitals duty to provide care to pregnant women in medical distress This tension lies at the heart of a federal lawsuit filed last week by the American Civil Liberties Union  The suit was brought on behalf of a Michigan woman Tamesha Means who says she was subjected to substandard care at a Catholic hospital  the only hospital in her county  after her water broke at 18 weeks of pregnancy Doctors in such circumstances typically induce labor or surgically remove the fetus to reduce the womans chances of infection But according to the complaint doctors acting in accordance with the bishops directives did not inform Ms Means that her fetus had virtually no chance of surviving or that terminating her pregnancy was the safest treatment option  Despite acute pain and bleeding Ms Means was sent home twice and when she returned a third time with a fever from her untreated infection she miscarried even as the paperwork was being prepared to discharge her again The fetus died soon after  The case has gained attention because Ms Means is not suing the hospital for medical negligence but the United States Conference of Catholic Bishops The ACLU is arguing on her behalf that having issued the mandates and made them conditions of hospital affiliation the conference is responsible for the unnecessary trauma and harm that Ms Means and other pregnant women in similar situations have experienced at Catholicsponsored hospitals How the suit will play out is unclear but it showcases an important issue Catholic hospitals account for about 15 percent of the nations hospital beds and in many communities are the only hospital facilities available Allowing religious doctrine to prevail over the need for competent emergency care and a womans right to complete and accurate information about her condition and treatment choices violates medical ethics and existing law  The problem Ms Means encountered is not unique or limited to her particular medical needs In 2010 the Diocese of Phoenix punished a nun and stripped a hospital of its affiliation after doctors there performed an abortion to save a mothers life In a statement last Friday the president of the bishops group Archbishop Joseph Kurtz said that the religious directives did not encourage or require substandard medical treatment He also portrayed the case as an attack on religious freedom  the same unpersuasive argument the bishops are making against the new federal health care laws requirement that all plans include contraception coverage The bishops are free to worship as they choose and advocate for their beliefs But those beliefs should not shield the bishops from legal accountability when churchaffiliated hospitals following their rules cause patients harm

years but that was long enough to whet his appetite for more But for more what precisely Mr Brown a noncandidate in perpetual campaign mode is not saying He is openly toying with some options like running for the Senate next year in New Hampshire He has also visited Iowa to test the presidential waters and may be positioning himself as a potential vicepresidential pick Not under consideration apparently is any office in his home state of Massachusetts where a Senate seat is also up next year I know theres a lot of curiosity and interest as to what my future plans are he told reporters waiting for him in Londonderry where he was the main attraction at a meetandgreet with local Republicans Nothings really changed since the last time weve seen each other which is more often than not  That is to say while he has made numerous visits recently to New Hampshire where he has long owned a vacation home he still has not decided whether to challenge Senator Jeanne Shaheen a Democrat who is seeking reelection Mr Brown who first expressed interest in the race in April said last week that he was in no hurry despite word that New Hampshire Republicans were growing impatient To emphasize how little pressure he felt he indicated he did not have to decide until June 13 when filing closes to run in the September primary What about his earlier hints of presidential aspirations In an August visit to the Iowa State Fair a checkpoint on the circuit for presidential hopefuls he told The Des Moines Register that he wanted to see whether theres an interest in my brand of leadership and Republicanism His talk of challenging Ms Shaheen here home of the firstinthenation presidential primary could be a fig leaf for higher ambitions Mr Brown backpedaled on that last week while maintaining that his options were still wide open I dont think I ever said I was thinking about running for president he said but I dont think anythings off the table at this point It is this random approach to officeseeking that suggests to some Democrats that Mr Brown is more interested in keeping up his public profile than in gearing up for an intense campaign against Ms Shaheen a popular former threeterm governor Scott Brown has always been in love with himself and this is just a vanity tour said Matt Canter deputy executive director of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee But that has not stopped strategists on both sides from speculating how such a race might go Republicans here are obviously pleased to have a celebrity like Mr Brown at their disposal Although he lost his Senate seat last year to Elizabeth Warren by 8 percentage points he maintained high favorability ratings and he was among his partys top fundraisers nationwide The state party has booked him as its featured guest for its holiday reception Dec 19 and smaller groups are bringing him in to help raise money We dont mind living off his popularity right now said Gregory Carson chairman of the Londonderry Republican Committee who said he invited Mr Brown here to attract attention But if Mr Brown wants to take on Ms Shaheen he must first win the primary which is usually dominated by conservative voters Two other Republicans  former State Senator Jim Rubens and Karen Testerman a conservative activist  are already in the race and a third the former United States senator Bob Smith is set to join At the gathering here State Representative Daniel Tamburello said he liked Mr Brown personally but hesitated when asked whether he would support him Im a pretty strong prolife guy and thats usually a sticking point for me in the primaries Mr Tamburello said When campaigning in Massachusetts Mr Brown said he favored abortion rights although activists disputed the claim saying his was not a reliable vote Nonetheless the perception here is that he supports abortion rights Others said a bigger problem here would be his support for the federal ban on assault weapons which he declared last year after the shootings at a school in Newtown Conn Certainly in New Hampshire Second Amendment issues are a really big deal said Mr Carson the chairman Hed have to really address what his reasoning was for that State Senator Sharon Carson a Republican who represents Londonderry and is married to Mr Carson said that even before voters considered the gun question they would have to consider the matter of carpetbagging The biggest obstacle that he would face is people would see him as someone coming from outside the state of New Hampshire she said Moments later Mr Brown unwittingly highlighted the problem While speaking outside to reporters and brushing off the suggestion that party leaders wanted guidance from him about his plans he said What Ive heard from the Republicans up here is theyre thankful that Ive been around for a year helping them raise money helping them raise awareness as to the issues that are affecting not only people here in Massachuss  in New Hampshire  but also in Massachusetts and throughout New England A video of the slipup recorded by a tracker from American Bridge a liberal group that birddogs Republican candidates instantly sailed around the Web It received such saturation coverage that a backlash even if tongueincheek soon developed with Vanity Fair defending Mr Brown and challenging the reader You try telling the difference between Massachusetts and New Hampshire In any case Mr Brown tried to focus on Ms Shaheen and linked her to what he said were fundamental problems with President Obamas health care plan Whats really at issue is that she really needs to start explaining to people why she was the deciding vote to pass Obamacare he said reviving the issue that helped propel him to the United States Senate in 2010  Up until it blew up she was still one of the No 1 supporters he said adding darkly So there are going to be consequences not only for her but for everybody Billy Shaheen the senators husband and one of the states most prominent Democratic operatives said it was hard to say right now how much his wifes support for Mr Obamas health care plan might be hurting her But residents are angry She said she makes no apologies for trying to help people get affordable health insurance he said And she has called for the White House to extend the enrollment period saying citizens should not be penalized for the governments botched signup process Mr Shaheen also noted that Mr Brown might face questions about health care himself As a state senator in 2006 he supported Gov Mitt Romneys health care overhaul in Massachusetts which was the model for the Obama plan Mr Brown later argued that the two plans were very different but enough similarities exist that New Hampshires conservative voters could question whether he shares their values Mr Browns heavy donations last year from the financial services industry could also come into play The New Hampshire Democratic Party began an online campaign Wednesday calling on Mr Brown to release the names of the clients he represents for Nixon Peabody the Bostonbased law firm he joined after losing his Senate seat But perhaps the Democrats strongest argument against Mr Brown will be what they say is his failure so far to demonstrate a serious commitment to the state You cant be cavalier about this Mr Shaheen said Youve got to earn your support here This is not a beauty contest
Republicans Running in Reverse,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/opinion/collins-republicans-running-in-reverse.html,Lets hear it for women in high places  This week in Detroit Mary Barra took over General Motors In Washington Senator Patty Murray made headlines when she worked out a deal with Representative Paul Ryan to keep the government funded for the next two years There was a time when passing a budget was regarded as the legislative equivalent of getting up and making your bed in the morning But now its more like climbing the Matterhorn in flipflops so kudos Patty Murray Next step is to see if Nancy Pelosi can figure out how to get longterm unemployment benefits extended  The glass ceiling is definitely cracking And no whimpering about how they only put us in control when the government is falling apart or your company underwent one of the biggest bankruptcies in American history We are looking on the bright side Meanwhile Republican congressmen are getting special tutoring on how to talk with women particularly on the campaign trail Some of our members just arent as sensitive as they ought to be the House speaker John Boehner told reporters last week OK that one is not necessarily all that heartening Remedial classes on how not to say things is not progress said former Republican Senator Olympia Snowe of Maine in a phone interview  They need better ideas not Mad Men style sensitivity training said Representative Nita Lowey of New York Lowey who serves as the top Democrat on the powerful House Appropriations Committee thinks that Republicans problem is antiwomen policies not their inability to talk with the opposite sex Believe it or not Paul Ryan is a good friend she said He calls me Mom I call him Naughty Boy I always enjoy talking to Nita Lowey but this conversation was a particular high point Republicans are well aware theyve got a gender gap problem There are consultants in Washington who do nothing but work on closing it Given their current level of success this looks like a rich field for future employment  if you have children in college perhaps you should suggest they look into a career in GOP womenwhispering  Obviously this goes way way deeper than social awkwardness or inept phraseology It cant be an accident that out of 98 women in the House and Senate only 23 are members of the Republican Party Or that only one of those Republican women has a committee chairmanship of a group that was assembled to take charge of housekeeping They talk about recruiting more women to run but those efforts tend to disintegrate said Snowe Ive seen it so often They all sort of fizzle out I dont think theres a genuine will Snowe recalled that when she was recruited in 1978 party leaders were so eager to get her on the team that they promised that if shed run theyd back her in a primary if one occurred And they didnt ask me my position on abortion  Maine has a long tradition of electing progressive Republican women to the Senate Before Snowe there was Margaret Chase Smith who spent much of the 1950s and 1960s as the only woman in her chamber She was the first senator from either party who dared to stand up to Joseph McCarthys virulent antiCommunist crusade But she had to stand in line with the tourists when she wanted to use a restroom in the Capitol Smith started out in the House where she served on the Naval Affairs Committee After long evenings of subcommittee work shed occasionally be taken out for a walk by a staff member  her male colleagues she said were exhausted from having a woman around all the time  When Patty Murray got the first real budget deal since 2010 she did it in part by patiently letting her opponents blather away until they toppled over with exhaustion In a truly just world volunteers would have offered to invite Ted Cruz for a stroll If Senator Smith could see the powerful women in Congress now shed probably be tickled But you wonder what she would think of her party  While American women have been winning rights and opportunities that were unimaginable only a few decades ago the one thing thats gone in the opposite direction is the Republican Party which is willing to train its members in how to talk to the ladies but not open its doors to candidates who believe in reproductive rights This is the party that used to be well ahead of the competition when it came to support for womens issues  from the Equal Rights Amendment to family planning  Oh my gosh Shed be appalled Snowe said of Smith Shed be appalled I dont think she could conceive of how its all evolved today Even in my own experience its hard to comprehend 
"Huge Fines for Violators of One-Child Policy, but Little Accounting",https://sinosphere.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/12/12/huge-fines-for-violators-of-one-child-policy-but-little-accounting/,"
                                     The disclosures come as China has said it will further ease its strict familyplanning regulations which government officials say have helped moderate its population growth and prevent as many as 400 million births
                                        But the policies have also led to widespread abuses including forced abortions and crippling fines that are sometimes levied arbitrarily Recent weeks have seen a pair of highprofile cases that show how the fines can affect people at various levels of society
                                         On Dec 1 the film director Zhang Yimou acknowledged having
                                        two sons and a daughter with his current wife the actress Chen Ting He now faces the possibility of millions of dollars in fines On Dec 4 Ai Guangdong a farmer in Hebei Province killed himself after local officials confiscated more than three tons of corn the Southern Metropolis Daily reported Mr Ai and his wife had five children and had
                                        been subject to years of onerous fines the newspaper said Chinese provinces have begun disclosing the amounts they received last year in fines after a lawyer opposed to Chinas family planning policies formally requested the tallies in July The 24 provinces regions and provinciallevel cities that have reported so far say they took in 20 billion renminbi or about 329 billion last year Another seven provinces have yet to respond The fines usually are a multiple of the average annual disposable income in a given region ranging from three to six times for a second child to as much as 15 times for a fourth In some jurisdictions such as Jiangsu
                                        Province where Mr Zhang lives wealthy families can be assessed fines linked to their own incomes Critics of Chinas family planning system say that the recent disclosures still fall short because they reveal little about where the money goes No department was able to shed any light on how the money was spent said Wu Youshui the lawyer in Zhejiang Province who first requested the figures Its like putting a bowl of rice
                                        into a big pot No one knows where each grain has gone The stated purpose of the revenue raised through family planning fines is to enhance childrens welfare The term shehui fuyangfei  means social support payment
                                        It had originally been called excess birth fine and then unplanned birth fee but social support payment which was adopted in 2000 was meant to convey the idea that
                                        the money would help cover the costs of extra children to society But critics say much of the money is diverted to other uses It is added to government coffers and then distributed to other government bodies which obscures its origin Some of the funds go to supporting the infrastructure that enforces the onechild policy said Yi Fuxian a University of Wisconsin scientist Local family planning committees never use the money for children
                                        he said They use this money as bonuses or to upgrade office equipment or even for foreign travel Not even the central government knows what the money is used for The total amount collected is probably much higher than has been reported said He Yafu an independent researcher in Guangdong Province who studies family planning policy Much of the fee collection is casual with
                                        no receipts or tallies registered he said That appeared to be the case with Mr Ai the farmer who killed himself This informality encourages corruption argues Mr He and the reliance of family planning officials on fines for bonuses also leads to abuse There is a widely known practice called build the pond and farm the fishÂ  he said Officials will encourage pregnancy so they have someone to fine later as long as the

                                        growth Mr Yi said The critics say that making public the amount collected in fines is an important first step but that the fines must eventually be scrapped When a thief robs you and walks away with your money you go and ask for the money back Mr He said You dont just demand that the robber tell you what he spent the money on Mia Li contributed research

Claims Drop Under State-Run Womenâ€™s Health Program in Texas,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/13/us/claims-drop-under-state-run-womens-health-program.html,To stop Planned Parenthood clinics from receiving public financing Texas Republican leaders gambled that the state could operate a contraception and cancerscreening program for lowincome women without tens of millions of federal dollars But with the exclusion of about 40 Planned Parenthood clinics  none of which performed abortions  from the Texas Womens Health Program in 2013 records showed that claims for birth control and wellness exams dropped as did enrollment numbers  State health officials reintroduced the Medicaid Womens Health Program as the Texas Womens Health Program in January after the federal government discontinued its 9to1 match for the program  a decision the Obama administration made when state lawmakers began enforcing rules they said made clinics even loosely affiliated with abortion providers ineligible to receive taxpayer dollars By law none of the providers in the program performed abortions  The new statefinanced program got off to a rocky start In some parts of Texas the states health agency struggled to find providers to replace Planned Parenthood clinics which provided 40 percent of Womens Health Program services in 2012 There can still be some pockets where we dont have a provider and we did before said Dr Kyle Janek the Texas health commissioner Planned Parenthood may have been the only game in that area During the first six months of this year there were 38 percent fewer reimbursement claims for birth control than there were during the first six months of 2012 according to a Texas Tribune analysis of data provided by the Texas Health and Human Services Commission The number of wellness exams meanwhile decreased by 23 percent Program enrollment figures have also declined to 110900 in May from 127000 in January 2012 Figures from May were the most recent available Cecile Richards the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America called the figures troubling  Despite all the promises from state officials that womens health care needs would be met she said its clear they arent But Dr Janek argued that the claims numbers were misleading He said birth control distributed by the program has not declined as much as initial claims data suggested because the majority of providers that replaced Planned Parenthood clinics were physician groups that directed patients to pharmacies to fill prescriptions rather than distributing the drugs themselves as family planning clinics do The programs pharmacy data for 2013 is not complete and the state could not provide information on how many birth control prescriptions were filled We think when you add all those up for birth control both those delivered at the pharmacy and those given by the providers office weve got an increase not a decrease Dr Janek said  The Womens Health Program claims for longacting reversible birth control methods like intrauterine devices and hormonal implants which must be inserted by the provider declined by 17 percent in the same time period Dr Janek said that was the result of the state not paying providers enough to cover the procedure something health officials have rectified by raising reimbursement rates for copper IUDs by 200 and hormonal implants by 75 Weve changed that so I expect the second six months and thereafter will tell a different story he said  Dr Janek said that while he was happy with the staterun programs progress he would not be satisfied until we do better The state is conducting targeted outreach to encourage more women to enroll health officials said that when they sent mailers in October and November to women whose families were registered for other state programs enrollment promptly increased by more than 9000 women While Republican state leaders work to improve capacity in the staterun program many family planning clinics have struggled Seventysix family planning clinics closed after the 2011 legislative session when Republican lawmakers with Planned Parenthood in their cross hairs cut twothirds of the states family planning budget set up a tiered system to shift remaining dollars away from reproductive health clinics and ousted Planned Parenthood and other clinics from the Womens Health Program Haven Health Clinic in Amarillo for example the only family planning clinic that serves the 26 counties in the Texas Panhandle saw a 20 percent decrease in Womens Health Program patients from 2012 to 2013  Were struggling now but wed be out of business if the program closed completely which would be devastating for this part of the state said Carolina Cogdill Havens chief executive Republican lawmakers attempted to mitigate the damage they had done to Texas family planning infrastructure in the 2013 legislative session by passing the largest financial package for womens health in state history Texas 201415 budget includes 71 million to operate the Texas Womens Health Program 100 million to expand a primary care program to serve an additional 170000 women and 43 million to replace family planning grants the federal government used to award to the state health agency  but has now given to another organization  But womens health advocates remain concerned that the damage wrought in 2011 cannot easily be undone  The Texas Womens Health Program has great potential but it has not taken off in private practice yet said Dr Janet Realini the chairwoman of the Texas Womens Healthcare Coalition which represents 39 medical trade associations and advocacy groups The providers who were doing most of that work have been either excluded or damaged by the cuts Parkland Health and Hospital System in the Dallas area received 212 calls in January from former Planned Parenthood patients looking for a new Womens Health Program provider said Paula Turicchi Parklands senior vice president for women and infants specialty health In 2013 Parkland clinics have served 9180 patients in the program compared with 8655 in 2012  We definitely saw a greater impact around those locations where Planned Parenthood had been a provider Ms Turicchi said In response to the 2011 budget cuts Parkland instituted a 25 copayment for lowincome family planning patients Ms Turicchi said that 42 of 420 patients who canceled appointments in February 2012 because they could not afford the copayment later returned pregnant Parkland recently received 48 million through the states expanded primary health care program to increase services for poor women in 2014

"On Election Day, Latin America Willingly Trades Machismo for Female Clout",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/world/americas/on-election-day-latin-america-willingly-trades-machismo-for-female-clout.html,SANTIAGO Chile  When Chileans vote Sunday for their next leader they will choose between a former president seeking to expand access to higher education broadly and a staunch conservative opposing tax increases aimed at reducing Chiles high levels of inequality The fact that both candidates  Michelle Bachelet a former president who narrowly missed a firstround victory in November and Evelyn Matthei her rightwing opponent  are women reveals an area where Latin America is surging the empowerment of female leaders in politics Eight of the estimated 29 women in the world who have been elected as presidents of their countries since the 1970s have done so in Latin America and the Caribbean long considered a bastion of machismo with half of them ascending since 2006 Up and down the Americas with the notable exception of the United States women are soaring into the highest political realms In Brazil Latin Americas largest country Dilma Rousseff a former energy minister who was elected in 2010 is preparing to run for a new term as president in 2014 In neighboring Argentina Cristina Fernndez de Kirchner is in her second term as president and in Central America Laura Chinchilla is wrapping up her term as Costa Ricas first female president In the Caribbean Portia SimpsonMiller is the prime minister of Jamaica the Caribbeans largest Englishspeaking island and Kamla PersadBissessar is the prime minister of Trinidad and Tobago the Caribbeans biggest exporter of oil and natural gas The gains for women in politics in various countries have been remarkable reflecting a broad shift in thinking said Marta Lagos the director of a Chilean polling firm that works throughout Latin America She said that about 80 percent of people in the region now thought that women should participate in politics up from about 30 percent in the early 1990s Still Ms Lagos said ingrained sexism persists across Latin America reflected in income gaps between men and women and in the executive suites of corporations still largely dominated by men Theres a lot of hypocrisy she said Men are generally fine with women in positions of political power as long as they retain economic power The income gap between men and women in Chile has actually widened with men earning on average about 1172 a month and women about 811 according to an employment survey this year by the University of Chile No nation in Latin America has achieved gender parity in government and scholars say the advances by women could be easily reversed Overall representation in parliaments remains low even in countries like Brazil where Ms Rousseff has named women to an array of cabinet posts and supported the appointment of a woman to head Petrobras the national oil company Yet while the results remain uneven the Americas already have the secondhighest regional average of women in lower houses of congress in the world at about 24 percent lagging behind only Scandinavia and other Nordic countries in Europe at about 42 percent said Joan Caivano director of special projects at the InterAmerican Dialogue a Washington policy group Such advances are partly the result of quotas Argentina pioneered such measures in the early 1990s with a law establishing that 30 percent of legislative candidates must be women more than a dozen countries now have similar laws In Bolivia Costa Rica and Ecuador every other candidate on a political party election list must be female These measures contrast with the relatively short history of female participation in politics in some parts of Latin America In El Salvador for instance women were not allowed to run for elective office until 1961 the same year that Paraguay changed its Constitution to give women the right to vote Mara Estela de Pern the widow of Gen Juan D Pern the populist leader of Argentina became the hemispheres first female head of state in 1974 upon the death of her husband Known as Isabel she governed Argentina until she was ousted in a 1976 military coup She is living in exile in Spain where Argentine authorities have unsuccessfully tried to extradite her in connection with human rights violations In a break from the pattern established by Mrs Pern in which Latin Americas female heads of state were the wives or widows of male presidents or opposition leaders the path to power has grown more varied highlighted by the election in 2006 of Ms Bachelet a pediatrician and single mother of three who served in important cabinet posts including defense minister before her first presidential run Latin America is really ahead of the pack said Farida Jalalzai a scholar on gender politics at the University of MissouriSt Louis This is interesting because it had seemed to stall by the early 2000s but no more Once in power Ms Bachelet named a cabinet of 10 women and 10 men But faced with street protests early in her term she shook up her cabinet replacing some of the female ministers with men She also increased access to child care for poor families and helped create pensions for housewives and legalize alimony payments to divorced women Chile one of Latin Americas most socially conservative countries legalized divorce only in 2004 But while she advanced some policies aimed at improving womens lives and finished her first term in 2010 with high approval ratings her race this year against Ms Matthei has shown that the presence of female candidates does not guarantee an embrace of feminist issues Ms Matthei for instance has supported exceptions to Chiles total ban on abortion contending that the procedure is needed when a womans life is in danger but she said she would not push such a change if elected after facing resistance within her own party And while Ms Bachelet supports legalizing abortion in cases of medical emergency or rape she has also had to grapple with elements in her coalition who oppose loosening Chiles abortion laws Some in Chile point to the heavy influence of the Roman Catholic Church which opposes abortion but played an important role in fighting rights abuses during Augusto Pinochets dictatorship There is a certain irony that this election pits two women from very different party backgrounds said Ms Caivano of the InterAmerican Dialogue Yet each has been constrained by their respective partys orthodoxy on the abortion question
The Catholics Still in Exile,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/15/opinion/sunday/bruni-the-catholics-still-in-exile.html,HONEYMOON isnt a word usually associated with pontiffs but Pope Francis is having an extraordinary one Last week Time magazine named him its person of the year saying that he had given fresh hope to many Catholics estranged by the churchs censorious ways The magazine noted the absence of harsh condemnation in his mentions of divorced couples of women seeking abortions and of gay people including his statement that if a homosexual person is of good will and is in search of God I am no one to judge From all of this Time concluded that he had lifted the church above the doctrinal police work so important to his recent predecessors Well they didnt get the memo in the suburbs of Philadelphia where a teacher of French and Spanish was fired from a Catholic high school earlier this month because hed let the school know that he intended to take advantage of New Jerseys legalization of samesex marriage and tie the knot there According to news reports it wasnt any secret that the teacher was gay he and his partner wore rings and attended faculty parties together But honoring that union Pledging the kind of commitment that is or should be more consistent with the churchs values than keeping it in the shadows His Catholic supervisors sending the message that the shadows were just fine terminated his 12year employment The memo also didnt make it to Little Rock Ark where Tippi McCullough 50 got the ax after 14 years as an English teacher at a high school affiliated with the Sisters of Mercy This was in October Her crime too was to take a relationship that Catholic coworkers apparently knew about and formalize it She told me last week that she and her longtime partner had even been overnight guests on the school principals houseboat But when school officials learned that the couple had just been legally married in one of the New Mexico counties where thats now possible they told her they had to let her go though she hadnt announced the wedding or given any signal that she was going to be more public about her partnership than before Her dismissal upset some school employees one of whom apparently gave The Arkansas Times remarks that another Francis  Msgr Francis I Malone a local priest  made in a faculty meeting afterward The devil is real he reportedly said He goes after people like you and institutions like this one Dont give in to him Malone added Rise up above this like the good and decent people God has made you to be In a subsequent exchange with the newspaper Malone didnt deny those remarks but said that they werent meant to characterize McCullough or her situation McCullough said that she was struggling to reconcile the stated mission of the Sisters of Mercy with how she was treated Our whole school is founded on the mercy values she told me Things like the recognition of the intrinsic worth and dignity of each person and respect for varied religious traditions and beliefs But that recognition isnt applied equally to everyone she added Thats the hardest thing for me And I loved teaching there Pope Francis has indeed been a revelation his gentle tone and sustained humility more in touch with the heart of Catholicism than the bitter jeremiads of other Catholic leaders were But its important to note that he hasnt pledged to revisit doctrine nor are such revisions likely to happen anytime soon The world turns at a breathless clip the church at a glacial one Its equally important to note that beyond Rome the very focus on sexual morality that the pope seems to be waving Catholics away from can still be keen and uncompromising Examples are made where they neednt be punishment is meted out when it doesnt have to be And its this as much as anything uttered in Vatican City that continues to drive a wedge between openminded Catholics and the churchs hierarchy The churchs treatment of gays and lesbians is especially rife with mixed messages and hypocrisy In schools and congregations many priests nuns and other Catholics state or quietly signal that they see nothing sinful in the loving relationships of gay couples only to have more hidebound Catholics swoop in to sweep such couples away For a gay person who doesnt want to be exiled secrecy is smarter than honesty which is supposedly a virtue I DONT understand said Nick Johns whose Catholic church outside Atlanta asked him to resign from his job as an organist last May as it became better known that he had a male fianc They make it clear that they dont think being gay is wrong but they think gay people should be celibate he said accurately describing Catholic doctrine And now that Ive found the love of my life I cant imagine God wanting me to suppress that If God made us and he gives us the gift of love and he gave me that gift and if he made me this way why wouldnt he want this Johns 28 was reared in a devout Catholic family and studied the organ with the goal of playing in church Last January he said the priest in charge of the congregation that employed him advised him to make his Facebook posts which included mentions of his fianc private and he did so He said his best friend was gay and he realized it wasnt a choice Johns told me He was really very understanding But that priest moved on in April a temporary successor citing the Facebook posts informed Johns that he should resign or hed be fired Johns said The Human Rights Campaign an advocacy group has identified nine cases like his in the United States this year but the groups president Chad Griffin stresses that these are just the ones that have come to public light McCullough observed that many employees of Catholic schools run afoul of Catholic doctrine  and of the morals clause they routinely sign  but arent reprimanded or removed Maybe theyre divorced Maybe they use artificial birth control The church turns a blind eye as it frequently does with gay employees  until all of a sudden it doesnt That erratic cruel rhythm is partly responsible for the breach that Francis has only begun to heal McCullough recently took a new job with Little Rock Central High School which she proudly noted was an important theater in the struggle for civil rights Still she feels a profound loss and is drifting away from a church she loved I asked her if shed known how the school would react would she have married anyway Yes she said A thousand times yes Shes finished with onehalf openness or threequarters openness or whatever calculation shed made As I told the principal Im 50 years old she said Im tired of this Ive tried to play this game my whole life I dont want to do it anymore
Senate Prepares to Wrap Up Sluggish 2013 ,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/us/politics/congress-prepares-to-leave-behind-a-sluggish-2013.html,WASHINGTON  The Senates final week in session this year promises to be memorable not for legislative business like the pending budget and defense bills but for something far less inspired the vast amount of time it spends doing nothing in particular As is typical on Mondays senators will have their first vote at 530 pm From there the rest of the week during which the Senate will take up the pending bills and a group of presidential nominations seems certain to be bogged down with the kind of hurryupandwait limbo that has consumed most working weeks in the Senate this year Its been a year of great accomplishments and achievements said Senator John McCain Republican of Arizona who wore a mischievous grin his voice thick with sarcasm When Im down at the old soldiers home and Im sitting in my rocking chair Ill say Boy 2013 was a banner yearÂ  The pace of work sluggish already because of rigid old rules that require daylong waiting periods before votes has slowed even more lately because of partisan gridlock as was the case last week when Republicans held up a slate of President Obamas nominees to retaliate after Democrats took away the ability to block most confirmations through a filibuster But the lack of movement in the Senate is only half the story of a Congress that has reached record levels of inactivity Lawmakers simply are not spending as much time in Washington for many reasons including a distaste for the contentious atmosphere that a deeply divided government has created and the demands of a fundraising schedule And the numbers prove it According to data analyzed by The New York Times the House of Representatives which ended its business for the year last week left town with the distinction of having been at work for the fewest hours in a nonelection year since 2005 when detailed information about legislative activity became available Not counting brief pro forma sessions the House was in session for 942 hours an average of about 28 hours each week it conducted business in Washington That is far lower than the nearly 1700 hours it was in session in 2007 the 1350 hours in 2005 or even the 1200 in 2011 By a similar measure the Senate was near its recorded lows for days on the floor Senators have spent 99 days casting votes this year close to the recent low point for a nonelection year in 1991 when there were 95 voting days This level of inaction has meant that many pressing questions of domestic and foreign policy remain at loose ends Despite public furor over spying programs by the National Security Agency and mass killings like the one in Newtown Conn last year legislation meant to address these issues has stalled  Though there is wide recognition among members of both parties that the nations immigration laws need to be updated to address the 11 million people here without documentation immigration overhaul failed to get any further than the Senate There was no agreement on a farm bill that would provide agricultural subsidies as well as food stamps for poor families The deep financial problems at the United States Postal Service went unaddressed by major legislation And the cumbersome unpopular tax code was untouched as were federal benefit programs like Medicare whose costs are soaring Senator Max Baucus the Montana Democrat who as chairman of the Finance Committee has been pursuing a deal on tax overhaul summed up his low expectations on reaching compromise on any major legislation My view is you get what you can get and you keep going forward You do what you can do As a benchmark for congressional productivity scholars do not look only at the volume of bills passed which ignores important nuances like the complexity of the issues addressed by Congress It also overlooks the question of whether making more laws is beneficial  Sarah Binder a senior fellow at the Brookings Institution has come up with a way of calculating how effective Congresses have been by looking at what laws were passed relative to the salient national issues at the time The numbers are not flattering to anyone on Capitol Hill Her most recent data through the 112th Congress which met from January 2011 to January 2013 showed that 72 percent of the issues at the national forefront met a legislative stalemate and went unresolved That tied the record for the most gridlocked Congress since 1947 the 106th which included the impeachment of President Bill Clinton Its fairly easy to trace polarization to partisan gridlock Ms Binder said And we are as people say as polarized as weve ever been These data do not point to a complete lack of activity in Congress The Republicancontrolled House in fact has been a hive of legislative action But the bills it has passed have often been used to score points with the partys base a practice criticized by Democrats as governing by press release  Among them have been measures to restrict abortion roll back government oversight powers and dismantle Mr Obamas health care law The House has passed variations of bills meant to defang the health care law nearly four dozen times before they forced a government shutdown over the issue in October This was a huge waste of time this Congress Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California said on Thursday night There are few signs that the atmosphere will improve The only hope seems to be that partisan acrimony and gridlock have gotten so bad that they might have finally bottomed out Members of both parties said they saw some hope in the bipartisan budget deal that passed the House overwhelmingly a rare compromise that they say Congress needs more of We owe the American people more than weve been giving said Representative Tom Cole Republican of Oklahoma 
Chilean Voters Return a Former President to Power ,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/16/world/americas/bachelet-wins-chilean-presidency-in-landslide.html,SANTIAGO Chile  Chilean voters handed a landslide victory to Michelle Bachelet on Sunday returning her to the presidency amid continuing unease over high levels of inequality in Chile despite an enviable stretch of rapid economic growth Ms Bachelet received about 62 percent of the vote compared with 38 percent for her opponent Evelyn Matthei according to preliminary results from the Chilean electoral service Ms Matthei conceded defeat Ms Bachelet who was widely admired as president from 2006 to 2010 when her policies helped shield Chile from a sharp downturn during the global financial crisis has put forth an ambitious package of proposals that would among other things increase corporate taxes expand access to higher education and overhaul the 1980 Constitution which dates to the dictatorship of Gen Augusto Pinochet Her platform contrasted sharply with the antitax views of Ms Matthei a former labor minister who belongs to the most conservative wing of the governing coalition of President Sebastin Piera a rightwing billionaire Ghosts of the Pinochet era hung over this years race unlike Mr Piera himself Ms Matthei voted in favor of General Pinochet in the 1988 plebiscite that opened the way for democracy to be reestablished in Chile After Ms Bachelet narrowly missed earning an outright victory in a first election round in November some voters predicted a shakeup to the political establishment in Chile one of Latin Americas most socially conservative countries It stands out in the region for maintaining a total ban on abortion and resisting efforts to legalize samesex marriage as the authorities have done in Brazil Argentina and Uruguay What Im most interested in is to have a constituent assembly to change the Constitution and political integrity ethics in politics said Pablo Gonzlez 34 a psychologist If Ms Bachelet a 62yearold pediatrician is able to advance her proposals Chile one of the regions first countries to aggressively expose its economy to market forces in the 1970s and 1980s may once again be seen as a laboratory for policy experimentation in Latin America There are concerns that the countrys enormous progress in recent decades will be undone said Michael Shifter president of the InterAmerican Dialogue a Washington policy group But it is far more likely that Chile will remain pretty much on its present course with continued growth joined with more serious efforts at improving health and education and pursuing greater social justice For now at least commodities exports are delivering robust economic growth The economy while slowing somewhat from last year is forecast to expand more than 4 percent in 2013 But many Chileans complain that most of the riches from the boom are still controlled by a relatively small elite Chile has the highest level of income inequality among the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Developments 34 member countries That explains at least in part why Mr Pieras approval ratings remain lower than 40 percent and Ms Mattheis pledges to continue with many of his policies have failed to resonate with voters Disappointment with Mr Pieras administration Chiles first rightwing government since the countrys transition to democracy in the 1990s led to waves of student protests and the recent election of some leaders of social movements to Congress Ms Bachelet has promised to draft legislation within her first 100 days in office aiming to increase tax revenues by about 3 percent of gross domestic product Ms Matthei 60 and other conservative leaders contend that such a move could scare off investment but such warnings have been mocked as insensitive to the needs of struggling voters
British Catholics' Quandary,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/opinion/malik-british-catholics-quandary.html,LONDON  They call it the Francis effect the impact of Pope Francis in galvanizing the Catholic faithful Since he arrived at the Vatican church attendance has surged across the world while in his homeland of Argentina the number of people defining themselves as believers has risen by a reported 12 percent  Not just Catholics but those of other faiths and of no faith have fallen under Francis spell Even atheists should be praying for Pope Francis as the Guardian columnist Jonathan Freedland put it recently  Yet how much has really changed Francis may be transforming the perception of the church and its mission but not its core doctrines He has called for a church more welcoming to gay people and women but he will not challenge the idea that homosexual acts are sinful refuses to embrace the possibility of samesex marriage and insists that the ordination of women as priests is not open to discussion  None of this should be surprising Religious institutions necessarily spurn the modern and the fashionable in favor of the traditional and the sacred But it points up the dilemma in which religion finds itself in the modern world If religious institutions do not change they risk becoming obsolete If they do change they may imperil their authority This quandary is faced not just by the Catholic Church but by all religious institutions today The Vatican recently sent out a questionnaire to gauge believers views on sex and family life It is an initiative that has been partly preempted in Britain at least by Linda Woodhead a professor in the sociology of religion at Lancaster University who has spent two years surveying the social attitudes of British believers including Catholics The results suggest that believers of all faiths are more liberal than expected They also suggest a chasm between the views of believers and the official teachings of most faiths  To put all this in context about half of Britons now claim to have no religion The Anglican Church represents a third while Catholics constitute about 9 percent or 56 million A 2007 survey found though that attendance of Mass by Catholics outstripped churchgoing by Anglicans  making Catholics Britains most observant Christian denomination  Professor Woodheads research found that 16 percent of Catholics want to ban abortions altogether but twothirds accept abortion of some kind Astonishingly one in 20 want a more liberal abortion law than currently exists in Britain Almost twothirds of British Catholics want British law to be changed to permit assisted suicide Less than half think samesex marriage is wrong more than a third think its right Only 9 percent even feel guilty about using contraception  In Britain Professor Woodhead noted that faithful Catholics according to official teaching are now a rare and endangered species Much the same is true of most other religions with the exception of Islam the British Muslims she surveyed stood out as significantly more socially conservative Pope Francis modernizing approach might seem the ideal means of bridging the gap between the church and its followers In fact it may prove as problematic for the church as the rigid traditionalism of his predecessor Benedict XVI Religious values are immensely flexible over time Christian beliefs on many issues from slavery to women have changed enormously in the past two millenniums Yet an institution like the Catholic Church can never be truly modern The authority of the church rests on its claim to be able to interpret Gods word Were the church to modify its teachings to meet the preferences of its flock then its authority would inevitably weaken But were it not to do so the chasm between official teaching and actual practice would continue to grow This is the difficulty in which the Anglican Church has found itself in recent years racked by controversies over modernization particularly in its attitudes toward homosexuality and the ordination of women It has come to be mocked both as an institution in which change is glacially slow and as one that has lost its bearings by ditching traditional values According to Professor Woodhead few British believers now look to religion as the primary source of moral guidance Most follow their own reason or intuition or the advice of family and friends fewer than one in 10 of believers seek guidance from God or a holy book None look to religious leaders The only faith that shows a substantially different pattern is again Islam  It is easy to see why conservatives and traditional believers would find these figures troubling Even for nonbelievers and social liberals however there may be cause for concern The more open attitudes to social mores and the greater willingness to think for oneself are welcome But the decay of religious authority points also to a more atomized society and a destruction of collective consensus about moral judgments Professor Woodheads surveys also reveal a generalized suspicion of strongly held beliefs of any kind This erosion of convictions has over the past three decades gnawed away at the political sphere leading to the decline of ideological politics and a growing distrust of traditional political parties Mainstream parties have ditched their old constituencies coming to see politics less as a matter of competing visions of the future than as a process of technocratic management That has created fertile ground for the rise of myriad populist movements often rooted in hostility to the Other The way party politics has jettisoned once cherished principles has been one reason for the greater salience of religious identities in recent years The vacuum left by ideology has been filled by religious affiliation The irony is that the new relativism may now also be undermining traditional religious institutions And perhaps with the same consequences    Kenan Malik is a writer lecturer and broadcaster and the author of From Fatwa to Jihad The Rushdie Affair and Its Aftermath  
"A Disability, and a Motherâ€™s Embrace",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/health/separating-a-son-from-a-down-syndrome-diagnosis-in-raising-henry.html,Rachel Adams is an Upper West Side intellectual who gave birth to a boy with Down syndrome six years ago In this era of advanced prenatal screening the first question more than one friend asked her was How could this have happened On the surface it seemed like an expression of concern But what it meant was How could this child have happened To Ms Adams the idea that her sons very existence requires an explanation  that he is here because of some failure of medical science  is appalling Her book is less a memoir about mothering a child with Down syndrome than it is her attempt to set people straight The syndrome is a disability as she makes clear not an illness and certainly not a tragedy Raising Henry is an important hopeful book for that reason alone and its easy to be on Ms Adamss team Sometimes though you wish she were a more effective captain A professor of English and American studies at Columbia she seems most at home making an argument drawing on research especially her own seeing connections She observes that in the brainy circles in which she moves everyone talks about diversity  but how much are differences really valued I wonder she writes whether my friends and colleagues would recognize the value of a child who was slower less capable and more dependent And while she makes many good points she leaves her most compelling evidence her casecloser largely out of the picture Henry himself She writes that her son is separate from his diagnosis but barely offers a sense of who he is One quick glimpse comes midway through the book when she writes that no genetic test would have told her about the essence of Henry I couldnt have known about his great sense of humor or the sound of his infectious laugh Or the smell of his hair The delight he gets from singing along with music or pouring bathwater from one cup to another His weight on my lap when were reading a book together Thats the stuff Too bad there is so little of it Comparisons with the vivid characters who populate the 2012 book Far From the Tree Andrew Solomons magnificent study of disability and identity differences are hard to avoid People like the autistic child who tells his mother I love you shortly before she dies or the woman who starts her own school to meet her deaf sons needs make Mr Solomons weighty volume implausibly a pageturner When Ms Adams was pregnant with Henry her second child she and her husband Jon decided to skip an amniocentesis which would have identified the extra chromosome that causes Down syndrome Shed had the test during her first pregnancy and was repelled and terrified by the long needle stuck into her abdomen anyway an early screening in the second pregnancy suggested that the odds for Down syndrome were just one in 2000 She doesnt say whether she would have had an abortion had she known or what her husband would have wanted to do A dispiriting subplot of the memoir is the authors growing disillusionment with doctors She comes to trust her own instinct above their advice  and no wonder given their abysmal bedside manner For instance the resident who sews her up after the delivery sprints out of the room faster than you can say perineum she realizes later that he must have known that Henry had Down syndrome but lacked the courage to break the news When Henry was 3 days old a pediatric geneticist used him as a teaching prop for a group of residents Pointing out a characteristic of Down syndrome he reached into the incubator to demonstrate the floppiness of Henrys limbs by lifting them and letting them drop Neither he nor the residents uttered a word to Ms Adams as they continued on their rounds Her obstetricians performance was hardly better Visiting Ms Adams after the birth she burst into tears  which although odd at least seemed sympathetic But soon the doctors attention shifted to herself I went back through all your records she said I wanted to make sure I didnt miss anything so I showed them to my colleagues and everyone agrees there was nothing At that moment Ms Adams says she hated her obstetrician Later she reconsidered reasoning that if the doctor had pushed her to have an amnio she might never have had Henry She even wrote the doctor a thankyou note But the feeling didnt last After talking to another mother of a child with Down syndrome who happened to be a patient of the same obstetrician Ms Adams realized that those tears were not out of worry for the challenges the new mother faced but rather out of regret that Henry had come into existence at all Ms Adams never saw that doctor again but with this book she gives her a welldeserved piece of her mind
Pope Replaces Conservative U.S. Cardinal on Influential Vatican Committee,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/17/world/europe/pope-replaces-conservative-us-cardinal-on-influential-vatican-committee.html,ROME  Pope Francis moved on Monday against a conservative American cardinal who has been an outspoken critic of abortion and samesex marriage by replacing him on a powerful Vatican committee with another American who is less identified with the culture wars within the Roman Catholic Church The popes decision to remove Cardinal Raymond L Burke from the Congregation for Bishops was taken by church experts to be a signal that Francis is willing to disrupt the Vatican establishment in order to be more inclusive Even so many saw the move less as an effort to change doctrine on specific social issues than an attempt to bring a stylistic and pastoral consistency to the churchs leadership He is saying that you dont need to be a conservative to become a bishop said Alberto Melloni the director of the John XXIII Foundation for Religious Studies in Bologna Italy a liberal Catholic research institute He wants good bishops regardless of how conservative or liberal they are Cardinal Burke who came to the Vatican in 2008 after serving as archbishop of St Louis is a favorite of many conservative Catholics in the United States for his upholding of church rites and traditions favored by Pope Benedict XVI Cardinal Burkes preference for the long train of billowing red silk known as cappa magna and other such vestments has however made him seem out of step with Francis who has made it clear through example that he prefers more humble attire Last week Cardinal Burke also seemed to create more substantive daylight between himself and the pope giving an interview in which he raised concerns about comments by Francis that the church should reduce the focus on abortion and samesex marriage One gets the impression or its interpreted this way in the media that he thinks were talking too much about abortion too much about the integrity of marriage as between one man and one woman Cardinal Burke said of the pope in an interview with EWTN a Catholic broadcaster But we can never talk enough about that Since his election as pope in March Francis has received glowing news media coverage and widespread adulation from the faithful for putting a kinder more inclusive face on a global institution that had been widely perceived as out of touch He has expressed an intention to reorganize and overhaul the Roman Curia the bureaucracy that governs the church Cardinal Burke still serves as the prefect of the Vaticans highest canonical court but analysts say his removal from the Congregation for Bishops will sharply reduce his influence especially over personnel changes in American churches The Congregation for Bishops is the most important congregation in the Vatican said the Rev Thomas J Reese a Jesuit priest and the author of Inside the Vatican The Politics and Organization of the Catholic Church It decides who are going to be the bishops all over the world he added This is what has the most direct impact on the life of the local church To replace Cardinal Burke Francis chose Cardinal Donald Wuerl of Washington an ideological moderate with a deep knowledge of the Vatican but also with pastoral experience Father Reese noted that Cardinal Burke had been a leader of American bishops arguing that Catholic politicians who support abortion rights should be barred from receiving communion while Cardinal Wuerl had taken an opposite tack That certainly is in line with the pope who has said that communion is not a reward for being good Father Reese said It is a sacrament of healing to help people The pope also removed Cardinal Justin Rigali the former archbishop of Philadelphia from the Congregation for Bishops From his committee post Cardinal Rigali has long been a crucial player in shaping the American hierarchy He stepped down as archbishop of Philadelphia amid a scandal over his handling of priest abuse cases there And Francis reconfirmed the congregational posting for Cardinal William J Levada a former prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith Like Cardinal Wuerl Cardinal Levada is considered a moderate Some recent appointments have disheartened liberals within the church particularly the popes choice in October to approve the Rev Leonard Blair as the archbishop of Hartford He was central in a doctrinal investigation that reprimanded a group of American nuns who were deemed to have drifted from church teaching Many church observers saw the hand of Cardinal Burke in that selection as they did in the appointment of Salvatore J Cordileone an outspoken opponent of samesex marriage as archbishop of San Francisco In an interview in Washington last week Cardinal Wuerl suggested that the pope was altering the way the bishops congregation functioned For example Francis is already surveying a broader range of bishops than those in the congregation the cardinal said When it comes to future bishops he is asking a number of sources he said Asked whether all of the popes changes mattered if Cardinal Burke still had such influence in appointing bishops Cardinal Wuerl smiled Dont we have to give this pope time he said
"After Ruling Critical of N.S.A., Uncertain Terrain for Appeal",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/18/us/politics/after-ruling-critical-of-nsa-uncertain-terrain-for-appeal.html,WASHINGTON  As Judge Richard J Leon heard arguments last month in a challenge to a National Security Agency program he said only one thing was certain Im not sure how Im going to come out he said but I know its going upstairs He meant that appeals were inevitable first to a federal appeals court in Washington and then to the Supreme Court  On Monday Judge Leon ruled that the program which collects records of all Americans phone calls is probably unconstitutional He stayed his order to allow for that anticipated trip upstairs The appeal will face ideological crosscurrents Supreme Court opinions pointing in opposite directions and unpredictable judicial voting But it seems reasonably likely that the case or a related one will for the first time result in a definitive legal ruling on the constitutionality of one of the postSept 11 government surveillance programs Similar cases including one brought by the American Civil Liberties Union in New York are pending Unlike in earlier cases challenging warrantless wiretapping programs it is likely that judges will no longer decline to hear the new ones based on the objection that the plaintiffs cannot demonstrate that information about them has been collected  Judge Leon was dismissive of the governments halfhearted argument on this point saying it defies common sense The main initial critique of Judge Leons decision was that it blew past the closest Supreme Court precedent and tried to anticipate where the justices might be heading based on concurring rather than controlling opinions in a 2012 decision  The next stop for the case is the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit which thanks to the recent overhaul of the Senates filibuster rule has a majority of Democratic appointees among its active judges But it may be that nothing turns on that Writing recently in Judicature magazine Judge Douglas H Ginsburg who was appointed to the District of Columbia Circuit by President Ronald Reagan noted with satisfaction that a recent empirical study had absolved his court of the charge so often leveled in the vacuous but vociferous political debates over the confirmation of a new judge that the court is a political partisan His own 2010 opinion in United States v Maynard writing for a unanimous threejudge panel with two judges appointed by a Republican president tends to illustrate his point The decision which will be helpful to the challengers to the data collection program was curiously mentioned only in passing by Judge Leon Judge Ginsburg said the collection of huge troves of data over long stretches of time producing a mosaic of information could cross a constitutional line A person who knows all of anothers travels Judge Ginsburg wrote can deduce whether he is a weekly churchgoer a heavy drinker a regular at the gym an unfaithful husband an outpatient receiving medical treatment an associate of particular individuals or political groups  and not just one fact about a person but all such facts Alexander A Abdo an ACLU lawyer echoed that reasoning at the Nov 22 argument in the New York case four days after arguments in the case heard by Judge Leon The telephone records collected by the security agency reveal Mr Abdo said who you call and when whether you call your doctor the domestic violence hotline an abortion provider an exgirlfriend a suicide hotline or a pastor he said And it reveals not just one of those details about every American but every one of those details The District of Columbia Circuits decision Mr Abdo said could serve as a model for this court In 1979 in Smith v Maryland the Supreme Court said a robbery suspect could not expect that his right to privacy extended to the numbers dialed from his phone The government says the Fourth Amendment analysis in the new cases should begin and end with that decision  The governments position is that Fourth Amendment challenge is foreclosed by Smith v Maryland which held that there is no reasonable expectation of privacy in the noncontent information thats held by third parties Stuart F Delery a Justice Department lawyer said at the argument of the ACLU case The 2012 decision United States v Jones an appeal from the Maynard decision unanimously rejected the use of a GPS device to track the movements of a drug suspect over a month The majority in the 2012 case said that attaching the device violated the defendants property rights  In a pair of concurrences though five justices said the tracking raised concerns about the defendants expectation of privacy It may be necessary Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote citing the Smith case to reconsider the premise that an individual has no reasonable expectation of privacy in information voluntarily disclosed to third parties  But it is one thing for justices even five of them to indicate that a precedent had been undermined It is another for a lowercourt judge to make use of such musings Indeed the Supreme Court has cautioned against it If a precedent of this court has direct application in a case yet appears to rest on reasons rejected in some other line of decisions Justice Anthony M Kennedy wrote for the court in 1989 lowercourt judges should follow the case which directly controls leaving to this court the prerogative of overruling its own decisions Last month a federal judge in California took that approach in refusing to grant a new trial to a defendant convicted of terrorism charges based on asserted Fourth Amendment violations arising from the NSA program Judge Jeffrey T Miller said he would not blaze a new path and adopt the approach to the concept of privacy set forth by Justice Sotomayor in her concurrence in United States v Jones There will almost certainly be more decisions on the constitutionality of the program in the ACLU case and in one brought by the Electronic Frontier Foundation They all present essentially the same issues and it is hard to predict which will strike the justices as the most attractive vehicle for a decision If nothing else Judge Leons decision was a powerful critique of the secret court that supervises the program He noted that 15 judges of the court the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court have issued 35 orders authorizing it even as the government repeatedly made misrepresentations and inaccurate statements about the program Barry Friedman a law professor at New York University who is at work on a book on the Fourth Amendment said that only Judge Leons work was worthy of a federal judge Judge Leons reads as though there is a living breathing thinking person behind it he said Right or wrong ultimately it is full of detail realworld fact and serious consideration The FISA court opinions are lifeless They read like a machine wrote them

                                        risky sex drug and alcohol use family breakdown etc And yet Caplan says almost no social conservative bothers to make [economic] arguments Why dont they Here are a few of many possible answers The first is that social conservatives actually do make such arguments even if the phrase negative externalities isnt deployed with quite
                                        the frequency Caplan would like Look at any prominent document on changing family structures for instance from The Moynihan Report down through Barbara Dafoe Whiteheads famous Dan Quayle Was Right                                        to the marriage gap arguments of today and youll find an intense focus on the socioeconomic costs of the trends the writers are describing andor deploringÂ Indeed the entire corpus
                                        of sociallyconservative intellectual efforts from 1970sera neoconservatives like Richard John Neuhaus and James Q Wilson down to the present era is shot through with arguments that are if not purely economic
                                        at least heavily informed by economic questions Right now whether youre reading Jonathan Last on demography or Kay Hymowitz on young manhood                                        or Brad Wilcox on marriage and middle America or Mark Regnerus on the market for premarital sex
                                        the case for social conservatism is reliably  perhaps even too reliably I fear in some of my own workÂ Â framed in the language of costs and benefits mobility and opportunity
                                        education and income and life outcomes And likewise on issues that fall within the sociallyconservative penumbra like immigration crime and drugs But note that very few of the writers and intellectuals Ive just mentioned are practicing economists Theyre political scientists sociologists journalists and so forth Arguably the most influential
                                        sociallyconservative champion of free market economics in the last generation Michael Novak earned degrees in theology and philosophy not economics itself So maybe the question is why dont social
                                        conservatives becomeÂ economists Probably it has something to do with their frequent religiophilosophical commitments Social conservatives are not uniformly religious but they tend to be religionfriendly
                                        in ways that make an uneasy fit with the homo economicusÂ assumptions that undergird so much of the work of the economics profession left and right Social conservatives can argue in the language of those assumptions just as they can argue in the language of philosophical utilitarianismÂ  but they are still more likely to be drawn to philosophy or history
                                        or theology or journalism than to the dismal science itselfÂ Which is why its also not surprising that to the extent that there is a specifically sociallyconservative perspective on economics 
                                        the set of ideas loosely categorizable as distributism that links Catholic writers like GK Chesterton and Hilaire Belloc to crunchy cult figures like EF Schumacher                                        and Wendell Berry to alternativeright conservatives likeÂ Allan Carlson and John MdailleÂ Â its
                                        one that prides itself on rejecting some of the assumptions of the field and that tends to be extremely marginal as a result And then for social conservatives who are explicitly religious theres always the awareness that economic arguments are at best asymptotic to their deepest convictions on questions like sexuality marriage
                                        human personhood and human rights As I noted in yesterdays post the sociological case for sexual restraint rests on aggregates patterns trends There is no social science research in existence that can
                                        actually vindicate the idea that certain behavior is always wrong that you should never cheat or fornicate or lust after somebody elses spouse that no man should put asunder what God
                                        has joined togetherÂ For that as with many of the questions up for debate in the culture wars you need philosophy revelation or both And where Christianity is concerned the actual teaching of the faith on some of these questions is too radical too essentially unconservative in its prescriptions Â never look at a woman
                                        lustfully what Â to form a sound basis for public policy in any case Which is also on the flip side a reason why economists might not identify with socially conservatism Because they see no economic
                                        basis for absolute prohibitions on almost anything and assume mistakenly that the only alternatively to social liberalism is the strict legal enforcement of the Decalogue But its also important not to overthink the intellectual issues hereÂ The simplest explanation for the curious absence of socially conservative economicsÂ the same reason that there
                                        arent many social conservatives in any academic field Because social conservatism is considered uniquely socially disreputable in elite culture in ways that libertarianism and economic conservatism
                                        are not A thousand conversations Are you a Republican Yes but socially liberal fiscally conservative dont worry This disreputability does not necessarily mean that wouldbe sociallyconservative economists would face outright career discrimination There are shall we say some unique challenges                                        associated with making your way as a social conservative in academia but the deeper issue is that the assumptions of social liberalism are so ingrained in the intelligentsia that it would simply never occur to
                                        many highlyintelligent people to question them In my experience even when welleducated people pick up some sociallyconservative impulsesÂ  which time experience and parenthood often instillÂ 
                                        they remain instinctively horrified andor baffled by the idea of being associated with social conservatism as an ideology which they associate with fundamentalists bigots hypocrites and all those culturallyalien
                                        folks out in Jesusland This is very culturally understandable not least because there are so many social conservatives whoÂ do in fact tend toward the Phil Robertson style of argumentÂ on
                                        culturewar issuesÂ But it creates a very striking intellectual blind spot The kind of obvious issues Caplan identifies dont get much airing in elite circles large numbers of educated people labor
                                        in ignorance of the range of social science findings that complicate note that I didnt say disprove sociallyliberal beliefs and many of our best and brightest end up taking as a given publicpolicy assumptions
                                        to take one of my hobbyhorses the flawed conceit thatÂ liberal policies reduce both unwanted pregnancies and abortion rates
                                        that dont actually have that much empirical support Such blind spots exist in a range of areas admittedlyÂ  to be willfully ignorant is human on the right and left alike But the actuallynotthatcurious absence of social conservatives in the contemporary
                                        intelligentsia is one of the more striking examples of how cultural affinities and what Tyler Cowen calls mood affiliation                                        are far more powerful than mere research mere data and mere facts"
Fans Criticize Move to Suspend â€˜Duck Dynastyâ€™ Star,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/20/business/media/fans-criticize-move-to-suspend-duck-dynasty-star.html,The AE network was assailed on Thursday by thousands of fans of its most popular show over its decision to suspend the patriarch of the Duck Dynasty family Phil Robertson because of comments made in an interview in GQ magazine that the network deemed homophobic On Facebook and other social media sites supporters of the family  along with religious and conservative groups  accused AE of attacking Christian values and free speech There were numerous calls for boycotts of the network with prominent Republicans like Sarah Palin and Gov Bobby Jindal of Louisiana criticizing AE for what they called intolerance of Mr Robertsons beliefs The gay rights organization Glaad issued a statement on Wednesday condemning Mr Robertsons comments as vile and extreme and suggested that sponsors reexamine their ties to the Duck Dynasty series The group asked supporters to donate the cost of a duck call to the organization The Robertson family is in the duck call business and charges between 1495 and 24995 for its custommade calls Duck Dynasty which is filmed in Louisiana is by far the biggest hit on AE with an audience of 14 million viewers Any damage to the series from reduced viewing or withdrawals by advertisers could prove significantly costly Though AE declined to say anything beyond a statement the network released on Wednesday one AE executive who asked not to be identified said the network had no second thoughts about ordering the suspension based on references Mr Robertson made in the GQ interview The executive cited a comparison Mr Robertson made between gay sex and bestiality In the interview Mr Robertson said Start with homosexual behavior and just morph out from there Bestiality sleeping around with this woman and that woman and that woman and those men He also compared homosexual and heterosexual sex in graphic terms Another extensive comment  which included homosexuals along with adulterers the idolaters the male prostitutes the homosexual offenders the greedy the drunkards the slanderers the swindlers who would all be denied entry into heaven  referred to verses in the book of I Corinthians Many supporters on Thursday said Mr Robertson was essentially citing Scripture in expressing his views on homosexuality The Faith and Freedom Coalition an organization led by the religious activist Ralph Reed called for a grassroots campaign to get viewers to stop watching the AE network and said the decision to suspend Mr Robertson was a brazen act of antiChristian bigotry But critics of Mr Robertsons comments disagreed Even PETA weighed in issuing a statement condemning the show for its celebration of hunting saying Whats sinful is hating people and animals Phil Robertson issued a statement saying I would never treat anyone with disrespect just because they are different from me We are all created by the Almighty and like Him I love all of humanity We would all be better off if we loved God and loved each other The family followed that up with a statement released late Thursday night in which they seemed to challenge the AE suspension It read in part Phil would never incite or encourage hate We are disappointed that Phil has been placed on hiatus for expressing his faith which is his constitutionally protected right We have had a successful working relationship with AE but as a family we cannot imagine the show going forward without our patriarch at the helm We are in discussions with AE to see what that means for the future of Duck Dynasty A Facebook page in support of Mr Robertson which called for a boycott of AE had received more than 900000 likes by Thursday night and numerous Twitter hashtags also called for support of the family and boycotts of the network Several of the critics of the AE decision said Mr Robertsons position was essentially the same as that of the pope But the AE executive cited the graphic language that Mr Robertson used to talk about homosexual acts and said the overt comparison he made between bestiality and homosexuality prompted the suspension Mr Robertson has always been known as an evangelical Christian who preaches in many venues A video of him assailing abortion rights went viral last year He was initially reluctant to get involved with a television show until his son Willie who runs the familys business empire told him the show would be a platform to talk about the things you like to talk about But Willie Robertson has said  that he often had to remind his father that the show was not intended for proselytizing He said he reminded his father he was Phil Robertson not Pat Robertson  and this is not the 700 Club Its a comedy show Indeed the essence of the shows success has been its appeal to families of all kinds A top executive at a rival network noted that in research studies viewers say they enjoy the show because it is one of the few that people feel safe in watching with their children The show is also at the center of a marketing phenomenon Beyond the spectacular television ratings the show generates cash from merchandising of all kinds from Tshirts to garden gnomes and of course all kinds of duckhunting gear Walmart sells Duck Dynasty items in six departments in its stores Attempts to reach Walmart for comment were unsuccessful The Duck Dynasty Christmas album Duck the Halls which prominently features Phil Robertson has sold almost 600000 copies and retailers expect sales to rise because of the controversy AE may have little to worry about long term said Eric Schiffer the chairman of Reputation Management Consultants a firm that specializes in advising individuals and companies on how to deal with risks to their reputation Mr Schiffer argued that the network had to do something in the wake of Mr Robertsons comments but he said the combination of Mr Robertsons conciliatory clarification and the time before the suspension actually sets in would mean the issue would have no lasting effect One reason AE may not be discomfited by the protests is that it will be a long time before any viewer even notices the suspension The next edition of nine Duck Dynasty episodes has already been completed and the episodes will begin next month Phil Robertson will be prominently seen in all of them The suspension will affect only future episodes which have not yet been shot and will not be seen for months

American Moral Values on the Rebound,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/23/us/american-moral-values-on-the-rebound.html,WASHINGTON  The American political system is barely functional and the economy is still struggling especially for those in the middle and working classes But when it comes to the biggest concern of some commentators a generation ago  the decay of our culture  there is evidence that the country is doing all right In the 1990s the conservative William J Bennett a former education secretary and drug czar devised his Index of Leading Cultural Indicators He worried about a pervasive decline in moral values and eroding social pathologies A few years later he tempered his negative assessment seeing some improvements but he was still pessimistic In a recent interview Mr Bennett said that he now saw more progress than deterioration and that his worst forebodings had not materialized Were not headed for catastrophe he said The positive developments include falling crime rates fewer abortions and a remarkable decline in teenage pregnancies Less encouraging is the increasing number of singleparent families and the huge prison population On health matters cigarette smoking continues to drop but drug use doesnt Crime has been declining steadily with rare exceptions for the past couple of decades Since 1995 the murder rate has been reduced almost by half and violent crime is down more than 43 percent Although the United States is plagued by an epidemic of gun violence compared with almost any other country firearmsrelated homicides  in keeping with other crime data  have declined sharply since the 1990s Mr Bennett and other social observers have analyzed many indicators including educational and economic data The state of the family is always central Americans marry and divorce more than the citizens of any other industrialized nation One of the most troubling elements of the picture isnt new In 1965 a young then relatively unknown Labor Department official named Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote a report warning that almost a quarter of black Americans were born to single mothers the number for whites was only 3 percent Four and a half decades later the rate for blacks has tripled to 72 percent of all births The rate for whites has increased tenfold to 29 percent higher than the rate for blacks in the Moynihan report For Hispanics its 53 percent It has been conclusively demonstrated that on average children raised without two parents do considerably worse educationally and economically There is little consensus however on how to reverse the trend or even its underlying causes A decade and a half ago the current nominee to lead the Federal Reserve Janet L Yellen and her husband the economist and Nobel laureate George A Akerlof wrote a paper on outofwedlock childbearing that refuted conservative ideas and a few liberal ones An effective policy response has been elusive  Even so an especially encouraging harbinger of change is the dramatic progress over the past two decades in reducing pregnancies and birthrates among teenagers Although they remain higher than in most other countries both rates have dropped about 40 percent in 20 years This would surprise most Americans in one survey half of the respondents said teenage pregnancies and birth rates were still rising This turnaround has been led by groups like the National Campaign to Prevent Teen and Unplanned Pregnancy which uses education and pressure on the entertainment industry and media and sidesteps polarizing ideological postures  The magic combination of less sex and more contraception has contributed to this national success story said Sarah Brown the chief executive of the campaign Teenagers are waiting longer to have sex have fewer partners use contraceptives more and perhaps most important there is a growing social norm she said that teen pregnancy is not OK The United States remains beset by difficulties political economic and cultural Some of the key social trends however are more positive To study them provides hope that the country isnt as one doomsayer declared in the 1990s slouching toward Gomorrah

Westchester County Leader Weighs a Run for Governor,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/25/nyregion/westchester-county-leader-weighs-a-run-for-governor.html,Although an early poll suggests his bid may be quixotic Rob Astorino fresh from an impressive reelection victory for county executive of Westchester is mulling whether to seek the Republican nomination to challenge Andrew M Cuomo for governor next year In an interview earlier this month Mr Astorino confirmed reports that he is exploring a run for governor with party officials and political operatives and has had discussions with Gov Chris Christie of New Jersey an early favorite for the Republican presidential nomination Mr Astorino wants to see how much money he can raise and what kind of support he can arouse in parts of the state that may not be familiar with him  Im seriously considering it at this point he said Ill come to a conclusion in the weeks ahead One of the biggest hurdles he faces is name recognition A poll taken in November found Mr Cuomo had a whopping 39point edge over Mr Astorino 63 percent to 24 percent according to a Siena Research Institute poll taken in November shortly after Mr Astorinos reelection The poll did however indicate that voters ratings of Mr Cuomos job performance had declined Another hurdle is more endemic As Democrats like Assemblyman Richard L Brodsky point out To win the Republican nomination Mr Astorino must campaign on socially conservative principles that will alienate the majority of the states voters in the general election Mr Astorino acknowledges that he is a righttolife advocate who favors abortion only in cases of rape incest or when a mothers life is in danger and that he permitted gun shows at Westchesters cultural center after a 10year hiatus But Mr Astorino 46 a former radio host for the Catholic Channel on Sirius Satellite Radio shrugs off the poll and the pessimistic analyses He points out that he will become known outside the Hudson Valley once he starts campaigning The heart of his campaign he asserts is not about gun control or abortion but on cutting taxes reducing spending and easing state mandates that for example force jurisdictions like Westchester to turn over a large slice of their budgets for pensions Mr Astorino would like to change the system so that only workers contributions not ultimate benefits are fixed And he points out he has twice run in a county where Democrats have a 2to1 edge in registration and won handily garnering 56 percent of the vote in 2013 That he says suggests that voters are more concerned about his fiscal prudence than social issues The effect Albany is having on taxpayers is disastrous he said singling out Mr Cuomo as Albanys embodiment I had hoped he would take bold action to stop the downward spiral of the state but he hasnt done it By contrast he said he came into Westchester when it was grappling with a deficit treated people like adults and made tough decisions and cut spending as well as revenue in a county that charges among the highest property taxes in the nation  It would be great if the rest of the state would consider Westchester a laboratory for how to solve fiscal problems he said Responding to MrÂ Astorinos criticism Peter E Kauffmann a spokesman for the New York State Democratic Committee said the state is fundamentally advanced from where it was three years ago Jobs are up taxes are down and the states credit rating is positive  as opposed to Westchester which has been downgraded he said Another issue Mr Astorino plans to emphasize is the authorization of hydraulic fracturing  a procedure for extracting natural gas also known as fracking  in the vast Marcellus Shale formation which stretches into the central and western parts of the state Mr Astorino believes fracking opposed by some environmental groups could bring thousands of jobs to struggling locales Mr Astorino may face contenders Two names that have been talked about are Carl Paladino 67 the wealthy Buffalobased real estate developer who was soundly defeated as the nominee in 2010 but could be expected to finance his own campaign and Michael Garcia 52 a former United States attorney for the Southern District If Mr Astorino chooses to run according to party leaders Mr Garcia would seek the Republican nomination for state attorney general Mr Astorino is not the first Westchester Republican county executive to challenge a sitting governor Andrew P ORourke who died a year ago ran against Mr Cuomos father Mario in 1986 and was trounced Mr Astorino brings to his pursuit the genial polish of a radio performer  he was also an anchor for an MSG Network program and helped launch ESPN radio in New York He has also been immersed in local government as a county legislator a

Donâ€™t Trash Colombiaâ€™s Democracy,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/opinion/dont-trash-colombias-democracy.html,BOGOT Colombia  On Dec 9 I was giving a talk at City Hall on the need to fight corruption when suddenly my cellphone alerted me to this message Colombias inspector general had decided to remove me from my job as mayor of the nations capital and to bar me from holding office for 15 years My alleged sin bungling a project to bring trash collection  run by an oligopoly of private contractors  under direct city management Startled I told the audience what I had just learned They were irate the countrys minister of justice and a United Nations representative in Colombia seated at the head table with me both hugged me in a show of solidarity Tens of thousands of Colombians have rallied in the Plaza de Bolvar in the heart of the capital in my support More protests are planned For now I am the mayor I am challenging the inspector generals decision which I consider arbitrary and politically motivated In an interview on Sunday the nations chief prosecutor urged President Juan Manuel Santos to postpone the decision I was elected mayor of this city of eight million in 2011 after two terms in the Chamber of Representatives and one in the Senate My administration has focused on helping the poor readying the city for the effects of climate change and strengthening the public sphere  My political career is not one I could have predicted In the 1970s I joined a leftist guerrilla organization the April 19th Movement or M19 and was imprisoned and tortured from 1985 to 1987 for my participation But by 1990 our movement had laid down its arms and made peace with the government  even though our partys presidential candidate was assassinated that year Indeed in 1991 we helped revise the Constitution to make it more democratic The M19 was never part of the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia or FARC with whom the Colombian government is engaged in peace talks in Cuba to end nearly a halfcentury of armed conflict But the effort to remove me has become inextricably tied up with the issue of whether and how to end the longstanding struggle with the FARC Those who support the talks with the FARC have said that removing me would demonstrate that former guerrillas could not safely lay down their arms and be assured a role in a fair and democratic government  a concern shared by Kevin Whitaker President Obamas nominee to be ambassador to Colombia At a Senate confirmation hearing on Dec 11 Mr Whitaker said of the decision to remove me Theres a fundamental question thats raised by this it seems to me and that is one of political pluralism which he described as the challenge of how to integrate into the legal unarmed democratic process individuals of the left He added If individuals in Colombia were to conclude based on this action or any other action that that space doesnt exist then the basic conditions for peace are going to be in some ways eroded As a Colombian senator I supported the appointment of the inspector general Alejandro Ordez because of my belief in the importance of political pluralism even though he is a close ally of the rightwing former president lvaro Uribe who has criticized his successor Mr Santos for talking with the FARC While the inspector general has power under the Constitution to remove certain officials in my case Mr Ordez has overstepped and abused this authority In attempting to disqualify me from participation in politics on the flimsiest of pretexts Mr Ordez is trying to end my political career and weaken the political left He is also trying to deal a blow to the peace process with the FARC It is precisely because of this overreach that many in Colombia are calling for a reform of the inspector generals powers so as to require judicial review before an elected official can be removed This would bring our Constitution into line with the American Convention on Human Rights a treaty that Colombia has ratified It provides that elected officials may be removed only after being convicted by a competent judge in criminal proceedings The grounds for my removal are preposterous Last December I tried to break the oligopoly of private companies that held the contracts for garbage removal My administration estimated that these companies had overcharged the city some 300 million in the decade before I took office Those companies previously concession holders are now contractors with the city I acknowledge that my government made mistakes that are not uncommon when changing the model for provision of a public service as complex as trash collection in a city with millions of residents But Mr Ordez has accused me of no crime He says among other things that my administration mishandled our effort to bring trash collection under public control and in so doing attacked the system of free enterprise He also says that the accumulation of several thousand tons of garbage on Dec 1820 2012 threatened public health He does not demonstrate how this justified the removal of the democratically elected mayor of the nations capital  Mr Ordezs background shows a pattern of intolerance As a student in the northern city of Bucaramanga more than 30 years ago he participated in the mass burning of books considered impious from a public library These included Protestant translations of the Bible Mr Ordez is an ultraconservative Catholic and works by Gabriel Garca Mrquez As inspector general Mr Ordez interfered with the construction of a womens clinic in Medelln on the theory that abortions might be performed there He also threatened to remove judges and notaries who performed samesex marriages even though the countrys Constitutional Court ruled in 2011 that samesex couples could join in solemn union President Santos now faces a choice He can back Mr Ordez which I believe would violate democratic principles and international law and defy the will of the voters of Bogot while also setting back the peace process or he can pursue a democratic resolution to this situation one that respects our nations longing for peace democracy and human rights Respect for the popular vote must be the basis of democracy    Gustavo Petro Urrego is the mayor of Bogot This article was translated by Charles H Roberts from the Spanish      
Portrait of an Aunt With Dark Secrets,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/books/in-priscilla-nicholas-shakespeare-looks-at-family-mystery.html,The mythical status of Nicholas Shakespeares aunt Priscilla the subject of this biographical memoir took shape in his family on her return to London after the liberation of Paris A glamorous survivor of four years as a British enemy alien in France during World War II married to a French viscount astonishingly and adulterously dating the British movie star Robert Donat The familys image couldnt have been how she saw herself as the onceadored daughter of a father she barely glimpsed after she was swept off to Paris by a mother she described seemingly accurately as a selfish vain stupid woman next as an aspiring ballet dancer crippled by illness then a shy 20yearold whose parents wouldnt support her and  on her way to have a French abortion  a pickup by the viscount But to the author and his parents she was all mystery and romance They knew shed been in a concentration camp and they strongly suspected shed played a role in the Resistance Mr Shakespeare a prizewinning novelist and biographer began to pursue Priscillas story after her death when a pile of letters and photographs shed saved among them portions of a fictionalized autobiography more or less fell into his lap He also drew on works by his grandfather Priscillas father S P B Mais a BBC broadcaster and writer who had among his 200 books written about his daughter And stumbling on a familiar name in a library archive Mr Shakespeare found a further trove of such documents by Priscillas lifelong friend Gillian quite a character in her own right The women in fact wrote novels featuring each other This referential incestuousness is one of the slightly wicked pleasures of Mr Shakespeares book Priscilla The Hidden Life of an Englishwoman in Wartime FranceÂ  Graham Greene to whom Priscillas father had been kind returns the favor by naming a fictional character for him As a famous older man Greene features in Gillians life in France Priscillas beau Donat plays the dashing lead in the Hitchcock film of the book that had long been S P B Maiss lodestar The 39 Steps Priscillas mother sleeps with Gillians father As Mr Shakespeare does his research the mystery of Priscilla begins to recede and so does her glamour She is revealed as possibly less worthy  but maybe more intriguing She was not he found in the Resistance And Gillian who survived her friend said that Besanon the camp where Priscilla was interned for four months with other British passport holders was not a concentration camp though the Germans called it that For them it was Frontstalag 142  and it had much in common with the notorious camps the wooden bunks meager food and frozen latrines into which elderly inmates sometimes slid to be found dead in the morning Of the 4000 women interned in Besanon 700 died Which is to say it wasnt a death camp or even a forcedlabor camp but it was bad enough What is most shocking about what Mr Shakespeare discovers however is that none of this ever happened at least so far as the Besanon townspeople are concerned When it comes to the Occupation most of what even French officialdom offers is still blankness and denial What he also found was that survival for the French  or for the British in occupied territory  often meant collaboration In Priscillas case after her starved internment it was sexual collaboration with men powerful enough to keep her not only safe but also comfortable This section of the book is the most sensational largely because of the detail it reveals about highlevel blackmarket characters rather than about Priscilla who seems less to connect with people than to ricochet between them hoping to score security She sticks with her viscount who is impotent but feels betrayed when she is incarcerated at Besanon and he shows no interest in getting her out Others were more potent in every way Daniel Vernier a married businessman who had himself smuggled into the camp and protected her pretty much from 1941 to the liberation of Paris in 44 a Belgian racecar driver who jealously beat her a German named Otto one step away from Hermann Gring who kept her in caviar and couture and weirdly Madame Verniers brother the one man she ever fell in love with The sensational aspect though mainly has to do with the flamboyant characters that Priscilla may or may not have known directly Nazis and other goods traffickers living the high life in Paris One said to have inspired the title character in Louis Malles Lacombe Lucien is a highvoiced epicene youth who sells out Jews but like Ferdinand the bull just wants to smell the pretty flowers though only if theyre white There is finally almost too much here The sheer richness of sources can induce a kind of double vision Passages come from Maiss books and we get paragraphs by Gillian who in later years viewed Priscilla through a lens of bitchery Mr Shakespeare is also telling the story of how he got Priscillas story both chronology and perspective can be tricky to parse And while he offers some overview you may wish the whole had been framed less as a series of mysteries and been allowed more analysis  not to mention a timeline of the principals life and a cast list or at least an index deficiencies probably to be laid at the publishers door A map of France would be handy too Scattered across the book are what we can only guess from endnotes giving sources but no page numbers are quotations and subjective details from Priscillas manuscripts yet theres a hole where her viewpoint should be She stayed faithful to her second British marriage wrote unsuccessfully drank and died at 65 Mr Shakespeare compares her sympathetically to Anna Karenina and she is indeed the inadvertent protagonist of a morality tale about the dire consequences of a louche upbringing But we never know what she told herself about her life really That no doubt was what her nephew most wanted to fill in Our hunger to know what she thought and felt is a tribute to just how much of her he has been able to put on the page
Lawmakers Cite Progress on Budget Near Deadline,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/27/us/politics/nearing-a-1-trillion-measure-and-budget-normalcy.html,WASHINGTON  With the next budget deadline just weeks away top lawmakers said this week that they had made significant progress negotiating a huge governmentwide spending bill that gives the once mighty congressional Appropriations Committees an opportunity to reassert control over the flow of federal dollars We have a chance to prove to the rest of the Congress that we can produce bills Representative Harold Rogers the Kentucky Republican who is the chairman of the House Appropriations Committee said in an interview The past few years have proved frustrating for members of the spending panels With House Republicans unable to come to terms with Senate Democrats on a budget the government has mainly functioned under a series of continuing resolutions that have taken the Appropriations Committees out of the game It has been a real struggle and tough at times Mr Rogers said While most members of Congress have scattered for the holidays the panels bipartisan leadership and senior staff members have been assembling a 1 trillion measure that splits an extra 45 billion between military and domestic needs under the terms of the overarching budget deal reached this month and signed into law by President Obama on Thursday Lawmakers involved in the talks say both Republicans and Democrats are determined to get legislation through Congress by the Jan 15 deadline even though many rankandfile members are likely to be wary of an omnibus measure that takes in 12 sweeping spending bills intended to be considered separately The Jan 15 deadline essentially leaves just more than a week to win passage given that members of the House and the Senate will not start trickling back until Jan 6 Committee members say the bipartisan push behind the measure has produced results as they struggle to work out the myriad issues and financing disputes that can tangle appropriations bills and have contributed to the messy budget fights that have snarled the appropriations process I am on the phone three four five times a day said Representative Nita M Lowey of New York the top Democrat on the House panel We are really talking specifics So far we havent hit any bottlenecks Those negotiating the legislation are holding details of the talks close unwilling to let too much become public for fear of giving opponents time to build a case against the spending measure or incite lobbying campaigns by those who believe they are being overlooked This is a time for the hard work and less public announcements said Ms Lowey who acknowledged that serious challenges remained and that the committees faced an extraordinarily tight deadline for such a sweeping legislative job Budget watchdogs said they were not surprised that those drafting the legislation were divulging few details They just want to spring it on us at the last minute said Steve Ellis the vice president of Taxpayers for Common Sense These are oldschool appropriators These are people who know how to write these bills In an effort to improve the bills prospects Mr Rogers said he and Senator Barbara A Mikulski the Maryland Democrat who is the chairwoman of the Senate Appropriations Committee had agreed to limit contentious policy riders that can tie up a spending bill Riders often focus on politically charged issues like abortion environmental policy and antiterrorism tactics Holding riders to what Mr Rogers called a bare minimum might prove difficult because many lawmakers will see the spending measure as one of the few major pieces of legislation likely to clear Congress in an election year and will want to take advantage of it There are some general priorities as lawmakers get a chance to reorder spending after many agencies have been running on autopilot under socalled continuing resolutions that essentially extend existing financing levels and programs Democrats such as Ms Lowey and Senator Tom Harkin of Iowa who oversees much of the governments social spending say they want to use the 22 billion in extra domestic dollars to expand health care research and preschool programs among other initiatives At the same time defense hawks see the legislation as a chance to undo damage they think was done to the military through automatic cuts required when Congress failed to reach a broader budget agreement in 2011 Failure to win passage would mean that the Pentagon would again operate under a continuing resolution Between lawmakers interested in steering more money to domestic initiatives and those focused on the Pentagon the appropriations leaders hope to secure the votes to push through the legislation over the objections of conservatives who are unhappy with new spending and of liberals who believe that social programs are being shortchanged While the appropriations leaders are optimistic potential stumbling blocks are numerous Congress has struggled for years to pass legislation financing labor and health programs and some Republicans will again balk at money for the new health care law Battles will also most likely arise over spending for the Environmental Protection Agency NASA military pensions and the Internal Revenue Service which has been under fire from Republicans for singling out conservative groups for special scrutiny The budget fights reached a peak in October with the government shutdown In its aftermath Mr Rogers pressed Speaker John A Boehner of Ohio and other House Republican leaders  none of whom have ever served on the Appropriations Committee  to strike a deal that provided an overall spending figure the committees could work with All I wanted from him was a number Mr Rogers said and he delivered The spending bill covers federal agencies through Sept 30 But the budget deal also set spending for the 2015 fiscal year providing the Appropriations Committees a chance to restore a semblance of order to a process that has gone badly off the rails Mr Rogers said the committees hoped to return to the textbook approach of conducting oversight hearings on agency spending assembling and passing bills in each chamber and then holding HouseSenate negotiations to resolve differences Success could restore some of the luster to the Appropriations Committees It is simple he said Somebody has to propose how we spend the money write it down on a piece of paper and say Here what do you think That is what appropriators do

State Feminists vs. 343 Bastards,https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/30/opinion/state-feminists-vs-343-bastards.html,Berlin  Feminists across Western Europe are sounding the alarm Prostitution they claim has become todays white slavery with ever more women from Bulgaria and Romania Africa and Asia being forced tricked or seduced into selling their bodies  But in doing so these activists are creating a schism in the movement between those who see prostitution as another form of male oppression and those who see it as a possible means of female empowerment Much of the debate is centered in Germany where prostitution is legal As a result the German author Alice Schwarzer said the country has become an El Dorado for human traffickers a paradise for johns from all over the Continent who come in busloads to frequent the new megabrothels in Cologne Munich or Berlin  And indeed prostitution is big business here In bordellos along the borders with France and Poland countries where prostitution is illegal groups of visitors are often offered flatrate packages Though exact numbers are rare experts estimate that there are as many as 400000 prostitutes in Germany serving more than a million clients and churning out a hefty revenue of 15 billion euros a year  Ms Schwarzer is a leading proponent of recriminalizing prostitution a position that puts her at odds with her erstwhile allies on the left After all prostitution was legalized under the coalition government of the Social Democrat Gerhard Schrder in 2002 The idea said the Green Party politician Kerstin Mller one of the architects of the law was to give registered sex workers a way to get out of the shadows including making them eligible for social security  To Ms Schwarzer though such a system simply locks in place a misogynist power structure Prostitution is not the exception it is a mass phenomenon Ms Schwarzers position is common in other parts of Northern Europe where a sort of state feminism has been on the rise for decades In the name of protecting women in 1999 Sweden criminalized the hiring of prostitutes turning the judicial gaze on the johns and away from the women Such a law works well in a place like Sweden where the political consensus is to subordinate ones personal needs and desires to the common good  In Sweden there are many more men who consider themselves feminists than anywhere else in the world said the German journalist Thomas Kirchner a correspondent for the Sddeutsche Zeitung Men have to ask themselves Do I really want to satisfy my urge even if that means supporting a system that humiliates and exploits thousands of women What image of women do I teach my children  The Swedish model is being taken up across the Continent Northern Ireland Belgium Finland and Lithuania are all about to follow suit But Ms Schwarzer and Sweden represent just one side of the debate Organizations that represent sex workers have pushed back aggressively They argue that the women for whom they advocate  such as the sociology student earning a little extra money in a highpriced escort service the exprostitute who opened up her own business and who claims to love her job  are a social category that simply does not exist for the feminist prohibition movement which sees only victims of oppression Resistance to this new state feminism has nowhere been as vivid as in France where a new law imposes a fine of 1500 euros on people caught soliciting a prostitute they are also required to undergo awareness classes on the dire situation of prostitutes and the dangers of sex work The French philosopher Elisabeth Badinter declared the proposal a declaration of hate toward male sexuality She has made common cause with a growing number of Frenchmen  as diverse as the novelist Frdric Beigbeder and the lawyer Richard Malka who defended Dominique StraussKahn against charges of rape  who deny that their visiting prostitutes constitutes anything other than a private transaction between consenting adults A petition called 343 Bastards  an allusion to a notorious abortionrights campaign in 1971 of 343 sluts  stated that some of us have gone go or will go to prostitutes  and we are not even ashamed They added everyone should be free to sell their charms and even to love doing it  What this debate obscures is the crucial difference between prostitution in general which can certainly be about consenting adults doing what they want with their bodies and human trafficking which no one should tolerate or provide excuses for Unfortunately state feminism in its desire to make a stand for women ends up punishing those who are most open about their willingness to pay or be paid for sex while pushing the evils of human trafficking and forced sex work further underground Instead of cracking down on the men who frequent prostitutes the authorities should be focused on the criminal networks that bring in women from Eastern European countries to the European Union  Punishing johns in general is a kind of fundamentalism that doesnt befit a liberation movement By becoming a state religion feminism can only lose    Mariam Lau is a political correspondent for the

Edelin, Doctor at Center of Landmark Abortion Case, Dies at 74",https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/31/us/kenneth-c-edelin-physician-at-center-of-landmark-abortion-case-dies-at-74.html,Dr Kenneth C Edelin a Boston physician whose 1975 manslaughter conviction for performing a legal abortion was overturned on appeal in a landmark test of medical legal religious and political questions surrounding abortion in America died on Monday in Sarasota Fla He was 74 The cause was cancer his family said  Two years after the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade decision legalized abortion in 1973 Dr Edelin a 35yearold resident in obstetrics and gynecology at Boston City Hospital became the focus of a national debate over crucial issues that had been left unresolved by the justices When does life begin Does an aborted fetus have rights And what are a doctors often contradictory duties to the fetus and its mother  Dr Edelin pronounced EEdalin was charged with causing the death of the fetus of an unwed 17yearold during an elective abortion in her sixth month of pregnancy In a sixweek trial in Boston that explored uncharted legal ground and made headlines across the country Dr Edelin who was black was vilified as a babykiller and defended as a victim of racial and religious prejudice being tried for an action that had never been defined as a crime killing a fetus that may or may not have been a person and whose rights had never been specified by law The abortion which took place in 1973 began as a routine procedure the injection of a saline solution that usually causes uterine contractions and the expulsion of the fetus But several tries were unsuccessful and Dr Edelin completed the abortion by a surgical procedure known as a hysterotomy  making a small incision in the uterus and detaching the fetus from the placental wall by hand Prosecutors did not contest the legality of the abortion  Roe v Wade had struck down antiabortion laws in most states including Massachusetts  but argued that Dr Edelin after ending the pregnancy had deprived a baby boy of oxygen while it was still in the womb being born A photo of the dead fetus was shown to the jurors and some said they were shaken by it The defense called the photo inflammatory and objected repeatedly to the prosecutions use of fetus and baby as interchangeable terms Medical experts testified for the defense that the fetus estimated to be 24 weeks old was not viable enough to have survived outside the womb Dr Edelins lawyers contended that no person had even existed let alone died But the allwhite 12member jury which included nine men and 10 Roman Catholics convicted Dr Edelin of manslaughter Some jurors said later that the photo of the dead fetus whose face they said looked distorted as if in pain had been decisive in their decision to vote guilty An alternate juror also said after the verdict that jurors had made racial slurs against Dr Edelin more than once before closing arguments  The presiding judge who had instructed the jury that it could convict only if it believed that the fetus was a viable person and that the doctor had acted recklessly sentenced Dr Edelin to one year of probation although he could have imposed a maximum of 20 years in prison Dr Edelin kept his medical license and continued to practice at Boston City Hospital The verdict was hailed as a victory by antiabortion groups and the Catholic hierarchy which had long contended that life was sacred and began at conception But it shocked and dismayed advocates of womens rights who called the case a precedent that could make doctors wary of performing abortions in the second trimester  Dr Edelin called the prosecution a witch hunt in a city where a huge Catholic population believed that fetuses were human beings and that abortions were sacrilegious The chief prosecutor Assistant District Attorney Newman A Flanagan was a Catholic who hoped to run for Suffolk County district attorney and was widely admired for pursuing a case that might tighten restrictions and intimidate doctors who performed abortions  Dr Edelin appealed the verdict and in 1976 the states highest judicial body the Supreme Judicial Court unanimously overturned the conviction and formally acquitted him  The appellate court held that a doctor could commit manslaughter only by ending the life of a fetus that was definitely alive outside the womans body It rejected the prosecution theory that the fetus might have been alive in the uterus after being separated from the uterine wall and was thus a person for purposes of the manslaughter law The ruling also clarified the definition of life saying that it meant having heartbeats and respiration  more than several transient cardiac transactions and more than fleeting respiratory efforts or gasps Besides giving doctors protection by defining when a fetus is a live person the ruling also protected them from criminal liability for failing to take heroic measures to save a fetus once it was outside a womans body Propelled to fame by the case Dr Edelin became a hero of the womens movement was named to prestigious posts in national health and human rights organizations and went on to a successful medical and teaching career He became known for his concern for indigent patients and spoke often of the need for legal and safe abortions Nobody likes

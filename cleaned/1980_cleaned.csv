Screen: Discretion at 39 in Sautet's 'Simple Story':The Cast,https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/10/archives/screen-discretion-at-39-in-sautets-simple-storythe-cast.html,Largely because of the late great immortal Jack Benny I cant hear someone say hes 39 without grinning in comic anticipation No one as Mr Benny taught us is ever seriously certifiably 39 Being 39 is a joke a vain attempt to stop timeThis may explain part though not all of my skepticism about A Simple Story Une Histoire Simple a serious new film by Claude Sautet the writerdirector of among other films The Things of Life Cesar and Rosalie and Vincent Franois Paul and the OthersA Simple Story is not a simple story but there all irony ends It is instead the discreetly poignant mixedup story of Marie who at 39 must reexamine her life the choices already made and those still to be faced Marie is said to be a successful industrial designer and though we see her looking very serious behind an easel we never know what she is designing as if that would be in some way indiscreetWe learn that Marie is 39 in discreet fashion  in the course of an interview with the doctor whos going to perform an abortion for Marie This is a discreetly sad scene and also a little unreal because Marie is played by Romy Schneider a stunningly beautiful woman who is in her 40s but whose face suggests neither youth nor age but supernatural agelessnessMarie is vaguely discontented Her 16yearold son is growing up and away from her as she knows he should and shes in the process of splitting up with her lover Serge Claude Brasseur a foolish weak man who doesnt measure up to Maries anklesThough we dont really believe it for a minute Marie will grow old one day and this has begun to haunt her She knows there must be more to life than this which is mainly what A Simple Story is all about Because Mr Sautet makes movies that are nothing if not discreetly realistic we know that not much will have changed by the time Marie has weathered this particular crisis except that shell have grown up in some way that is photogenic but discreetly vagueDiscretion as you may have gathered by this time is the operative word in Sautet films which are hugely successful in France but which with the exception of Vincent Franois Paul and the Others tend to leave me unmoved and unconvinced When Im feeling depressed Im perfectly willing to admit that Ive become too jaded by the roughandtumble of American films to respond to the subtleties of the Sautet work When all is well as right this minute Im convinced that Mr Sautets films are as empty as I suspect though they are attractively acted and mounted and sometimes unexpectedly cinematic in styleIn the course of A Simple Story there are lots of jolly gettogethers among Marie and her female friends and among Marie and her female friends with their lovers and husbands There are good times and bad on weekends in lovely country houses happysad afterwork drinks in favorite cafes lovers quarrels discreet love scenes and one suicide Marie and her exhusband Georges Bruno Cremer have a brief affair but the affair is an afterdinner brandy not the introduction to a new meal Food its preparation and consumption plays an important part in Sautet filmsA Simple Story which opens today at the 57th Street Playhouse is a pretty movie extremely well acted but anesthetizing Mr Sautet treats his characters as if they were gods not heaven knows because they are powerful but because they are without connections to anything else The world of his films is exactly the world seen by these people There is nothing outside the movie frameIn serious movies even if the scale is small and the method comic we are aware of some larger scheme of things into which the characters fit The people in A Simple Story for all of the films middleclass realism are like the people in television commercials They are contemporary myths The Cast A SIMPLE STORY directed by Claude Sautet screenplay French with English subtitles by Mr Sautet and JeanLoup Dabadie dialogue by Mr Dabadie director of photography Jean Boflety film editor Jacqueline Thiedot music by Philippe Sarde produced by Alain Sarde distributed by Quarlet Films At the 57th Street Playhouse Running time 110 minutes This film is not ratedMarie      Romy SchneiderGeorges      Bruno CremerSerge      Claude BrasseurGabrielle      Arlette BonnardEsther      Sophie OaumierAnna      Eva DarianFrancine      Francine BergeJerome      Roger PigautMaries Mother      Madeline RobinsonMartin      Yves Knapp
Screen: 'Blood Feud' By Lina Wertmuller:Three Attitudes,https://www.nytimes.com/1980/02/22/archives/screen-blood-feud-by-lina-wertmullerthree-attitudes.html,IT is high time to wonder why any actress in a Lina Wertmuller film spends so much time spitting clawing and shrieking at the camera How can a director arouse such strong passions in her performers and still make her audiences drowsy Pure exasperation seems to be the key Blood Feud is Miss Wertmuller at her worst which is just a hop skip and a jump from her best as far as I can see Harsh words perhaps but then Miss Wertmuller makes hysterical movies Its hard to respond generously to a harangueBlood Feud which opens today at the Plaza turns Sophia Loren into a harpy That cannot have been easy Otherwise the films accomplishments are muddled and minimal Miss Loren plays a shrill Sicilian widow whose husband has been murdered by the towns richest man soon to become the towns most influential Fascist the story begins in 1920 and spans several years Then she becomes involved with two other men a socialist lawyer Marcello Mastroianni and a gangster who has gone to America and come back with a few phrases of English and a Victrola Giancarlo Giannini She winds up loving them both but it takes quite a while for her to discover this and meanwhile there is a lot of screamingMiss Wertmuller who fills the screen with messy camerawork and gorgeous scenery presents three attitudes instead of three characters This is by no means as simple as it sounds because the attitudes arent clearly rendered and they shift like the sands But the gangster tends to be bad although he is brave which is useful And the socialist tends to be good although his helplessness doesnt help The woman is clearly a heroine because she defies the law to perform abortions The men are terribly sexist about sex which is a great big suprise for us allBlood Feud stays talky for a while then builds to a number of action scenes that are staged almost comically as if they were slapstick The most remarkable thing in the film is a Greek temple in the Sicilian countryside where sheep are seen grazing The temple is also seen in a painting on someones wall and the sheep reappear periodically So many characters turn up in black shirts by the storys doctrinaire ending that the sheep might well have been expected to saunter by in similar outfits Fortunately that doesnt happen Three Attitudes BLOOD FEUD written and directed by Lina Wertmuller director of photography Tonino Delli Colli film editor Franco Fraticelli music by Dangio and Nando De Luca produced by Harry Colombo released by Associated Film Distribution Italian with English subtitles At the Plaza Theater Running time 99 minutes This film is rated RTitina Paterno      Sophia LorenLawyer Spallone      Marcello MastroianniNick Sammichele      Giancarlo GianniniAcicatena      Turi Ferro

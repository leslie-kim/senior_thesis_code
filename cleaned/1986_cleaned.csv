HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/02/garden/hers.html,UP until the day before yesterday you were labeled a fanatic if you suggested that the next target of the prolife movement would be contraception  today the abortion clinic tomorrow the drugstore Never mind that the Roman Catholic Church has never made any secret of its ban on any form of contraception except abstinence What is the rhythm method but planned abstinence  even when pregnancy means death Never mind too that the Protestant fundamentalists take an only slightly less drastic position In America we like to think that truth lies in the middle  like the Happy Birthday on a cake Thus people who saw a threat to family planning had to be extremists to balance the people who conducted funeral services over aborted fetuses Thats why its so fascinating to watch the antiabortionists come clean At their behest American aid to international family planning programs has been slashed A few weeks ago a bomb was mailed to a birthcontrol clinic  not an abortion clinic in Oregon Earlier this fall Representative Jack F Kemp and Senator Orrin G Hatch attempted to cut off Title X funding for local familyplanning centers  the only counseling available for millions of poor women  unless the centers agreed not to inform their clients of the existence of legal abortion Although the move failed it brought a new phrase to public light According to Joseph M Scheidler chief spokesman for the ProLife Action League and author of its bible Closed 99 Ways to Stop Abortion such funding is wrong because it promotes the contraceptive mentality Like the abortion mentality Mr Schiedler wrote in a recent OpEd piece in USA Today the contraceptive mentality is antichild He said It attempts to exclude the possibility of new life by perverting a natural function into a mere means of recreation thus establishing the hedonistic value system based on selfishness So now its official The same adjectives used rather successfully to stigmatize women who choose abortion  antichild hedonistic selfish  also apply to just about every couple in the United States including Catholics and fundamentalists Your friends with the two adorable petted toddlers actually hate children  without the Pill theyd have 10 When you and your mate fall happily into bed on a Sunday afternoon youre just using each other like a prostitute and a john This new honesty I have to say pleases me no end I have a rather antimetaphysical turn of mind so I always felt left out of those quasitheological discussions about whether an embryo is a person or how would I feel if my mother had aborted me Its good to have the debate back on earthly terrain as a struggle over the meaning of sex Suddenly a lot of things make sense Its always seemed bizarre for example that the prolife or antichoice movement which calls abortion murder and a holocaust doesnt take to the streets to demand contraception for all Using a diaphragm has to be small potatoes morally speaking compared with killing like shoplifting compared with blowing up the store But as a movement antichoicers oppose just about every measure that could cut the abortion rate by lowering the risk of unwanted pregnancy sex education inschool birthcontrol clinics confidentiality for teenagers televised contraception ads Even the more thoughtful prolifers who can see the connection between abortion and poverty or lack of childcare services are silent on the most obvious connection of all that between abortion and lack of contraception The problem in America isnt too much contraceptive mentality but too little The sexual revolution may have brought sex out of the closet sort of but birth control is still in there with the old sweaters and sneakers Youd think for instance that there would be a vast army of citizens agitating for enormous spending on contraceptive research Short of a way to lose weight without dieting would any scientific advance do more to increase everyday human happiness than a cheap available painless foolproof fussless method of birth control An herb tea say that one could sip over the morning paper But there is no such movement and thats why I find myself at 36 facing the same choice I faced when I was 20 A method of birth control discovered by the ancient Egyptians versus those that present risks to my health For something used regularly by so many the cultural quiet surrounding birth control is striking indeed Its as though the prudery and guilt that used to be associated with our sexual parts have attached themselves to our pills and devices instead Sex is ubiquitous on televison for instance but not even sultry Joan Collins slips into the bathroom before trysting And what about movies Do Meryl Streep and Robert Redford discuss protection before the violin music and the dissolve Novels are almost as circumspect Most of the famous contraception scenes in our fiction are interstingly negative Theres poor Dottie in Mary McCarthys The Group waiting with her new pessary on a park bench for the married man who never shows Theres Updikes Rabbit Angstrom who wont let his prostitute girlfriend use her diaphragm because it spoils the mystery of sex and Norman Mailers Rojack who does the same with his prostitute girlfriend The women go along with this of course and have the best sex of their lives  so much for realism in contemporary fiction I wish we were a hedonistic culture and saw sexual pleasure as a normal part of civilized life like tasty meals and summer vacations and opera tickets But under the Playboy glitz were still the same old Puritans who thought Massachusetts winters were good for the soul We still suspect sex entails punishment  an attitude strongly reinforced by the new sexually transmitted diseases  and because contraception breaks this connection we cant acknowledge it except in a worried furtive way Thats why nobody argues for teenage birth control on the ground that sex can be a positive experience for young people  its always presented as damage control Contraception cuts another connection too  the one between sex and sexism Without contraception womens rights are just words because women who cant control their fertility cant stay in school or keep a job or postpone marriage or divorce a breadwinner or think of themselves as anything but natures victims This link is so strong and so obvious I would suggest that the ultimate aim of the antichoicers is not to save unborn children or even to quell teenage promiscuity but to put women back in the kitchen Right now though thats only one womans fanatical opinion
CHILDBIRTH DEATHS FOR OLDER WOMEN DECLINE 50%,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/03/us/childbirth-deaths-for-older-women-decline-50.html,The death rate from pregnancyrelated causes among women 35 years and older has dropped nearly 50 percent in recent years a study shows but women that age are still three times as likely to die from such causes Although older women will probably continue to be at higher risk of maternal death researchers said in an article to be published Friday in The Journal of the American Medical Association recent trends should be reassuring to younger women who are considering postponement of pregnancy and to women aged 35 or older who are contemplating pregnancy The reseachers said the decline could be attributed to the higher social and economic status of older women having babies in recent years In general people of lower education and income have higher mortality rates said Dr James W Buehler who headed the study at the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta 50 Drop in Death Rates The study said pregnancyrelated deaths among women 35 and over were about 50 percent lower in 1982 than from 1974 through 1978 The mortality rate among women of that age in 1982 was 242 deaths per 100000 live births from 1974 through 1978 the average mortality rate was 475 deaths per 100000 live births the study said The mortality rates included deaths from abortion The 1982 rates were compiled by the National Center for Health Statistics
COMMON SENSE ON FAMILY PLANNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/opinion/common-sense-on-family-planning.html,One good way to help men and women make sound decisions about family planning is to make sure they obtain the necessary information This season Congress is to be congratulated for its rare appreciation of that wisdom in balking at the efforts of those who deny it Representative Jack Kemp of New York for example proposed to deny Federal funds to clinics that give abortion counseling so as to erect what he called a wall of separation between family planning and abortion But no federally funded familyplanning clinics provide or even recommend abortions They only advise that abortion is a legal option as they should and make referrals on request Had Congress passed Mr Kemps proposal clinics that inform clients about the full range of their medical options would have lost substantial subsidies Fortunately for them and the people they help the House and Senate rejected the idea Congress showed more good sense last month in heading off a damaging new rule at the Agency for International Development It plans to give poor nations 40 million over five years to promote natural familyplanning programs but said it would no longer require the recipients to counsel couples about the wide choice of contraceptive methods The issue here was not abortion no AID money goes for abortionrelated activities The issue was the need of poor families to make a free and informed choice about family planning Senator Dennis DeConcini of Arizona a foe of abortion recognized the folly in the agencys new rule What surer way to increase abortion rates than to deny people knowledge about contraception The Senator got Congress to stipulate that the recipients of AID familyplanning funds must provide directly or through referral advice on all birth control methods Thanks to the Senator couples in poor nations can be taught the natural familyplanning method if they want it but they will not be denied access to other methods
FALWELL FORMING GROUP TO LOOK AT BROAD ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/us/falwell-forming-group-to-look-at-broad-issues.html,The Rev Jerry Falwell founder of Moral Majority announced today that he was forming a new political organization with the hope of mobilizing millions of conservatives who support his views on domestic and foreign issues He said Moral Majority would continue to focus on strictly moral issues such as abortion and pornography as a subsidiary of the new entity the Liberty Federation He said the federation supported President Reagans hightechnology antimissile plan favored financial aid to the rebels in Nicaragua and would help resist possible Communistic takeovers in Taiwan South Korea the Philippines South Africa and all over the world Charles E Judd executive director of the Liberty Federation and Moral Majority said the new organization would be no more or less religious than Moral Majority Bush Plans to Speak At a news conference here today Mr Falwell said Vice President Bush would speak at the first meeting of the federation in Washington on Jan 24 An aide to Mr Bush confirmed that the Vice President was planning to be there Such an appearance could be expected to help Mr Bush a likely contender in the Republican Presidential primaries in 1988 to solidify his support among conservatives Members of the Bush camp acknowledged that the Vice President might alienate some liberal or moderate Republicans if he was perceived as closely tied to Moral Majority But they said Mr Falwells support was strategically important to Mr Bush because it would be virtually impossible for any rival to gain the Republican Presidential nomination except by consolidating the New Right against him Mr Falwell a leader of the Christian fundamentalist movement said he was not a candidate for any political office and was supporting Mr Bush for President in 1988 According to political professionals in both parties Mr Falwells endorsement might cost a candidate more votes than it gained National polls by both parties have also detected strong negative reactions to him He has blamed the news media for such reactions In the January issue of his newspaper renamed Liberty Report Mr Falwell said The press for six years has bloodied and beaten the name Moral Majority There are a lot of people who will say yes to everything we are saying but they dare not stand with us on particular policies for fear of getting tarred hurt  that is picking up baggage that the media have dumped on us John Buchanan chairman of People for the American Way a group formed in part to counter Mr Falwell said in a statement By changing its name and charter Moral Majority is finally acknowledging its true identity a political organization advocating rightwing positions He said Mr Falwell should now play by the same rules as others in the political arena He should stop pretending to be chairman of the Lords political action committee and stop suggesting that to disagree with Jerry Falwell is to side with Satan against God Mr Buchanan said Paul G Kirk Jr chairman of the Democratic National Committee said in a statement This public relations name change speaks volumes about the reputations of both Jerry Falwell and his organization A Liberty Federation wont stand for true liberty any more than the Moral Majority represents the moral values of most Americans Mr Falwell a Baptist minister from Lynchburg Va said Moral Majority had attracted six and a half million Americans since it was chartered in June 1979 Conservative Roman Catholics constitute the largest single bloc of members with 30 percent of the total he said and Protestants and Jews are also members Moral Majority has a budget of 7 million this year according to Mr Falwell He said the Liberty Federation including Moral Majority and Liberty Alliance a new lobbying group would have a budget of 12 million He said the money would be raised from new constituents who are interested in our agenda Roy C Jones legislative director of Moral Majority and Alan P Dye a lawyer for Mr Falwells organizations said charitable contributions to the Liberty Federation would be taxdeductible Gifts to Liberty Alliance or Moral Majority Inc will not be
THE TRUTH ABOUT POLYGRAPHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/04/us/the-truth-about-polygraphs.html,Polygraph or liedetector tests are supposed to help investigators determine the truth But the truth about the Governments use of the polygraph can be elusive The staffs of at least four Congressional committees and the General Accounting Office for example are now trying to determine how the many different agencies of the Federal Government are actually using the polygraph and whether the device is an effective tool Even the Federal Bureau of Investigation has got into the act by initiating a nationwide survey to learn how often polygraph tests have generated inaccurate leads in FBI investigations Efforts to Expand Their Use The interest of the Congressional committees was spurred by the Reagan Administrations repeated efforts to expand the use of polygraph testing for protecting national security secrets Last month President Reagan backed away from his decision authorizing Federal investigators to undertake the random polygraphing of tens of thousands of senior Federal officials after Secretary of State George P Shultz suggested he would resign if forced to take such a test One of the nagging questions about the polygraph concerns its basic usefulness Although there is evidence the tests can help investigators in narrowly focused criminal cases a 1983 study by the Office of Technology Assessment a bipartisan agency that serves Congress concluded The available research does not establish the scientific validity of the polygraph test for personnel security screening A second key question focuses on the questions the examiners are asking In recent testimony before the House Government Operations Committee and several other Congressional bodies for example Richard G Stilwell then Deputy Under Secretary of Defense for Policy said the military had restricted its questions to specific counterintelligence matters and avoided asking about political beliefs and personal activities But an investigation published today by the General Accounting Office for the Senate Armed Services Committee found that the training manual used by the military until late November suggested asking about a subjects political racial and religious affiliations and whether the subject had engaged in a variety of sex acts or had ever been a party to an abortion The GAO study said the Defense Department had now ordered the abolition of the training manual Representative Jack Brooks the Texas Democrat who heads the House Government Operations Committee has denounced the manual as both illegal and inappropriate Over all few people seem to know how many polygraph examinations are being conducted by Federal agencies mostly because several of the major programs are cloaked in official secrecy The Central Intelligence Agency and the National Security Agency for example both have longestablished procedures requiring such screening for both job applicants and on a periodic basis current employees These agencies together are now thought to have about 100000 employees It is doubtful that the ambitious polygraph plans favored by both the Reagan Administration and some members of Congress can be achieved in the next few years The major hurdle is the lack of enough people to conduct the tests in which the subjects pulse and other physical signs are measured at the same time the person is being asked a series of questions Military Has 152 Testers Defense Department experts say that an individual examiner working at top speed can conduct 300 tests a year Yet department officials said recently that the military had only 152 examiners In the fiscal year 1985 according to testimony before a special hearing held recently by Democratic Representatives Don Edwards of California and Patricia Schroeder of Colorado examiners working in the Defense Department but not including those working for the National Security Agency were able to conduct 10000 to 12000 tests in connection with criminal investigations and about 3000 tests for counterintelligence purposes One littleknown Defense Department polygraph project bears the code name Seven Screens possibly an allusion to Salomes seven veils Since 1982 this test has been used to examine the reliability of about 8000 people mostly working on a classified Air Force contract According to a recent briefing by the department for Congressional staff members the test has produced doubts about 10 of the 8000 people questioned These cases have been referred to the FBI 40 to 45 Testers at FBI Lane Bonner a spokesman said the FBI had 40 to 45 polygraph examiners In the fiscal year 1984 he said they conducted more than 2800 examinations mostly in connection with criminal investigations A spokesman for the Secret Service said it was against policy to disclose how many polygraph examiners worked for the Service or how many tests they administered The Secret Service is a Treasury Department agency with the dual tasks of protecting the President Vice President and certain other political figures and of combating counterfeiting Most Government polygraph examiners are trained at a special school operated by the Army at Fort McClellan Ala Last year this school trained 48 new examiners The Defense Department is now expanding the school so it can train 108 students a year The Central Intelligence Agency has its own polygraph school the operations of which are secret

BACK TO A BASIC CONTRACEPTIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/05/business/back-to-a-basic-contraceptive.html,ANNE an attractive New York widow in her mid40s decided it was time to begin dating again Before reentering the social wars she visited her gynecologist Anne had long used a diaphragm to prevent pregnancy but feared this would provide little protection against AIDS the acquired immune deficiency syndrome for which there is no cure The doctor suggested that she stay with the diaphragm but also invest in a packet of condoms The medical profession considers the rubber sheaths named after an 18th Century British physician to be after abstinence the most effective preventive against sexually transmitted diseases including the deadly AIDS Anne did as advised despite some embarrassment caused by the proximity of two youths to the drug store counter and her confusion at the variety of brands and styles available When she emerged from the store bearing a packet of lambskin Fourex Anne joined the growing number of Americans reacquainting themselves with a device they thought consigned to the ash heap of sexual history Manhattan with its large homosexual and singles communities is showing the sharpest sales increases Sales are up 20 to 25 percent said Irving Appel of Eichen  Appell a pharmaceutical distribution house Individual drug stores report increases of up to 50 percent The West Coast shows similar gains to which San Franciscos homosexual population undoubtedly contributes Sales for the last two months of 1985 were 25 percent above the same period the year before said Mark Klein marketing vice president of Schmid Laboratories a Britishowned New Jersey company whose brands including Ramses Sheik Excita and Fourex account for 35 percent of the 400 million condoms sold annually in the United States Physicians encourage the return to the ancient product which has existed in some form since Roman times Tests to see whether condoms can protect users against the AIDS virus are still underway But the herpes virus failed to penetrate condoms and medical experts expect similar results in the AIDS tests There is no real cure for herpes said Dr David Grimes a researcher for the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta And AIDS kills people So we have to look at prevention until science comes up with a cure That means the condom preferably one that comes with a spermicide Somehow the combination seems to create a synergistic action against a number of sexually transmitted diseases Such recommendations come as a boon to Schmid Ansell Inc and CarterWallace Inc the maker of Trojans the three major companies in the industry Condom makers spent the 1960s and 70s watching their product lose ground to competitive birth control methods Condoms now account for only 20 percent of the nations 1 billion birth control products industry with the pill accounting for almost half Both products trail sterilization as the antipregnancy method favored by Americans But condom sales have risen well above their traditional 10 percent annual growth rate  the same rate as the birth control industry as a whole  and now are taking business from the pill The biggest growth in the market is not from the users themselves but from American women For several years doctors have been warning women over 35 especially those who are obese or smoke heavily that they might be wise to switch from the pill to another form of birth control Now the growing evidence that the AIDS virus can be transmitted during heterosexual sex is bringing even more women to the condom market With society concerned not only about AIDS but also about a flood of unwanted pregnancies among teenagers the industry figures it must continue to benefit Women now spend some 100 million to buy nearly 40 percent of the condoms sold at retail up from less than 10 percent a decade ago say industry sources In California where trends often seem to start these days the figure is closer to 60 percent The outlook for condoms has never been better concluded Mr Klein This optimism is tempered only by the industrys continuing inability to advertise its unmentionable product Companies rely mainly on recommendations from counseling services and physicians word of mouth and some offbeat approaches  because they have little choice Despite a 1977 Supreme Court ruling that the advertising and display of contraceptive products are legal the television and print media refuse such ads almost unanimously They are cheered on by activist groups that are increasingly opposed not only to abortion but to contraception George Schweitzer vice president of communications for the CBS broadcasting group summed up the networks basic concern Contraceptive ads would be an intrusion on the moral and religious beliefs of many members of our audience During the sexual revolution of the 1960s and 70s condom makers advertised in the only medium available sexoriented magazines such as Penthouse The sex books push pleasure said Fred Poppe chairman of Poppe Tyson Inc an advertising agency for Trojans the brand that is the perennial market leader with a 55 percent share They rejected all our ads mentioning the diseaseprevention benefits of condoms Trojans is now part of CarterWallace a New Yorkbased maker of personal hygiene products which last October bought the former owner Youngs Drug Products Corporation More recently though condom makers have been buoyed by faint cracks in the solid wall of media opposition On her cable TV show Dr Ruth Westheimer pitches Lifestyle condoms from Ansell Inc an Australianowned company that is the largest American maker although most of its annual production is sold to the United States Agency for International Development for export to developing countries The Turner Broadcasting System has has run ads for several birth control products However Turner Broadcasting declined to run the Lifestyle ads Dr Ruth is a proponent of sex for pleasure and we did not want to be seen endorsing her views explained Jerry Hogan vice president for sales Condom companies have also enjoyed some success by experimenting with untraditional advertising approaches Last summer Schmid hired a plane to stream a banner reading Plan ahead with Ramses along the East and West Coast beaches This winter the company is running similarly worded ads for Ramses Extra on Atlanta billboards If we can sell in the Bible Belt we can sell anywhere reasoned Mr Klein The Mentor Corporation a Minneapolisbased maker of medical equipment recently placed ads for its new condom entry in Los Angeles magazine and its MinneapolisSt Paul counterpart and is talking to womens service magazines about similar placements Mentor packages its condoms in colorfully striped boxes that blend with feminine hygiene products That way women can toss them in their shopping bags at the drugstore along with douches tampons and other feminine products and not feel embarrassed said Thomas M Hauser Mentor executive vice president Marketing condoms to women is a wellestablished tactic in Britain Until four or five years ago we promoted a macho image But then all our research showed that it is usually women who make the decision about contraception said Michael Broadbridge a marketing manager for London International whose Durex brands account for 96 percent of Britains condom sales The 70yearold company which also owns Schmid Laboratories here advertises condoms in British womens magazines and national newspapers its surveys show that women account for around 35 percent of sales THE arrival of AIDS coincides with another boon for the condom makers  the epidemic of unplanned teenage pregnancies in the United States A recent study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute shows that unwed American teenagers produce children with far greater frequency than their counterparts in other Western industrial nations The reason is not any greater promiscuity on the part of American youth argues the study but the other nations greater willingness to introduce sex education into schools and to establish clinics where teenagers who are traditionally major condom users can obtain birth control advice and products Guttmacher and other organizations concerned with the unwanted pregnancy issue notably the Planned Parenthood Federation of America are trying to stem the tide Planned Parenthood counsels two to three million young people annually The Federation favors the pill for young women but encourages young men to use condoms as prevention against both pregnancy and disease Theres a lot of sexually transmitted disease among young people said Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood A recent Louis Harris poll for Planned Parenthood reported that 85 percent of the respondents thought sex education should be taught in schools Twothirds of the adults favored requiring public schools to establish links with family planning centers so that teenagers could obtain and learn about contraceptives The condom makers are eager to provide such a link Schmid for example doles out information to community boards contemplating sex education programs for their schools  The Harris study also showed that 78 percent of adult respondents believe TV should present messages about birth control as part of its programming Miss Wattleton was particularly incensed last year when the networks rejected a public service ad on birth control prepared by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists because it contained the word contraceptive It is outrageous that the TV networks which often show people engaged in sex will not accept contraceptive ads even on a public service basis Mr Schweitzer of CBS dissents We felt that amounted to advocacy for contraceptives he said Once ACOG agreed to remove the word then neither we nor the other networks had problems with the ad Growing public pressure over such issues is clearly telling on the networks They are accepting more pointed public service ads about public health and birth control Mr Schweitzer noted that CBS will devote 80 percent of its public service advertising to health information during the first part of 1986 Last year he said CBS donated time worth 200 million to public service advertising This years figure will be larger So even though the condom makers cannot advertise they plan to piggyback upon the public service TV ads Most such ads contain telephone numbers or addresses for viewers interested in more information With Planned Parenthood and ACOG encouraging people to use condoms if they engage in sex with multiple partners the manufacturers benefit Change is coming to newspapers at a slower pace According to Donald W Kurtz vice president of the Newspaper Advertising Bureau the vast majority of papers still do not accept condom advertising although a few are rethinking their policies because of AIDS It is no longer just a contraceptive matter its a health matter said Leonard R Harris Director of Corporate Communications at The New York Times which has long banned condom ads and despite a recent review of that policy continues to do so However Mr Harris suggests the policy is by no means engraved in stone The condom makers are responding to the health issue by playing up the prophylactic aspect in their marketing Several companies make forthright statements on their packages Most forthright is Ansells message for its MantoMan brand The condom when properly used effectively aids in preventing the transmission and contracting of sexual genital disease Ironically the condom makers most difficult sell ultimately may be the original customers Men When women began taking responsibility for birth control few men regretted shedding condoms Despite experiments with thinner latex bright colors and ribbing the product has not been improved enough to win favor with many males Moreover men are inclined to play down the health risk identifying AIDS with intravenous drug users recipients of donated blood and homosexuals Men tell you they arent infected so theres no reason for them to use a condom said a female marketing executive in San Francisco a city that claims a considerable number of bisexual men Yet they cant always know Something like AIDS can take years to show up IN JAPAN THE FAMILY FAVORITE TOKYO As in the United States condoms are sold mainly in drugstores here But they are such an accepted part of daily life that many Japanese buy them at supermarkets from street vending machines and even from doortodoor salesmen In a poll of married women conducted by a national newspaper two years ago 80 percent of the respondents cited the prophylactic as their families preferred contraceptive technique All other methods lagged far behind especially the pill which was cited by only 22 percent Birthcontrol pills are strictly regulated by the Government which is worried about their side effects and limits their use Japanese rely on physical measures rather than chemical measures for contraception said Masao Asakawa an executive at Okamoto Industries Japans leading condom manufacturer Production last year was 8064 million condoms worth 55 million at the wholesale level Figures on retail sales are closely guarded but they probably were 70 million to 80 million There are six manufacturers in Japan but 98 percent of the supply comes from three companies  Okamoto Fuji Latex and Sagami Rubber Industries All of them consider their products technologically superior to the American and European versions Since the 1960s they have produced condoms with a thickness of one onethousandth of an inch the American variety is twice as thick and in the Japanese view more uncomfortable Companies here emphasize this difference portraying their products as more sensual and appealing A televisionindustry code prohibits onair advertising for condoms so manufacturers use newspapers and magazines Packaging is important Okamotos condoms are sold in elegant boxes that look as if they might contain mints or cigarettes Still sales growth in the domestic market has stopped and the companies increasingly have looked overseas Last year Japan exported 230 million condoms or 29 percent of total production The United States however is largely out of bounds Takeshi Yonese an Okamoto executive said the Japanese condom is considered too thin failing to pass United States Government tests for durability

intellectual and political history seemed headed inexorably leftward and the conservative movement was caricatured not entirely unfairly as a collection of segregationists Babbitts and crackpot generals Mr Buckley had the temerity to uphold the cause of Toryism He and his magazine nurtured the movement helped it recover from the 1964 Goldwater debacle and gave it a rallying point and sounding board as it gradually gained the strength and respectability to win the Presidency Conservatism is far from the dominant intellectual force in the country today but neither is liberalism There is now a balance between the movements a permanent contest and Mr Buckley deserves credit for helping make it so It would have been exciting if Mr Buckleys various anniversaries had been commemorated by publication of a different book from this one which is mostly a collection of columns over the last seven years He reportedly knocks out his column in 20 minutes flat three times a week for 260 newspapers That is too little time for serious contemplation of difficult subjects Often he picks targets that are like fish in a barrel human rights hypocrisy at the United Nations Jimmy Carters rejection of any inordinate fear of Communism Marxism as a failed economic model advocacy of pederasty by a homosexualrights leader and of course evil doings of the men who run the Soviet Union He hits these every time but it would be more interesting to see him analyze why so many people in the world are hostile to the American system what we ought to do about dictators friendly to us who get in trouble with their own people how to cope with poverty what to think about homosexuality and whether the democratic West can prevail in protracted struggle with the determined Leninists in Moscow Mr Buckleys ethical system is deeply rooted in religion He opposes abortion and he defends the Moral Majoritys right to be heard but he is not a bookbanning New Right authoritarian determined to Christianize America In his youth Mr Buckley was or sounded arrogant strident and intolerant but nowadays he can afford to be gentle One of the best columns in this collection is a deft scolding of the AntiDefamation League of Bnai Brith for honoring Hugh Hefner of Playboy magazine by giving him a First Amendment Freedoms Award The racial toleration for which the AntiDefamation League strives he says rests on the idea of the sanctity of the individual  yes even that of the nubile girl  whereas Playboy subordinates anything and anyone to gratification of the male sexual impulse In the same column Mr Buckley says that racial tolerance is also based on the proposition that we are all brothers created equal by God Not all conservatives believe that but Mr Buckley indicates that he now shares Martin Luther King Jrs dream that white and black Americans would in due course mix as though differences in the color of their skins were irrelevant He turns this proposition smartly against Dr Kings wouldbe heir the Rev Jesse Jackson whom he accuses of an exuberant tribalism of trying to persuade blacks that their ethnic bond is the chain that binds them together above all other kinships which isnt good not for blacks not for America Mr Buckley believes in the equality of all mankind under God and before the law He also believes that all citizens should pay equal tax rates  specifically 25 percent He stoutly one might say devoutly believes that this will not only be good for the rich but also for the nonrich who will benefit from increased job opportunities There is no specific endorsement in this book of supplyside economics in all its aspects but Mr Buckley surely seems an implicit adherent of that movement To the supplysiders greatest political problem a profligate doubling of the national debt in just five years Mr Buckley has the same answers as Mr Reagan  deep domestic spending cuts and passage of a balancedbudget amendment to the Constitution Mr Buckley favors welfare shelter medical care and food assistance to the poor but not redistribution of wealth and not dependence on the state to uplift the underclass Mr Buckley believes in the old virtues hard work faith and selfreliance  and he finds great satisfaction in the fact that 30 percent of voters making under 5000 per year and 50 percent of those in the 500010000 bracket voted for Mr Reagan in 1984 I N foreign policy Mr Buckley is not one of the New Right conservatives who echoing Woodrow Wilson and John F Kennedys Inaugural want to do battle with Communist regimes because they are evil More than once he refers favorably to John Quincy Adamss statement in 1821 that America goes not abroad in search of monsters to destroy She is the wellwisher to the freedom and independence of all She is the champion and vindicator only of her own But neither is he an isolationist who wants to arm to the teeth but never fight Mr Buckley believes in intervention including declaring war to protect American interests He would have declared war on Iran though for tactical reasons not dropped any bombs when students seized hostages at the American Embassy He was delighted when the United States invaded Grenada He clearly wishes to do the same in Cuba any old day because it is a Soviet salient deep within the womb of territory putatively protected by the Monroe Doctrine Mr Buckley expresses disappointment that Mr Reagan hasnt been tougher on Moscow and Havana but he doesnt really blame the President It is he says because the Western spirit is weak There is a hint of deep pessimism here from a man whose experience and accomplishments should make him an optimist like the President And after all the victories conservatism has scored Mr Buckley still believes that the liberals have preempted the categories of public discussion Is the West too weak to prevail Are the liberals really still ahead Is William Buckley really a pessimist These are subjects for a serious book
WORST-CASE SCENARIOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/05/books/worstcase-scenarios.html,MOTHERS ON TRIAL The Battle for Children and Custody By Phyllis Chesler 651 pp New York McGrawHill Book Company 2295 NEARLY 15 years ago in Women and Madness Phyllis Chesler suggested that motherhood was a burden from which women needed to be freed In Mothers on Trial she describes it as a birthright for them to defend jealously This apparent change of heart coincides with changes in popular feminist priorities children have become as politically correct as careers It also reflects the harm done to women particularly older traditional homemakers by enlightened nonsexist familylaw reforms Women have been impoverished by nofault divorce and low shortterm alimony awards Now according to Phyllis Chesler courts are less likely to presume mothers make better parents and women are beginning to lose their children Fathers have traditionally owned their offspring as well as their wives but throughout most of this century sex roles and social ideals kept mothers and children together  where Phyllis Chesler believes they belong Today she charges the emergence of a New sensitive Male the fathers rights movement and antifeminist backlash are inspiring a spate of unjust paternal custody awards Mothers on Trial is a fiercely polemic indictment of this development With little hard statistical evidence to support her Phyllis Chesler relies on anecdotes case studies expert testimony and her own impassioned belief that paternal custodial challenges are witch hunts designed to enforce patriarchal codes of maternal behavior Beginning with a dramatic selective history of mothers and custody from 1600 to the present Mothers on Trial presents an impressive collection of horror stories about women who have been wrongfully deprived of their children The primary focus is on interviews the author conducted with 60 women who were challenged for custody between 1960 and 1981 She did not interview the fathers although she did talk to men involved in other custody disputes Readers will hear only one side of these very rancorous cases Still the mothers stories are believable and disturbing All had followed traditional paths of marriage and motherhood acting as their childrens primary care givers they had been what Phyllis Chesler calls good enough mothers by conventional standards The overwhelming majority of the women lost custody some to fathers who had been physically abusive delinquent in child support payments or guilty of kidnapping their children One of the most important factors in almost all of these cases was money fathers were better able to afford litigation and could offer more material comforts to their children Phyllis Chesler presents these as worstcase scenarios suggesting that gross abuses of justice occur only in a society that routinely tolerates lesser ones Whether her case studies are indeed indicative of a pervasive antimother bias or merely anomalous they do highlight double standards for male and female parents Mothers are forced to choose between custody of their children and selfdetermined lives with interests outside the home Fathers are allowed and expected to be absentee parents and those who sporadically engage in child care are considered heroic Supplementing her interviews with a sampling of other recent custody cases Phyllis Chesler makes clear that it is relatively easy for a man to be a good enough parent and nearly impossible for a woman Unfortunately she is not content to make this point alone or to make it in a way that will persuade readers who do not already share her views She has a penchant for stating her opinions as facts she doesnt argue so much as pronounce issuing proclamations about patriarchal oppression that some will applaud and others call strident Husband murder today is still treated as a form of regicide she states Unprovoked wife murder is still treated as the prerogative or sport of kings Her brief rhetorical discussions of such complex matters as abortion and reproductive technology are gratuitous Moreover although Mothers on Trial is heavily annotated with nearly 200 pages of footnotes it rests on some inadequately substantiated assertions To support her claim that the childs best interests have generally been equated in court with the fathers interest in custody Phyllis Chesler cites an excerpt from an article in the Harvard Womens Law Journal stating that the best interest standard is an unduly subjective one Her use of statistics is equally sloppy and misleading In the preface she states that one million fathers won legal custody between 1975 and 1985 she later reduces this figure to 400000 In neither instance does she offer a comparable estimate of the far greater number of women who won or retained custody during the same period Finally there is little hard information here about custody laws nationwide A survey of state law would have helped to define objectively the extent of a profather trend The author simply reports that twothirds of the states have rejected the maternal presumption as customary without noting whether they continue to use it at all or what they use in its stead M OTHERS ON TRIAL concludes with the muddled demand that women be granted automatically prior legal rights to custody Phyllis Chesler repeatedly complains that the maternal presumption was never interpreted as a maternal right confusing the concepts of rights and presumptions A presumption is essentially a rule for determining the burden of proof tipping the scales at trial She cites convincing arguments in favor of a maternal preference based on the likelihood that the mother has been responsible for primary child care but it is a great leap from this to a law mandating maternal custody What Phyllis Chesler proposes is a form of protectionism for mothers based on assumptions about their vulnerability as a class and most of all their superior capacity to rear and nurture children That women are by nature or social conditioning better parents as she asserts is a matter about which reasonable feminists may differ  not a fact of which a court may take judicial notice Littered with oversimplifications rhetorical conclusions and boldfaced textual headings Mothers on Trial is pop radical feminism It will engender some appropriate outrage at sexist social injustice without providing a reasoned credible analysis of its nature and scope Phyllis Chesler doesnt demand enough of her readers She settles for making them angry without necessarily making them think
"HART SIZES UP THE ISSUES, PERSONALITIES AND STRATEGIES OF '88",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/06/us/hart-sizes-up-the-issues-personalities-and-strategies-of-88.html,Senator Gary Hart has found splendid isolation in Troublesome Gulch in a turnofthecentury log and stone cabin on a dirt road that he says was once a stagecoach line between Evergreen and Denver But as much as he says he loves his new home in the Rocky Mountains he clearly has his eye on a betterknown address at 1600 Pennslyvania Avenue On Saturday Mr Hart announced that he will not run for reelection and instead will pursue the live option of seeking the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988 A few hours after making that announcement the 49yearold Senator invited a small group of reporters to his cabin to talk about his political plans With the fireplace crackling Mr Hart sat in a large leather chair an elk hide on the wall behind him and left little doubt that he would prefer to be seen as an outsider rather than a madeinWashington frontrunner Im better known that I was two years ago and thats about it the Senator who enjoyed unexpected success in the 1984 race said as one of his dogs Smokey sat down by him and yawned Doesnt Mind Respectability He does not expect this frontrunnership to hold up over the period of time he said and when the dust settles its going to look like a whole bunch of new people competing for the same job Mr Hart said he was not uncomfortable with the increasing attention being focused on him since Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts announced that he would not run for President in 1988 I dont mind the respectability he said I think it will give me an opportunity to get across a message or my views substantively on issues like military reform and foreign policy If there is a risk in being seen as the leader of the pack so early he added it is to be that visible that long and have nothing to say Mr Hart plans to have plenty to say between now and 1988 he said and looks forward to the coming political debate with a new generation of Democratic Presidential hopefuls Among those mentioned as his possible challengers for the nomination are Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware outgoing Governors Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Charles S Robb of Virginia and Governor Cuomo of New York Similarity of Messages With the exception of Mr Cuomo who is 53 years old the others are all in the 40s and are sounding political themes some consider strikingly similiar to Mr Harts I think the similarity of our messages remains to be seen said Mr Hart I havent yet heard what the message is Mr Hart said he would be spending the coming months refining and sharpening his own political views starting with a series of speeches he expects to deliver next spring on foreign policy One of them he said will deal with the appropriate use of military power He said none of the likely Presidential hopefuls in his own party have yet quite worked out our foreign policy and he added that no one including himself has yet defined the generational and attitudinal dynamics that will be at play in the 1988 In general he said his generation of Democratic leaders tend to be more marketoriented in economics and opposed to protectionist trade policies He said they are prochoice on social issues like abortion and have a new and different interest in defense that hasnt quite jelled yet Social Security at Issue Democrats Mr Hart said are still searching for a way to be prodefense without giving the Pentagon everything it wants On one sensitive issue the 1988 campaign is likely to see a major departure from the traditional Democratic Party line Mr Hart among other potential candidates has taken the position that new taxes and if necessary deferral of Social Security costofliving increases should be considered as part of any package to reduce the Federal budget deficit Asked about the need to broaden his own political base Mr Hart contended he would be as strong a candidate in the South and among blacks as any of the other Democrats One unknown factor is the plans of the civil rights leader Jesse Jackson who won strong support from other blacks in his race for the Democratic nomination in 1984 Senator Hart said he did not believe any white candidate can make a bloc appeal to minority voters in 1988 Black and Hispanic voters he added are becoming more diverse and less monolithic in their political attitudes and are listening for new voices who offer them something other than just cliches Of appealing to Southern blacks he said Its becoming a lot more subtle than just going into black churches in six Southern cities and saying civil rights civil rights Ill make that appeal as strong as anyone for I have the record to do so Where to Base Campaign Most likely he said he will locate his national campaign headquarters in nearby Denver It may make a great deal of sense to organize where I will be living when I leave the Senate he said The day is long past  and I think President Carter figured that out  when you have to run a national campaign out of Washington He acknowledged that such a move would be made partly for symbolic purposes but added that he has no intention of running an antiWashington campaign Mr Hart said he does not expect to see the kind of constituency group lineup of domino endorsements that occurred in 1984 I think a lot of people learned what can happen he added Mr Hart said his criticism of Walter F Mondale in 1984 for winning the endorsements of organized labor womens groups and others was misunderstood He said he had actively sought the support of these same groups and will do so again in 1988 if he runs The issue was whether you were willing to say what they wanted to hear to get their endorsements said Mr Hart The Senator said he still is not willing to pay that price for endorsements

U.S. MAY SEEK CURB ON MIRANDA RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/us/us-may-seek-curb-on-miranda-rule.html,The Justice Department is actively investigating ways to blunt the effects of the Supreme Courts 1966 Miranda decision requiring the police to inform criminal suspects of their constitutional rights before questioning or to overturn it department officials say In recent weeks they have said that the department was considering several options but that it had made no final decision on how or whether to attack the decision in Miranda v Arizona which Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d recently described as infamous and wrong The department one official said may file a brief with the Supreme Court asking the justices to overturn the earlier decision which came in a rape and kidnapping case involving Ernesto A Miranda Under another proposal the official said the department would attempt to enforce a 1968 Federal law designed by Congress to reverse some effects of the Miranda decision The law which has been largely ignored because of concern about its constitutionality permits use of voluntary confessions in Federal cases even if suspects are not advised of their rights before questioning Department Exploring Options Were looking at a wide variety of options said Stephen J Markman Assistant Attorney General for legal policy We are exploring whether or not there are alternative ways of protecting Fifth Amendment rights while at the same time interfering less with legitimate lawenforcement functions He would not discuss details of the departments proposed action The Miranda rule was based on the selfincrimination provisions of the Fifth Amendment to the Constitution which says no person shall be compelled in any criminal case to be a witness against himself Under the 1966 rule the police are prohibited from interrogating suspects in custody without first advising them of their right to remain silent and to have a lawyer present Any move to weaken or eliminate the rule would doubtless prompt a battle between the Justice Department and civil liberties groups which have long argued that the Miranda decision offers protection from coercive police tactics LawEnforcement Objections Statements obtained in violation of the Miranda rule are not admissible in court and that has angered many lawenforcement officials who say they have been forced by technicalities to abandon cases against dangerous criminals Mr Meese a former prosecutor is among the Miranda rules fiercest critics I think the idea that police cannot ask questions of the person who knows the most about the crime is an infamous decision he said last August I think if a person doesnt want to answer thats their right he added But youve had time after time all these ridiculous situations in which police are precluded from asking the one person who knows the most about the crime In recent months officials said Justice Department lawyers acting with the support of Mr Meese have begun reviewing the options for curbing use of the Miranda rule or eliminating it Change Seen as Unlikely Charles S Sims national staff counsel for the American Civil Liberties Union said he was not overly concerned about the departments recent efforts The Supreme Court has rejected the Governments approach in the past and we dont expect that its going to be particularly successful in the future he said I dont think that the Court will change the decision its taken on Miranda merely because Mr Meese wants to further his own personal agenda on the question Bruce Fein a former Justice Department official who remains close to top political appointees in the agency said he believed the department was planning a major attack on the Miranda rule He said Mr Meese might offer a brief to the Supreme Court asking a reversal of the decision The brief would be similar to one the Justice Department submitted earlier this year asking the court to overturn its 1973 ruling that legalized abortion More likely Mr Fein said is an attempt by the department to enforce the 1968 law which declared that confessions in Federal cases were valid if given voluntarily Failure of the police to recite the Miranda warning would be only one factor in deciding whether a confession was voluntary Because it appeared to be an attempt to reverse a constitutional ruling with legislation many lawyers have questioned the constitutionality of the statute which was part of the omnibus Crime Control Act of 1968 The provision has been largely ignored in the years since Mr Fein suggested that prosecutors might now attempt to enforce the law in a carefully selected case prompting a Supreme Court challenge that would allow the department to argue that it was attempting to uphold the will of Congress The justices have historically been reluctant to overturn an act of Congress even when the act was perceived as an attack on the Court My view is that tactically they are far better off to use the Crime Control Act because then they are vindicating a Congressional statute which they are obligated to enforce Mr Fein said They come to the Court not only with an executive branch imprimatur but with legislative support as well
Fetuses Grow Up,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/opinion/l-fetuses-grow-up-938486.html,To the Editor Logic is a necessary qualification for a head of state yet President Reagan appears sadly lacking in it On the one hand he passionately defends the right to life of an unborn fetus while on the other by opposing gun control even the registration of guns he disregards the right to life of a human being who is already out of the womb The incongruity is startling especially as hordes of people are amassing fortunes by the sale of guns Does it occur to Mr Reagan that a good percentage of those fetuses he is trying to save will be gunned down in later years TAMARA GEVA New York Dec 30 1985
LEGISLATIVE 'GOLD',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/nyregion/legislative-gold.html,Time and again in his State of the State Message today Governor Cuomo used phrases like I shall again propose I will once more ask I will again pursue And in the process he unintentionally underscored that a number of the messages key legislative proposals for 1986 were hardly new Many are leftover from past years programs the Governor has repeatedly failed to get approved by the Legislature and is now undertaking still another campaign to enact Once again among more than a dozen such issues the Governor called for passage of his housing program for New York City of an environmental bond issue of ways to control the rapidly rising costs of medical malpractice insurance And once again less than an hour after he spoke the State Senates Republican majority was already saying many of them would not be passed Mr Cuomo contends that all this is simply how the legislative process works that a bill sometimes has to be submitted for two or three or four years before lawmakers become sufficiently comfortable with the proposal to pass it The Gold Is That Deep Its like digging for legislative gold the Governor said this morning in an interview before his address You shovel for two days or three days because the gold is that deep You keep shoveling until you hit it But both Democrats and Republicans suggested today that the Governor had failed to win passage of some programs in part because he had not set priorities but had instead laid out sweeping legislative agendas without concentrating on one or two specific programs As an example they pointed to a special session of the Legislature that the Governor called last month to win passage of a medical malpractice insurance bill Instead of keeping the agenda then to that one issue he added five others thereby undercutting the focus of the session and diverting attention from the very issue he hoped to resolve Cuomo says everything is important said Gerald Benjamin a political science professor at the State University College at New Paltz who has studied the governorship But the political process cant accommodate that It has to focus on only a few things at a time Where does he want to focus Is it housing Is it the environment A Defining Issue My perception continued Professor Benjamin who is also the Republican majority leader of the Ulster County Legislature has been that he needs a defining issue or two substantial achievements that hes going to move toward over a period of time Otherwise what will be the mark of his administration Looking back what will these years have counted for Mr Cuomo defended his legislative record saying that more of his bills 69 percent  had won passage than those of any governor in 20 years But he added that the whole notion of success and failure is inappropriate Mr Cuomo said that he thought it was his responsibility as the Governor to take the lead in selling his administrations proposals but that the price was that evey failure was viewed as a personal defeat for him An Unfair Test If you were to spend a lot of time away from the chamber and leave it to your staff then nobody would ascribe success or failure to you he said Its an unfair test Repeatedly today both in the interview and the address Mr Cuomo refused to attribute the blocking of his legislative proposals to politics to the fact that he is a Democrat and the Senate is controlled by Republicans He pointed out that previous governors had sometimes had difficulty getting their bills passed even when their party controlled both houses of the Legislature although many of those issues that continued from year to year were emotional ones such as changes in divorce and abortion laws And throughout the day he was careful to be gracious about Republicans A Change in Style That is the style he has followed for much of his term as Governor Asked if perhaps it was time to change that style if perhaps more direct attacks on Republicans might break the long deadlock over key programs the Governor said There is a temptation to develop a whole new style but I dont believe that the confrontation style works In fact he is clearly uncomfortable in confrontations Ordering the Legislature to return last month and take up six of his bills was a confrontational act but once the legislators were here and the special session had begun Mr Cuomo backed off and softened his tone As its biggest weapon the Cuomo administration is counting on the fact that this is an election year and that Senate Republicans who hold the majority with only 35 seats out of 61 will be under strong pressure from specialinterest groups to pass some of his programs Do they really think they can run for reelecton by being an obstructionist Legislature the Governor asked But if the deadlock is to be broken later this session that certainly was not evident today Warren M Anderson the Senate majority leader said that there is nothing strikingly new in Mr Cuomos proposals and added This was not one of the Governors more distinguished efforts
Proper Interpretation Of the Constitution,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/opinion/proper-interpretation-of-the-constitution.html,Attorney General Edwin Meeses call last summer for a return to a jurisprudence of original intention has produced a sharp debate over how we should interpret the Constitution This debate will not end soon We have seen the problem of judicial activism before in our history but never with such reach into so many areas previously left to the political process On one side of the debate are those who argue with the Attorney General that any valid theory of constitutional adjudication must be rooted in the text as illuminated by the intentions of those who wrote proposed and ratified the Constitutions articles and amendments Among those subscribing to this view there are to be sure differences  mainly over how to interpret certain provisions such as the 14th Amendment Even so the issue is how to read the Constitution not whether to read it All who hold to this view agree that the text in all its parts should be taken seriously as a written document whose meaning can be discerned and applied today The other party in the debate argues to the contrary that a valid theory of constitutional adjudication cannot be grounded in the text as informed by original intention Some argue that it is impossible to know the intentions of the Framers of the Constitution Justice John Paul Stevens of the United States Supreme Court is even skeptical about whether one can speak intelligently about who the Framers were Others argue that even if original intention is knowable it need not be controlling today Not surprisingly those who reject a jurisprudence of original intention still admire judicial power And they attempt to root constitutional decisionmaking in sources other than the written text  including contemporary values ethical arguments the notion of moral evolution and the right of equal citizenship In our time these extratextual sources typically draw on political liberalism Examples illustrate the vast difference between these two approaches to constitutional adjudication In 1973 in Frontiero v Richardson a case involving sex discrimination four Supreme Court Justices argued that sex should be treated under the 14th Amendment as a classification as suspect as race Needless to say the Framers of that amendment did not contemplate sexual equality Yet had the four been able to collect a fifth vote the Court would have in effect enacted the Equal Rights Amendment Such a decision could not have been grounded in any recognizable jurisprudence of original intention and could only have reflected the Justices own moral beliefs Or consider capital punishment Justice William Brennan reaches outside the text itself and invokes the ideal of human dignity to say that the Eighth Amendment outlaws the death penalty For those who ground constitutional adjudication in the written Constitution however it is clear that no part of the text proscribes capital punishment These examples may suggest to some that a jurisprudence of original intention is politically conservative It isnt Indeed it is neither liberal nor conservative Many conservatives are for example against abortion but the Constitution does not contain within its four corners a right to life for the unborn Like equal rights for women and like the death penalty abortion is a matter that should be decided by the people through their legislatures The issue is not whether one is liberal or conservative but more fundamentally whether one believes in the Constitution as law  believes that it contains objectives and intelligible principles that constrain those who consent to it including and especially judges If the answer is that there are no such principles and that judges may fill the Constitution with their own beliefs and ideals we will cease to be a selfgoverning people and we will depend for our future on the wisdom or the lack of it of judges Whatever else may be said about original intention plainly it was not the intention of the Framers to make future generations of Americans dependent upon the unfettered and inevitably arbitrary wills of an elite few
TEXT OF CUOMO'S 4TH STATE OF STATE ADDRESS TO THE LEGISLATURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/09/nyregion/text-of-cuomo-s-4th-state-of-state-address-to-the-legislature.html,Following is a transcript of Governor Cuomos State of the State Address to the Legislature yesterday as recorded by The New York Times through the facilities of Channel 13 This is the fourth annual message Ive been privileged to deliver Its an appropriate time for an accounting to the people and I think a good time to look forward The last three years have been a time of achievement They cap a decade of recovery and move us now I think to the verge of a grand resurgence Little more than a decade ago with the greatest city in the world virtually bankrupt and the future of the entire state in jeopardy many of us sat in this chamber and heard the grim but realistic assessment by Governor Carey that the days of wine and roses were over Our population was down employment was down taxes imposed a crushing burden our infrastructure was crumbling Businesses fell over one another in the exodus Our time in the opinion of many had come and gone But many of us then led by Governor Carey saw it differently In the spirit that made this state great we looked at our troubles and saw them as challenges And we set about to restore our greatness Together we worked for more than 10 years to lift ourselves from that low point and we succeeded We rescued ourselves from fiscal devastation And then three years ago we took a firmer hold of our future and began to rebuild and renew our state And at that time I offered to work with you on a program of jobs and justice in a new intelligent partnership that would put aside superficial differences and make our only special interest the common good of the people of this state What we achieved since then has exceeded what some of us had hoped for And the election year will inevitably be a time for discussing those achievements a time for taking credit and a time for placing blame And in all likelihood some of us will take too much credit and some of us will place too much blame It is possible that I will not be exempt from that temptation But now when were still removed from the heat and rhetoric of campaigns let it be recorded for the months ahead that the credit for the good that we achieve does not belong to the Governor nor to one party nor even to the Legislature but to all of us together It was our common activity  upstaters and downstaters Democrats and Repubilcans  that enabled us to recover and to rebuild A thousand times a year for three years we rose above narrow partisanship to join in making laws that sheltered and educated people that reduced their tax burdens that made them safer on the street and in their homes and that expanded their opportunities We put aside polarizing and simplistic political poetry and we let the plain prose of governance of our laws and budgets describe a fresh new brand of governmental philosophy a New York philosophy that was at once aggressive and pragmatic a New York philosophy that binds common sense to compassion and demonstrates that government can have a head and a heart at the same time A Clear Philosphy What we New Yorkers believe our philosophy is clear from what weve done We believe in a freeenterprise system that produces what generations of immigrants came here for and what thousands of our New Yorkers still yearn for  a chance to earn their own bread with dignity We believe in a government working to provide opportunity for individual growth on an equitable and inclusive basis for all who are willing to use their own talents We believe in a government that cooperates with the private sector unleashing the natural initiative and power of our people a government that helps put people to work and encourages their progress without despising their success or condemning their profits a government that contributes to the capacity and wealth of our state by providing the physical infrastructure thats needed and by helping to cultivate the human resources that are the essence of all progress We believe that all who can work should work but we believe that those of us who have succeeded should contribute reasonably to those who because they are too old or too frail or otherwise impeded have not been able to provide for themselves in the freeenterprise system We are not afraid to be called compassionate But we believe that any system of public welfare that discourages employment and encourages dependence on government subsidy from generation to generation is not compassionate but callous Now of course in the year ahead there will be questions that will divide us and that will define our differences and that is as it should be But it would be a mistake for us to magnify unnecessarily those differences to draw arbitrary lines in the sand for attempted political advantage to diverge now from a course that has proven so successful over the last three years We should continue instead to operate on the proven premise that the very best government will also be the very best politics Gains Are Listed Now consider how much we have achieved together over the last three years that way 894000 more people at work today than in 1982 an unemployment rate under the national average our streets and homes and businesses safer with serious reported crime down 13 percent the first budget in New Yorks history balanced according to generally accepted accounting principles And if we will adopt the budget I will propose next week we will reduce taxes this year by over 1 billion Thats what we agreed to do together last year At the same time we provided more help for the mentally ill and retarded for those grown too old to help themselves and those not yet old enough And together we made our childrens future more secure by investing generously and wisely in schools and computers and books And all of us are safer on our highways because we enacted new tough drunkdriving laws and a 21yearold purchase age for alcohol And together we produced a massive rebuilding of our roads and bridges and airports and centers of advanced technology and hightech incubators that are beginning to generate a whole new industry of opportunity And dramatic assistance to agriculture  an entire community added to the North Country at Fort Drum Together we produced the first acidrain law in the nation the first seatbelt law the first homeless program Our population is up our credit ratings are up And on and on and on  all accomplished together as a family Tax Victory Claimed We were able to achieve another singular victory because we stood together as a state We stood up when no one else would against the radical illconceived proposal to end deductibility of state and local taxes Our middle class  those of us who are not poor enough to be on welfare nor rich enough to be free of worry  our middle class would have borne the brunt of this attack on our history and our constitutional right as a state And we ignored those who said we could not win and we refused to allow our political labels to divide us With the interest of New Yorkers as their only concern Warren Anderson spoke against the idea and locked arms with Stanley Fink and Fred Orenstein joined with Clarence Rappelyea and John Marchi and Jerry Kremer and Ned Regan and Bob Abrams and Pat Moynihan and Al DAmato and members of our Congressional delegation Tom Downey and Ray McGrath and Charlie Rangel from both sides of the aisle And I was privileged to be Governor of a state whose leaders all of them spoke with one voice in favor of federalism in favor of fairness and spoke so insistently and persuasively that the whole nation listened and agreed We won a victory which a year ago practically no one outside of New York thought possible And I tell you that this experience is a vivid illustration of the immense power of this state when all of us work toward a common objective And it should be to us a source of encouragement perhaps even inspiration but not a reason for complacency First because the battle to preserve federalism is not yet over This historic struggle against double taxation now moves into the United States Senate And beyond that because serious problems remain to be dealt with in this state For all the affluence and all the power evident in the Empire State there persists an intolerable amount of deprivation even despair And its no consolation that many parts of the nation share this pain Many of us are doing better than ever but the stark truth is we have more poor and more homeless than at any time since the Great Depression Too many of our people especially minority men and women are denied employment And perhaps our worst and most dangerous failure is the new lost generation of children among us One of every two minority children are born to poverty  and one out of every five children overall The dropout rate for minority youth in high schools is appalling Every year thousands of children are born to other children under circumstances that make their chance of success in this society a tragic improbability And if we you and I look the other way as a generation of children born and raised in poverty surrounded by drugs and despair is denied adequate education and employment none of us will escape the trouble and the pain that will come Both love and selfinterest demand that we do more New Job Program Now none of this nor all of it taken together should intimidate us Our success in recent years proves our capacity to meet hard challenges and we will meet them if we continue on the course that weve set for ourselves over the last three years The agenda I propose is set out in detail in the full message before you Its complete its practical and it is emminently achievable Let me for now just highlight some of its many features in the time thats allowed us this afternoon Now since my inauguration Ive pointed out that one of the most productive things government can do is to provide our people worthwhile jobs in the private sector Weve made especially good progess in these last three years In November of 1985 last November there were 8 million New Yorkers at work more than any time in our history And today New York generates one in every five new jobs nationwide This year we should concentrate our efforts on expanding these opportunities Under our director of economic development Vincent Tese weve provided a comprehensive longrange plan for doing that In selected communities with acute needs  places like Buffalo Oneida Elmira Ogdensburg Mount Vernon Brooklyn Hempstead  I will ask you to create New York opportunity zones Now in these zones the state will offer financial help energy training and tax incentives for new and expanding firms that employ area residents Communities considered for designation as opportunity zones will be asked to contribute themselves contribute appropriate selfhelp initiatives like day care and security services Now these opportunity zones will provide incentives and produce jobs where we need them most  in the areas that have not enjoyed the full benefit of our economic recovery But unlike the socalled Federal enterprise zone our opportunity zones will not relax public health and safety rules or force people to work for less than the minimum wage Our New York opportunity zones will help end misery and not write it into law Welfare and Work We should also make opportunity a more integral part of our system of welfare This state has never shirked its obligation to provide for the needy and never will But a system which doles out money without helping people to help themselves is more cruel than it is kind And no one knows that better than the men women and children who are on welfare Work is better than welfare I believe we can do a better job of ensuring that public assistance programs lead to work instead of to prolonged dependency We should insist on measuring the ability of people on welfare to work in the private sector And for those applicants who are employable we should conduct a real effective job search We will encouarge businesses to hire and train public assistance recipients for real jobs in exchange for wage subsidies from the state and we will expand affordable daycare programs The intolerable dropout rate among our high school students can be attributed in part at least to their feeling that their efforts in school will not be rewarded with a good job after graduation They need to believe in a future worth struggling for And so I propose we work toward providing a guarantee that every high school graduate will have a job in the private sector or an opportunity for a college degree Organized labor and our business community are already at work developing at my request an act of partnership with our state government that will start us toward that objective by creating specific links between individual students and clearly identified jobs in the private sector Now our education system is a vital part of our opportunity arsenal and we have done much for it over these last three years We must do more We have the best teachers in the United States This year because they are the best we must see that the people whom we ask to instruct and motivate our children are paid something closer to their special worth I propose we allocate funds on a need basis to school districts across the state with emphasis on entrylevel salaries I will propose we continue the development of high schools of excellence and that we establish this years scholarships of excellence at 2000 each for 1000 of our most able graduates The third year of our computer program will be provided for in the budget proposal Ill give you next week And I reaffirm now my goal that by the year 2000 every child in this state will have the full opportunity to become computer literate Help for Families Part of our education process must be devoted to helping those who are not in school Many times these are young people who are leading lives of confusion that can become lives of despair And no problem we face is more tragic than the syndrome of children having children I will request additional resources for new avenues to dignity Our program for adolescent support and pregnancy prevention Now we can do many things to give our young people our young men and women a better chance to use their gift of life with more wisdom and reverence But one thing is most clear there is ample proof that preventive family planning services can avoid thousands of unwanted pregnancies and consequent abortions Therefore I will ask for an expansion of our help for family planning services bringing our annual commitment to this important work to 10 million this year And in order to give our children a healthy start I will propose an increase in support for prenatal care as well as for the state nutrition assistance program Now comprehensive economic development welfare reform and the encouragement assistance and education our young people deserve  all of these will contribute to more jobs and a more competitive New York But there will be no real continuing growth in jobs without adequate and affordable energy Now this is an area so vital to the public interest that the state a long time ago intervened directly becoming both a public producer of energy and establishing a commission to regulate private utilities I believe in public power The Assembly majority led by Speaker Fink has supported it for a long time The State Power Authority works well in the energy marketplace complementing investorowned utilities And Im pleased that Senator Anderson has agreed that the possibility of more public power especially on Long Island is worth pursuing In fact our own study of the matter is well advanced but I will immediately appoint privatesector experts to supplement that investigation and help us determine with precision the feasibility of establishing public power facilities on Long Island or elsewhere and I will ask them to report as soon as possible certainly well before the end of this session so that we will have a chance if it is practical to do something this year More Hydropower Hydropower is one of the most valuable natural resources that we have It is cleaner cheaper and a safer source of energy So I will continue to work to bring more hydropower from Canada into our state especially to southeastern New York Reallocation of existing lowcost hydropower from upstate to downstate is another question I understand the eagerness of the downstaters to share this cheaper power But even substantial reallocation would produce only minimal help downstate while it would be devastating upstate I will oppose reallocation as I have in the past I do this in order to protect the industries of western New York  in the North Country especially it is wiser and fairer to seek new sources of cheaper energy for downstate homes and businesses Now our attention to jobs and the strength that economic development gives us would be incomplete without careful consideration of one of our largest our oldest and our most productive industries  agriculture Agriculture and the family farm are vital to New Yorks economy I will recommend expansion of the Agricultural Research and Development Program I will also ask the Job Development Authority to recapitalize its Rural Development Loan Fund making cheaper credit available to agriculture By now after three years of this term and most of this message it should be clear that I believe deeply that our future like our past will be created mostly by the labor of our own hands and minds in the private sector through jobs and the freedom and dignity that they bring us Its just as clear however that there are people who are not reached by that system And where free enterprise fails intelligent government must begin Shelter for Homeless Today people are threatened with freezing to death because they have no shelter  here in New York and all across the nation  because there is not enough housing It is as simple and as wrong as that And the problem cannot be solved without government help and it cannot be solved without our help This state  and this Legislature I am proud to say  have acted more aggressively and effectively than any other in the Union to provide shelter and care for thousands of homeless men women and children But now we need to do more I will propose an additional allocation to the Homeless Housing Assistance Program of 20 million an amount Im sure will be spent with the blessing of every New Yorker fortunate enough to have a roof overhead and a meal to eat In addition I wish to announce what I believe to be a unique initiative to help homeless families Beginning in New York City where the problem of homelessness is most prevalent and together with Mayor Koch we will bring together government and the private sector to provide shelter social services and a transition into permanent residence and community living for thousands of families This will bring hope to these families and end the welfare hotel ripoff Support services the essential support services will be made to accompany the housing and the housing will be built by the private sector My full message to you spells out a comprehensive Housing New York plan that I believe deals fairly and effectively with all parts of the state and all aspects of the problem and I ask for your full cooperation in achieving it Improved Contracts You know that we cannot afford to waste public funds not for housing or for any public purpose The Wicks Law was passed generations ago to keep down construction costs But the evidence indicates it does just the opposite it drives costs up If government is to be respected it must admit its mistakes and correct them The Wicks Law in its present absolute form is a mistake I ask you to replace it with more flexible and intelligent contract options that will assure quality that will assure economy and compliance with prevailing wage requirements There is another area where the freeenterprise system needs the help of goverment to meet our mutual obligations The nearly 18 million New Yorkers who share the 50000 square miles of the Empire State look to us for the protection and renewal of our common environment our earth and water and air the beauty and the natural bounty that were blessed with I am proposing this year a 145 billion environmental bond act It will be the largest in the history of the State of New York and it will allow us to remediate hazardous waste sites throughout the state to acquire new public lands to promote historic preservation and to enhance our urban parks One of our greatest treasures is the Adirondacks Thats a region that will be kept more secure if its complex web of life is better appreciated by those who visit there And so I will recommend that we establish an extensive educational and interpretive center at Paul Smiths College and satellite visitors facilities at the parks major gateways Praise for Courts No institution is more important to us than our system of justice We are proud that our new Chief Judge Sol Wachtler has so quickly established himself as a leader among the great jurists of the land Im grateful to him I look forward to working closely with the Chief Judge to improve the administration of our courts and finally this year to achieve first passage of a constitutional amendment merging the states trial courts into a single coherent and unified system One situation does need further study and should have been dealt with long before now As long as men and women who are damaged wrongfully by toxic substances are denied the fundamental right to have their cases heard before the courts of this state we cannot say we have done all the justice that we should do We must have a toxic torts bill this year One reason our system of justice has reached a new level of excellence and effectiveness in these last three years is the extraordinary success of our Director of Criminal Justice Larry Kurlander This year he will lead our efforts to continue to strengthen the Organized Crime Task Force under Ron Goldstock to enact stricter penalties for drug dealers particularly those to peddle drugs to children  and to obtain a lifewithoutparole bill and to continue our support of police and prosecutors statewide As a continuing expression of my commitment to the state police and my desire to keep this the most effective force of its kind in the nation I will ask you to increase the uniform police by 200 troopers giving them the strength they need to serve the entire state Health Problems We must complete our work on medical malpractice insurance and deal with the problems of obtaining affordable liability insurance in other areas Our elderly population grows larger every year and for all that we have done many are not yet adequately provided for  nor are all of our disabled Our healthcare system and particularly its reimbursement methods are undergoing fundamental reform and redirection We must guide that development now And we will continue to increase community care for the mentally retarded and to reconfigure the residential services for the mentally ill The battle against the killer AIDS must be continued I will propose that we double our efforts this year We must expand our openmeetings law with respect to local governments And we must keep alive our deep commitment to human and civil rights especially by speaking out in a substantial and effective way against the ugly sin of apartheid by refusing to deal with businesses that accept an inhumanity we cannot abide And this year we must face the profound the perplexing the spiritually punishing questions of how to define lifes end and under what circumstances to allow the end of life Now each of these matters is addressed in the message I have delivered to you today All of this and more And with all of its pieces the actions I describe in this message will allow us to use the extraordinary achievements of the last three years as a platform from which to launch a whole new era of progress to bring us closer to a good job for everyone whos able to work expanded opportunities for those grown weak and those who have not yet been given the chance to grow strong a more secure future for our children a cleaner environment a firmer grasp on the fundamental values of life that show New Yorkers to be a specially civilized people And we know we can do it because we have done it before Call for Action Our Statue of Liberty whose centennial we celebrate this year reminds us of that As the layers of the years are chipped away from her handsome features we will see her more clearly and we will be reminded more vividly of the teeming masses yearning to breathe free of the tired the poor the wretched and the homeless people whose names we bear whose memories we reverence and whose deeds ought to inspire us for they were a people who overcame fear and prejudice and ignorance people who began in slavery or in steerage who through their courage and their love took the richness of the liberty and opportunity they found here and left us their heirs with more than they ever dreamed of Remembering that how can we do less than this agenda that I have proposed to you today We can do all of this and more for all of it is tied together by two endearing truths  the reality of our problems of course but the enormity of our capacity when we come together as a family should and bring to bear all the wisdom and all the compassion and all the power of this great place that we call the Empire State I thank you for the privilege of being able to address you in each of these four years I thank you for the good work youve done that has benefited the whole family of New York so much And I pledge to you the fullest uses of my mind and heart in making this fourth year of my term the most fulfilling Thank you and God bless you
NEW GROUP SEEKS STRATEGIES FOR CURBING TEEN PRE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/nyregion/new-group-seeks-strategies-for-curbing-teen-pre.html,DOCTORS politicians and social service providers from throughout Connecticut are trying to tell people that thousands of teenagers are having babies in all kinds of communities and that Connecticut can do something about the problem Armed with studies and stories about the matter a new Teen Pregnancy Prevention Council created by the state legislature has begun a twoyear effort to set a longterm strategy for the state to cut down on teenage pregnancy Each year more than 9000 Connecticut teenagers from cities and suburbs alike get pregnant accounting for more than 15 percent of all pregnancies This issue goes to the core of social policy in this country said the councils chairman Edward Keane who has organized teenage pregnancy prevention programs in Bridgeport This group is key The issue has to come out into the open The council  which includes state representatives and officials of hospitals government departments and agencies such as Planned Parenthood  considered at one of its first meetings this month organizing public forums throughout the state in 1986 The purpose of the forums would be to publicize individual teenage mothers stories as well as those of agencies trying to deal with the problem Meanwhile State Representative Mary M Mushinsky a Wallingford Democrat who first sought to make teenage pregnancy a prominent issue in the legislature plans to reintroduce some bills defeated last session that proposed preventative steps They include mandatory family life education and health clinics for teenagers in public schools Those and other proposals resulted from a task force Miss Mushinsky formed last year in which both proabortion and righttolife advocates worked together on the matter A state legislator in Wisconsin borrowed Miss Mushinskys idea of uniting proabortion and righttolife advocates to prepare a package of bills that passed that states legislature this fall The issue has caused growing concern elsewhere too A November Harris Poll showed 84 percent of Americans considering it a serious national problem A cover story in the Dec 9 issue of Time magazine declared that teen pregnancies are corroding Americas social fabric Its going to become one of the two or three biggest issues in Connecticut said a council member Dr Victor Strasburger director of Adolescent Medicine at Bridgeport Hospital We as a group have to educate people about the issues  that it is economic that it is preventable that sex education doesnt tell kids to have sex He and Miss Mushinsky agreed that the issue was becoming more prominent because of its increasing expense to the public More than half of the women in the state receiving Aid to Families with Dependent Children had their first child in their teens Last December alone benefits for these women and their children cost the state an estimated 5 million More than half of the Connecticut teenagers who become pregnant have abortions according to a report issued by Miss Mushinskys task force Some kids who experiment in high schools have had two or three before they graduate Miss Mushinsky said Council members identify various causes for the high number of teenage pregnancies including the breakdown of the family the depiction of sex by the media and a lack of both readily available birth control and important information Every message in the media tells kids Have sex now Sex is adult Whats wrong with you if youre not doing it  Dr Strasburger said A 10minute film strip in the schools on menstruation doesnt do much Sex is the one thing youre supposed to come out of high school knowing nothing about He pointed to a recent study by the nonprofit New York Citybased Alan Guttmacher Institute It showed that the United States has the highest teenage pregnancy rate among industrialized nations many of which dispense contraception and sex education more openly despite the fact that American teenagers are not more sexually active The task force also identifies unemployment as a cause Twenty percent of pregnant teenagers interviewed said they intentionally had children because they saw no future career The General Assembly responded to that finding earlier this year by passing a bill to use Federal job training funds to reach at risk teenagers and teenage parents Another task force proposal that passed into law enables teenage parents who earn 120 percent of the poverty level to remain eligible for Medicaid A more controversial proposal which lost by 26 votes would have set up the family life education courses Under the proposal all Connecticut communities would elect locally run organizations to set up curriculums in the schools including grade schools on pregnancy and related issues such as birth control Members of the new state council many of whom served on last years task force agreed at a meeting in Hartford earlier this month that they needed to build more support for the idea before it could pass into law State Representative Norma Leone Cappelletti a Waterbury Republican reported on the reaction of a local board of education They said Forget it Thats sex education Youre showing teenaged children how to have sexual intercourse  The new council includes officials from the State Departments of Children and Youth Services Health and Human Services and Human Resources and the Office of Policy and Management While advocates from both sides of the abortion issue are again represented this new council is designed more to put the findings of last years task force into practice Miss Mushinsky said I found that the state policy on teen pregnancy prevention was in real disarray she said The agencies werent always on the same wavelength A council member Susan Bucknell of the Office of Policy and Management said state agencies had begun coordinating their approaches to teenage pregnancy The Health and Human Services Department and the Education Department for instance are already talking to each other about similar programs they run to help teenage parents she said The new council she said will play a useful role in building public support for such efforts
"THE MORMONS; GROWTH, PROSPERITY AND CONTROVERSY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/magazine/the-mormons-growth-prosperity-and-controversy.html,LIGHT SNOW AND HAIL FELL AS MORE than 6000 mourners crowded into a cavernous gilded church in Salt Lake City on a chilly Saturday in early November Outside thousands of others stood in the cold trying to share a moment of history with those inside As the 325 voices of the Mormon Tabernacle Choir filled the church thousands perhaps millions of other Mormons across the country and in Canada participated vicariously in the funeral rites for their patriarchal leader via satelliterelayed television and radio broadcasts Spencer Woolley Kimball prophet seer revelator and President of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints  the Mormons  was eulogized as a noble example of what the Lord expects of all of us The following day in accordance with church tradition the man who spoke those words Ezra Taft Benson the senior member of the Council of the Twelve Apostles which rules the church was elected Kimballs successor Benson a political conservative whose name became familiar during the 1950s when he was Secretary of Agriculture under President Eisenhower inherited absolute authority over a unique American institution A century ago the Mormon church was a small persecuted religious cult whose leaders were being hunted down by Federal marshals as illegal polygamists It is now the fastestgrowing church among the major denominations in the United States and one of the richest From a largely rural sect with roots in the American frontier Mormonism has become a predominantly urban faith controlled by an expanding bureaucracy in Salt Lake City with a highly successful program of proselytism that has attracted converts in more than 96 countries The church owns insurance companies department stores television and radio stations office towers hotels industrial parks orange groves foodprocessing plants hundreds of thousands of acres of productive farmland from Florida to Washington State and other temporal assets worth billions of dollars box page 38 With less than 2 percent of the nations population the church exercises political and social influence far beyond its numbers  an influence that for the most part is Republican and conservative Growing at a rate of almost 6 percent a year the church is likely to become even more influential in the future The Mormons birth rate is almost twice the national average And each day almost 30000 bicycleriding darksuited young missionaries go to work around the world in an effort to recruit more members spreading a gospel they point out that is Christian but not Protestant As Benson took charge of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints it was an organization experiencing rapid growth great temporal prosperity based on the fact that to remain in good standing Mormons must pay 10 percent of their income to the church and growing political influence But it was also strangely haunted by its own history and caught inexplicably in the middle of a murder mystery The victims were two Mormons involved in a thriving commerce in the sale of documents from the churchs early days There have been no arrests but if nothing else the police investigation has revealed the churchs hierarchy to be obsessed with stopping any tampering with the churchs official account of its past HE CHURCH OF JESUS CHRIST OF Latterday Saints is a native American religion It is one of a handful of faiths like Christian Science Jehovahs Witnesses and SeventhDay Adventists that managed to survive a period of great religious ferment on the 19thcentury frontier an era that produced hundreds of sects that diverged from mainstream Christianity The Mormons claim to be Gods only true church created at His direction in 1830 by Joseph Smith Jr an upstate New York farm boy centuries after the Protestant Reformation Many Americans know of the Mormons mostly because of a few members the singing Osmond family former Presidential candidate George Romney the Marriott family of hotelkeepers or Peter Vidmar the goldmedalwinning Olympic gymnast But driven by a will to succeed that is part and parcel of their religion Mormons are rising to prominence throughout the country Mark H Willes recently appointed president of the General Mills Corporation is a Mormon so is David P Gardner president of the University of California Bruce Christensen president of the Public Broadcasting Service Nolan D Archibald chief operating officer of the Beatrice Foods Company and Dr William C DeVries the surgeon who implanted the first mechanical heart Under President Reagan Mormons have become more influential in Washington David Fischer the Presidents longtime personal assistant is a Mormon as are Rex E Lee the former United States Solicitor General and Richard Wirthlin Mr Reagans political adviser and poll taker One of Utahs two Republican Senators Orrin G Hatch has played a major role in an effort to reshape the Federal judiciary by appointing judges with more conservative views The other Jake Garn was the first Congressman to go into space Both are Mormons The Central Intelligence Agency recruits heavily among young Mormons returning from missionary work abroad because of their experience overseas their ability to speak foreign languages their strict morality and conservative outlook Mormons also show up in large numbers in the Federal Bureau of Investigation When their leaders ask them to do something Mormons respond forcefully Last January members were asked to fast for a day and contribute the money saved to victims of the Ethiopian famine A week later they contributed more than 6 million Four years earlier church leaders asked members to help defeat the proposed Federal equal rights amendment Largely because of pressure brought by Mormons in states that had not yet ratified the amendment the measure was stopped in 1982 When he died on Nov 5 at the age of 90 Spencer Kimball had presided over the church for almost 12 years Like most top Mormon elders he had risen to power after a successful business career Although he was seriously ill and little more than the titular head of the church in the last four years of his life the former insurance man presided over the church during a period of phenomenal growth Worldwide membership jumped 75 percent during his tenure to more than 58 million including about 2 million overseas New temples were opened in South Africa Tonga Tahiti the Philippines Guatemala Japan Brazil East Germany Mexico Australia and a dozen other countries The temples have attracted attention not only because local people tend to view Mormons with suspicion but because of the buildings stunning architecture A few of them bear a resemblance to the Salt Lake City temple with its six Gothic towers but many are strikingly contemporary with tall sharply pointed steeples that provide an almost unworldly aura During his tenure Kimball demonstrated that the church could still be as pragmatic as it had been in 1890 That year one of his predecessors as the churchs prophet declaring that he had been instructed to do so by divine revelation banned the practice of polygamy A law prohibiting plural marriages as Mormons call the practice had been passed by Congress and upheld by the Supreme Court Barring polygamy was the price demanded by Washington for Utahs admission to statehood and the church leaders complied abolishing one of the foundations of early Mormon doctrine On June 9 1978 Kimball said God had revealed to him that black males formerly excluded because they carried the curse of Cain should be given full status in the church The decision not only improved the churchs public standing at a time of growing criticism in the aftermath of the 1960s civil rights movement it also opened the way for expanded missionary work in Africa and Latin America RISING 28 STORIES THE OFFICE BUILDING OF the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints in Salt Lake City is the tallest building in Utah Its top floors look down on the dome of the State Capitol less than a mile away Brigham Young brought members of the church to the Salt Lake Valley in 1847 His legacy is a state that is the closest thing to a theocracy America has produced Seventy percent of Utahs residents are Mormons and the church dominates its political social and business life From the skyscraper overlooking the city and the nearby Wasatch Mountains hundreds of Mormon bureaucrats manage farflung ecclesiastical and economic enterprises Nearby on Temple Square are the piercing Gothic spires of the mother temple and the domed Mormon Tabernacle where each Sunday morning the famous choir performs on a nationally broadcast radio program Almost lost amid this architecture is a more modest 75yearold building where the senior elders of the church exercise absolute authority over the Mormon flock At the top of the theocracy is Benson 86 who as the president prophet seer and revelator is said to speak with the word of God Next in line are two presidential counselors who share with Benson the office of the First Presidency Gordon B Hinckley 75 who runs the church on a daytoday basis and Thomas S Monson 58 a former publisher of the churchowned Salt Lake City newspaper The Deseret News The next tier is the Council of the Twelve Apostles followed by the First Quorum of the Seventy Collectively all are known as the General Authorities of the church Recently two of the apostles greeted a visitor in a woodpaneled office in the administration building The visit came at a difficult time for the church Documents from its earliest days which some viewed as a kind of Mormon Dead Sea Scrolls had surfaced and seemed to place in doubt some of the churchs fundamental teachings Worse two Mormons involved in the search for such documents had been murdered and a third narrowly escaped death Moreover Mormons were under increasingly bitter attack from Southern Baptists and Christian evangelical sects who view the church as competitors and unChristian Thousands of people each month were being shown a movie produced by exMormons called The God Makers that assailed the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints as one of the most dangerous and deceptive groups in the world The film depicts it as a rich cult that dabbles in pagan practices and the occult distorts its history brainwashes its members subjugates its female members and bases its beliefs on scripture that is a fairy tale just like Alice in Wonderland In Israel Orthodox Jews have rioted over efforts by the church to expand a Brigham Young University study center in Jerusalem which they view as a beachhead from which the Mormons plan to launch a massive effort to convert Jews When they received their visitor the apostles Neal A Maxwell 59 a former executive vice president of the University of Utah and Boyd K Packer 61 a trustee of the churchs Brigham Young University were dressed in dark business suits like those worn by their young missionaries The Mormons they said had been accustomed to criticism by outsiders since their earliest days After decades of being quiescent antiMormon feelings were now on the rise Maxwell said But it was to be expected he added because Mormon dogma diverges so much from conventional Christian thought Its hard to be noticed on a pastel landscape he said If we were nonsmoking humanists nobody would pay any attention to us I F THERE IS AN AMERica that embodies the vision that Ronald Reagan has for his country  a nation of pious striving selfreliant and politically conservative traditional families where men work hard at their jobs and women work hard in the home raising their children it is in Mormon country Mormonism is more than simply a religion that serves as broker between man and God In the lives of its members Mormonism is a pervasive spiritual and social presence It not only promises members an afterlife but also envelops them in an earthly womb that includes emphasis on strong families stable marriages and a close community working together to achieve material success Mormonism says Peggy Fletcher publisher of Sunstone a journal of liberal Mormon thought that is not connected to the church is unambiguous simple and straightforward when life is full of ambiguity and chaos In return the church demands conformity and obedience It is not a democracy It expects members to have large families  typically four children often six or eight Members may not smoke or drink alcohol coffee tea or even soft drinks containing caffeine The church tells them how to dress how they should cut their hair and what their sexual practices should be A church founded by men who took multiple wives and according to some historical accounts sometimes persuaded women to submit to them sexually with the promise of eternal salvation is now one of the most puritanical In Mormon theology says a pamphlet explaining the churchs precepts adultery is next to murder in gravity For a devout Mormon family life is a constant round of social and religious meetings all with the purpose one way or another of helping members get to heaven According to Mormon doctrine Jesus will someday return to rule the earth When He does He will turn for help to members of His only true church All humans will be resurrected physically and joined with their spirits if found worthy they may also be reunited with their families Everyone will be admitted to one of three heavenly kingdoms but only the most worthy will be eligible for the highest of these kingdoms Some will become godlike and redeem other planets just as thousands of years ago Jesus was sent to earth to become its Redeemer From early childhood Mormons are warned to prepare for the millennium to achieve perfection in their lives to follow the Ten Commandments and to obey unquestioningly the churchs teachings and the words of the current prophet seer and revelator At the age of 12 males in good standing are eligible for ordination into the priesthood As long as they remain worthy they have the authority to act in the name of God and participate in the rituals of the church Females are excluded from the priesthood but can enter heaven if they have led exemplary lives They cannot reach the highest of the celestial kingdoms however unless both they and their husbands are judged worthy Any member who violates church directives on doctrine morality or life style who challenges the word of the hierarchy who declines to pay 10 percent of his income to the church or otherwise fails to pass muster in the eyes of his local lay bishop faces serious ecclesiastical consquences The bishop can deprive him of a temple recommend the right to enter the temple where Mormons must go if they are to complete the rites necessary to insure for themselves their families and their ancestors a place in heaven Sunday services at a Mormon church do not vary a great deal from any Christian denomination the weekly sermon might include a few words from a lay bishop or congregation member about the importance of living a good life and there are hymns and a communion service But the rituals that are held at the temples  which contain clusters of elaborately decorated rooms including some meant to remind members of heaven  are a unique part of Mormonism Some of these rituals are similar to rites of the Masonic Lodge to which many of the early Mormons belonged Mormons in good standing visit their temple normally on any day except Sunday to be married in a complex ceremony in which they are said to be sealed for time and all eternity and to participate in what the church calls vicarious work on behalf of the dead In these rites they act as standins for ancestors during baptisms and marriages so that these people may have the same chance of an eternal life as do living Mormons To help members identify their ancestors the church operates the largest and most comprehensive genealogical library in the world Though the Mormons face a new wave of criticism from outsiders some members academicians and others who follow Mormon affairs have been arguing that the churchs biggest problems are more internal than external difficulties managing its rapid growth especially overseas an undermining of its teaching caused by changing sexual mores and other social currents a loss of members to splinter groups that claim the right to practice polygamy intellectual ferment within its ranks that refuses to die despite efforts to quell it and a budding restiveness among some Mormon women over the role defined for them by the church And though many maintain that the loyalty of its members runs so deep that there is little reason for the church to worry recent events suggest that some members of the hierarchy are haunted by a fear that the church could be destroyed by research into its past A CCORDING TO MORmon doctrine an 18yearold Palmyra NY youth named Joseph Smith Jr was visited in 1823 by an angel named Moroni who led him to a cache of gold plates that the angel had buried in 421 AD Four years later Moroni allowed Smith with the help of special devices and two scribes to translate the reformed Egyptian characters that were printed on the plates They told how a group had migrated from what is now Israel to the Americas before the time of Christ and had created a thriving civilization Jesus was said to have visited the New World following His Resurrection and left a message that Smith interpreted as a call to establish a church in His name in the United States Smith was to call the story that he transcribed the Book of Mormon and it was to become the cornerstone of the new faith As the church grew from a tiny frontier sect to a farflung international organization successive generations of Mormon leaders steadfastly maintained that the Book of Mormon was literally true and that the church must stand or fall on its accuracy as the revealed word of God Last October Ezra Benson called it the most correct book on earth In 1909 one of the churchs most respected historians Brigham H Roberts wrote If the origin of the Book of Mormon could be proved to be other than that set forth by Joseph Smith    then the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints and its message and doctrines which in some respects may be said to have arisen out of the Book of Mormon must fall Mormonism has long had an obsession with history Joseph Smith instructed his followers to make copious records to keep letters diaries and other documents for posterity Many did not only in the early years of the church but after Smith was murdered by a lynch mob in Carthage Ill in 1844 and his successor Brigham Young led the persecuted Mormons to the Salt Lake Valley three years later This wealth of documents would later create a cottage industry for historians studying the westward movement and other aspects of 19thcentury American life Over the past decade and especially in the past year or so many of the fundamental tenets of Mormon theology have been challenged Anthropologists and geologists for example have found increasing evidence to support a theory that American Indians are descendants of people who migrated from Asia via a nowflooded continental land bridge from Siberia to Alaska not from Israel in small boats as the Mormons claim But the greatest challenges have come from within the Mormon community itself In November the University of Illinois Press released Studies of the Book of Mormon which contains a previously unpublished study by Brigham H Roberts in which he showed how the Book of Mormon is remarkably similar to another book View of the Hebrews written in 1823 by a Christian minister Ethan Smith Roberts would later defend the Book of Mormon But on page after page of the newly published study which he sent to church authorities in the 1920s with an appeal for help in resolving his doubts he pointed out similarities coincidences and identical language in the two volumes He suggested that Smith who he called a youth with an unusually powerful faculty of imagination had fabricated the Book of Mormon Last May Mormon leaders acknowledged possession of two letters that raised other questions about Mormon orthodoxy By then rumors of the letters existence had already filtered out of the church bureaucracy The first written in 1830 by Martin Harris Smiths close associate to a friend gives an account of the discovery of the gold plates that departs substantially from the one presented to church members Harris recalled hearing a rumor in 1827 that Joseph Smith had found a gold bible then wrote I take Joseph aside  he says it is true I found it 4 years ago with my stone but only just got it because of the enchantment The old spirit come to me 3 times in the same dream  says dig up the gold but when I take it up the next morning the spirit transfigured himself from a white salamander in the bottom of the hole and struck me 3 times   The letter had been donated to the church by a Salt Lake City businessman and Mormon bishop Steven F Christensen who said he had purchased it in January 1984 from two local document collectors Lyn Jacobs and Mark W Hofmann He said that he and another local businessman J Gary Sheets had subsequently spent 20000 on research that proved it was authentic In mythology the salamander is a creature resembling a lizard capable of living in or enduring fire  a characterization church officials contended that did not preclude its use to describe an angel Still Harriss story was far different from the glorious religious experience described in Mormon theology If Harriss letter was the Mormon equivalent of a Dead Sea Scroll it was not the contemporary evidence Mormon leaders would have wanted most to prove the churchs doctrine A week after Harriss letter was made public Mormon officials under questioning from local reporters released a letter written by Joseph Smith to a friend in 1825 They said it had been purchased more than a year earlier from Hofmann the Salt Lake City document collector by Gordon B Hinckley one of the churchs three top officials Hinckley had kept it in a church vault Smith appears in the letter to be obsessed with finding buried treasure guarded by spirits creating much the same image conveyed in Harriss letter and lending some credence to church critics who claim Smith was an imaginative dabbler in folk magic Although the letters produced a lot of publicity many Mormons and outsiders who know the church have insisted that they would have virtually no effect on the faith of the vast majority of church members whose fealty runs deep and is based on more than belief in the official doctrine Mormonism is not simply a commitment to a theology or a church practice but a socialcultural order said Sterling M McMurrin a Mormon philosopher and the EE Ericksen Distinguished Professor of History at the University of Utah It becomes part of a persons second nature he belongs to the church like he belongs to his family and he does not quit his family because someone in it turns out to be a rascal Jan Shipps a leading nonMormon historian of the church agreed A professor and director of the Center for American Studies at Indiana UniversityPurdue University at Indianapolis she said Religions have an almost infinite capacity to explain things away Mormonism as a church of revelation she said can always revise its doctrines to accommodate new information All it takes is a few words from the current prophet seer and revelator Nevertheless at least some members of the Mormon hierarchy appear to have been growing increasingly troubled that old documents and research into the churchs past could undermine members faith These fears apparently began to harden in the early 1980s when Mormon elders ordered the closing of certain church archives to scholars they regarded as unfriendly to the church They also disbanded a team of professional historians that Ezra Benson then an apostle had condemned for attempting to inordinately humanize the prophets of God so that their human frailties become more evident than their spiritual qualities Davis Bitton a history professor at the University of Utah and a member of the church historical team that was dissolved in 1982 said members had been allowed considerable freedom early in the groups 10year existence But as time passed they were progressively denied access to certain documents and church authorities increasingly pressured them not to publish work on topics such as polygamy that might embarrass the modern church They were also forced to sanitize reports that might show early church leaders or the official doctrine in a dim light Bitton said one member of the department a librarian regularly checked writings of church historians underlined passages he considered inappropriate and sent these annotated copies to his personal contacts within the General Authorities Stanley R Larson a New Testament scholar who lives in a Salt Lake City suburb says he was forced from his job in the churchs translations department this fall after writing a paper that concluded that the text of a speech attributed to Jesus in the Book of Mormon had probably been copied from a King James version of the Bible The speech Larson said contains mistakes in translation identical to those found in copies of the Bible available in Joseph Smiths time Stan has a new job now and hes happy said Larsons wife Patricia who like him is a Mormon Now hes free to think for himself Mormon leaders defend the limits placed on historians by saying that any research published by church employees carries the churchs official imprimatur and that they do not want to be in a position of seeming to endorse material contrary to official view Historians with the proper degree of commitment for the church may have access to Mormon archives Elder Maxwell said In June Gordon Hinckley in a speech relayed by satellite to Mormon young adults around the country declared that the church encouraged individual freedom of inquiry thought and expression But he assailed those who were poking into all the crevices of our history ferreting out little things of small import and magnifying them into great issues of public discussion working the media in an effort to give credibility to their efforts The recently discovered letters Hinckley said have no real relevancy to the question of the authenticity of the church or the divine origin of the Book of Mormon In a speech at Brigham Young University in August Dallin H Oaks an elder of the church told Mormons to look skeptically at news reports and new histories of the Mormons calling them often biased and told out of context Satan he said can use truth to promote his purposes and the fact that something is true is not always a justification for communicating it Oaks who served as president of Brigham Young University as a justice on the Utah Supreme Court and as chairman of the board of Public Broadcasting Service before being made an apostle in 1984 added Criticism is particularly objectionable when it is directed toward church authorities it is one thing to deprecate a person who exercises corporate power or even government power it is quite another thing to criticize or deprecate a person for the performance of an office to which he or she has been called of God It does not matter that the criticism is true On Oct 6 speaking at the churchs annual fall conference apostle James E Faust sent a strong warning to the flock Mormons he said who were questioning official accounts of Joseph Smiths experiences or were challenging his successors or any of the fundamental settled doctrines of the church could be doing so at spiritual peril A T ABOUT 815 AM on Oct 15 Steven Christensen the 31yearold Salt Lake City investment counselor and Mormon bishop who had donated the Martin Harris letter to the church arrived at his sixthfloor office in the Judge Building a few blocks from the mother church at Temple Square He leaned over to pick up a package addressed to him that was on the floor in front of his office It exploded hurling his body through his office door and puncturing it with a fusillade of hardenedsteel cement nails Later that morning Kathleen W Sheets 50 whose husband had helped Christensen authenticate the Harris letter returned to the familys home in a welltodo Salt Lake City suburb after a trip to the bank A package was waiting near the house She picked it up and it exploded killing her instantly Later that day a police official said These are our suspects and held up a lengthy computer printout listing investors in a troubled financial company headed by Mrs Sheetss husband and with which Christensen had once been affiliated But that afternoon police subsequently learned a series of events began that added another dimension to the murder investigation and seemed to rule out the investors At about 250 PM Mark Hofmann who had located the Martin Harris and the Joseph Smith letters arrived at the world headquarters of the church The 30yearold Hoffman was a former missionary who had turned an adolescent preoccupation with church history into a prosperous business At the headquarters he asked to see Hugh W Pinnock an elder and member of the First Quorum of the Seventy Pinnock was not there but apostle Dallin H Oaks agreed to see him Oaks later said that he recognized Hofmanns name because Pinnock had told him that he and Steven Christensen had been trying to purchase a set of documents from the early days of the church known as the McLellin Collection This collection long rumored to exist was said to contain letters and other materials compiled by a contemporary of Joseph Smiths William E McLellin including some with possibly damaging comments about Smith and Mormonism Oaks said Hofmann was planning to sell the collection to an unidentified person who intended to donate it to the church The sale was scheduled to take place the following day According to Pinnock Christensen had introduced him to Hofmann the previous June and Pinnock had agreed to help Hofmann raise 185000 to buy the McLellin Collection from an unidentified source in Texas Pinnock a former director of the First Interstate Bank in Salt Lake City said he called a bank officer who agreed to lend the money to Hofmann After the bombings Pinnock said he had repaid the loan from his own funds According to Oaks when Hofmann visited church headquarters on the afternoon of the bombings he told Oaks he expected to be questioned by the police regarding the murders He said he was worried about what he should say to them said Oaks I told him he should just answer their questions and tell them the truth After about 10 minutes Oaks said Hofmann left Police said the unidentified church member who had agreed to buy the documents from Hofmann and then give them to the church had drawn a check for 185000 and planned to purchase them at 2 PM on Oct 16 At 240 PM that day a bomb detonated two blocks from the churchs headquarters and blew apart a small car severely injuring its owner  Mark Hofmann Within hours police officials said that Hofmann had been the principal suspect in the bombing murders the day before and while carrying a third bomb blew himself up Hofmann denied it and was not charged with the murders However he and a 28yearold friend Shannon Flynn were charged with possession of an illegal weapon an Israelimade Uzi submachine gun allegedly found at Flynns home Following the bombings Flynn had also asked church officials for advice on what he should tell the police Nearly three months after the murders the question of who planted the bombs remains a mystery Police officials still maintain that Hofmann is their leading suspect but independent polygraph experts say he easily passed a lie detector test in which he disclaimed culpability Rumors have circulated in Salt Lake City that a s
cret group of rightwing Mormons was somehow involved in the deaths Hofmann has refused to discuss the case with reporters but according to a friend he believes a religious crackpot unhappy with his commerce in documents from the Mormon past may have set the bombs In the ensuing weeks members of a Texas family said they had the McLellin Collection in a safedeposit box and had never heard of Mark Hofmann before the bombings Nothing has surfaced to link church leaders in any way to the murders But during the investigation it has become evident that high officials of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints were doing a brisk business with Hofmann Hinckley said at a press conference that starting in 1980 he had purchased about 40 documents from Hofmann Only a few of them have been made public others are in a church vault Whether they cast any new light on the churchs past is not known Whatever the outcome of the investigation few people expect the church hierarchy to relax its resistence to efforts to rewrite its history When all is said and done Hinckley told a church conference recently the only real wealth of the church is the faith of its people T O MANY MORMONS a much more important question than who planted the bombs is In what direction will Ezra Taft Benson take them The answer Probably to the right but not as far as some church critics expect For much of his life Benson has had close personal ties to the John Birch Society and similiar conservative organizations At various times he has attributed the nations civilrights movement to Communists and questioned whether it was possible to be a good Mormon and a liberal Democrat at the same time He has also been a leading force in the church hierarchy seeking to crack down on dissenters and historical revisionists Yet insiders say the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is run on a much more collegial basis by the Council of the Twelve Apostles than many nonMormons realize Many of the most recently appointed apostles are less dogmatic than Benson is and because of his age Benson may turn over much of the daytoday operation of the church to Hinckley considered a moderate by Mormon standards According to this view there will be no more change in the course of the church than there would be at any large successful corporate entity being taken over by new management In his first public statement as prophet seer and revelator Benson seemed anxious to change his image as an archconservative when he said I love all our Fathers children of every color creed and political persuasion Still others argue that Bensons personal feelings run too deeply for him to tolerate any significant dissent Almost no one expects him to grant Mormon women full ecclesiastical equality with men as priests of the church which many have sought On one thing Benson and the Council of Twelve Apostles seem in full accord  a strong belief in the need to protect the traditional family which means resistance to pornography homosexuality abortion and women working outside the home among other things It is a battle that the church has been losing to some extent Despite the pervasive presence of the church in Utah the states divorce rate is higher than the national average While the rate of alcoholism is lower than the national average social workers say Utah has serious problems with drug abuse child abuse and teenage pregnancies Church pressure on women to stay home with their children notwithstanding a Federal survey in 1984 found that 544 percent of Utah women over the age of 16 worked outside the home higher than the national average In the past two or three years weve taken some steps backwards said Linda King Newell who with her husband Jackson edits Dialogue a journal unaffiliated with the church that often questions its official line The church she said had tried but not succeeded in halting efforts to probe into its past Like some other Mormon observers she maintains the church hierarchy has married itself too firmly to the literalness of the Book of Mormon History doesnt change but what we know about it does change If honest scholarship proved that some Mormon doctrines were faulty she said the church could adjust to it and perhaps even be strengthened by it But she said she didnt expect much assistance from the men who run the church Change comes two ways in the Mormon Church she said Slowly or not at all ONLY A HANDFUL OF high officials and senior members of a management team that runs the farflung Mormon business empire know precisely how rich the church is When members of the Council of Twelve Apostles are asked to place a value on the churchs assets or to estimate its income they say the church never discusses its financial affairs with outsiders Public records nevertheless indicate that the Church of Jesus Christ of Latterday Saints is enormously wealthy richer probably than any religious organization in the nation except the Roman Catholic Church In The Mormon Corporate Empire to be published in March by Beacon Press authors John Heinerman and Anson Shupe estimate the churchs total assets at nearly 8 billion and its yearly income at about 2 billion about 75 percent of it from tithing and offerings Besides temples churches and other religious facilities around the world the church owns television and radio stations a daily newspaper insurance companies more than 800000 acres of working farmland a company that develops industrial parks several food processing plants department stores office buildings

"LONG ISLAND OPINION; UNWED, BUT JUST ANOTHER MOTHER",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/nyregion/long-island-opinion-unwed-but-just-another-mother.html,THE two women had never been close Lucy was a very casual housekeeper in love with books and music Margaret her sisterinlaw was extremely neat and practicalminded They both however had strong and outspoken opinions about life For example Lucy was prochoice while Margaret believed in neither contraception nor abortion And Margaret unmarried became pregnant Margaret phoned Lucy [ not their real names ] from her home out of state and reported the news Her boyfriend decided he couldnt cope with marriage and she went to pieces The humiliation she felt in her hometown was devastating Moreover her nausea wasnt abating it seemed impossible to keep on with her job Youve really considered all options Lucy asked All yes What do you want to do Have this baby But how I just cant stand staying here and I have nowhere else to go Come stay at our house Lucy said So it was that Margaret arrived and that we Lucys friends became involved with a curious and instructive experience She gathered a few of us beforehand to talk about Margaret I believe in choice she told us and this is Margarets choice Youre my friends so Im hoping youll be Margarets friends Some people have made her feel guilty and some stupid but were going to help her feel good There she added I hope She looked around for support We hadnt much to give Married sheltered in middleclass neighborhoods we hadnt seen a living breathing unwed mother in years We also had trouble believing that Margaret in her mid20s and known for good sense had not practiced some form of birth control And in addition we were artybookish types would she even want us as friends Well somebody said we can at least make an effort Lets put up some streamers and make a fancy sign saying Welcome Margaret  It turned out not to be as bad an idea as it sounded When she came tired and shaky from the trip we were not present but our handiwork was along with a symbolic bottle of champagne to celebrate her courage Lucy phoned me that evening Shes in bed but she wants me to say thankyou for her Was she pleased She cried Lucy said Oh my And she said it felt wonderful She wants to make us a luncheon next Saturday It was a simple lunch though I dont know how she managed it One could see in her eyes the nausea Still she was efficient and neat perhaps a bit prim to our eyes So she said to start some conversation I guess youre like intellectual Ive always thought heavy reading is a waste of time myself Nonplussed we answered in concert Is that so There followed a leaden silence Lucy cleared her throat Margaret had an appointment with a doctor she said and maybe you can give her the lowdown on him Im scared going to a strange doctor in a strange town kind of like a child would be Margaret said then The silence melted We were full of reassurance and Margaret became full of questions She made us feel like experts on reproduction roles normally left to nurses and other pragmatic women on our streets Our ponderous advice fortunately was lightened by one companion who gave a comic routine on The First Feeding of the Newborn Margaret whose lips had been tight with emotional pain relaxed and laughed I never remember being so pleased with someones laughter It was a signal that we could hang together as her companions I dont know what the others felt but Id come to meet her imagining that in the company of a pregnant person whose fiance ran off one pretended the pregnancy wasnt happening Humor I had assumed would be as out of place as at a funeral None of us ever had been noisy about our abortion views and we were not of one mind about the issue either Two believed it would have been best for Margaret They saw as I did not the cruelty of our culture that offers so little economic and spiritual support to mother and child I was distressed by the notion of aborting Regardless here we were with Margaret and with Lucy Those two were of such different personalities and persuasions that I for one expected disaster before a month was out It never came One would stop in to find them in feisty discussions about cleaning methods clothing styles even religion  and then one would see them set out together for a movie joking Many times Margaret ran the cleaner around Lucys feet while she was absorbed in a book Many times Lucy breezed home from graduate school with a surprise for Margaret  food she especially liked or the True Confessionstype magazines she read There was an optimism a momentum one could plainly sense that came from taking on this commitment together That is not to say there werent trying times Though my life became enmeshed with Margarets and I probably helped her in many small painless ways I was not Lucy I never lived through the long hours of depressions or the desperate hours full of futile hope that the exboyfriend would see the light or the final fearful hours of labor Instead the rest of us received much more than we gave  hours of discussion with Margaret Lucy and one another Over time we talked about all kinds of questions faced by pregnant women in all kinds of situations Our words werent abstract theory They were glued to reality helping figure the complicated numbers of our friends medical bills conjuring antidotes for the nausea that never left her lugging a used crib to the bedroom The more disparate our views on abortion the closer we seemed to become There was no place for anger or empty catchwords The deeper our convictions the deeper we had to search within ourselves the more we seriously had to listen to others Beyond dialogue were delicate moments of community that would always stay in mind I can see one of them now A friend who has had an abortion appears at the door with baby blankets for Margaret The two cannot completely understand each others convictions and they never will But they are not enemies or faceless stereotypes to each other Margaret smiles at her friend Sit a while she says Have some tea This period of our lives began to end as Margaret came to term and gave birth to a boy who developed classic colic She stayed on a few more months and perhaps they were the hardest for both her and Lucy but their alliance held So did ours We carried in baby gifts and sometimes took a turn at walking the little one At last she took the child and left for her home state where 11 years later she still is raising him alone She never forgets to send a Christmas card but she rarely visits here She rarely travels anywhere her life mainly has been occupied these years with the endless work of survival Margaret virtually disappeared from our lives but she and Lucy together affected mine forever One way is in my response to those who utter angry categorical slogans meant to divide the community of women I think of those days and simply cannot hear them
WHAT STANDARDS FOR CORPORATE CRIME?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/12/books/what-standards-for-corporate-crime.html,AT ANY COST Corporate Greed Women and the Dalkon Shield By Morton Mintz Illustrated 308 pp New York Pantheon Books 1795 IN 1971 many women frightened by bad publicity about the side effects of oral contraceptive pills were delighted to hear of a new contraceptive alternative the Dalkon Shield a crabshaped intrauterine device that the A H Robins Company in Richmond was marketing as modern and safe The company quoted the developer claiming the shield was without the actual and potential hazards of systemic medication for birth control It quickly became the leading intrauterine device with more than 45 million sold worldwide before sales were suspended in the United States in June 1974 But for the women who used the shield  and ultimately for A H Robins which declared bankruptcy in August 1985 under the weight of 14000 shieldrelated lawsuits  it was nothing short of disastrous At least 110000 women using the device became pregnant and more than half of them miscarried 15 in the United States are known to have had fatal septic abortions and 18 died of pelvic inflammatory disease Some of the women left the shield in place during pregnancy and gave birth to deformed children and thousands of others suffered pelvic infections that left them infertile In retrospect the most astonishing part of the shields history is how casually the device was put on the market with how little testing  and once on the market how long it took for either A H Robins or the Federal Food and Drug Administration to note the damage and remove it Morton Mintz a reporter for The Washington Post who has covered the Federal regulatory agencies does a meticulous job of tracing the steps that led to the ravages of the Dalkon Shield The first villain of the story was Dr Hugh J Davis then a faculty member at the School of Hygiene and Public Health Johns Hopkins University According to the book he invented the shield produced the false and misleading test results on which the marketing campaigns were based and earned royalties on every shield sold  while passing himself off in medical journals books and Congressional testimony as an impartial expert Another villain was Dr Ellen Preston a pediatrician and Robinss liaison with physicians who Mr Mintz asserts seems to have been totally unconcerned about the mounting toll of injuries reported to her by doctors A H Robins throughout showed far more interest in profits than in preventing further deaths and injuries Company officials destroyed documents and made a policy of misleading both physicians and Federal investigators who asked questions about the Dalkon Shield One employee discovered that the shields design encouraged the growth of bacteria along the tail of the device and into the uterus After finding a simple solution he was ignored reprimanded and forced out of his job The lesson of these corporate misdeeds is a troubling one Mr Mintz points out If any single individual had inflicted serious injury on thousands of women and actually killed some of them he would surely be prosecuted and jailed But we have different standards for corporate crime E Claiborne Robins the chief executive of A H Robins is not perceived as a criminal In fact because he is a generous philanthropist having given at least 100 million to educational institutions he is lauded in local newspapers and received an award in 1982 in Richmond for distinguishing himself in his community Why Mr Mintz asks in a thoughtful epilogue have we allowed such a chasm to develop between personal and business ethics  why for example are corporate officers not held personally responsible in such instances of corporate malfeasance With large corporations wielding so much power over our daily lives Mr Mintz says our failure to deter or punish corporate crime sets the stage for many more disasters like the Dalkon Shield

"FOR SOME APPLICANTS, STUDENT ESSAY UNLOCKS OR SEALS THE DOOR TO COLLEGE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/13/nyregion/for-some-applicants-student-essay-unlocks-or-seals-the-door-to-college.html,The college admission essay Harry Bauld cautioned seniors at the Horace Mann School in the Riverdale section of the Bronx can be the ultimate noose with which a 17yearold can hang himself Mr Bauld read hundreds of essaysturnednooses when he worked in the admissions offices of Brown and Columbia Universities Now a writer living in Pepperell Mass he returns every year to Horace Mann where he once taught English to offer the students some strong and funny advice about the art of writing good essays Aside from drooling on the admission officers oxfords he contends the college interview is not going to make that much difference The colleges cant hold 30 minutes of whiteknuckled terror against a kid who has four solid years of achievement he said Besides the interview staffs are too large and include a lot of student interviewers You cant count on their impressions But the essay he said is crucial for applicants in the gray area which he defined as where youre in the ball park but not one whose academic numbers make you too easy to dismiss or too overwhelming to deny What matters in a big application pool is that you come alive he said And youve got to come alive on paper This is where the college can really find out whether a kid is imaginative or unresponsive If your essay is No 39 in a pile of 50 and it begins Hello I am a very unique person youre in trouble It goes into the pile with the old potato chips Mr Bauld said he disliked that kind of autobiographical achievementtouting essay because he felt it promotes the tone of a kid talking to an adult a counterfeit quality that comes through right away There are five other stereotypes that he urged seniors to avoid  The my favorite things essay Sample These are the things that I am for puppy dogs and sunshine and Mrs Fields cookies These are the things I am against spinach nuclear war and being grounded Mr Bauld said that in admissions parlance this is known as a fluff ball  The trip essay Sample I went to Israel this summer and it was exciting because I had to adapt to different food different customs and a different way of life Mr Bauld complained that everything is different except the essay  The 3D essay Sample I feel I have the determination discipline and diversity of interests to succeed at whatever I do As Mr Bauld saw it Those 3 Ds equal a fourth dull  The Miss America essay A high school kid should steer away from the big issues he advised When they go on and on like a beauty queen about nuclear war or abortion it just generates a lot of cliches and makes them sound like theyre parroting their parents  The jock essay Sample Through wrestling I have learned control goals and how to work with people Mr Bauld did not recommend any formula that showed how the student had accrued noble achievement A noble quality B and highsounding attribute C Some Topics Are Dictated Of course to a certain extent the topics are dictated by the colleges Cornell asks applicants to write about an intellectual social political or personal issue you feel is important Wesleyan has two Identify a person who has had a significant influence on you and describe that influence And Share with us what you believe other Wesleyan students would learn from you both inside and outside the classroom Stanford also requires two Given the authority to establish a holiday what would you choose to commemorate And Suppose you had the opportunity to spend a day with anyone With whom would it be and how would you spend your time The fact that each college comes up with an individual question  forcing applicants to write as many as a dozen different essays  leaves high school counselors annoyed and seniors anguished But the admissions deans resist the notion of a standardized essay arguing that they want to test teenage writing and thinking skills in their own ways If the colleges use essay questions to filter out students some students use the essay questions to filter out colleges Gillian Salton a senior at Horace Mann said she was put off by the colleges that required big issue essays  No matter how much you like to pretend 17yearolds dont know that much about Nicaragua or apartheid she said She was attracted to schools like Stanford whose questions show a sense of humor Student Talents Differ Some students like Miss Salton and Peter Urkowitz a senior at St Anns School in Brooklyn look forward to writing the essay Others like David Lender a senior at Edward R Murrow High School in Brooklyn dread it Some people speak better Mr Lender said Some write better I speak better He tried to put aside his insecurity about his prose by choosing a controversial topic for his serious issue essay taking a stand against affirmative action He also typed his essays because this suggested you put more effort into it Mr Bauld told students that they can maneuver no matter what the question to add a light original touch and minimize what he called the greatest teenage crime pomposity He advised the students to get back to simple writing tenets Write about what you know he said Write something only you could write If the most burning issue in your life is that when you put five pairs of socks in the dryer you come out with a body stocking and a knit hat write about that  not nuclear power Handling the Big Issue If a college requires a big issue essay he said try to get a personal handle on the issue nobody wants a history or current events paper He gaves the students a reading list of essays that he thought would expose them to a variety of appealing firstperson voices including George Orwells The Art of Donald McGill E B Whites Death of a Pig Doris Lessings My Father John Updikes Hub Fans Bid Kid Adieu G K Chestertons On Running After Ones Hat and Tom Wolfes Thursday Kind of Love Mr Bauld recalled several essays that came into the Brown University admissions office that made strikingly positive impressions in answering the requirement We hope to gain as complete a picture of you as possible Use this opportunity to tell us anything you think we should know One teenager taking the requirement literally sent in a picture of himself posed like a Greek statue with fig leaf Another began with the lead I do most of my best thinking in the bathroom One of the most popular essays sent to Brown was a humorous piece by a teenager who talked about how growing a beard had changed all his social interactions Entertainment Can Count Youve got to picture weary jaded admissions officers lying catatonic on the couch at midnight blinded by grade point averages Mr Bauld said They are people who like to be entertained Of course different admissions officers will respond differently to such gambits and applicants who try to be original should take care not to slide over the line into preciousness Jean Fetter the dean of undergraduate admissions at Stanford said many students tried to be overly clever on the 1984 essay question that asked candidates to choose one adjective to describe themselves Some used adjectives like concise and terse and then did not write an essay One applicant picked reflective wrote the essay back to front and attached a hand mirror I happened to read it very late at night and found it somewhat frustrating Mrs Fetter said That kind of ingenuity can strike different people in different ways Karl Furstenberg the dean of admissions at Wesleyan agreed and said A lot of people fall into the trap of trying to use gimmicks Theyre overly humorous in a way thats unnatural or they try to say something outrageous to catch your attention In summary Mr Bauld advised students to loosen up but dont loosen up too much  dont try to be Rodney Dangerfield
COURT TO REVIEW CONNECTICUT'S OPEN-PRIMARY BAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/nyregion/court-to-review-connecticut-s-open-primary-ban.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether Connecticut had violated the Constitution in barring the state Republican Party from opening to all voters its primary elections for Congress and statewide offices The case which could have an important impact on the electoral process nationally is an appeal by the state of a Federal appellate decision in August That ruling struck down the Connecticut law as a violation of the Republican Partys First Amendment right to freedom of association The appellate ruling cast doubt on the Constitutionality of similar closed primary laws in more than 35 other states including New York and New Jersey which also prohibit voters who have not affiliated themselves with a political party from voting in that partys primaries If the Court upholds the appellate courts reasoning in the Connecticut case it could give a potent legal weapon to political parties to strike down laws in states that block the party from choosing its candidates for public office in any manner it chooses Primaries Opened to All Voters The Court also agreed today to review two other Federal appellate rulings on election law One of them struck down Washington States restrictions on access of minor parties to the general election ballot The other held the Federal ban on corporate campaign spending could not constitutionally be enforced against a nonprofit antiabortion group in Massachusetts The cases will be heard next autumn In the Connecticut case the Republican Party outnumbered by Democrats in the state sought to broaden its appeal in 1984 by amending its rules to open to all voters regardless of affiliation its primary elections for Congress and for statewide offices although not those for the state legislature In a bitter partisan battle Democrats blocked Republican efforts to amend the states closed primary law to conform to the new Republican Party rule In 1984 the General Assembly controlled by Democrats rejected a Republican proposal to amend the law In 1985 after Republicans had won control of the legislature Gov William A ONeill a Democrat vetoed an amendment that the legislature had approved Right to SelfDetermination The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in Manhattan struck down the law on the ground that Connecticuts interest in regulating primary elections must give way to a political partys right to selfdetermination In his lengthy opinion for the Second Circuit Judge Irving R Kaufman said Our political organizations must retain the freedom to invite into their ranks those citizens with whom they wish to associate New York and 14 other states supporting Connecticuts Supreme Court appeal argued that the Second Circuit ruling calls in question virtually any attempt by a state to regulate the primary process and will create chaos rather than order in elections On the other hand the Connecticut Republican Party in opposing the appeal said the States claims in support of the statute amount to an attempt  for whatever reasons  to freeze the Republican Party in a status quo minority position Tashjian v Republican Party No 85766 Spending Limits in Elections In Federal Election Commission v Massachusetts Citizens for Life No 85701 the Court agreed to hear an FEC appeal of a Federal appellate decision striking down a statutory limit on corporate campaign spending The FEC had sued Massachusetts Citizens for Life Inc for having violated the Federal law which bars corporate spending on elections when it spent 9912 in 1978 to support identified prolife candidates The appeals court said the statute violated the First Amendment right of free speech as applied to nonprofit ideological corporations The FECs appeal said the decision raised an unresolved question of significant national importance and could enable forprofit corporations to evade disclosure requirements by giving money to nonprofit corporations for use in campaigns In Munro v Socialist Workers Party No 85656 the Court agreed to review the State of Washingtons requirement that a political candidate receive 1 percent of the votes cast for the office he seeks in the primary election in order to appear on the general election ballot
CONFEREES SEE PERIL IN GOALS OF GROUPS ON RELIGIOUS RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/nyregion/conferees-see-peril-in-goals-of-groups-on-religious-right.html,The religious new right poses an increasing threat to womens rights and freedom of religion in the United States speakers at a conference on the effects of religious fundamentalism said yesterday They want to prescribe a fundamentalist clampdown a religious clampdown on the diversity of religious freedom and on the human spirit the feminist author Betty Friedan told the gathering attended by about 100 people at the offices of the American Jewish Congress on East 84th Street In a call that was echoed by other speakers she urged the creation of a coalition to support what she termed the traditional American values of religious freedom and cultural pluralism The conference was sponsored by the American Jewish Congress and the Womens American Organization for Rehabilitation Through Training a volunteer group that supports vocational technological and scientific education The session brought together more than a dozen speakers involved with womens rights and religious freedom The overall theme of the conference was articulated by Norman Redlich dean of the New York University School of Law Religion he said provides basic guidance not just on matters of the spirit but also on social questions such as the role of women He said recent Supreme Court decisions had blurred the separation of church and state and had raised the specter of increasing government support for a particular religions view of morality Various speakers said that calls for censorship of school books advocacy of prayer in public schools and of public financial support for private religious schools and violence and intimidation against abortion clinics were part of a common trend The session did not include any representatives of the religious organizations being criticized Stan Hastey director of information services for the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs said fundamentalist leaders such as the Rev Jerry Falwell or Pat Robertson were betraying what he said was traditional Baptist support for religious pluralism Mr Falwell recently announced the formation of a new group called the Liberty Federation to lobby for political causes The conference organizers said in a statement that the announcement was both revealing and cause for deepened concern
Politics; From Money Magic to Money Misery,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/us/politics-from-money-magic-to-money-misery.html,Ronald Reagans political success seems to have been something of a financial disaster for Richard A Viguerie the directmail tactician who raised hundreds of millions of dollars in the 1970s for causes and candidates of the political right and as a result became a force in American politics According to court records Mr Vigueries fundraising company is being sued for several million dollars by creditors for falling into arrears and the Viguerie Company is now offering for sale its headquarters in Falls Church Va across the Potomac from Washington Mr Viguerie sold his nationally circulated monthly magazine Conservative Digest last fall Of Conservative Complacency Mr Viguerie did not respond to several telephone inquiries concerning his financial status But fundraising specialists say his problems came in good part because Mr Reagans political success has led to complacency among many conservative donors on mailing lists that once performed magicically for such heroes of the right as Mr Reagan George C Wallace and Jesse Helms Successes like that did not continue however and expensive directmail campaigns conducted recently in behalf of conservative causes failed leaving Mr Viguerie heavily in debt The experts also say Mr Viguerie faces increasing competition for directmail donors from the regular Republican Party campaign apparatus which uses mailing lists that overlap with his Issues That Were Getting Old According to Herbert E Alexander director of the Citizens Research Foundation a campaignfunds study group at the University of Southern California Mr Vigueries highriding success of the 1970s became the victim not only of conservative camplacency with President Reagan in place but also of Mr Vigueries longstanding emphasis on issues rather than candidates He was strong on issues that were getting old or seem more or less settled like abortion and capital punishment or the Panama Canal treaty when that was a current controversy Mr Alexander said He also was getting a lot of competition for basically the same conservative money from the regular Republican Party which has built up a tremendous mailing list of its own Since his debut on the New Right as director of Young Americans for Freedom in the early 1960s Mr Viguerie now 52 years old has always been something of an unorthodox exceptionally independentminded conservative He said he declined on principle for example to raise money for President Nixons 1972 reelection campaign and then in 1975 when he was raising millions for the thirdparty Presidential candidacy of Governor Wallace of Alabama he said it was his fervent hope that Mr Wallace and Mr Reagan would team up as the ticket of a new party in 1976 Last year backed by conservative church groups Mr Vigueries independence led him to mount an outsiders campaign for the Republican nomination for lieutenant governor of Virginia It was a doomed diversion that some of his associates believe distracted him from his directmail business at a critical time Officials at two of the Viguerie Companys massmailing clients the National Conservative Political Action Committee and another conservative group promoting a return to the gold standard RuffPAC say they suffered large losses in separately disappointing Viguerierun campaigns in 1984 Suing for Millions High mailing costs and poor returns left them owing money rather than counting it and left Mr Viguerie about 4 million in the hole the groups say RuffPAC contending that thousands of pieces of its mailing ended up in a Chicago dump is not only disputing Mr Vigueries bill but also suing him for millions said Neil Blair its executive director And NCPAC is negotiating with Mr Viguerie over about 3 million he says it owes him In addition the companys office suppliers are suing for nonpayment of bills The Viguerie Companys mounting difficulties were illustrated at a hearing Friday in a courtroom in Fairfax Circuit Court in suburban northern Virginia where the company collected and refined mailing lists of some 5 million Americans in a computerfilled office building Defending him against one of the rash of creditor lawsuits  this one for 18214 in overdue charges by Western Union Electronic Mail Inc  Mr Vigueries attorney obtained court approval of an agreement to settle the debt for 16440 payable at about 457 a month over three years Office Bills Pizza Bills With the sale of the Viguerie Companys building worth several million dollars Mr Viguerie could presumably retire the unpaid office bills They range from 70000 to 210000 But they pale in comparison with the money demanded in the latest suit against him filed last month by the First American Bank of Virginia In June 1984 the bank says it lent Mr Viguerie money that with interest now comes to about 11 million to equip and open the ShowBiz Pizza Place a nonpolitical eatery in Fairfax County Payments on the loan ceased last November according to the banks lawyer

What Due Process Meant to Potter Stewart,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/14/opinion/l-what-due-process-meant-to-potter-stewart-051886.html,To the Editor In your frontpage obituary of Associate Justice Potter Stewart of the United States Supreme Court Dec 8 you define substantive due process as a lawyers term for judges substituting their personal values for those of the legislature You seem to suggest by this that Justice Stewart supported judicial activism of this type Where did this definition come from Its not one that Justice Stewart would have accepted nor would anyone else but the most cynical conservative of lawyers The suggestion that substantive due process involves usurping the legislatures function in favor of personal values  those are fighting words in most law schools and should not be passed off as an uncontroversial definition In fact substantive due process is a lawyers term for the idea that judges are empowered to articulate fundamental values not explicitly protected by the Constitution which the Government may not impinge without meeting a high standard of justification I paraphrase here the standard constitutional law text by Prof Gerald Gunther of Stanford Law School page 502 Fundamental values do not necessarily have anything to do with a judges personal values Nor does the activity of articulating those values necessarily have anything to do with the legislature In his concurrence in Roe v Wade Justice Stewart criticized the Texas abortion statute at issue But his reason was that it infringed on a long line of Supreme Court cases that clarified that freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life is one of the liberties protected by the due process clause of the 14th Amendment To suggest that Justice Stewarts concurrence was based on a capricious desire to enshrine his own values in the law of the land does this careful competent Justice a great disservice MARTHA F DAVIS Chicago Dec 17 1985 The writer is a lawyer

SHOULD FARMERS GO COLD TURKEY?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/weekinreview/should-farmers-go-cold-turkey.html,Perhaps the most important event in the postwar drive to modernize the raising of farm animals most authorities now agree was the discovery in 1949 that antibiotic drugs cause chicks to gain weight quickly The finding forever changed how farmers produce beef pork poultry and eggs The drugs mixed into feed not only cause farm animals to grow to record weights in record time but also protect them against deadly bacterial diseases Antibiotics were the first of what has turned out to be a flood of new drugs and food supplements that have kept animals healthy and hungry helping American farmers achieve extraordindary gains in production efficiency In recent years however scientists consumer groups members of Congress and their staffs have begun raising questions about the use of animal drugs and feed supplements and whether residues of these substances left in food are a threat to human health A new sense of urgency was added to the safety debate last week by a Congressional study that severely criticized the Federal Food and Drug Administrations ability to oversee the 2 billionayear animal drug industry The study charged that the agency had failed to remove from the market more than a dozen widely used animal drugs its own scientists have said cause cancer and other illnesses Residues of these and many other potentially dangerous substances the report said have been identified in meat poultry milk and eggs The report prepared by the House Government Operations subcommittee on intergovernmental relations and human resources also detailed instances in which dangerous drugs are routinely fed to farm animals even though the chemicals have never been approved by the agency for use in the United States In other cases the report said farmers are using harmful drugs illegally  for instance administering to beef cattle powerful drugs approved only for poultry The report said the agency seemed unwilling to do anything about the problem though it poses a grave risk to consumers The FDA for too long has been placing the concerns of livestock producers ahead of concerns for health said Representative Ted Weiss the subcommittee chairman and a Democrat of Manhattan Under the agencys own statutes this is flagrantly illegal behavior FDA officials while agreeing with many of the findings fired back a few salvos of their own The report says we dont care about consumers Thats just real hard for me to swallow said Dr Gerald Guest acting director of the agencys Center for Veterinary Medicine This is a sweeping indictment But its full of gross statements that just arent accurate The use of drugs and feed supplements for livestock and poultry is widespread From birth to death farm animals are vaccinated inoculated fed and implanted with an astonishing array of substances many of them extremely toxic Pigs for example are fed antibiotics in combination with sulfa drugs to help them gain weight and prevent pneumonialike infections They are routinely treated with arsenic compounds for intestinal infections and other powerful drugs to cure parasitic diseases Withdrawal Periods Cattle and sheep are regularly given natural estrogen a female hormone to promote growth And farmers use synthetic sex hormones to bring entire herds into heat at the same time and to induce spontaneous abortions When these drugs are used properly they will not leave unsafe residues said Maryln Cordle acting director of the residue division in the Department of Agricultures Food Safety and Inspection Service The concern is when farmers dont use these drugs according to label directions Her department spends 362 million each year to inspect meat and poultry and test for 110 drugs in roughly 40000 food samples And the FDA has withdrawal periods for most drugs requiring farmers to remove an animal from the drug for a specified length of time before slaughter But the Congressional study said between 20000 and 30000 drugs and feed supplements are in use and many producers do not abide by the withdrawalperiod rules Livestock producers insist that the drugs are vital A sick animal represents a substantial loss they say in an industry that survives on narrow profit margins Wed go broke without these products said Dr Wes Bonner a veterinarian and general manager of Veribest Cattle Feeders Inc in Veribest Tex I think nothing would tickle cattlemen more than if we could throw all these products out the window But theres no way its going to happen unless the poultry industry does it too
LONG ISLAND JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/nyregion/long-island-journal-429686.html,THE LAW AND THE MALL THE recent New York State court ruling regarding leafletting at the Smith Haven Mall brought national media attention to the Lake Grove shopping center according to its vice president and general manager Abe Zitren We had TV out here and everything he said But he added theres been no reaction from the Long Island public those most affected by the decision Last month the State Court of Appeals ruled that the New York Constitution permits privately owned shopping centers to ban the distribution of handbills pamphlets and other types of politically oriented literature on their premises The decision overturned a 1982 state court ruling that required the Smith Haven Mall to designate areas for groups to hand out their materials I let everyone in after the 1982 ruling Mr Zitren said the Hare Krishnas were here all sorts of groups He would have accepted politicians too he said but none asked Now he will not automatically bar everyone but look at requests on a casebycase basis It depends on the group he said The general manager of the Sunrise Mall in Massapequa Nicholas Peragine also said he would not immediately ban all leafletting Well use our discretion he added Long Islands largest shopping center Roosevelt Field in Garden City has been doing just that for years according to Alice Rosen the director of marketing Roosevelt Field Mrs Rosen said is one of the few malls on Long Island that have a community booth for groups interested in reaching the public The booth was set up about five years ago she said It may be rented by any Long Island group for up to three days at a time at 25 a day but the group must have a million dollars worth of insurance The League of Women Voters animal protection groups and the Vietnam Veterans of America are just a few of the organizations that have rented it she added The recent court ruling Mrs Rosen said will not effect the community booth nor the malls policy regulating it No group can use it more than once every six months she said which allows all to get a chance 9 ROOMS WILL TRAVEL THEYRE giving away a house in Amityville Its a real classic said Charles V Powell of Amityvilles American Legion post Its a very attractive house It has a lot of character The post according to Mr Powell bought the 65yearold 9room 2 12story colonial 7 years ago but it remained vacant Since the post still has no need for the structure it is willing to give it away free and clear Mr Powell said The house can be yours for the taking  literally  because it doesnt come with any land The property it currently sits on will be used for a parking lot for the new American Legion building now under construction So if you want the house youve got to take it and the moving could be a bit tricky The house is in the incorporated Village of Amityville but its north of the railroad trestle Mr Powell said A few people were interested in it but they wanted to move it south The housemovers said theyd have to chop off the top to get it under the railroad trestle and the movers werent going to put the top back on if they did get it under the Route 110 bridge One interested party Mr Powell said was given an estimate of 20000 by the Long Island Lighting Company to disconnect lines so the house could be moved It would cost the post 3000 to demolish the house Mr Powell said So if it can be given away theyll save money and someone will get a free house Anyone interested in the building can call Mr Powell at 7954218 So far Legion officials have advertised the free house in local papers in Amityville and Massapequa Im amazed at some of the responses weve gotten Mr Powell said One person called and wanted to know if the house was haunted He thought it was the Amityville Horror house Its not SEX AND THE STUDENT THE figures are in on which sexeducation course at Lindenhurst High School is the most popular  and given the controversy over the courses in recent months the results might surprise some people Sex education has been the subject of debate in the community for more than three years For this school year a compromise was struck with community members who didnt want certain subjects taught like contraception and abortion But it would seem it is those subjects that the majority of students want to learn about With parents consent juniors can choose between two sex education courses One is Family Life which discusses contraceptives and other sexrelated subjects The other is Sexuality Commitment and the Family which stresses abstaining from sex rather than other methods of birth control A third option is also available a course that teaches the life cycle from birth to old age but with no discussion of sex at all The threeweek courses are part of the school health program The first semester ended a few weeks ago and students signed up for the spring semester last week According to Lee McLaughlin the director of physical education and health courses at the school of the 331 students who took one of the three courses last semester 75 percent chose the more liberal course 18 percent took the more conservative course and 7 percent took the third choice Mr McLaughlin added however that students who did not choose one of the courses or did not get permission from a parent to take sex education were placed in the lifecycle course Its not as if 7 percent chose not to take sex education he said This semester estimates are that 60 percent will take the more liberal course 35 percent will take the conservative course and 5 percent have not chosen either The whole subject is very sensitive Mr McLaughlin said but the three choices certainly add a new dimension to the program TO TASTE OR NOT TO TASTE FEWER popping corks will be heard in Long Island schoolrooms this year Registration for adult education courses in area school districts starts this week and residents of Huntington and Seaford will be able to sign up for winetasting courses Great Neck residents however will not According to Robert D Sholiton Great Necks director of adult education it was decided that holding winetasting courses in public school buildings presented potential legal problems and sent the wrong signals to students This will be the first session in 10 years that wine courses will not be offered in the North Shore community I always thought of Great Neck as avant garde said Seafords adult education director Paul V Pepe But now personally I think theyre overreacting Nobodys ever walked out of one of our courses tipsy Mr Pepe said Seaford has been offering winetasting courses to adults for more than 12 years first in the public library and for the last five years in a former elementary school building Its not just a party he said Its educational and instructive Huntingtons adult education director Roberta Polinger agreed Im not concerned she said They dont drink that much  it probably equals one glass of wine an evening Huntington is offering a 10week course on Long Island wines Class members bring their own glasses Mrs Polinger said and for 60 they will taste some of the Islands finest products Mrs Polinger and Mr Pepe will probably sample a little of the grape too they acknowledged As directors of the adult education programs they observe the various courses and the winetasting courses are ones they especially like Wine tasting Chinese cooking and belly dancing Mr Pepe said Those are my favorite courses to observe ON THE MEDIA FRONT SOME news last week for Long Island media watchers WCBSTV Channel 2 named a new Long Island news correspondent Josh Mankiewicz a former ABCTV correspondent will begin covering the Island in the middle of February according to a station official And also last week WSNLTV Channel 67 ended all local production Joan May of Glen Cove who was the news director for the Central Islip station said all local programming  a daily halfhour news show and a daily halfhour public affairs program  ended as of Friday The station will be be broadcasting only musicvideo programs originating from a

DEMOCRATS' HOPES UP IN CAROLINA SENATE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/us/democrats-hopes-up-in-carolina-senate-race.html,The Democratic Partys chances of winning a United States Senate seat in North Carolina has taken on a new dimension with former Gov Terry Sanford formally beccoming a candidate Mr Sanford 68 years old recently retired after 15 years as president of Duke University He was immediately regarded by political specialists as the frontrunner for the Democratic nomination in a field of four candidates none of whom has a statewide political base The state primary will be May 6 The seat is now held by Senator John P East a Republican who is suffering from a thyroid disorder and is not seeking a second term James T Broyhill a 22year member of the House of Representatives and David B Funderburk former Ambassador to Rumania who is backed by the political organization of Senator Jesse Helms are competing for the Republican nomination Mr Funderburks campaign has already begun sponsoring television commercials charging that Mr Broyhill voted to support positions favoring abortion rights and the Democratic budget proposal in the House Mr Broyhill has argued that his record shows him to be a genuine conservative and he has picked up the backing of the oldline regulars in the state Republican Party With the incumbent not seeking reelection and with the prospect of a divisive Republican primary the national Democratic Party initially made North Carolina a target in its effort to recapture control of the Senate And yet for the five months before Mr Sanford announced his move this week the state Democratic leadership looked in vain for a major figure to run for Mr Easts seat Former Gov James B Hunt Jr who lost a bruising race to Mr Helms in 1984 decided not to run So did Representative Charles G Rose 3d Wade Smith a former state party chairman and William C Friday president of the University of North Carolina Search for Fresh Face In September Mr Sanford announced his intention to run but he withdrew after a few days At that time party leaders were looking for a fresh candidate and did not rally to him Mr Sanford was Governor from 1961 to 1965 and has not held elected office since then In 1972 and in 1976 he sought the Democratic Presidential nomination In 1972 he was defeated in North Carolinas primary by Gov George C Wallace of Alabama Several candidates had entered the Democratic race for the Senate nomination but had not attracted broad support from the party activists Those who have filed and remain in the race are T L Odom a Mecklenburg County Commissioner William I Belk a Charlotte department store executive who is former president of Young Democrats of America Betty C Wallace of Raleigh a state education official and Katherine H Harper president of Harper Companies International of Charlotte Two days after Mr Sanford filed his candidacy Marvin K Blount Jr of Greenville a former state judge who had begun television commercials for his Senate candidacy dropped out and endorsed Mr Sanford D M Faircloth a former State Commerce Secretary was also preparing to enter but stepped aside
CUOMO ASSERTS HE IS VICTIM OF ETHNIC BIAS BY COLUMNISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/19/nyregion/cuomo-asserts-he-is-victim-of-ethnic-bias-by-columnists.html,Governor Cuincreasing references to my ethnicity declared today If anything could make me change my mind about running for the Presidency its people talking about An Italian cant do it a Catholic cant do it  Mr Cuomo said he was referring to natilysts who he said were contending that theres no way Cuomo can win  Italians from the Northeast cant win The only people he named were the columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak The Governor who has consistently denied being a candidate for the Presidency and licly hinted that he might be said in an interview that he had a powerful feeling about the issue of ethnic bias which he called a very important subject that I will discuss over and over and over I Am Going to Speak Out I dont mind the Republicans licking their chops and saying Thats just what we want him to do because people wont vote for Italians  the Governor said evidently referring to a possible campaign for the Presidency Even though reporters will take out of context some of the things Im saying even with that absurdity I am going to speak out Last month after Mr Cuomo asked reporters not to use the word Mafia to describe organized crime because he said it was a slight against ItalianAmericans national Democratic leaders were reported to have urged him not to emphasize his ethnicity Asked about that Mr Cuomo said I think a popular political opinion is Mario when you underscore the Italian part of your package and allow discussion of Mafia that produces no pluses They say the Mafia subject is an unpleasant one and that any association with an unpleasant subject is bad for you the Governor added Well thats what they said about abortion about tax deductibility When you have a powerful instinct you go with it I had a powerful instinct about tax reform about abortion and I have a powerful instinct about this The Governor has been a leader in the fight against the Reagan Administrations efforts to end the deductibility of state and local taxes from Federal income taxes And he has challenged leaders of the Roman Catholic Church who have suggested that Roman Catholics in public office have an obligation to apply the churchs teachings in carrying out public policy Over the years Mr Cuomo who was born to immigrant parents in a bluecollar neighborhood in Queens has mentioned from time to time discrimination against ItalianAmericans that he said had kept him out of the best schools and the best law firms But in the last month or so he has talked more and more about bias As I have gotten older Mr Cuomo who is 53 years old said last month this has become more significant to me Major Address Planned The Governors comments today came only hours before he left for San Antonio where he was to give a speech tonight at a national Democratic gathering His aides said he was planning to make a major address soon on the issue of discrimination against not only ItalianAmericans but also against blacks and other ethnic groups This goes way beyond Italians  it affects blacks Jews Mr Cuomo said although for the most part he concentrated on ItalianAmericans Andrew Cuomo the Governors son and one of his top political advisers said Mr Cuomo was concerned about an array of factors that seemed to rule out certain people for the Presidency such as geography or ethnicity or religion When Governor Cuomos name is mentioned for the Presidency Andrew Cuomo said very often one of the first issues is his ethnicity Dont you hear it Someone says Cuomo for President Then someone else says Can an Italian from the Northeast be elected President  Well is that how its decided he said Shouldnt the questions be about intelligence and ability not ethnicity In the interview today he specifically referred to a Jan 8 column by the syndicated writers Rowland Evans and Robert Novak In the column they referred to Mr Cuomos ethnic difficulty And one paragraph read Cuomos political problem is described by a liberal member of the Democratic National Committee from the Deep South Between Richmond and Houston there are no Cuomos and damn few Marios  There was no answer at Mr Evanss office in Washington at his home there or at his country house The Washington Post which syndicates the column said Mr Novak was traveling in the Middle East and that a telephone number was not available for him there The Governor also mentioned today a sign held by a protester yesterday who was opposed to his granting of clemency to Gary McGivern who was convicted of killing a deputy sheriff Kill a Cop Get Paroled by the Wop the sign said Discussing the Mafia I am not being hypersensitive to this  its there Mr Cuomo said about his overall impressions And of the national political writers specifically he said I do notice an increasing interest in my ethnicity And one has to wonder about that The Governor drew wide publicity last month after he criticized news organizations for using the word Mafia to describe organized crime The thrust of his comments  in an emotional 45minute discussion with reporters in his office  was that there was a Mafia but that it was only one faction of organized crime But twice during the conversation he seemed to imply that there was no Mafia at all At one point he said Youre telling me that Mafia is an organization and Im telling you thats a lot of baloney At another point asked what the Mafia was the Governor said Its nothing  its a word that somebody made up Since then Mr Cuomo has repeatedly tried to clarify his remarks and today he repeated again Of course there is a Mafia He said he was simply trying to convey the notion that every time you use the word Mafia you suggest to people that all organized crime is Italian  its an ugly stereotype
CATHOLICS OPEN STATE DRIVE AGAINST MEDICAID ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/20/nyregion/catholics-open-state-drive-against-medicaid-abortion.html,The Roman Catholic bishops of all eight dioceses in New York State asked their congregations yesterday to take and sign postcards urging Governor Cuomo to end Medicaid financing of abortions It is time to stop the shedding of innocent blood in our society John Cardinal OConnor Archbishop of New York said at the 10 AM mass in St Patricks Cathedral We must fill out cards asking legislators to put an end to the slaughter of humans Civilized people cannot stand by and tolerate such injustice The cards circulated to parishioners at mass were timed to coincide with the anniversary on Wednesday of the 1973 United States Supreme Court decision that upheld womens right to abortions Tax Issue Raised The postcards say Please do not force me to pay state and local taxes for Medicaid abortions in your 8687 state budget I will hold all elected officials accountable who do not support my conscientious objections Parishioners were asked to sign the cards and return them to parish officials for mailing in bulk to the Governor Cardinal OConnor drew a contrast between the nationwide celebration today of the birthday of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr which he praised and the anniversary Wednesday of the Supreme Court ruling which he called a day of shame The Cardinal said 17 million abortions had been performed in the 13 years since the ruling He said that while the Federal Government paid for 293 abortions in 1984 and then only if they were medically necessary New York State paid for 45000 abortions on demand at a cost to the taxpayers of 16 million Boggles the Mind The destruction of human lives on such a massive scale boggles the mind the Cardinal said New York is one of 14 states still allowing the use of Medicaid funds to subsidize abortions after the Supreme Court ruled in 1980 that the Federal and state governments were not obligated to pay for them according to the Archdiocese of New York Only eight states including New York finance them willingly the rest are under court order to do so while lawsuits are pending according to a spokesman for the New York State Right to Life Committee Barbara Meara Mr Cuomo has long held that since abortions are legal in the United States it would be discriminatory to deny the procedure to people who are too poor to pay for them Abortions are among healthcare services reimbursable under Medicaid the Federalstate health insurance program for the poor said a spokesman for the Governor Thomas Conroy No Problems With Cards In response to the petition drive another spokesman for Mr Cuomo Kathleen Meehan said that while the Governor had not yet seen the cards he welcomes the free expression of ideas  he has no problems with the sending of the cards The Roman Catholic Church in New York has distributed petition cards in the past for mailing to local representatives but this is the first time a concerted petition effort has been directed at the Governor according to Joseph Zwilling a spokesman for the archdiocese Many congregation members who received cards said they hoped that legislators would be swayed by the political pressure There are 66 million Roman Catholics in New York State While many Catholics interviewed supported the churchs position some said they did not believe such a view should be imposed on everyone At the Church of the Epiphany on 22d Street and Second Avenue one woman said the bishops should seek to limit the financing of abortions to those during the first three months of pregnancy rather than a complete ban Under Medicaid abortions are allowed until the 24th week of pregnancy When you get to three and a half months the parishioner said you feel something inside you living and kicking  you have life But if you go back further than that I dont know Groups supporting abortion rights assailed the postcard drive If we believe in womens freedom we have to believe that women have the right to make their own moral choices said Ruth Imbesis acting coordinator of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights in New York City an advocacy group of 31 denominations including New York State Catholics for a Free Choice There are no references in the Bible that say abortion is a bad thing she said I am appalled at people in positions like the Cardinal who choose to make it that kind of an issue
CORRECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/nyregion/c-correction-986086.html,An article in Metropolitan Report yesterday about New York State Catholics opposition to Medicaid financing of abortions misstated the Medicaid guidelines Elective abortions are allowed until the 24th week of pregnancy thereafter only medically necessary abortions are allowed
CLUES TO BEHAVIOR SOUGHT IN HISTORY OF FAMILIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/21/science/clues-to-behavior-sought-in-history-of-families.html,IN their search for the causes of human behavior some psychologists find themselves drawn ever deeper into the past beyond the history of any individual and toward that of the whole family They discern across many generations of families the development of a kind of subculture complete with myths expectations and foibles that can explain some of the more baffling aspects of life In this pursuit they are attempting to codify themes familiar in Greek tragedy as well as in modern literature One of the new tools in this effort is called the genogram in which the interplay of generations within a family is carefully graphed so that repetitive patterns of behavior can be clearly identified Because the rapidly growing popularity of genograms had led to a lack of agreement on what symbols to use a task force of therapists and physicians recently proposed standard guidelines for constructing these psychological family trees Youre the product of millions and millions of human generations and youve got to understand what goes on in a family in that grand perspective you understand too little about a person if you look just at his inner life or immediate family said Murray Bowen a psychiatrist who is generally credited with originating the multigenerational approach to therapy While family therapists were the first to use this generational framework for treating psychological problems the orientation is spreading to those in other disciplines such as history and family medicine The psychological legacy of past generations is of course not a binding influence on the descendants It seems to diminish as time goes on and those in later generations come under the sway of many other psychological influences And the patterns of previous generations matter little to those who have little awareness of or no contact with their forebears Also the patterns that are revealed are by no means always negative In Alexander Graham Bells family tree for example there is a threegeneration preoccupation with problems in speaking and hearing which presaged his invention of the telephone Bells paternal grandfather was an actor and elocutionist who wrote a classic book on phonetics and invented a cure for stammering his father and uncle devoted themselves to teaching their fathers technique Bells mother and his own wife were both deaf and Bell himself taught the deaf studying in great detail the mechanics of speech It was his fathers suggestion to Alexander that he develop a talking machine that set him on the path that led eventually to the telephone The notion that the traumas and triumphs of one generation can reverberate through successive ones is of course as ancient as the biblical warning that the sins of the fathers will be visited upon the children for seven generations As a plot twist it was familiar in Greek tragedy Oedipus Rex for example  and in Shakespeares family epics including King Lear and Romeo and Juliet Modern novelists from Faulkner on have chronicled the intertwined fates of families over generations as soap operas like Dallas do The Adams Family Looking at multple generations helps you see how deep the problem is said Edward Friedman a family therapist who has written extensively on the topic When you have a deep problem in a family one that gets passed on over generations it is more effectively handled if you take more than one generation into account Among those outside the field of therapy who have turned to the approach is David F Musto of Yale a psychiatrist and historian who is studying the papers of four generations of the eminent Adams family The Adamses produced not only two American presidents but also several ambassadors and literary figures In Dr Mustos view the Adams family passed on a destructive family myth about its own place in history a myth that contributed to serious psychological difficulties including a suicide over successive generations The myth was created and propogated by Abigail Adams wife of John Adams the second American president According to Dr Musto during the Revolutionary War Abigail Adams was left to suffer loneliness and hardships in Massachusetts during the years her husband rose to fame in Philadelphia and Europe She justified her sacrifice by glorifying her husband and the cause for which he fought seeing him as the key figure in American independence Dr Musto writes in an article in New Directions in Psychohistory From that point on she had grand ambitions for her children particularly John Quincy Adams who she felt was destined to be a hero and statesman Impossible Expectations While that expectation proved true long before John Quincy Adams became the sixth American president in Dr Mustos view the family myth also contained extremely idealistic and unrealistic standards which were to prove a burden to later generations of Adamses According to the family selfimage an Adams was to be morally superior and find blazing success while remaining aloof from the shabby reality of business and politics This myth Dr Musto argues created an impossible situation for the Adamses in later generations While some of the Adams family in later generations actually did rise to eminence  John Quincy Adamss son Charles Francis Adams was Americas ambassador to Britain in the Civil War and came close to a Presidential nomination  others were decided failures Another of John Quincys sons George Washington Adams a heavy drinker was said to be so disheartened by his failure to uphold the family standards of success that he committed suicide at 28 It was not until the third generation after Abigail Dr Musto claims that the Adams family gave up her inflated vision of the familys destiny as the leaders of the American Republic Writing in a recent issue of The American Scholar Peter Shaw notes two contrasting types over several generations in the Adams family On one hand he says there were selfdeniers who never deviated from their sense of duty On the other were selfindulgers who seemed bent on disappointing family expectations Tracking Legacies by Genograms The genogram was developed by family therapists to track such legacies systematically using sets of of symbols on a family tree to show psychologically significant events Abortions and stillbirths separations and divorces and extramarital affairs for example In addition the genogram allows the noting of psychological alliances or distance between family members as well as unusually close or estranged relationships The net result is a family tree that reveals not just the usual relationships but also more significantly the emotional turbulence that is inevitable in a family Moreover it shows this turbulence not just in the present but also as it has survived over generations For example a genogram of the family of Eugene ONeill shows a pattern of estrangement between father and chldren over three generations according to Monica McGoldrick a clinical social worker in the Department of Psychiatry at Rutgers who headed a task force that developed standard guideline for genograms Both Eugene and his oldest brother Jamie felt estranged from their father and all of them blamed each other for the mothers drug addiction according to Professor McGoldrick In the next generation the playwright was totally estranged from his oldest son and had nothing to do with his daughter Oona after she married Charlie Chaplin Biographers should find the technique useful Professor McGoldrick said because it offers a systematic way to analyze the psychological influences of past generations on a person Insights Into Hidden Patterns The approach reveals not just tendencies toward problems in a family Professor McGoldrick says but also offers insights into hidden patterns that influence choices people make in life such as that of career For example she says students of Carl Jung and his theories would do well to take his family background into account in understanding the sources of his ideas Jung was from a family in which for three generations before him virtually all the males had been either physicians or ministers Many members including his mother also had strong beliefs in the supernatural A cousin was a medium and Jung attended her seances in his youth Jungs becoming a physician with a profound interest in the supernatural and religion fit right into the predominant patterns in his family Professor McGoldrick said Such crossgenerational influences on identity are more common than most people realize Professor McGoldrick said If you look back in your family you are often able to find a psychological twin or neartwin For example a patient of mine thought of herself as a total oddity in her family because she is gay and has a wry sense of humor in a family that is otherwise straightlaced and tightlipped But she recently found out about a grandaunt who was rarely mentioned by the family The grandaunt had the same sort of sense of humor and lived all her adult life with another woman with whom she shared a bed as her family put it Since family patterns can be transmitted from one generation to the next recognizing such patterns can often help families avoid repeating unfortunate patterns or transmitting them into future generations Professor McGoldrick said The guidelines for using genograms to plot family trees are outlined in Genograms in Family Assessment Norton which Professor McGoldrick wrote with Randy Gerson Generations Involved in Therapy The generational approach offers perhaps the most highly developed theory in family therapy a field stronger on technique and practical problemsolving than on theory said Richard Simon a family therapist in Washington DC and editor of the Family Therapy Networker the major trade journal in the field There are several family therapists who have proposed theories about the psychological dynamics at work in families over generations Apart from the efforts of Murray Bowen and his students the major work of this kind has been done by Ivan BoszormenyiNagy a psychiatrist at the Eastern Pennsylvania Psychiatric Institute in Philadelphia and his colleagues Family therapists who take this approach often hold therapy sessions at which are present not just the person with a psychological problem but also his parents siblings grandparents aunts and uncles and sometimes even cousins Dr BoszormenyiNagy for example writing in Invisible Loyalties Harper  Row describes treating a family in which both parents physically abused their 4yearold daughter The sessions included the child the parents and both sets of grandparents The problem was finally resolved when the parents of the child were each able to talk to their own parents about feeling neglected in their own childhoods resentments they had harbored in silence for years Some families seem to be far more marked by generational patterns than are others the theorists say In such families for example there may typically be a continuing pattern of women martyred by husbands who have mistresses or generation after generation in which there is incest or physical abuse But in almost all families the theorists say there are more subtle ways in which one generation leaves its psychological mark on successive ones In almost every family for example each generation has a psychological loyalty to the past one a sense that the child has a set of commitments to his parents to transmit their values and outlook to his children That transmission according to Dr BoszormenyiNagy repays a psychological debt to earlier generations It is in this sense that every marriage is actually two families that are trying to reproduce themselves  his and hers said Carl Whitaker a family therapist
REAGAN EXHORTS FOES OF ABORTION AT CAPITAL RALLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/us/reagan-exhorts-foes-of-abortion-at-capital-rally.html,President Reagan told thousands of opponents of abortion today that he was proud to join them in the long march for the right to life as they rallied here on the 13th anniversary of the Supreme Courts decision legalizing abortions We will continue to work together with members of Congress to overturn the tragedy of Roe v Wade the President said referring to that Court decision Every child about to be born is a unique unrepeatable gift he added speaking from the White House to the protesters by a telephone and loudspeaker hookup Every child who escapes the tragedy of abortion is an immeasurable victory The Presidents words brought cheers from the crowd that gathered on the Ellipse behind the White House before marching up Pennsylvania Avenue to the Supreme Court and the Capitol where they dispersed to lobby members of Congress The police estimated the crowd at 36000 people about half last years estimate A police spokesman said there were 10 arrests for demonstrating at the Supreme Court and 31 stemming from abortion protests at two health facilities in Washington earlier in the day From early morning the ranks of foes of abortion swelled as buses poured into this city from around the country for the 13th annual March for Life This was the second consecutive year that the President has addressed the rally We Have Been on a Roll Throughout the day leaders of the movement against abortion said they were confident that the tide was turning their way in American politics In a news conference before the march Dr John C Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee said We believe in this past year we have been on a roll Advocates of legalized abortion countered with equal conviction that the mainstream of public opinion supported their position and only needed to be mobilized Were beginning to organize the majority in we hope bigger and bigger numbers said Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women which plans a march in Washington this spring in support of legalized abortion and contraception A spokesman said NOW received increased reports of picketing and harassment today at clinics offering abortion services After his speech to the rally the President met with about 25 leaders of the movement against abortion Paul Brown of the American Life League one of the leaders at the meeting said he had raised the issue of prolife people in jail for violence or demonstrations against abortion clinics Mr Brown said that while he opposed violence and was not in any way justifying their actions some of those people serving long sentences were very young naive wellmeaning kids He said he asked the President if he would some day consider a pardon in some cases and said Mr Reagan had indicated he might someday review them on a casebycase basis I did not hear him say that said Albert R Brashear a spokesman for the White House who was in the meeting Mr Brashear said the President had been told about a specific case and replied Well I may get a review on this Dr Willke who was at the meeting agreed that the President had simply indicated he would like more information on that specific case It would be a gross misinterpretation to say the President responded in the affirmative to any suggestion of pardoning these people Dr Willke said The President told the leaders that their movement would benefit by an end to the violence against clinics Dr Willke said Songs Prayers and Pledges The antiabortion rally initiated and led by Nellie Gray a retired Federal employee who is a lawyer was marked by patriotic songs and prayers and pledges of support from numerous members of Congress Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York said The success of this movement is assured not only because its predicated on those JudeoChristian values upon which American was founded but because it is propeople Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina received some of the warmest applauses of the day No matter how long it takes right will eventually prevail the Senator told his audience The crowd was dotted with banners flags and signs some of which said The time for the choice is before conception and Jesus was a fetus Points of origin included Pennsylvania Maine Missouri and Wisconsin and organizers said virtually every other state Barbara Yasko of Waunakee Wis said she rode 22 hours on a bus to attend the rally I decided I wanted to step out and activate what I believe in Miss Yasko said Faith without activism is dead
BEHIND CUOMO'S ACTIONS: INSTINCT AND CALCULATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/nyregion/behind-cuomo-s-actions-instinct-and-calculation.html,Governor Cuomo questioned whether there was a Mafia He summoned the Legislature into special session only to see lawmakers reject all but one of his proposals and go home the same day He granted clemency to a convicted murderer but later a panel of his own Parole Board decided that the prisoner was unfit to be released into society And last week the Governor said he might be willing to run for President if only to prove wrong those who say an ItalianAmerican cannot win These actions by the Governor over the past month or so have drawn outrage from some people praise from others But for the most part they have left many people perplexed wondering just what he is up to and why The actions  some of them planned some done in the heat of the moment  say much about Mr Cuomo about his style of governing about a man who says he sometimes acts because of powerful instincts about a man who fights so hard to win that he can at times according to even his own aides bring about his own defeat If a lot of intelligent people tell me not to do something I think about it and take their advice the Governor said in an interview But the popular opinion of intelligent people can be off When you have a powerful instinct you ought to go with it It was such an instinct Mr Cuomo said that led him despite the advice of national Democratic leaders to confront speculation that an ItalianAmerican could not win the Presidency But while that and other actions by the Governor may have originated as instincts many also appear to be calculated political risks aimed at increasing his popularity There are indications that he has been served well by the previous times he has confronted controversial issues because of his strong personal feelings The Governors approval rating in publicopinion polls has risen over the last three years from 57 percent to about 70 percent Despite advice from his aides not to oppose a popular President Mr Cuomo led the fight last year against the Reagan Administrations plans to eliminate Federal incometax deductions for state and local taxes So farhe has succeeded  an important victory that has increased his national prominence Likewise the Governor was warned the year before not to get involved in a dispute with John Cardinal OConnor over whether Roman Catholic elected officials in executing public policy had an obligation to apply the churchs teachings against abortion Yet Mr Cuomo a Catholic turned the dispute to his advantage speaking eloquently about separation of church and state What I came to know about the Governor said Michael J Del Giudice his former chief of staff who is now an investment banker is that his sense of the body politic if you will is very keen He reads constantly he talks to people he samples the mail He is able to see patterns as theyre developing before others see them  and to make a judgment and move on them But some of the Governors more recent controversial actions have not so much been carefully thoughtout decisions on major policy as they have been spurofthemoment political slips When asked last month whether he would take action to save New York Citys 90cent transit fare for example Mr Cuomo dismissed the issue saying only that it was not on his agenda Later he acknowledged that his comment had been perceived as flip and that it had been a mistake Others of his actions came after careful deliberation His granting of clemency to Gary McGivern a convicted murderer was something he had been considering for three years When he announced it this month it drew an outcry from state Republican leaders and lawenforcement groups The Governor who said he had acted out of conscience went out of his way to point out that the White House had talked with state Republican leaders about making the clemency an election issue And he acknowledged that McGivern hurts me politically A key reason for his success in taking on politically controversial issues according to both his aides and his critics has been his ability to structure each debate so he is portrayed as the principled underdog fighting against public opinion and powerful institutions He did just that in his fight with the White House over the deductibility of state and local taxes He did it in his battle with the Cardinal over abortion And he is doing it in his fight against what he says is discrimination against ItalianAmericans portraying himself as the victim of widely held bias and as the lone voice against it He uses the ploy said Anthony J Colavita the state Republican chairman of making an issue out of something of being the one to create the issue then turning it around to make it look as if he didnt create it and is simply the victim who has to defend himself against the big boys But hes the big boy hes the Governor But while both the Governors aides and his critics agree that one of his strongest political talents is his ability to identify an issue and a method of attack they also agree that on occasion his personality leads him to get carried away They say he is still the athlete and the trial lawyer a man with a fierce will to win who is compelled to hammer away in an effort to score every debating point His aides acknowledge that there is no better example of how when carried to extreme such aggressiveness can hurt him than his comments about the Mafia Twice in an interview last month in which he talked about bias against ItalianAmericans Mr Cuomo denied the existence of the Mafia whose name he believes unfairly links all of organized crime to ItalianAmericans The Governor knows that there is a Mafia of course  he implied so during the interview and has repeatedly said it outright since then But he so wanted to prove why the word should not be used that he let his emotions and anger run away with him and denied the groups very existence I think the people are not like us the Governor said of those in the Albany political arena They dont react to the things we react to here They react to an overall perception of honesty and to a sincere effort of fighting for the state David Garth the political media consultant who talks with the Governor from time to time said If a candidate feels very strongly about an issue then my experience has been to let him run with it What the public reacts to is not so much the message as the sincerity If a candidate isnt sincere the public will be able to sense that
Men Emerging As Leaders In NOW Ranks,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/23/garden/men-emerging-as-leaders-in-now-ranks.html,THE recent election of Dr Robert Seidenberg as the first male president of the Greater Syracuse Chapter of the National Organization for Women inspired an editorialpage cartoon in a local newspaper It showed a bearded man wearing a dress and highheeled pumps being sworn into office by a woman in a mans pinstriped suit The significance of the cartoon was lost on its subject he recalled until the paper ran a letter to the editor noting that robes are worn by judges priests professors and others in offices of prestige So Dr Seidenberg said it was fitting that I be in womens robes  This 65yearold psychiatrist an early and active feminist is among a handful of men moving into leadership positions in NOWs 800 local chapters The exact number of chapters headed by men is unknown since the leadership roster of 1500 names is not broken down by sex but it is thought to be about 10 Many more NOW chapters including its two largest New York and Los Angeles have elected men to vice presidencies and other high offices Men have always made up between 5 and 10 percent of NOWs membership which stands currently at 173000 Yet according to longtime members like Frances Kolb who is writing a history of the 20yearold organizations first decade men have not always been welcome in its inner circle In the beginning  said Dr Kolb an Ashland Mass historian we felt it was good to have men in the womens movement because it showed that we were fair and equitable and that we believed men and women should have good relationships As a result at least one male face appeared on the national board until the early 1970s when the election process changed and when she said active hostility against men surfaced in NOW and other feminist organizations While traces of hostility persist Dr Kolb said now we just dont care about that kind of thing But no men have been national officers  she added Nor I guess are they likely to be Some feminist leaders notably Betty Friedan a founder of NOW advocate recruiting men as one cure for what she calls the profound paralysis of the womens movement Its passe she has said for feminists now to see men only as the enemy or to comtemplate separatist models for emotional or economic survival Sex roles and stereotypes are as deterimental to men as to women said Karen De Crow a former president of national NOW and a board member of the 200member chapter headed by Dr Seidenberg We want to get rid of sexism and the way to that is men and women side by side Despite such encouragement some men leading NOW chapters say they hesitated at first to run for office even when pressed by nominating committees It was not that they feared the ridicule of other men they said though there has been some of that Nor was it the criticism of women though there has been some of that too As Dr Seidenberg who took office last month put it I felt it would resonate too boringly with the image of the male taking over Thats why I served as secretary for several years to break stereotypes For some male leaders joining NOW was a logical outgrowth of civil rights activities Others were inspired by women in their lives usually wives and friends but also mothers and sisters Gerald Blum a 42yearold nuclear engineer in Pittsburgh became a member of the national organization 12 years ago during a second divorce He said the experience awakened in me a realization of sex roles and stereotypes For two years Mr Blum did no more than pay dues to NOW read the newsletter and write letters to legislators After joining the local South Hills chapter however he found himself picketing the White House traveling to conferences and defining feminism before the Lions Club and other male audiences In talks to mens groups Mr Blum former president of the 160member chapter and now copresident is often asked whether he encounters reverse discrimination Occasionally I do he acknowledged from a small minority of members You have to understand there are many women who have been treated badly by a few men in their lives and have difficulty not generalizing negative feelings to other men By contrast the Rev Tony Larsen pastor of the Unitarian Universalist Church in Racine Wis spoke of only positive reaction to his three years as chairman of the 20member NOW chapter there It meets in the church which has a history of concern with womens rights At first said the 36yearold minister now the chapters vice chairman I worried that maybe I wasnt the right person for the job but now I see that it probably is neat to have men in some leadership positions Among the activities that stand out in Mr Larsens mind are marches against rape an escort service for women who are being harassed outside abortion clinics a protest that led a department store chain to lift a ban on the wearing of slacks by female employees and a socalled sexorcism In it feminists read aloud from slips of paper containing sexist passages from the Bible and other religious writing and then burned the papers It was an effort to show that sexism is prevalent not just in the JudeoChristian tradition but in all religions said Mr Larsen Dr Seidenberg too mixes feminism with professional life He said he has observed the emotional damage caused by sex discrimination in male as well as female patients Everyone suffers when the games not played on a level field the psychiatrist said adding that men tend to justify their unwon advantages in one of two ways Either they work twice as hard to prove their superiority and suffer psychosomatic disorders he said or they become authoritarian figures again to justify the superiority Hobsons choice he said Dr Seidenberg and his wife Faith a lawyer who was once an officer of national NOW are both longtime feminists He has won respect in feminist circles by challenging the assumption that depressed women should be given pills and testifying to that effect before Congressional committees Twice as many women are on tranquilizers as should be he said Every medical magazine targets women as patients to be drugged While women have generally cheered his election he said men do not always take it seriously His barber for example joked that he was using his office to meet women The sexual fantasy is that a guy joins NOW for sex and the contrary thing is theyre a bunch of lesbians Dr Seidenberg said with a chuckle Well you cant have it both ways
Church Expels Parenthood Aide,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/24/us/church-expels-parenthood-aide.html,The Diocese of Providence has excommunicated the head of the states Planned Parenthood organization for what it called activities causing the sinful termination of human life But Mary Ann Sorrentino whose excommunication in June was made public this week said the churchs decision would not affect her work or her religious beliefs I am a Catholic and I will always be a Catholic Miss Sorrentino said Whether they give me communion or bury me in their church isnt going to change that The president of Planned Parenthood Faye Wattleton today called the churchs action political and religious persecution Miss Sorrentino 43 years old has been executive director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island for nine years The organization provides counseling on birth control and pregnancy and performs abortions I consider it is a discriminatory attack Miss Sorrentino said contrasting herself with Senator Edward M Kennedy and former Representative Geraldine A Ferraro both Catholics who support abortion rights The Rev Salvatore Matano vicar of administration for the diocese said the churchs ouster of Miss Sorrentino is a logical consequence of her position None of those is the head of an agency which in fact performs abortions Word of the excommunication came when a Rhode Island priest described her on an antiabortion program seen on several cable television outlets as public enemy No 1 of all babies being killed in the womb in Rhode Island
CHURCH CALLS EXCOMMUNICATED CATHOLIC ABORTION 'ACCOMPLICE',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/25/us/church-calls-excommunicated-catholic-abortion-accomplice.html,The Diocese of Providence has ruled that the director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island excommunicated herself from the Roman Catholic church by acting as an accomplice in abortions Several religious experts said the ruling against someone who has not directly participated in abortions was highly unusual I have not heard of that being done elsewhere said the Rev James H Provost executive coordinator at the Canon Law Society a professional association of church lawyers The diocese made the determination in the case of Mary Ann Sorrentino who has been director of the agency for nine years Mrs Sorrentino said that her agency operated a clinic that performed a thousand abortions a year In a letter to her dated June 14 1985 the dioceses Vicar for Administration the Rev Salvatore R Matano quoted Canon 1398 of the Churchs Code of Canon Law A person who procures a successful abortion incurs an automatic excommunication and Canon 1329 Accomplices who are not named in a law or in a precept incur an automatic penalty attached to an offense if it would not have been committed without their efforts The letter said that Mrs Sorrentino had incurred automatic excommunication by reason of the position of director Excommunicated Catholics are not permitted to receive communion make confession or go to Mass Priest Discloses Ruling The ruling was not made public at the time but was divulged by a priest on a Rhode Island cable television program about abortion which was shown Jan 22 the eve of the anniversary of the 1972 Supreme Court decision that struck down state antiabortion laws Of course it means a great deal to me personally Mrs Sorrentino said today in a telephone interview I have been a Roman Catholic ItalianAmerican woman for 42 years I feel very strongly about my roots People like me will understand in my culture my religion is very much a part of my life I will always be a Catholic in my heart The closest that I have been to abortions and I am not apologizing she added is I have been in the operating room suite holding the hands of women who have had abortions She noted that she was trained as a social worker and had accompanied patients from time to time to experience the experience of our patients I have found thats some of the most rewarding work Ive done she added Mrs Sorrentino said that the issue of her status arose in May two days before her 15yearold daughter was due to be confirmed Church officials demanded that the girl be interrogated about her own position on abortion Mrs Sorrentino said Only after the individual interview did they allow her daughter to be confirmed Mrs Sorrentino said The girl was previously interviewed by a parish priest along with the 75 other members of her confirmation class Mrs Sorrentino said They waited until the dress was bought the caterer hired and the relatives were ready to go she said The cruel thing of bringing in a child with mother and father there asking her to say to a priest I hate what my mother stands for and I think shes a cruel person that wasnt wasted on us Mrs Sorrentino said Calls to the diocese yesterday afternoon were referred to Father Matano who did not return a message She said that her agency did not advise women to have abortions but it answers their questions about the procedure and about alternatives and refers women to prenatal care if they decide to complete their pregnancies Several experts said that the action by the Rhode Island diocese was unusual A reasonable person would not have assumed that the canon would apply to the executive director of the organization said the Rev Richard McBrien chairman of the department of theology at Notre Dame University in South Bend Ind Most Catholics would believe it applies to the woman Many Catholics would think it applies only to the woman Another complicating factor would be whether it was clear beforehand to Mrs Sorrentino that the penalty for her role was excommunication he said The code of canon law says if youve got these kind of doubts theres a pretty good basis for saying its not automatic Mr McBrien said Its not that you cant kick her out its that youve got to have a process If a person is a director of a hospital in which abortions are performed the person who directs is not considered to incur excommunication the person who performs is Mr Provost said Much would depend upon how the local situation in Rhode Island is set up He added that individuals usually are not considered directly involved unless they make a specific referral themselves Mrs Sorrentino said that she could appeal the churchs ruling but in the current climate it isnt worth the postage to request a hearing The Code of Canon Law lists seven offenses for which automatic excommunication is the penalty of which four apply to laymen participation in an abortion an attack on the Pope desecration of the Holy Eucharist and defiant heresy The others are violating the confidentiality of the confession granting absolution to an accomplice in a sex crime and the illicit ordination of a bishop

BUSH SALUTES FALWELL CONSERVATISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/25/us/bush-salutes-falwell-conservatism.html,Vice President Bush intensifying his political courtship of Republican conservatives and religious fundamentalists said today that America is in crying need of the moral vision he said the Rev Jerry Falwell and his followers had brought to the political process Let me say go for it Mr Bush declared in urging a gathering of state leaders of Mr Falwells Liberty Federation to become more politically active The federation is a political organization formed recently by the founder of Moral Majority to mobilize conservatives who support his views on domestic and foreign issues Moral Majority has become a subsidiary of the federation Mr Bush who already has Mr Falwells endorsement for President urged the leaders of the federation not to let critics who have denounced their movement as moral McCarthyism drive them out of the political process America is in crying need of the moral vision you have brought to our political life the Vice President said At another point Mr Bush said What great goals you have Endorsement of Its Issues Mr Bush was cheered and applauded as he endorsed the main issues on the organizations agenda including opposition to abortion a call for prayer in public schools American aid to rebel groups fighting to overthrow the governments of Angola and Nica rauga and support for President Reagans proposed spacebased missile defense system That was good preaching Mr Falwell said after the Vice President sat down drawing scattered Amens from the audience Mr Bushs salute to the Falwell organization came less than 24 hours after he made one of his strongest political speeches to date Speaking at a fundraising dinner of the Conservative Party of New York Thursday night Mr Bush accused Governor Cuomo of being soft on crime and of pitting one American against another by raising the question of ethnic bigotry in national politics Ignored a Rival At the New York event the Vice President ignored one of his chief rivals for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination Representative Jack F Kemp of Upstate New York and instead directed sharp words at Governor Cuomo who is considered a potential Democratic Presidential contender in 1988 Mr Bushs political advisers contend that any challenge to the Vice President will have to come from the Republican right and a key element in their strategy for the nomination is for Mr Bush to move early to try to lock up that element of the party But some analysts say that while that strategy may work in the nomination battle it could saddle Mr Bush with some heavy ideological baggage in a general election campaign against a moderate Democrat In the coming weeks both the Mr Bush and Mr Kemp are scheduled to increase their visibility before conservative audiences With the exception of Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the former Senate majority leader all of the Republican Presidential hopefuls are scheduled to address the 13th Annual Conservative Political Action Committee Conference a major gathering of conservative activists that will convene Jan 30 in Washington Question of Effectiveness The lineup of Republican Presidential hopefuls at the conference includes Mr Bush Mr Kemp Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the majority leader former Gov Pierre du Pont of Delaware and Pat Robertson a television evangelist Mr Bushs political strategists were calling the backtoback events in New York and Washington a political success some of Mr Kemps forces contended that the Vice Presidents combativeness in the New York speech would yield only shortterm political gains One Kemp adviser who asked not to be identified called Mr Bushs attack on Governor Cuomo injudicious and baffling especially since Senator Alfonse DAmato Republican of New York and the Governor both Italian Americans have a good working relationship A top Bush strategist who also insisted on anonymity rejoined Kemp might as well have not been at the New York dinner Look at who made the news This strategist contended that Mr Bush was steadily gaining support among conservatives without any seepage in his traditional base and added that Mr Bush was not concerned about any criticism for his overtures to conservatives Paul Weyrich a leading conservative activist said today that he thought the political punches the Vice President threw at Mr Cuomo could improve the perception of Mr Bushs political character Two of Bushs problems are that he is perceived as not being a true believer and as being a weak political individual said Mr Weyrich who heads the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress I think attacking Cuomo can help make those things less of an issue if he keeps it up Mr Weyrich said Mr Kemp was in good shape among conservatives but added that Ive been surprised Jack hasnt wrapped up more hard core conservatives than he has Vice President Bush he said is going to be hard to beat Another conservative activist Howard Phillips of the Conservative Caucus Political Action Committee said Mr Bush was benefitting at the moment from the reluctance of conservatives to criticize Reagan policies and in this vacuum of a debate on the issues he added Mr Bush is enjoying the advantages of his incumbency
WHY ITALY IS SURPRISINGLY HOSPITABLE TO FEMINISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/weekinreview/why-italy-is-surprisingly-hospitable-to-feminism.html,Italian men are famous the world over for their aggressive affronts to female dignity and other sins against equality between the sexes So it might have come as something of a surprise this month when Prime Minister Bettino Craxi and Marisa Bellisario the managing director of Italtel the state communications company announced plans to improve the status of women in Italys workplaces Mr Craxi a Socialist who leans toward the political center declared flatly that Italy is a place in which the man is privileged and the woman is discriminated against Yet the announcement did not strike many younger Italian women as anything extraordinary an indication of how outofdate is the worlds view of the way Italy treats women After all they note the country passed its equivalent of the American equal rights amendment years ago Alida Castelli a leader of the working womens section of the Communist Party pointed to measures designed to protect the jobs of pregnant women insure womens property rights and expand parental leave after the birth of a child to cover fathers as well as mothers From a different political perspective Federica Olivares founded a group called Women in Careers an organization of managers and entrepreneurs aged 27 to 40 You remember the old boys network Mrs Olivares said Well we are the young girls network In the early days the womens movement in Italy and in other West European countries was more radical than that in the United States and less concerned with daytoday issues many women here say As a result Mrs Olivares said we are five to seven years behind our American cousins But in the long run Mrs Olivares said Italian women may be better off in part because Italian men despite their reputation may have always had a better image of women than other men The Italian mother of popular lore she noted was always a strong figure At one time conservatives in Italy and other heavily Roman Catholic countries won elections partly because large numbers of devout women voted for them In Italy they were the backbone of the vote for the longdominant Christian Democrats But the European left has made inroads in the last decade by winning away younger women with promises of greater opportunities In referendums on divorce and abortion Italians voted overwhelmingly in favor of liberalized laws  against the wishes of both the Vatican and the Christian Democrats In France the governing Socialists have made a big play to women through a variety of actions including at one time appointing a Government Minister who was dedicated to womens rights In light of this Mr Craxis recent socalled Women and Technology initiatives are hardly radical The experiment amounts to a limited affirmative action program that will be tried in Mrs Bellisarios company by the regional government of Lombardia where Milan is and by the Banca Nazionale del Lavoro the stateowned bank and Italys largest commercial bank The project at the bank will study why young universityeducated women do not move ahead faster and it will seek ways to help them along Most of the attention will be directed at the new hightechnology industries  a pragmatic choice some women said because it is easier to prevent barriers from being erected than to tear down the ones that exist The majority of the developing activities linked to the new technologies have a woman dimension totally unknown in the old productive processes said Mr Craxi in a statement that might make some feminists wince Hightech industries are also more likely to offer flexible hours he noted which are attractive to working mothers Mrs Bellisario has no illusions that the proposals will dramatically improve opportunities for women She said pointedly that she hoped they would encourage action by the big privatesector companies who are not represented here The countrys workforce is still dominated by men with women making up only about a third of it In industry the figure is about onefourth For all the improvements here women are still vastly underrepresented at the top she and Mr Craxi said As might be expected the womens movement is generally far stronger in the cities than in the countryside and in the modern north than in the more traditional south But Mrs Castelli who was named to the board of the Women and Technology project noted that the differences between north and south are not always as clear cut as they seem Recently she said two factories  one in Milan and one in Aquila farther south  were forced to lay off workers When the time came for the workers to go back full time women in Aquila could take up their jobs immediately The women in Aquila were able to take advantage of the extended family  their grandmothers to take care of their children Mrs Castelli said For the women in Milan it was more difficult to reorganize their family life In Italy she seemed to say even tradition sometimes works in womens favor
A NEW LOOK AT 'NOBLE SUFFERING',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/books/a-new-look-at-noble-suffering.html,PRAY my dear    have you not forgot to wind up the clock asks Mrs Shandy at the crucial moment of Tristrams conception and threeandahalf volumes later when face blackened and nose squashed Tristram finally makes a precarious entry into the world at the clumsy hands of Dr Slop we witness the first descriptive childbirth scene in English fiction Old rake of an English clergyman that he was in Tristram Shandy Laurence Sterne found childbirth like all of life subject for satire Dickens in turn would put upon it his customary stamp of morbid pathos Oliver Twists birth in a typically awful English workhouse attended by a ginimbibing pauper woman and an indifferent parish surgeon would necessarily conclude with the death of the pretty young mother Only one major novelist of the 18th and another of the 19th century attempted to write of childbirth Both were men both wrote in extremes of literary idiosyncracy Nowhere on either side of the Atlantic was there anything approaching Tolstoys naturalistic portrayal of birth in Anna Karenina By the early part of this century male novelists  Galsworthy Wells Forster Lawrence among others  were portraying childbirth but from the comfortable orientation of the fictional father And nowhere did a woman novelist of note assert feminine rights to the subject I think the somewhat belated involvement of women writers in the description of childbirth was prompted partly by the general avoidance in the 19th and preJoycean 20th centuries of dealing with bodily functions and concerns but more by the reluctance of women writers to stretch their luck by taking what must have seemed to them too great a step into forbidden realms Perhaps they felt it was audacious enough for them to write at all and to write so well and to write of passion and the occasional fruits of passion the illegitimate child Then too until after the first quarter of this century no celebrated woman novelist in the English language had had a child Jane Austen was not only childless but almost surely lived out her life a virgin Of the three Brontes Charlotte did marry and have a child but not until just before her death George Eliots connection with George Henry Lewes was apparently by design without issue Nineteenthcentury exceptions that come to mind  Mrs Gaskell Harriet Beecher Stowe Olive Schreiner Kate Chopin  cannot really be counted major novelists MATTERS remained much the same in the early 20th century Edith Wharton had no children Virginia Woolf no children Willa Cather no children Woolf incorporates childbirth in Orlando and again in Flush but obliquely Cather approaches it in My Antonia but pulls up short What a loss If only the sunbrowned Antonia had borne one of those wonderful children on stage instead of in the wings The situation was bound to change as the sheer number of women novelists proliferated toward the middle of the century My own earliest experience of childbirth in fiction came during my adolescent reading no Judy Blume then of Pearl Buck the bent bodies of Wang Lung and his wife Olan in the rice fields she well along in pregnancy but matching him row for row until that afternoon she has to stop early to give birth to their first child alone That was The Good Earth The heroine of Pavilion of Women is the elegant purposeful Madame Wu who renounced all matters of the flesh on her 40th birthday at 12 I thought that reasonable and arranged for a concubine for her husband Madame Wu is sent for to try to save the life of her childhood friend the fat and inelegant Madame Kang already mother of many now dying in childbirth Madame Wu insists that Kang be present to observe the desperate straits to which he has brought his wife by the time the baby is at last delivered Kang is a weakkneed wreck Pearl Buck was my introduction to life  not only childbirth but lust greed starvation violence sodomy How have the producers of miniseries overlooked her I think Pearl Buck writing in the 1930s and 40s out of her observations of women not of her culture served as a bridge between the symbolic approach of male novelists and the intimate immediate tone of women who more and more began to portray childbirth as they experienced it Inevitably when men included a birth scene in a novel the womans ordeal precipitated a change in the man  an awakening a rite of passage from B to C Even Tolstoy with his inimitable descriptive powers evokes the scene that he himself saw when his wife Sonia gave birth to their first child and allots Kitty a secondary role Levin has all the good lines Anais Nins story Birth published in 1948 is the earliest naturalistic presentation of childbirth I know of in our literature  the first time we are not looking over the fathers or the doctors or the midwifes shoulder but lying stretched out on the table with the laboring woman feeling her pain her exhaustion her rage Connecting labor with anger is I think unique to women writers There was certainly pain before  fear resignation sometimes irony  but never before were these noble sufferers betrayed by having their anger described for an audience that was supposed to be witnessing them at their most saintly moment In the childbirth literature of the last half century however there is often anger It is sometimes submerged sometimes surfacing usually caused by the helplessness regularly experienced by women in this country in the late 40s and 50s The struggle between motherright and medical authority took on momentum in those years In Nins Birth the woman knows that her baby premature is already dead but there is a part of her that does not want to deliver the child because it is hers her flesh and with its birth she will lose it forever She resists the doctor as long as she can At last she expels the child and immediately a new struggle is initiated The nurses do not want to show it to her It isnt done Primitive instinct battles against practicality motherright against authority Which is not to say that all women knew as well as Nins character what they wanted Most of them learned as they went along In the early 1950s Doris Lessing offered us in A Proper Marriage what was surely the lengthiest and most selfexamined literary pregnancy up to that time culminating in a minutely described labor and delivery followed by a prolonged lyingin Martha Quest is 19 years old conventionally married part of the middleclass white society of southern Africa When she finally goes into labor and enters a nursing home we share her indignation when she must make do with a hard deliveryroom table share her rage when during the agony of the contractions she cannot remember the intervening painlessness and during the intervals of rest cannot recall the pain She is scolded when she screams She hears herself call to God and to her mother both of whom she has repudiated in a more rational hour and is only eased when the scrubwoman washing the floor lays her black hand on her stomach and croons Let the baby come let the baby come let the baby come There is resolution in the natural that has been lost to the sophisticated state IT was this conflict with an obdurate authority that was reflected by the women writers of the 1940s 50s and into the 60s in both childbirth and postpartum scenes The villain was the hospital system a new mothers wishes were inconsequential Poor anxious little Priss Hartshorn in The Group by Mary McCarthy lying there in New York Hospital in the mid1930s torn between her pediatricianhusbands infant feeding theories probreast and hospital policy probottle forced to conform to a schedule that left her baby howling for much of the day and night feeling even when he was brought to her that he had no real connection to her but was just a piece of hospital property temporarily placed in her custody Almost no one writes favorably of giving birth in the 1950s at least not in this country In her autobiographical Of Woman Born Adrienne Rich suggests that both the woman who was unconscious and the conscious woman attempting to surmount her pain in natural childbirth were rejecting the passive suffering of an earlier time but had little sense of being in command Esther in The Bell Jar by Sylvia Plath watches a normal  that is drugged  hospital delivery with her medicalstudent boyfriend and wonders afterward if there is any other way to have a baby She is not appeased by his explanation that the drug would make the groaning woman forget the pain I thought it sounded just like the sort of drug a man would invent she says and she would go straight home and start another baby because the drug would make her forget how bad the pain had been Our literature bears out then that for the average woman of the 1940s and 50s giving birth was little different from anything else in womens experience Men were still in charge The system remained its code was not yet broken The woman in labor the woman expelling her child the woman whose newborn sucked from her breast was still just a woman The Pill brought a new maneuverability In The Womens Room Marilyn Frenchs heroine looks back at the prePill era and says I dont know what it is like to be pregnant voluntarily I assume its a very different experience from that of the women I know Marilyn French reminds us that the helplessness did not begin when the woman went into labor in unsympathetic surroundings it began nine months before And a woman who feels victimized by her pregnancy may or may not be a good mother Most of the women I knew who had unplanned often unwelcome pregnancies in the 50s and 60s were like Marilyn Frenchs women pretty good mothers Others were less so Martha Quest loved her child but left her when still a baby Meridian in Alice Walkers novel of that name loved hers impersonally as she might the moon or a tree loved him enough to give him away because she was afraid that in her anger she might kill him Felicitas in The Company of Women by Mary Gordon did not love hers until years later Are these fictional extremes or are they honest expressions of how a woman may feel when a child disrupts the direction of her life Our literature also reflects of course the alternative method of dealing with an unwanted pregnancy In fiction the decision for abortion is seldom an easy one seldom made and forgotten The heroine who coolly assesses her options acts and moves on is rare Do our novelists exploit the situation for the drama and selfsearching inherent in it Or are they reflecting precarious stretches of emotional uncertainty that lie below the surface in us all Given a heroines equivocation given pre1973 surreptitious arrangements involving nondescript rooms and faces I always want the heroine to cut and run Escape while she still can I could hardly refrain from cheering when Mary Gordons Felicitas waiting her turn in the plastic reception room in the Bronx does a quick double take and ducks out I wanted Maria Joan Didions heroine of Play It as It Lays to do the same It makes no sense for Felicitas uncertain who is the father or Maria whose lover is married to another to bear these children If I and others similarly affected are at heart prowoman perhaps prochoice why are we tense with anxiety Why do we so fervently want our heroines to reconsider Because I think we know how much the choice entails We are afraid for their psyches We would be have been afraid for our own Today women have more life choices than ever before the nuances have shifted When we hold our potential maternity in our own hands we have to listen to the voices of our deeper consciousness In her book In Search of Our Mothers Gardens Alice Walker describes being terrified of having children feeling fractured by the experience She compromised on  and strongly advocates one child Alice Walker is not alone in considering motherhood We have Erica Jong to thank for reminding us in a letter to The Book Review two years ago who among our contemporary women have written on the subject of childbirth and motherhood besides those already mentioned and herself they include Toni Morrison Marge Piercy Rosellen Brown Penelope Mortimer Anne Roiphe Susan Fromberg Schaffer Tillie Olsen Grace Paley Muriel Rukeyser and Anne Morrow Lindbergh Colette Dowling Anne Tyler and Nora Ephron are three more and quite recently Alice Hoffman Not surprisingly when we consider the dimensions of our current involvement we are now being offered novels in which pregnancy childbearing and parental emotion are the whole story In Fortunes Daughter which exactly spans the ninemonth gestation period in a young womans life Alice Hoffman intertwines Raes fate with that of Lila an older woman who a generation before that is back in the evil 50s bore an illegitimate child and gave her up In contrast to the heartwrenching account of Lilas delivery and the quarter of a century of agonized recriminations that follow Raes pregnancy becomes for the reader an increasingly pleasurable experience Although unmarried and abandoned by her boyfriend her pregnancy gives her confidence a new control over her life She is no victim there is no anger At the books end Rae the prodigal boyfriend returned Lila and Lilas husband all leave for the hospital and what will apparently be a very communal delivery We know we are part of a brave and highly satisfactory new world WITH The Cider House Rules by John Irving we come full circle A male novelist has returned to the fray and we are back looking over the doctors shoulder the shoulder of Wilbur Larch ensconced in his remote Maine orphanage Larch divides his time between delivering babies to unmarried mothers performing abortions on women who would otherwise resort to the butchery of quacks and sniffing ether But for all his courage and humanity Wilbur Larch is part of the medical authority that Anais Nin and Mary McCarthy among others rejected Mr Irving makes that clear At times Nurse Angela  one of Larchs two saintly helpmates  wondered if Dr Larch knew how he tended to overlook women she wondered if this was an occupational hazard among obstetricians or if men with a tendency to overlook women were drawn to the obstetrical field John Irving marks a major reentry of the male novelist into the world of childbirth and obstetrics a world that women writers have recently so dominated He has also shown himself willing to join the dialogue on abortion Others will follow They can provide an appropriate and welcome addition to the graphic the gritty the intimate vision of our contemporary women
CONGRESS ENVISIONS A YEAR TO FORGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/weekinreview/congress-envisions-a-year-to-forget.html,When Republican leaders had breakfast at the White House last week they listened quietly as President Reagan sketched out a budget proposal that would slice deficits solely by reducing domestic programs Lower defense spending and higher taxes were ruled out No voice was raised in opposition to the Presidents plan but later in the day Senator Thad Cochran of Mississippi joked that it was a good thing none of the Republican leaders had been asked to take lie detector tests By weeks end at another White House meeting Congressional Republicans began to lose patience with Mr Reagan Participants in the meetings said they had warned him that unless he showed more flexibility and leadership on budget matters the Republican Party could splinter and lose its Senate majority next fall Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the minority leader in the House stressed after the meeting We are headed for some kind of negotiated settlement Something has got to give This tension between Republican leaders and the White House summed up the dominant mood on Capitol Hill as the lawmakers returned for the second session of the 99th Congress They are looking forward to the year with all the relish usually accorded root canal work And the main reason is the fear and uncertainty so many feel over the implications of the new law that requires them to balance the budget in annual steps over the next five years If those steps are not taken automatic cuts will go into effect and many lawmakers agree with Representative Silvio O Conte a Massachusetts Republican when he calls the measure a disastrous piece of work The legislators got a taste of that disaster when James Miller the Director of the Office of Management and Budget said last week that if the automatic cuts are implemented in the next fiscal year military spending will drop 18 percent and domestic outlays by 25 percent Any deficitreduction plan that could forestall the automatic cuts many Congressman think must include new taxes and lower defense spending But as long as the President is adamantly opposed to both elements the lawmakers will remain frozen by indecision This paralysis is only aggravated by the elections now less than 10 months away Twentytwo Republican Senate seats will be up and a net gain of only four slots would put the Democrats back in control next January Accordingly Senate Republicans are eager to move forward on a bipartisan compromise as fast as possible so voters will have time to forget the Presidents proposals before they go to the polls We want to prove that we can govern said Mr Cochran the secretary of the Republican conference We can blame some of our problems on the Democrats but not all In his weekly radio address yesterday the President perhaps providing a preview of Tuesdays State of the Union message said he needed the help of Republicans and Democrats in the Congress if we are to solve the serious problems confronting our nation For now the Democrats seem ready to blame most of their problems on the Republicans Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the House is in no hurry to form a bipartisan coalition and shift the spotlight away from the Presidents budget which is due next week The Democrats reason that Mr Reagans plan for extensive cuts in domestic programs will prove wildly unpopular and they want to make sure everybody knows about it While Congress seems fixated on the budget issue the President is likely to use his State of the Union message to reemphasize his interest in overhauling the income tax code A 1400page revision was adopted by the House late last year and under pressure from the White House the Senate Finance Committee is taking up the issue The Senators show little enthusiasm for the project but see no way out of it If a bill does finally clear the Senate perhaps next summer it is likely to be more favorable to business than the House version and it could well include new revenues to help trim the deficit International trade is another issue likely to crowd the Congressional agenda and cause problems with the Administration Mr Reagan believes that sanctions against Americas trading partners would invite retaliation and lead to a spiraling economic war But many areas of the country are suffering from foreign imports and Democrats see the issue as the best way to attack the Reagan economic record Accordingly Congress is likely to adopt some form of legislation that cracks down on unfair trade practices abroad Among the items left over from last year is a rewriting of the immigration laws A storm blew up around the issue last week as an Administration report asserted that restricting the flow of immigration would impose heavy burdens on the economy At weeks end however the White House said it still wanted Congress to deal with the issue this year After five years of the Reagan presidency the legislative agenda of many conservatives also remains unfinished Protesters demanding an end to legalized abortion crowded the capital last week Mr Reagan reiterated his support for their cause but Congress seems in no mood to reverse the court decision that permitted women to terminate pregnancies On the foreign policy front White House officials said last week that Mr Reagan would soon request 100 million in new aid to the insurgents fighting the Government of Nicaragua more than half would be for military help which is now banned by Congress The White House hopes that repressive policies by Managua have switched Congressional sentiment in favor of military support but Democratic leaders predicted that the House would still reject the measure The Administration faces an even tougher battle if it tries to sell sophisticated new weapons to Jordan or to aid rebels fighting the Government of Angola
On Language; Secs Appeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/26/magazine/on-language-secs-appeal.html,DO YOU KNOW WHAT secular humanism is asked Norman Lear a few months ago subtly knocking the term in a letter to what he called a number of wellknown educators artists and public officials like yourself Myself I prefer like you and dont know exactly which directmail category applies to me but I will try to illuminate and aggravate the controversy about the phrase A spokesman for Mr Lears People for the American Way says Trying to define secular humanism is like trying to nail JellO to a tree Good metaphor often used would the coiner step forward In making the point that the phrase has different meanings to different people the organization sought to show that the phrase has no widely accepted meaning and thus did not belong in legislation Definitions do vary Secular humanism to the evangelist James Kennedy is a godless atheistic evolutionary amoral collectivist socialistic communistic religion posing a threat to schoolchildren To Michael J Rosenberg editor of Near East Report Secular humanist has become the new label employed to indict anyone who opposes school prayer believes in evolution or disagrees with the religious rights views on abortion Roy R Torcaso an outspoken atheist who was plaintiff in the 1961 case in which the phrase was popularized and is still one of the few people who calls himself a secular humanist cites the definition given by Corliss Lamont in his book The Philosophy of Humanism    joyous service for the greater good of all humanity in this natural world and advocating the methods of reason science and democracy I would describe most secular humanists as ethical atheists who try to do good without believing in God But that is not the definition as many humanists are agnostics and some who accept the label are churchgoers No pop lexicographer can lay down the law on what the phrase means I can only report what disputants say it means and put forward a definition that encompasses its different senses People in the word dodge can however trace the history of a term and the etymon teaches us where the attacker or defender is coming from Not comes from which means place of origin is coming from which uses the present progressive is coming instead of the simple present comes to show continuing action is colloquial English meaning the context or experience in which the speaker has reached his conclusion and should prove useful enough in time to become Standard English The preceding is a parenthetical remark Both preceding parenthetical remarks constitute a tangent In 1984 Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah wrote a paragraph in an education bill saying that Federal money for magnet schools may not be used for courses of instruction the substance of which is secular humanism Last year the United States Department of Education decided not to define the term but to leave its definition up to local schools That raised a further ruckus Senator Hatchs spokesman explained the intent of the original phrase in the legislation was to make sure that magnet schools improve their curriculums and not get into soft stuff such as personal values or courses in life styles the controversial phrase was dropped in the current legislation The civilliberties groups and Mr Lear won this round The phrase was probably taken from a footnote in the decision written in 1961 by Justice Hugo L Black in Torcaso v Watkins which in turn was taken from an amicus brief in that case written by Joseph L Blau professor emeritus of religion at Columbia University The footnotes point Among religions in this country however which do not teach what would generally be considered belief in the existence of God are Buddhism Taoism Ethical Culture Secular Humanism and others Go back further to 1952 and an essay by C Wright Mills Liberals have repeatedly articulated a secular humanism stressing the priceless value of the individual personality    The first citation in MerriamWebsters files is from a religious work in 1933 William G Pecks The Social Implications of the Oxford Movement in which secular humanism is opposed to Catholicism In face of this secular humanism the return of the Oxford leaders to Catholic doctrine and practice necessarily signified a criticism of the secular standpoint and the provision of a positive alternative If you have an earlier citation join the fun How does this etymology help us understand the furor raised by the phrase Secular is an adjective that means worldly not religious or otherworldly humanism is a concern for the human condition The modifier secular emphasizes the nonreligious character of the fuzzy noun humanism I think the phrase was construed by a growing number of clergymen especially evangelicals to be a euphemism for atheism No doubt a goodly number of secular humanists are atheists to them however the phrase subsumed atheism in a much broader philosophy of ethical values stressing individualism acting rightly unmotivated by the fear of God or promise of Heaven That broadening made secular humanism an even more inviting target to preachers than atheism because godlessness had been denounced so heatedly for so long Here was a way to slam opposition to prayer in schools to castigate sex education in schools to blast abortion  all potent social issues  while mixing in disapproval of the drug culture permissiveness pornography short skirts and livein lovers and tying all these in to a rejection of belief in God The target was Heavensent or heavensent as you prefer People who disagreed with many fervent religionists on one or more of the social issues but who firmly believed in God resented being lumped in with atheists and all the others They saw secular humanism as a linguistic bludgeon a chance to beat over the head all who oppose the religious right with a club incorporating all the issues Thats what the fight over a phrase is about Secular humanism may be defined as 1 a philosophy of ethical behavior unrelated to a concept of God 2 a characterization of an emphasis on individual moral choices as having the common denominator of atheism 3 an attempt to besmear political opponents by impugning their faith in God Its a bareknuckles fight and etymology lexicography and semantics are right in the middle of it Flakes Will Fall PRESIDENT REAGAN IN A news conference called the Libyan leader Muammar elQaddafi flaky This is not one of your regular diplomatic terms of art like intransigent next day from the highest levels of the White House came this urgent call What is the derivation and current meaning of flaky Frankly I had been awaiting a different query How come there is no u after the Q in Qaddafi Answer on the back of my tongue a Q without a u is intended to represent the velar sound of k Although Shakespeare used the adjective in Richard III to describe the breaking of dawn  and flaky darkness breaks within the east  the word in its current slang meaning of offbeat eccentric was first reported by Leonard Koppett in The New York Times in 1964 Baseball players like Joe Pepitone Jim Bouton and Phil Linz were said to be flaky The term appears to have replaced kook as a synonym for nutty although as Mr Reagan pointed out it is not used to mean mentally deranged a more serious affliction It is sometimes spelled flakey to insure pronunciation with a long a to differentiate it from flak an acronym for Flieger Abwehr Kanone meaning criticism The last time flaky was used politically was in derogation of Gov Jerry Brown of California who responded vigorously by denouncing those in favor of building bigger nuclear power plants They are the flakes
BRIEFING; Let's Poll All the Lawyers,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/27/us/briefing-let-s-poll-all-the-lawyers.html,The old political saw that the Supreme Court follows the election returns is probably a good deal less valid than the idea that the Justices decisions reflect the views of most lawyers As a result there is considerable interest in how lawyers see the issues now before the High Court enough interest so that the American Bar Association has engaged a public opinion research firm Kane Parsons  Associates of New York to take the professions pulse For example the Justices are now pondering two cases that impelled the Justice Department to propose a reversal of the decision in 1973 that recognized a constitutional right to abortion The finding of one of the bar associations polls published in its monthly magazine was than 53 percent of American lawyers favor the original decision 22 percent want it overruled and 10 percent would modify it In another case the Administration is defending Federal regulations designed to force lifeprolonging treatment for severely handicapped newborns over parental objections the poll shows 57 percent of lawyers disagreeing with that position The Court is also weighing the question of the obligation a criminal lawyer owes a client who says he plans to commit perjury A forthcoming poll shows 71 percent favor the lawyers withdrawal from the case 17 percent would tell the client that the lawyer would disclose any perjury and 7 percent would inform the judge after such perjury The polls involve telephone interviews with a random sample of 600 lawyers around the country regardless of membership in the association The surveys and are subject to a sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points
"Contempt for Abortion, and Tolerance",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/27/opinion/contempt-for-abortion-and-tolerance.html,Last week marked the 13th anniversary of Roe v Wade the Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion and Washington was once more the scene of the March for Life rally The crowd was only half what it was last year but the enthusiasm was the same  and so was the host We will continue to work together with Congress President Ronald Reagan told the crowd to overturn the tragedy of Roe v Wade The Supreme Court decision does not endorse abortion it leaves up to a woman and her doctor the choice to continue a pregnancy at least during the first trimester It allows some limitation on abortion in the second trimester and even greater limitation in the third Nonetheless many Americans oppose the decision some so strenuously that they line the entrances to abortion clinics harassing and hissing the patients Often by letter and telephone they threaten bombs and arson Sometimes they follow through The abortion argument didnt begin with Roe v Wade however It has divided humankind for centuries and probably always will One side of the debate finds abortion a morally indefensible destruction of life the other finds forcing a woman to incubate a fetus against her will an equally immoral invasion of her right to control her body Roe v Wade made clear that however passionate the debate neither side has the superior moral claim Instead Justice Blackmun held that a womans rights must be weighed against the fetuss growing potential for life From this he reasoned that the states interest in protecting life increases as the fetus grows closer to term That profoundly humane effort to accommodate deep moral conflicts was in the finest American tradition of tolerance Mr Reagans long opposition to abortion made predictable his welcome to the demonstrators followed by his advice quoted by a member of the National Right to Life Committee that an end to violence would earn their movement a lot of brownie points Surely millions of Americans hoped for something more from a President especially one whose fondest promise was to get the Government off peoples backs This was after all the anniversary of a Supreme Court decision that gave practical voice not to abortion or to its foes but to tolerance and liberty

REAGAN URGES CONSERVATIVES TO UNITE AND PRESS AGENDA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/01/31/us/reagan-urges-conservatives-to-unite-and-press-agenda.html,President Reagan urged conservatives tonight to press ahead with their agenda of domestic and foreign policy issues saying the tide of history is all but irreversibily turned our way But he warned that conservatives could face a costly tactical defeat in this years Congressional elections unless they pull together Speaking before the Conservative Political Action Conference Mr Reagan said conservatives should thrust their issues to the front of this years political debate Mr Reagan said We must tell the American people that the progress we made thus far is not enough that it will never be enough until the conservative agenda is enacted and that means enterprise zones prayer in the public schools and the protection of the unborn Meese on States Rights Speaking before the same conference earlier today Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d said true conservatives should support the rights of the states to pass liberal abortion laws restrict sales of pistols or take other steps that are opposed by the Reagan Administration and many of its supporters Mr Reagan echoing many of the themes of his 1984 Presidential campaign said the outcome of this years Congressional elections will decide whether the days of high taxes and higher spending the days of economic stagflation and skyrocketing inflation the days of national malaise and international humiliation the days of Blame America First and inordinate fear of communism will all come roaring back at us once again The President said liberal Democrats knew that unless they delivered a telling blow against Republicans in November the 1988 Presidential race will be dominated by conservatives in both parties Liberals Hiding and Waiting My fellow conservatives he added lets get the message out loud and clear The Washington liberals and the San Francisco Democrats arent extinct  theyre just in hiding waiting for another try Many of the conservatives in the audience were among Mr Reagans earliest and most zealous supporters in his long campaign for the White House While celebrating his Presidency they will spend much of their time here looking over most of the potential Republican candidates who will be bidding to succeed Mr Reagan In the next two days the conference will hear from Vice President Bush Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York Bob Dole of Kansas the Senate majority leader and former Gov Pierre S du Pont 4th of Delaware Mr Bush is scheduled to speak Friday night at the conferences dinner honoring Jonas Savimbi the leader of rebel forces fighting to overthrow the Marxist government of Angola Conservatives have made American support for Mr Savimbi one of their principal foreign policy battles Although Mr Reagan has publicly suggested channeling covert aid to Mr Savimbis forces many conservatives are unhappy with the position Secretary of State George P Shultz has taken against openly providing any financial assistance to the rebels Baker Shuns Cattle Show The only prospective Republican Presidential candidate missing from the conference program is Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the former Senate majority leader David Spear a spokesman for Mr Baker said the former Senator had declined an invitation to speak because he was scheduled to be traveling in the Middle East The trip was subsequently canceled He said Mr Baker would be making his case for conservative support but added Were not going to partake of every cattle show that comes down the pike In his address Mr Meese said issues of public or civic morality such as abortion were best decided by the states The toughest political problems deserve to have full and open debate he said Whether the issue is abortion pornography or aid to parochial schools there is no constitutionally explicit reason why people within the several states may not deliberate over them and reach a consensual judgment What this means to put it bluntly is that federalism would allow states the freedom to make choices which we as conservatives may very well disagree with For example Mr Meese continued federalism properly understood means that states or localities may ban handguns Also they may ban pornography as Minneapolis recently tried to do Or they may enact liberal abortion laws that even go beyond Roe v Wade he said referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion Two Pending Court Cases The Justice Department has urged the High Court in two pending cases to overrule that decision and rule that states have the power to regulate or prohibit abortion That was consistent with what Mr Meese said today but his speech marked the first time that he has explicitly endorsed the rights of states to enact liberal abortion laws By the same token the Attorney General seemed to be asserting the right of states to restrict abortion prosecute pornography or remove restrictions on the sale of pistols according to the wishes of the states citizens and independent of Federal authority Mr Meese also elaborated on the implications of one of the most fundamental political themes of the Reagan Presidency the call for a substantially smaller Federal Government The objective is not simply less government overall although that may happen but less government at the national level he said The happy result will be better government at the state and local levels levels where the government is closer to the people Limits to State Power Noted The Attorney General acknowledged that the power of states was not unlimited noting for example that they cannot invalidate contracts coin money or discriminate on the basis of race But he said that beyond these limits the Constitution granted states broad authority To deny the right of people to choose certain substantive ends he said is not to deny them the right to choose any substantive ends Mr Meese said he expected that his speech would irritate many people even some conservatives To argue for federalism as one of our most basic constitutional principles surely will not please everyone he said not even all conservatives But he said true conservatism was more a dedication to a set of processes of constitutional government than an endorsement of a particular set of positions on government policies

Ending Medicaid for Abortion Punishes the Poor,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/opinion/l-ending-medicaid-for-abortion-punishes-the-poor-999086.html,To the Editor The petition drive to end Medicaid funds for abortion that has been undertaken by the Roman Catholic dioceses of New York creates political pressure to which New York States elected officials should not and cannot constitutionally succumb Described by Cardinal OConnor as an effort to persuade legislators to put an end to the slaughter of humans the move to exclude abortion selectively from the Medicaid program represents an attempt to impose one religious viewpoint on everyone As a practical matter the effort to delete abortion from Medicaid amounts to an attack on poor women For the issue is not whether abortions will be performed at all the constitutional right to choose abortion over childbirth established in 1973 cannot be overturned by our State Legislature The only question is whether the poor  and the poor alone  will be able to exercise that right Since Medicaid covers the expenses of childbirth a cutoff of funds for abortion would push many povertystricken women to have children even if they are unprepared or unable to undertake the added parental responsibilities A cutoff of Medicaid funds for abortion would be antithetical to the humanitarian tradition that has characterized New York State Indeed it might for this reason violate our State Constitution which prohibits the state from categorically denying assistance such as Medicaid for criteria that do not relate to the financial neediness of the individual All women rich and poor deserve the freedom to choose for themselves whether or not to bear a child Concession to the church on this matter would offend the mandate of governmental neutrality on the morality of abortion which is at the heart of the constitutional guarantee of choice And it would do so in a particularly offensive way  by selectively penalizing the poor MADELINE KOCHEN Director Reproductive Rights Project New York Civil Liberties Union New York Jan 23 1986
RISE IN COCAINE ABUSE POSES THREAT TO INFANTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/nyregion/rise-in-cocaine-abuse-poses-threat-to-infants.html,In the special care nursery at the BronxLebanon Hospital Center a 3weekold girl squalled and twitched her cries fitful and her limbs stiff Lifted from the crib by Dr Jing Yoon the child failed to settle into the warm folds of an adult embrace  a sure sign the doctor said of cocaine withdrawal In Dr Yoons nursery one recent afternoon eight babies were withdrawing from drugs seven of them born to women who said they had used cocaine either alone or in combination with other toxic substances These mothers are among the two million women who experts estimate regularly use cocaine Physicians fear that many women underestimate the dangers of cocaine and that their babies like those of the heroin addicts who preceded them will suffer developmental and neurological problems Brain Damage Feared Its a very important problem that needs to be described so people in the streets know it and refrain from doing it said Dr Herman Mendez a pediatrician at Kings County Hospital in Brooklyn who recently saw two cocaineaffected babies with such protracted tremors that he assumed they would have longlasting brain dysfunction Our greatest concern is that cocaine use somehow affects the fetal nervous system and may lead to longterm deficiencies we have yet to define said Dr Arnold M Washton the director of addiction research and treatment at Regent Hospital on East 61st Street in Manhattan and Stony Lodge Hospital in Ossining NY Im afraid these children will show up disproportionately in the ranks of the learning disabled Poor Are Mainly Affected While cocaine is generally considered the drug favored by middleclass and wealthy abusers doctors who treat both rich and poor say the babies of the poor seem disproportionately affected The doctors believe that welltodo educated women are more likely to understand the risk of cocaine abuse in pregancy and to discontinue its use just as they more often stop smoking or drinking during pregnancy Affluent people are incredibly caught up in being healthy during pregnancy said Dr Bruce Greenwald who sees patients from across the economic spectrum as chief pediatric resident at the municipal Bellevue Hospital Center and the New York University Medical Center a voluntary hospital Disagreement Over Symptoms Doctors who treat the babies of addicts disagree about the precise effects of cocaine Some report symptoms peculiar to this drug while others say the effects are like those of heroin or methadone in babies In describing the difficulty of isolating the effects of cocaine these doctors note that babies are rarely exposed to just one toxic substance since few cocaine abusers limit themselves to one drug But despite this confusion the doctors are unanimous in their belief that more and more pregnant women are exposing their unborn children to a dangerous drug that they do not seem to take as seriously as heroin The Myth of This Drug The traditional assumption among women using cocaine is that its shortacting and doesnt get to the fetus Dr Washton said That is part and parcel of the myth of this drug  that it is not addictive and not harmful to the body At the nursery at BronxLebanon Dr Yoon characterizes withdrawing infants by the drug their mothers say they have taken In 1982 24 percent reported that their babies had been year that figure had soared to 74 percent Such data however seems unreliable to Dr Yoon who said that women admitted abuse of cocaine more readily than heroin They think cocaine is benign so they tell us she said They dont tell us the other things because theyre afraid well take their babies away from them Lets put it sociologically said Dr Lorraine Hale executive director of Hale House in Harlem a home for the children of addicts Heroin is considered a black drug and therefore its bad Cocaine is considered a white drug so the perception is it cant be bad for you It is in the clinics and wards of public hospitals that doctors most frequently treat withdrawing babies who are jittery cranky and unresponsive We call this under control barely said Dr Yoon at BronxLebanon as she held the 3weekold babyAll of them go through at least this Shes beautiful right How dare mothers give them this trouble Dr Yoon treats the babies with decreasing doses of phenobarbitol while other doctors use Valium or tincture of opium Even if medication is not necessary or after it is discontinued the babies remain intolerant to cuddling inattentive to cooing and have difficulty making eye contact At Hale House for instance a 10monthold boy and a 7monthold girl  both the children of cocaine abusers  recently were not responding to Clara Hale the 80yearold founder or to her daughter Dr Hale Theres kind of a coldness Dr Hale said tickling the chin of the baby girl but failing to coax a smile The doctors despite disagreements and a dearth of controlled studies report a variety of other problems The most commonly cited difficulties during pregnancy are early onset of labor and frequent miscarriage caused by a sudden separation of the placenta After birth many doctors report high infant mortality low birth weight and behavioral problems Doctors speculate that all of these problems are caused by cocaines constriction of the mothers blood vessels which deprives the fetus of oxygen and makes the drug more damaging to the central nervous system than heroin or other opiates Dr Ira J Chasnoff of the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago is the author of a study recently reported in The New England Journal of Medicine that involved only 23 women but is generally considered the most controlled research to date Dr Chasnoff did not note low birth weights findings reported by both Dr Nesrin Bingol at Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx and Dr Loretta P Finnegan at the Jefferson Medical College in Philadelphia He did however report one case of suspected sudden infant death syndrome one baby who had suffered a paralyzing stroke while in his mothers uterus and one case of severe malformation of the kidney and genitourinary tract in an infant whose mother had taken a heavy dose of cocaine in the fifth week of pregnancy Several of the dozen doctors interviewed also report parental behavior among cocaine users that is completely unlike that associated with heroin which depresses rather than stimulates the nervous system Dr Hale for one said mothers who use cocaine were more likely to abandon their babies or to be obstreperous when visiting them Six months ago she said Hale House was forced to change our whole style of operation denying parents the right to visit children at the brownstone at 154 West 122d Street Some doctors say they are troubled about what to tell women who used cocaine during the early weeks of pregancy when they were unaware they were pregnant Dr Washton said he answered women directly I tell them what what Id tell my daughter if she was old enough to get pregnant he said Yes have an abortion because if youve used cocaine during the first trimester youre playing Russian roulette At a cocaine abuse clinic at the ColumbiaPresbyterian Medical Center Dr Jeffrey S Rosecan responded more cautiously We run a fine line here he said I dont want to take a reefer madness tack and exaggerate because women will have unnecessary abortions At the same time I dont think we should be too cavalier
LIBYA'S WOMEN: ERA OF CHANGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/style/libya-s-women-era-of-change.html,Fawzia Abdullah is a 21yearold first lieutenant at the Womens Military Academy an extraordinary institution in the Arab world Like most of her male counterparts she has been trained to fire Russianmade surfacetoair missiles to dismantle and reassemble Kalashnikov rifles in less than a minute and to handle recoilless antiaircraft guns She also plays the bagpipes in the marching band Her makeup is impeccable her short fingernails painted with bright crimson polish She wears fishnet stockings under mediumhighheeled miniboots and solid golddrop earrings offset her jet black hair Her goal she says is to win an extra star and become a captain in the Libyan Army which no Libyan woman has yet accomplished But she added with a giggle I would also really like to get married Some things have not changed in revolutionary Libya Symbol and Reality The military academy  which has trained 7000 women since its opening in 1978  is the most prominent symbol of Col Muammar elQaddafis drive to make women and men equal but women in Libya as elsewhere remain vastly underrepresented at the top of virtually every part of society Most women here are still housewives and mothers few hold prominent jobs in politics or finance At the same time Colonel Qaddafi has made considerable strides in improving the status of women in his country and has challenged many of the laws and traditions that have held women back in Arab countries according to Libyans and other Arab and Western residents here Women have won considerable rights since Colonel Qaddafi and a small group of junior officers overthrew the monarchy of King Idris in an almost bloodless military coup over 16 years ago Gains in Education For example Goverment statistics show a fivefold increase in the number of women enrolled in universities although male students still outnumber the women threetoone Girls and boys now attend primary and preparatory schools in roughly equal numbers Child brides have been banned and the minimum legal age for marriage has been set at 18 Women and men now have roughly comparable rights in demanding a divorce Colonel Qaddafi is pressing the Basic Peoples Congresses the units through which Libyans theoretically run their own affairs to discourage polygamy which is tolerated by most Arab Islamic countries by limiting each family to one home These are all radical changes in Arab societies Colonel Qaddafi asserted in a recent interview Diplomats Libyans and Western residents say however that resistance to such changes remains stubborn in this tribal maledominated and highly patriarchal society Its going to take a very long time to change peoples ideas said Khadijal elJahmy a former teacher journalist Libyas first female newscaster and magazine publisher and a leading and ardent feminist Like many Libyan women Mrs Jahmy who is 65 could still be considered traditional in a Western sense She believes strongly that a womans primary role in life is as a wife homemaker and mother she said and that education makes women more productive and effective in these tasks To this day women are vastly underrepresented in the Peoples Congresses the cornerstone of Colonel Qaddafis state of the masses and in the General Peoples Congress the higher decisionmaking body to which delegates are elected In fact there are no women in a position of authority in this nation of 35 million people half of them women Colonel Qaddafis wife Safiya shares the disdain of many Libyan women for politics Halfway through a recent long interview in which Colonel Qaddafi was elaborating on his political views and foreign policy she grew visibly bored and left the room But she was not given much chance to participate Her husband answered almost every question directed in English or Arabic to his wife A student nurse and only 15 years old when she met the young leader of the revolution in a hospital where he was recovering from appendicitis Mrs Qaddafi chose to pursue the traditional Libyan womans role of wife and homemaker rather than her nursing career With seven children she has time for little else she said Colonel Qaddafi on the other hand wants his children especially his only daughter Aisha to become doctors and perpetuators of his revolution The Libyan leader has faced the stiffest resistance of all to his vision of mobilizing every woman as well as men in the defense of the country Libyans have been openly hostile to mandatory military training for high school girls and to the military academies in particular Libyans simply dont want their daughters running around in pants and toting AK47 rifles one diplomat said Many Libyan families have even refused to send their daughters to high school to avoid compulsory military training he said A Religious Obstacle Another source of resistance to the colonels revolutionary ideas about the status of women is Islam Many Libyans still a deeply religious people believe that women must cover their heads for modesty as required by the Koran and be subservient to the heads of their households Even Colonel Qaddafi has been wary of challenging the conservative sexual mores of his people rooted partly in their interpretation of Islam Adultery in Libya is punishable by public flogging An unwed mother is sent to prison if the father of her child refuses to marry her Abortion is illegal and contraception discouraged We need more children in this vast country Mrs Jahmy asserted vehemently defending restrictions on a womans control of her body which is a hallmark of the feminist struggle in the Western world Aggravated by repeated rebuffs from his traditional citizens Colonel Qaddafi has focused most of his revolutionary proselytizing on the young At many public appearances he surrounds himself mainly with guntoting female revolutionary guards One Dedicated Activist Hes just given up on the older folks one Libyan asserted But kids now 17 and under are far more malleable They dont remember a life before the revolution It is from the young that Colonel Qaddafi has formed his revolutionary committees and guards an elite who constitute what he has dubbed the vanguard of the revolution The colonel has come increasingly to depend on them as the hope for his Government residents say One such activist is Fatiya Zakkah 32 the mother of three She is an unpaid worker in Colonel Qaddafis office She was 15 when the revolution came she said Inspired by its goals and dreams she joined the Arab Socialist Union at school where she was noticed by Colonel Qaddafi who asked her to work for him She is totally devoted to Mr Qaddafi Arab socialism and the victory of progressive democracy For her there is no contradiction between Islam and the colonels revolution Although she does not cover her head as do many Libyan women even those of the military academy she has made the haj the pilgrimage to Mecca that every pious Moslem must make at least once I dress modestly for Islam she said But I would willingly take off all my clothes and run naked into battle in defense of my country
Defeat the Homosexual Rights Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/03/opinion/defeat-the-homosexual-rights-bill.html,The homosexual rights bill under consideration in the New York City Council would be if passed  and the chances are said to be good  a dangerous assault on our families and our values America is experiencing a civil war in which traditional morality is pitted against a rising tide of teen sex prostitution adultery and pornography Leading the charge toward radical change and decadence are the homosexualists  advocates of special protected minority status for homosexuals Some 75 American communities including the state of Wisconsin have passed sexual orientation ordinances similar to the New York bill These are the first dominoes to fall but all our values are at risk Homosexuals claim that they need such laws to protect them from discrimination I see little evidence that they are unfairly singled out Their political clout financial status the coverage they receive in the media all are better than average In fact now that the courts have decriminalized sodomy discreet homosexuals are better protected than adulterers who are still discriminated against by the law Besides homosexual activists want more than protective laws They want society to accept their behavior as the social and moral equivalent of heterosexuality They want legal recognition of samesex marriages and sex education courses that teach that the homosexual life style is just as valid as the nuclear family The American Civil Liberties Union of Los Angeles is already suing the Big Brother organization for not allowing overt homosexuals to counsel and befriend 6yearold boys Militants have already pressured the New York City Parks Department to display three lifesize statues that celebrate homosexuality Imagine then what might happen if we passed a homosexual rights bill Religious and moral people must oppose this legislation which can only pave the way for a general breakdown of family values and moral responsibility It can only make it easier for everyone  not just homosexuals but anyone who feels constrained by the rules that hold our families together  to say If it feels good well do it Like pornography and abortion if homosexuality becomes legal this year it will become moral the next This is of course exactly what the homosexual activists want Just as liberal divorce laws and looser attitudes toward fidelity have encouraged adultery so laws that remove the stigma of homosexuality will encourage sodomy Just as homosexuality flourishes among prisoners so it will flourish in society at large if we lift the taboos that protect our families We will see increased experimentation with bisexual and homosexual life styles by young people and others who are suffering from psychosexual problems insecurity and sexual identity problems Like millions of Americans I believe that homosexual activity is as unequivocably wrong as adultery in all circumstances and without exception I also believe that it is societys right to discriminate in the hiring of overt homosexuals  and open adulterers  in camps schools youth centers and anywhere else where it is part of the job to act as a role model for students clients or even coworkers The bill before the City Council denies us that right If it were passed a teacher who solicited homosexual sex could be fired but not a gym instructor who discussed his sexual ideology or love life with his students  something that homosexuals looking for social acceptance are surely more apt to do than heterosexuals Proponents of the bill say that it is not a form of affirmative action In fact it would prohibit quotas which are probably unconstitutional anyway but not goals and timetables which are surely just as dangerous Supporters also make much of the fact that the bill would not require religious institutions to hire homosexuals In fact such institutions are already constitutionally excluded from civil rights legislation But why should only corporate religions be exempt from the law while religious people outside the church are not If I cant tell a militant homosexual to keep his sexual practices in the bedroom he certainly cannot force me to keep my religion in the synogogue Homosexuality a moral wrong cannot be the basis of a civil right Society doesnt make allowances for alcoholics murderers or rapists even if they are biologically predisposed to do what they do Why should we have to lower standards for homosexuals

Advertising; A Citicorp Account To Smith,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/business/advertising-a-citicorp-account-to-smith.html,SMITHGREENLAND facing a field of nine competitors has emerged victorious to become agency for the worldwide operation of the Citicorp Investment Bank The multimilliondollar assignment was formerly with Homer  Durham which was in the competition and which remains agency for another Citicorp assignment Elizabeth Allen vice president and director of marketing communications for Citicorp Investment Bank was at the agency yesterday and said two of its accomplishments had really been crucial in deciding to include it in the race Those two factors were the agencys consumer research into the differences between the drinkers of Johnnie Walker Red Label Scotch and the more expensive Johnnie Walker Black and the ad that SmithGreenland did for Planned Parenthood of New York explaining abortion to men The Johnnie Walker work showed the agencys strength in research she said A friend who first brought SmithGreenland to Mrs Allens attention told her it was one of the most interesting things hes seen in a long time As for advertising creativity the Planned Parenthood ad impressed Mrs Allen with the clarity with which it explained complex issues Investment banking and family planning they both have practical and emotional elements she said noting that any agency that can make the abortion issue clear can do the same for investment banking This agency she said does gutsy but appropriate advertising Citicorp is gutsy and we want to take some risks Leo Greenland chairman and chief executive of the agency contributed the objectives of the agencys advertising  To position the bank as a leader in global investment  Highlight its unique products and services on a local and worldwide basis  Demonstrate Citicorps leadership and innovation in many areas  Take advantage in advertising of the good qualities of Citicorp people SmithGreenlands assignment will be to create both an image campaign which is Mrs Allens sphere of influence and product advertising both to be used worldwide Citicorp Investment Bank has its own representatives in about 40 countries and can be served by Citibank people in at least 50 more The advertising that SmithGreenland does will be used in domestic and international publications while the advertising it creates will be copied locally in different countries for form and content As far as image advertising goes Mrs Allen knows what she wants Her goal is a campaign that captures the personality of Citicorp Investment Banking and does it as well as Morgan Stanleys corporate advertising captures that firms personality However it may be 1987 before she gets to see such material from SmithGreenland Before anything goes on paper the agency team headed by Bert Rosenberg executive vice president management supervisor must digest all the material Mrs Allen is giving them about the units farflung activities And while the agency is doing that the Citicorp Investment Bank will continue to use the global edge campaign from Homer  Durham which has been using traditional customers of investment bankers to illustrate the services of Citicorp That campaign has been running in The Wall Street Journal The Financial Times and occasionally in The International Herald Tribune while its domestic magazine schedule called for fourcolor bleed ads in Business Week Forbes and Institutional Investor all aimed at reaching a target audience of chief executive officers and chief financial officers I would love to get into television Mrs Allen said but its perceived to be too expensive And my charter is image advertising for the investment bank worldwide However the book is still open The direction the future advertising takes is largely dependent on the research by the agency and its recommendations Why Mrs Allen even wants the agency to look into the value of the timehonored tombstone ad and discern whether or not people are really reading them and if the bank might do better with a different format One of the things I like about SmithGreenland Mrs Allen said they dont come in with a preconceived notion about what is right in businesstobusiness financial services advertising Unlike Homer  Durham which continues as agency for Citibank Industrial Credit SmithGreenland will be doing some tombstone work but will not totally replace Albert FrankGuenther Law
A Morality Test for South Africa's Opposition,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/04/opinion/a-morality-test-for-south-africas-opposition.html,To earn popular support in America third world resistance leaders must pass a kind of test They must offer some reasonable prospect that their triumph will lead to a humane democratic regime  and not a greater despotism As they plead for greater support from the West in the form of sanctions the leaders of the South African opposition now face precisely that challenge Boiled down to one question the test is Will you hold honest free elections As evidence resistance leaders should be ready to reject actively and explicitly extremists of the right or left who do not share their democratic commitment That is why South African Bishop Desmond M Tutus recent American tour was such a disappointment True some useful publicity was generated a commodity in short supply since the South African Government imposed strict limits on the Western media Even an ofttold story deserves retelling when its as cruel as apartheid But few Americans oppose sanctions against South Africa because they are uninformed about or numb to apartheid In fact few Americans oppose sanctions Even President Reagan Representative Jack Kemp and columnist William Safire approve of some limited measures The stakes in the debate have changed The issue in South Africa is not whether the forces opposed to apartheid will triumph They will as Bishop Tutu confidently asserts The question is which forces  a broad democratic opposition or a small clique of undemocratic Marxists willing to ape apartheids ruthlessness The undemocratic forces within the resistance pose a clear threat Several leaders of the African National Congress are avowed Marxists who may well prefer class war to balloting Their numbers are small but then so are those of many Marxist groups that have nevertheless managed to seize control of what were once democratic movements Much of the African National Congresss money is raised in America and Europe Here in the United States this month Bishop Tutu solicited funds for the African National Congress with leaflets extolling such freedom fighters as Muammar elQaddafi of Libya and Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua Bishop Tutu himself warns that if economic pressure is not applied to the apartheid Government soon South African blacks resentment may bubble over and give tyrants of the left a chance to seize control His American supporters echo these prophecies If cited as a possibility by so many longtime opponents of apartheid the danger of a Marxist dictatorship must be something other than rightwing fantasy Yet this month in a long speech at Stanford University and in similar addresses at Atlanta and across the country Bishop Tutu offered no plans for dealing with this danger In fact he scarcely referred to it dismissing such concerns as evasion of the real issue In Atlanta he chided Americans for being so late to recognize that South Africa has a succession problem  and he suggested that the reason might be our ill motives Asked what sort of government should follow apartheid the Bishop said that South Africas legitimate leaders would have to get together and do some horsetrading In other words the Bishops attitude and that of his American supporters has been to take offense if one so much as raises the question of undemocratic infiltrators within their movement You are either for us or against us Bishop Tutu told his campus audience An important issue is thus treated with contempt Other freedom fighters  the contras in Nicaragua the opposition in Cambodia and the Government of El Salvador  have had to answer similarly difficult questions and to purge some of their own ranks in order to win increased American aid Indeed all three of these groups are still on a sort of moral probation in the United States Even if they find it demeaning freedom fighters looking for American support are wise to answer such concerns In her campaign against Philippine dictator Ferdinand E Marcos Corazon A Aquino has confronted headon charges that her party is riddled with Communists She has benefited projecting an image of confidence and putting the Marxists on notice that only democrats are welcome in her opposition To ask for similar signals from apartheids opponents is not to demean them It is the essence of democracy In the same way we expected say the Democrats to denounce student hecklers who would not allow the former chief delegate to the United Nations Jeane J Kirkpatrick to speak at their college and we expected Ronald Reagan to swiftly chastise fanatics who bombed an abortion clinic in the name of human life In a like way Bishop Tutu and his supporters should denounce nondemocrats in the African National Congress  should denounce them loudly and by name Instead they have skirted the issue Apartheids opponents have made it difficult for people like Ronald Reagan and George Bush to support them impugning the Administrations motives for applying sanctions much tougher than any from Europe and for sending Mr Bush to Atlanta when Bishop Tutu was honored there recently Apartheids opponents should make it easy not hard for latecomers to jump on the bandwagon If they do not they will betray those of us in the United States who have broken ranks with our own party to support them To date that support by a handful of House Republicans and newspaper columnists has rested mainly on hope  a gamble that leaders like Desmond Tutu will not allow the recent white dictatorship to be replaced by a black one If on the other hand Bishop Tutu and others can make some hard choices about membership in their own movement our faith will be justified And the apartheid opposition will tap into something strong a moral consensus on the part of a powerful and generous people that South Africas freedom fighters deserve our support
ABORTION BATTLE SHIFTS TO AID FOR FAMILY PLANNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/05/us/abortion-battle-shifts-to-aid-for-family-planning.html,Abortion has been a flashpoint in American politics often dominating elections and polarizing debate over domestic programs In recent years however activists in the fight against legal abortion have increasingly turned their attention to a new front United States Government assistance for family planning programs abroad And they are winning significant victories with population planning organizations saying they see a fundamental shift in Federal policy Over the last 18 months under lobbying pressure by opponents of abortion the United States has eliminated money for one major international population planning organization and sharply reduced money for another In both instances the abortion issue was central to the decision But some antiabortion activists are also focusing on the type of family planning services offered with United States support The Agency for International Development has dramatically increased its spending on birth control that relys on periodic abstinence from sexual intercourse Rule Was Overturned Last year in a move strongly supported by some Roman Catholic activists the agency also tried unsuccessfully to change its rules so that counselors on this form of family planning could receive Federal money without having to give their clients information or referals on other forms of birth control That rule change was later overturned by Congress International population planning programs are now being questioned and they must be defended in a way their proponents didnt have to 10 years ago said Robert G Marshall of the American Life League Advocates of population control see things in a considerably different light Were seeing what I would consider a reprehensible retreat from reality by the present Administration said Werner Fornos president of the Population Institute At a time when many developing countries are most eager for population assistance Mr Fornos added the United States is crippling some of the organizations best able to provide it Mr Fornos and others also assert that these recent developments may be only the first round in a battle over Government support of artificial contraception They Deny Smokescreen Leaders of the largest antiabortion organization reject the notion that the abortion issue is being used as a smokescreen to attack contraception programs We think thats a scare tactic on their part said Douglas Johnson the legislative director for the National Right to Life Committee Officials of that committee say they are trying to halt the exporting of abortion policies and practices to developing nations by groups that receive American money They also say they are trying to keep the United States from supporting programs in countries that coerce abortion But while the National Right to Life Committee takes no position on contraception other elements of the antiabortion movement do For example the American Life League whose officials were among those who met with President Reagan last month argues that the Federal Government should cease all assistance for contraception programs at home and abroad We dont think the Government should fund these things  artificial means of birth control said Mr Marshall director of research for the organization based in Stafford Va They lend themselves to coercion and centralized control over family life Agency Caught in Middle As these international population programs become entangled in the abortion debate the Agency for International Development increasingly finds itself in the middle The agencys administrator M Peter McPherson argues that family planning programs help prevent abortion Activists on both sides of the issue trace the agencys policy shift to the 1984 world population conference in Mexico City The United States had barred the use of its money for abortion services abroad since 1973 at Mexico City the Reagan Administration announced a new prohibition Henceforth no Federal money would be provided to private organizations operating abroad that perform or actively promote abortion even if those services were paid for by other sources of money As a result the International Planned Parenthood Federation lost all Federal money last year an amount estimated at 115 million although affiliates that comply with the new abortion policy still receive money according to AID UN Group Is Affected In the United States private organizations that provide abortion services can still receive Federal money for family planning clinics although the Federal dollars cannot be used for their abortion services Last summer antiabortion activists won another victory on the international front when Congress approved an amendment that banned all Federal aid for groups that support or participate in the management of Government population programs that coerce abortion or sterilization That amendment which stemmed from reports of coercion in Chinas population program resulted in a 10 million cut in Federal aid for another major group the United Nations Fund for Population Activities Chinese officials have denied repeatedly that their program includes coerced abortion or sterilization Still at issue is whether that amendment will lead to a total withdrawal of United States support for the United Nations group this year Antiabortion activists and their supporters in Congress are calling for such a cutoff unless the group pulls out of China Lobbying Imbalance Cited Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado a strong supporter of international population assistance said she feared a steady erosion in support for family planning abroad Those programs she said do not have a driving immediate constituency on Capitol Hill as opposed to the activists who oppose them Everythings in serious danger with the deficit reduction law on the scene she said Foreign aid is never particularly popular and if you have a domestic group thats lobbying hard and GrammRudman coming from the other side its very hard to figure out how youre going to sustain it Mr Johnson of the National Right to Life Committee said that if organizations persist in the linkage of abortion and contraception they will suffer If theyre not engaged in abortionrelated activities he said we dont care how much they get because theyre out of our purview
BUSH STANDS BY ATTACK ON CUOMO BUT CONCEDES THAT IT WAS HARSH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/us/bush-stands-by-attack-on-cuomo-but-concedes-that-it-was-harsh.html,Vice President Bush says he stands by the concept behind his recent attack on Governor Cuomo of New York but he acknowledges that he should have chosen his words more carefully And Mr Bushs advisers say his political activities will be carefully managed in the coming months to avoid incidents that could reinforce the negative reactions that emerged from the Cuomo episode and other recent events In an interview aboard Air Force Two on Wednesday as he flew to Alabama and Mississippi for a series of Republican fundraising events Mr Bush said that he had been stung by the harsh reaction to some of his recent political statements But he insisted that it had not damaged him politically saying This too shall pass Cuomo Remark Bush Reaction Last month Mr Cuomo said in an interview that ethnic prejudice lay behind assertions some people had made that he as an ItalianAmerican would have a hard time being elected President Mr Cuomo said he was tempted to run just to show that a person of his heritage could win A few days later at a dinner given by the Conservative Party of New York Mr Bush responded by accusing Mr Cuomo of divisiveness adding Hes telling us to ignore the millions of blacks Jews Irish Italians Latins and Poles who shattered the bonds of discrimination and built this great land In the interview Wednesday Mr Bush said he was particularly surprised by the ferocity of the very personal attack on him in a syndicated newspaper column by George F Will a conservative commentator Reacting to Mr Bushs charge that Mr Cuomo was trying to divide the country along ethnic lines the columnist accused Mr Bush of lying and called him a lapdog Im Responsible for What I Say Nobody likes to be attacked in a very personal way especially by someone he respects Mr Bush said but Im responsible for what I say and all this speculation about why I said it has no relevance Certainly the people who were there for the most part seemed to think it was all right But did it turn out the way I wanted Obviously no He added Im not going to spend a lot of time worrying about it Im sure were going to take other shots but youre talking about a guy who took on Ferraro and survived He was referring to former Representative Geraldine A Ferraro of Queens the 1984 Democratic VicePresidential candidate with whom Mr Bush engaged in a sharp nationally televised debate The Cop Killer Issue Mr Will called the Vice Presidents characterization of Mr Cuomos remarks not only gibberish but also a lie The low point of Mr Bushs performance Mr Will wrote was his attempt to portray Mr Cuomo as lenient toward cop killers for granting clemency to Gary McGivern a convict who has served 18 years in prison for his involvement in the killing of a police officer At the conservatives dinner Mr Bush had said Gov Ronald Reagan kept cop killers in jail Mr Will suggested that Mr Bushs combativeness toward Mr Cuomo was a clumsy attempt to curry favor among party conservatives He wrote The unpleasant sound Bush is emitting as he traipses from one conservative gathering to another is a thin tinny arf  the sound of a lapdog Mr Bush said he did not understand why he was being accused of pandering to conservatives when he was doing no more than most other potential Presidential candidates appearing before conservative gatherings He said that with few exceptions his remarks to these groups were no different from what he had been saying to other audiences around the country Bush Sees Some Misconceptons Im not being asked to give up anything or to forswear my values said Mr Bush I can think of some evolution in my views over the years but I dont think there have been any radical shifts Mr Bush said some conservatives including the Rev Jerry Falwell who has already endorsed him for President may have misconceptions about some of his views For example he said not all conservatives liked his position on abortion Unlike some people in the antiabortion movement Mr Bush said he does not oppose abortion when pregnancy results from rape or incest or the mothers life is in danger And he said he would never be a part of what he called the absolutely outrageous effort by some conservatives to make a political litmus test of their hostility toward Secretary of State George P Shultz Asked in the interview why he had made the attack on Mr Cuomo Mr Bush responded I think the speech spoke for itself I think the whole concept of opportunity for everybody is what I was trying to say in one reference and that we are concerned about the victims of crime and less concerned about those who commit crimes was the other point Mr Bush said he had no regrets about the concept of his speech but he added Maybe a better choice of words I cant argue with that but the whole theme no I stand by that I thought it was a good way to focus on the strong beliefs within our party on how to approach these various issues Calm First Reaction to Attack The day Mr Wills column appeared according to one Bush aide Mr Bush called in some of his closest advisers and told them not to let it get us down Mr Bush the aide added expressed confidence in the members of his political team and urged them not to blame themselves or one another His political advisers admitted that they were stunned by Mr Wills reaction which one Bush aide said defined the New York dinner in a politically damaging way They said their concern now was that Mr Bush not do anything that could strengthen a negative perception of him With a few exceptions they said he will stay out of political fights and focus his political energy for the rest of the year on campaigning for Republican candidates for the House and Senate A Move to Upstage Kemp Bush strategists acknowledged that the remarks about Mr Cuomo were part of a plan to upstage Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York one of Mr Bushs chief rivals for the Presidential nomination on his home turf They said the Kemp forces had hoped to use the New York event and a meeting of the Conservative Political Action Conference in Washington a week later to establish Mr Kemp as what one Bush adviser called the sentimental favorite of the conservatives The adviser added That didnt happen and Jack Kemp wont have another chance like that for the rest of this year Some Republican analysts say that although Mr Bush could pay a heavy price in the general election for deciding to move early and aggressively for the support of party conservatives the strategy appeared to be moving him through a crucial phase of his battle for the nomination Bushs main concern had to be that he would be savaged by the people on the right who hate him and that they would rally behind an alternative candidate said Kevin Phillips a Republican analyst That has not happened He seems to have defused their ideological compulsion to beat him even though it has put him through a demeaning period
ESSAY; The Speech That Failed,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/07/opinion/essay-the-speech-that-failed.html,In his superbly delivered warmly applauded joint session show Mr Reagan failed to step up to his own historic mission His idea was to present a short thematic address about the hard choices made in this years budget Fine idea but the theme chosen was then weighted with boilerplate and sunk in a swamp of schmaltz The theme was that the credit for the prosperity belonged to the American people not to government that the political philosophy shifting responsibility toward localities and individuals had been proved right that one great hurdle of spending cuts was left This was in direct contrast to Jimmy Carters malaise approach which tried to blame the people for the lack of will in the Government The mission of the address was not to enhance Mr Reagans popularity but to advance his priorities Despite doomsayers he had parlayed tax cuts and a defense buildup into prosperity without inflation  now how was he going to apply that successful formula to eliminating the deficit That answer is in his budget maintain defense increases protect Social Security and reach the Grudman deficitcutting targets by cutting the rest of the nondefense budget without raising taxes Granted legerdemain is in his solution by counting on a higher rate of economic growth than we have today he pretends to see less of a deficit Even so he has his own way to deal with the monster which deserved strong advocacy and fair hearing That way is to cut spending radically in areas that have long been sacrosanct By reducing taxes and by letting the deficit mushroom until Congress was willing to put itself in a straitjacket Mr Reagan has after five years reached the moment of truth with more borrowing denied government must either cut spending or raise taxes He is for cuts now was his chance to rally the people to join in the pleasure of doing the painful But a funny thing happened on the way to the lectern There was this pitch to be made for the lineitem veto a new Presidential power that never did Jefferson Davis any good when enshrined in the Confederate Constitution And a plug for tax reform was called for and a word against protectionism and a halfspeed ahead for an international monetary conference Then while he was at it Mr Reagan felt he had to boost vouchers for education push governmentsponsored prayer in schools and enlist again in antichoice abortion ranks And after five full years he had to appoint committees to look into welfare waste and illness insurance charging them to write reports in a year or so And dont forget space and Star Wars and the freedom fighters and now its time for the four heroes of the American dream Thats all folks No time left for the purpose of the speech to show the American people who deserve all this credit for their own prosperity how they can reduce the deficit threatening them by reducing the Federal role in their lives Theme shmeme they can read that in the fine print of the Budget Message submitted the next day But the fine print is where the battle is without that laundry list there will be no laundry The revolution is in the details and if the President is unwilling to get down in the trenches by letting the names of the sacrifices pass his lips nobody will join him on the publicity ramparts When it came to the dirty work pointing out the hard choices where was Ronald Reagan He refused to risk political capital by calling on railroad passengers to forgo Amtrak subsidies or to offend farmers by espousing an end to crop insurance He did not explain to students why college loans should be cut or persuade owners of small businesses why they should no longer look to Washington for credit or tell veterans why they should meet their own medical needs With the nations eyes riveted on him in prime time and with both houses of Congress his captive audience Mr Reagan could not bring himself to say why the states not the Federal Government should handle their own highway and masstransit and sewer needs That unhappy stuff although vital to the development of his theme might lose viewers and cost popularity points If a President chooses to ignore the constitutional requirement for a report on the state of the Union and prefers instead to mobilize support for his philosophy his speech should spell out the sacrifices he expects for the benefits he promises That is his job nobody elses and it requires political courage In his hodgepodge speech President Reagan flinched
JUDGE ASSERTS HE IS SUBJECT OF FALSE BRIBERY ALLEGATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/08/nyregion/judge-asserts-he-is-subject-of-false-bribery-allegation.html,Judge Vito J Titone of the State Court of Appeals said yesterday that he believed a disbarred lawyer convicted of drug charges has told authorities that the judge accepted bribes in two cases a decade ago Judge Titone emphatically denied any wrongdoing Judge Titone in an interview in his chambers in Albany said he understood that the lawyer Martin Light had named me to the Presidents Commission on Organized Crime The judge said he thought this might have been done to give them a big fish and obtain a recommendation from the commission for a reduced sentence A guy facing 15 years might do anything Judge Titone said A judge in my position cannot protect against it Mr Light received a 15year sentence last February after a conviction for heroin trafficking Allegations About 2 Cases Mr Light who appeared at a public hearing of the commission on Jan 29 to discuss the corruption of the criminaljustice system by mob lawyers and is now said to be in the Federal witness protection program was a Staten Island resident who has known Judge Titone professionally and socially since the early 1970s Judge Titone said he had not been officially informed of the accusations which have not been substantiated but are believed to be under investigation by state officials The allegations by Mr Light relate to two cases one when Judge Titone was a State Supreme Court justice on Staten Island in 1973 and 1974 and the other when he was a justice of the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court in Brooklyn in 1976 The judge was nominated by Governor Cuomo to the sevenmember Court of Appeals the states highest tribunal last April The first case according to lawenforcement officials who are familiar with the details involved Edward Lino who pleaded guilty to thirddegree assault before Justice Titone in 1973 The judge sentenced Mr Lino who was then 31 years old and had been convicted twice before to three years probation Mr Light represented him In October 1974 after Mr Lino said he wanted to move to Florida and the citys Probation Department recommended that he be allowed to go Justice Titone ended his probation The judge said this week that he was simply following the practice of the Probation Department to cut its workload when warranted The State of Florida he said was not interested in supervising probation for a misdemeanor offender from another state According to lawenforcement sources who asked not to be identified Mr Light has told the commission that Justice Titone received something of value other than cash for his ruling The authorities are said to be focusing on a stove and refrigerator that Justice Titone had in the summer house that he purchased in the mid1970s on Shelter Island Judge Titone said that shortly after he bought the summer place with a friend  the judge could not immediately recall the exact date  Mr Light mentioned to him that he himself was buying some appliances and could get some for the judge wholesale The judge said that he paid either Mr Light or the distributor for the refrigerator and stove He said the transaction had nothing to do with Mr Linos or any other case and that to his knowledge he had never met Mr Lino now a defendant in a Federal drug case Revocation of License The second case brought up by Mr Light concerned Dr Eliezer Shkolnik an abortion specialist who in the early 1970s was medical director of the Central Womens Center at 331 East 29th Street In 1974 state and city officials accused Dr Shkolnik of gross ineptitude at the clinic and after a hearing the State Board of Regents revoked his medical license on Aug 10 1976 Dr Shkolnik was represented on appeal by Stanley M Meyer a partner of Mr Light in the Brooklyn law firm of Preminger Meyer  Light On Aug 19 1976 Justice Titone then sitting on the Appellate Division for the Second Department in Brooklyn signed an order staying the revocation and requiring the Board of Regents to show cause within three weeks why the revocation should be sustained The matter was then routinely referred to the Appellate Division in Albany which upheld the revocation Mr Light according to lawenforcement authorities has said that Justice Titone received a cash bribe for issuing the stay order The sources said Mr Light had indicated that Mr Meyer was present when the money was paid Lawyer Denies Impropriety Judge Titone said this week that he did not remember the Shkolnik case but that like other judges he had handled hundreds of show cause orders Mr Meyer said in an interview that the Shkolnik matter was handled in a normal fashion He denied that a bribe had been attempted or paid Dr Shkolnik was shot to death on Dec 3 1980 in the lobby of his apartment house at 6776 Booth Street in Forest Hills Queens The murder was not solved but investigators believe it was unrelated to the license troubles Mr Light became an informant for the Presidents Commission soon after his sentencing by Federal District Judge Eugene H Nickerson in Brooklyn last February But it was not until last fall invesigators said that he first implicated Judge Titone The commission staff was said to have passed along the charges to Federal officials in the Eastern District and to state officials The executive director of the commission James D Harmon Jr declined to discuss the matter But in recent weeks Judge Titone said he learned that investigators were requesting documents relating to at least the Lino case When Mr Light appeared at a commission hearing on Jan 29 he was asked whether he had been a witness to instances of corruption by judges or prosecutors or police officials Each time he said yes but he was not asked to identify the officials publicly Statute of Limitations Ordinarily a felony in New York State may not be prosecuted after a lapse of five years In the case of corrupt activities by a public official however the statute of limitations may be extended to 10 years Judge Titone in the interview described Mr Light who is 50 years old as an affable person and a great story teller whom you could not help but like But he said the former lawyer was also a criminal buff Im not afraid of what Lights saying now the judge said because I have nothing to hide The judge said he met Mr Light around 1972 when the lawyer appeared before him Later he said Mr Light had other cases in his courtroom Judge Titone said that Mr Light lived near him on Staten Island and after the judge joined the appellate bench he would occasionally give the lawyer a lift to the latters office Sometimes at Christmas the judge said Mr Light may have given him small presents  he could not recall any however And the judge said he may have helped Mr Lights daughter who was applying to schools or the lawyers ailing father Parting of Ways The judge said he had a parting of the ways with Mr Light after he was indicted on drug charges in 1984 Mr Light had been indicted on three narcotics charges and was acquitted on two He said he had been framed by Federal agents but on Dec 14 1984 he was convicted of possession of heroin with intent to distribute it At his sentencing on Feb 21 1985 he appealed for leniency At one point he told the judge that it was so easy for anyone facing trouble like himself to say anything he wanted For example Mr Light said he could become a Government informant and lie about paying off public officials including judges I can give a report that I spoke to the judge and paid the judge he said But in reality he added It would be untrue absolutely never happened
Abortion Is Permitted Into Third Trimester,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/08/opinion/l-abortion-is-permitted-into-third-trimester-391586.html,To the Editor Contempt for Abortion and Tolerance editorial Jan 27 was misleading You state that the Supreme Court decision allows some limitation on abortion in the second trimester and even greater limitation in the third The key word is allows The wording in Roe v Wade is so ambiguous as to make abortion permissible for almost any reason up to and including the third trimester In the words of the Court the State may if it chooses regulate and even proscribe abortion except where it is necessary in appropriate medical judgment for the preservation of the life or health of the mother It strains credibility to say that there are over one million abortions annually in the interest of the mothers health or life While technically it is correct that the Supreme Court does not endorse abortion the result of Roe v Wade has been to give us the dubious distinction of having the most permissive abortion laws of any nation in the Western world Rev CHARLES F KILOSKI Mount Prospect Ill Jan 28 1986
SOOTHING RHETORIC AND A HARD SELL ON THE BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/weekinreview/soothing-rhetoric-and-a-hard-sell-on-the-budget.html,THERE is no pithier summary of President Reagans view of government than his own the one embedded in the set speech he gave all over the country in the late 1950s and early 1960s The truth is he used to say that outside of its legitimate function government does nothing as well or as economically as the private sector From the moment he took office on Jan 20 1981 with the declaration that Government is the problem Mr Reagan has worked to reshape it and redirect its energies into what he considers the appropriate channels He was at it again last week an unusually busy seven days during which he put his views to the Congress and the nation five times  in his fifth State of the Union Message in a budget for the 1987 fiscal year in an Economic Report in a legislative message he termed an Agenda for the Future and in his radio address yesterday More than any other modern President Mr Reagan believes as he said in the State of the Union address that defense  keeping America strong free and at peace  is Governments prime responsibility Not regulating business as Theodore Roosevelt might have argued not ending unemployment as Franklin D Roosevelt suggested but creating and maintaining strong military forces To that end he proposed an 119 percent increase in military spending the one vivid exception to a budget of extreme stringency His Strategic Defense Intiative Star Wars is the biggest single item as characteristic in its way of Mr Reagans awed optimism about the capacities of technology as the allocation for development of a plane that would carry passengers from Washington to Tokyo in two hours Military outlays would account for 28 cents of every Federal dollar spent in 1987 up from the less than 25 cents he requested for 1982 All other outlays except for interest payments would account for 57 cents down from almost 64 cents five years ago But Senator Sam Nunn the influential Georgia Democrat spoke for many of his colleagues when he said that Mr Reagans request this year may very well be in tune with the threat and the need but it is not in tune with what is going to happen The best the White House will do he added is a 3 to 4 percent Pentagon increase over the next few years If military spending is to grow at all given the new budgetbalancing act  the constitutionality of which is under challange  most other expenditures must shrink The law requires that the the deficit be trimmed in a single year from more than 200 billion to 144 billion For the President that provided a happy conjunction of preference and imperative The Administration proposed to sell some of its assets such as the Naval Petroleum Reserve It proposed to charge fees for some heretofore free Government services such as meat and poultry inspections It proposed to cut deeply into health care programs for the elderly And it proposed to eliminate altogether more than two dozen other programs Mass transit grants would go for example because the construction maintenance and operation of state and local transportation facilities are primarily state and local responsibilities Amtrak subsidies would go because the subsidies provide unfair competition against air and road transport Free legal services for the poor would go because the same function could be filled if every private attorney gave 20 free hours a year Inevitably much of the burden would fall on already beleaguered state and local governments which would get only limited Federal help with their new responsibilities on individuals and on charities One prominent mayor forecast glumly last week that the ghettos of this country will grow under this budget The United States is and was intended to be governed by a Federal system Mr Reagan wrote in his Agenda driving home the philosophical point made implicitly in the budget During the 1970s state and local governments were often bypassed As government became farther and farther removed from the people it became less efficient and less responsive It is doubtful whether the President who remains more popular than any other in the last halfcentury at a comparable point in his tenure has the backing of the people for what he proposes to do A recent New York TimesCBS News poll showed that sizable majorities thought the Government should spend more not less on the environment and aid to the poor and that only 17 per cent of the public favored increased military outlays Private values Mr Reagan said at another point in the State of the Union address must be at the heart of public policies  which to him means among other things that the Government like the family must live within its income He argued that the new deficitreduction act was not enough and called as he has before for the authority to veto individual spending items for a Constitutional amendment mandating a balanced budget and for a new Congressional budget process A public policy consonant with private values in Ronald Reagans view also means a Government less intrusive in some ways and more intrusive in others It means for example a Government that would permit prayer in schools but sharply restrict abortion Finally Government should be hortatory and the White House should be used for the national pulpit it can be Mr Reagan never shrinks from mounting the steps Twice last week in the State of the Union message and in his Agenda Mr Reagan used the same words brimful of confidence America believes America is ready America can win the race to the future and we shall Another President often talked like that Here is Teddy Roosevelt at the 1900 Republican National Convention The young giant of the West stands on a continent and clasps the crest of an ocean in either hand Our nation glorious in youth and strength looks into the future with eager eyes and rejoices as a strong man to run a race At 75 Ronald Reagan too rejoices but the race that faces him in the weeks and months to come will be full of hurdles
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/books/no-headline-423986.html,THE HANDMAIDS TALE By Margaret Atwood 311 pp Boston Houghton Mifflin Company 1695 SURELY the essential element of a cautionary tale is recognition Surprised recognition even enough to administer a shock We are warned by seeing our present selves in a distorting mirror of what we may be turning into if current trends are allowed to continue That was the effect of Nineteen EightyFour with its scary dating not 40 years ahead maybe also of Brave New World and to some extent of A Clockwork Orange It is an effect for me almost strikingly missing from Margaret Atwoods very readable book The Handmaids Tale offered by the publisher as a forecast of what we may have in store for us in the quite near future A standoff will have been achieved visavis the Russians and our own country will be ruled by rightwingers and religious fundamentalists with males restored to the traditional role of warriors and us females to our place  which however will have undergone subdivision into separate sectors of wives breeders servants and so forth each clothed in the appropriate uniform A fresh postfeminist approach to future shock you might say Yet the book just does not tell me what there is in our present mores that I ought to watch out for unless I want the United States of America to become a slave state something like the Republic of Gilead whose outlines are here sketched out Another reader less peculiar than myself might confess to a touch of apathy regarding credit cards instruments of social control but I have always been firmly against them and will go to almost any length to avoid using one Yet I can admit to a general failure to extrapolate sufficiently from the 1986 scene Still even when I try in the light of these palely lurid pages to take the Moral Majority seriously no shiver of recognition ensues I just cant see the intolerance of the far right presently directed not only at abortion clinics and homosexuals but also at high school libraries and smalltown schoolteachers as leading to a superbiblical puritanism by which procreation will be insisted on and reading of any kind banned Nor on the other hand do I fear our excesses of tolerance as pointing in the same direction Liberality toward pornography in the courts the media on the newstands may make an anxious parent feel disgusted with liberalism but can it really move a nation to install a theocracy strictly based on the Book of Genesis Where are the signs of it A backlash is only a backlash that is a reaction Fear of a backlash in politics ought not to deter anybody from adhering to principle that would be only another form of cowardice The same for excessive feminism which here seems to bear some responsibility for Gilead to be one of its causes The kind of doctrinaire feminism likely to produce a backlash is exemplified in the narrators absurd mother whom we first hear of at a bookburning in the old preGilead time  the right kind of bookburning naturally merely a pyre of pornographic magazines Mother thinks the narrator in what has become the present You wanted a womens culture Well now there is one The wrong kind of course The new world of The Handmaids Tale is a womans world even though governed seemingly and policed by men Its ethos is entirely domestic its female population is divided into classes based on household functions each class clad in a separate color that instantly identifies the wearer  dull green for the Marthas houseworkers blue for the Wives red blue and green stripes for the Econowives working class red for the Handmaids whose function is to bear children to the head of the household like Bilhah Rachels handmaid in Genesis but who also in their long red gowns and white wimplelike headgear have something of the aura of a temple harlot brown for the Aunts a thoughtcontrol force partgoverness partreformschool matron The head of the household  whose first name the handmaid takes adding the word of to show possession Offred Ofwarren  is known as the Commander It is his duty to inseminate his assigned partner who lies on the spread thighs of his wife THE Commanders presumably are the high bureaucracy of the regime yet they are oddly powerless in the household having no part in the administration of discipline and ceremonially subject to their aging wives We are not told how and in what sense they govern The oversight perhaps accounts for the thin credibility of the parable That they lack freedom are locked into their own rigid system is only to be expected It is no surprise that our narrators commander Fred like a typical bourgeois husband of former times does a bit of cheating getting Offred to play Scrabble with him secretly at night where books are forbidden word games become wicked look at his hoard of old fashion magazines forbidden kiss him even go dressed in glitter and feathers to an underground bunnytype nightclub staffed by fallen women mostly lesbian Nor is it a surprise that his wife catches him them Plusca change plus cest la meme chose But that cannot be the motto for a cautionary tale whose job is to warn of change Infertility is the big problem of the new world and the reason for many of its institutions A dramatically lowered birth rate which brought on the fall of the old order had a plurality of causes we are told The air got too full once of chemicals rays radiation the water swarmed with toxic molecules During an earthquake atomic power plants exploded nobodys fault A mutant strain of syphilis appeared and of course AIDS Then there were women who refused to breed as an antinuclear protest and had their tubes tied up Anyway infertility despite the radical measures of the new regime has not yet been overcome Not only are there barren women mostly shipped to the colonies but a worrying sterility in men especially among the powerful who ought to be reproducing themselves The amusing suggestion is made late in the book at a symposium June 25 2195 of Gileadean historical studies that sterility among the Commanders may have been the result of an earlier genesplicing experiment with mumps that produced a virus intended for insertion into the supply of caviar used by top officials in Moscow The Handmaids Tale contains several such touches of deft sardonic humor  for example the television news program showing clouds of smoke over what was formerly the city of Detroit we hear the anchorman explain that resettlement of the children of Ham in National Homeland One the wilds of North Dakota is continuing on schedule  3000 have arrived that week And yet what is lacking I think  what constitutes a fundamental disappointment after a promising start  is the destructive force of satire Nineteen EightyFour had it A Clockwork Orange had it even Brave New World had it though Huxley was rather short on savagery If The Handmaids Tale doesnt scare one doesnt wake one up it must be because it has no satiric bite The author has carefully drawn her projections from current trends As she has said elsewhere there is nothing here that has not been anticipated in the United States of America that we already know Perhaps that is the trouble the projections are too neatly penciled in The details including a Wall as in Berlin but also as in the Middle Ages a place where executed malefactors are displayed all raise their hands announcing themselves present At the same time the Republic of Gilead itself whatever in it that is not a projection is insufficiently imagined The Aunts are a good invention though I cannot picture them as belonging to any future unlike Big Brother they are more part of the past  our schoolteachers But the most conspicuous lack in comparison with the classics of the fearsomefuture genre is the inability to imagine a language to match the changed face of common life No newspeak And nothing like the linguistic tour de force of A Clockwork Orange  the brutal meltingdown of current English and Slavic words that in itself tells the story of the dread new breed The writing of The Handmaids Tale is undistinguished in a double sense ordinary if not glaringly so but also indistinguishable from what one supposes would be Margaret Atwoods normal way of expressing herself in the circumstances This is a serious defect unpardonable maybe for the genre a future that has no language invented for it lacks a personality That must be why collectively it is powerless to scare ONE could argue that the very tameness of the narratorheroines style is intended as characterization It is true that a leading trait of Offred we are never told her own real name in so many words but my textual detective work says it is June has always been an unwillingness to stick her neck out and perhaps we are meant to conclude that such unwillingness multiplied may be fatal to a free society After the takeover she tells us there were some protests and demonstrations I didnt go on any of the marches Luke [ her husband ] said it would be futile and I had to think about them my family him and her [ their little girl ]  Famous last words But though this may characterize an attitude  fairly widespread  it does not constitute a particular kind of speech And there are many poetical passages for example chosen at random All things white and circular I wait for the day to unroll for the earth to turn according to the round face of the implacable clock Which is surely oldspeak wouldnt you say Characterization in general is weak in The Handmaids Tale which maybe makes it a poets novel I cannot tell Luke the husband from Nick the chauffeurlover who may be an Eye government spy and or belong to the Mayday underground Nor is the Commander strongly drawn Again the Aunts are best How sad for postfeminists that one does not feel for OffredJune half as much as one did for Winston Smith no hero either but at any rate imaginable It seems harsh to say again of a poets novel  so hard to put down in part so striking  that it lacks imagination but that I fear is the problem The Lady Was Not for Hanging he dedication of The Handmaids Tale For Mary Webster and Perry Miller  holds clues to the novels roots in our Puritan past Mary Webster was an ancestor of mine who was hanged for a witch in Connecticut Margaret Atwood explained But she didnt die They hadnt invented the drop yet  the part of the platform that falls away  so they hanged her but she lived The authors studies in early American history under the Harvard scholar Perry Miller also informs her theme of religious intolerance You often hear in North America It cant happen here but it happened quite early on The Puritans banished people who didnt agree with them so we would be rather smug to assume that the seeds are not there Thats why I set the book in Cambridge said the Canadian author who lives in Toronto and has traveled widely in the United States Like many of her fictional women she has written poems essays and novels notably the feminist classic Surfacing she is wryly unpolemical Feminist activity is not causal its symptomatic she said of the books antiwoman society Any power structure will coopt the views of its opponents to sugarcoat the pill The regime gives women some things the womens movement says they want control over birth no pornography  but theres a price If you were going to put in a repressive regime how would you do it Despite the novels projections from current events Margaret Atwood resists calling her book a warning I do not have a political agenda of that kind The book wont tell you who to vote for she said But she advises Anyone who wants power will try to manipulate you by appealing to your desires and fears and sometimes your best instincts Women have to be a little cautious about that kind of appeal to them What are we being asked to give up  Caryn James
HISPANIC CATHOLICS FOUND TO HEW TO TRADITON,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/09/us/hispanic-catholics-found-to-hew-to-traditon.html,Hispanic Roman Catholics in the United States overwhelmingly support the traditional beliefs of their faith but as with other immigrants the tenacity of these beliefs appears to fade as they become more rooted in this country master English become more educated and increase their income a new national study has concluded The study also found that about eight out of every 10 Hispanic Catholics were being approached for conversion by Pentecostals Evangelicals and other sects and that a majority of Hispanic Catholics had a favorable view of these groups a possibly worrisome trend for the Roman Catholic Church The study The Hispanic Catholic in the United States was based on a survey of 1010 Hispanic Catholics from all parts of the country The findings were disclosed in New York Friday by the Northeast Pastoral Center for Hispanics Retain Folk Practices The study suggests that Hispanic Catholicism is quite different from the Catholicism of other ethnic groups Hispanic Catholics seeking more intimate and tangible ways of relating to the sacred the study says cling to folk practices such as the giving and asking of parental blessings having home altars praying to saints using holy water in the home and making religious deals with God At the same time they are often not aware of major institutional trends More than half the respondents said they had never heard of the Second Vatican Council or the American bishops pastoral letter on war and peace and three out of four said they did not know of liberation theology the movement centered in Latin America that blends faith with the achievement of social and political goals The Rev Roberto O Gonzalez who conducted the study with Michael La Velle said the findings suggested the church must improve efforts to communicate news of itself to Hispanic Americans and find better ways of holding Hispanic Catholics as they become better educated and earn more income The appeal that Pentecostal and other evangelical sects have for Hispanic Catholics he said also suggests that the church must place more emphasis on regular Bible reading 146 Million Hispanic Americans The survey is the first national study of the beliefs of Hispanic Catholics although many of its finding are comparable to one done in 1982 of Hispanic Catholics in the New York City area The 1980 census found that there were 146 million Hispanic Americans and the new study estimated that about 85 percent were Catholic The study found that 83 percent of Hispanic Catholics considered religion to be very important in their lives But firstgeneration immigrants were far more likely than their children or subsequent generations to feel this way To the surprise of Catholic officials the study found that Hispanic Catholics born in the United States had a clear preference for worship in English Hispanic Catholics showed a high level of support for the tenets of the church Virtually all respondents indicated they believed Jesus was divine and about 75 percent believed that saints can intercede with God in our name But the percentages of Hispanic Catholics affirming these beliefs generally declined by generation income and age Two out of three respondents said they believed abortion was always wrong a sharp contrast to the beliefs of nonHispanic Catholics A 1984 survey by Planned Parenthood of New York found that 73 percent of Catholic respondents supported a womans right to choose an abortion Only about 40 percent of those in the new survey however supported the churchs opposition to birth control One of the more surprising findings of the study was a relatively high level of attendance at mass The conventional wisdom within the church the study said is that the attendance rate among Hispanics Catholics is about 25 percent But 48 percent of the surveys respondents said they attend mass on Sundays and holy days Still a substantial minority one out of four said they rarely attend mass the study found and 876 percent do not involve themselves in parish activities
STATES SAID TO BE ILL-PREPARED FOR TEEN-AGE PREGNANCIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/10/us/states-said-to-be-ill-prepared-for-teen-age-pregnancies.html,One million teenagers will have unwanted pregnancies each year in the foreseeable future and state and local governments are illequipped to deal with the problem according to a Congressional report made public yesterday Despite the expenditure of billions of dollars annually to deal with problems related to teenage pregnancy the study found government agencies still depend on inadequate data and poorly coordinated programs As a result it said there is little likelihood of any significant decrease in the number of births to teenage mothers America will continue to experience the epidemic of babies having babies into the next decade said Representative George Miller a California Democrat who is chairman of the House Select Committee on Children Youth and Families which conducted the study We see an incredible failure by policy makers to dedicate the resources necessary to reduce the incidence of teenage pregnancy States Were Surveyed The bipartisan report Teen Pregnancy What Is Being Done A State by State Look was described by the committee as the most extensive information compiled to date on the problem The report was based on a survey mailed in February 1985 to the Governors of each state The birthrate for teenagers as for women generally has been declining since the early 1970s in the United States  from 617 births per 1000 teenage females in 1972 to 517 in 1983 But the report said the nation should expect one million teenage pregnancies 400000 abortions and onehalf million teenage births annually Nearly 55 percent of those babies will be born to unmarried adolescents the report said Of the 450000 families with children who had teenage parents in March 1984 the report said 85 percent had only one parent present The infants of teenagers are at far greater risk of having a low birthweight and of dying in infancy the report said and the mothers are at greater risk of being in poor health because of inadequate health care and poor nutrition Further the report found that teenage mothers and fathers are far more likely to drop out of school and to be unemployed Spending on TeenAge Households According to a SRI International study conducted in 1979 and cited by the report Federal state and local governments are estimated to spend an average of 18700 throughout childhood in additional health and welfare expenditures on the first child born to a teenager Another study conducted by the Urban Institute in 1975 estimated that the Federal Government spent more than 85 billion on households where the mother was a teenager Nonetheless 26 of the states acknowledged in the survey that prevention and assistance services were inadequate They said that services were fragmented not comprehensive and that the states lacked adequate data on such issues as what programs existed to help teenagers who in the population was at risk of becoming pregnant and what sources of funds were available for local programs In many states the report said programs tended to center on teenagers who were already pregnant or had children rather than on prevention The report found however that several states including New York Pennsylvania Rhode Island California Michigan Colorado and Illinois were trying to improve their stategies and to gather more complete data
Congress; A Dissertation on the Mail,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/14/us/congress-a-dissertation-on-the-mail.html,Hundreds of millions of letters arrive on Capitol Hill every year most of them requesting assistance of some sort or urging members of Congress to take some particular legislative action Do they have any effect especially when it comes to how members vote Orval Hansen a former Republican member of the House from Idaho has just completed a detailed study of Congressional mail and concluded that the answer for most members depends upon length of service on Capitol Hill The longer the service Mr Hansen reports the more confident members become in their own judgment and the less attention they pay to the mail which may or may not represent a cross section of their constituency Of Influence and Feelings A freshman or a newer member whos confronting an issue for the first time is much more likely to be influenced said Mr Hansen who served in the House from 1968 to 1974 and now is director of the Washingtonbased Columbia Institute for Political Research On the other hand he adds a legislator who feels strongly or is an expert will tend to go with his feelings But while senior members may heed their mail less they read more of it Mr Hansen says a fact he attributes to force of habit For instance he says Melvin Price a Democrat of Illinois who has served in the House more than 40 years still reads his mail conscientiously When Mel came to the Congress back in 1945 there wasnt much mail Mr Hansen said He just got in the habit of reading it and so he still does By contrast he continued freshman members today arrive in Washington to find their offices already halffull with mail 200 Million Pieces of Mail More than 200 million pieces of mail are directed to Capitol Hill each year according to some extimates with computerized mass mailings swelling that figure almost daily Although the growth of massmail organizations has diluted some of the impact of individual letters Mr Hansen says he also cites several recent issues such as like abortion and gun control on which some members say the mail even though massproduced played an important part in determining how they voted On legislative proposals concerning gun control and registration for instance Mr Hansen reports the National Rifle Association has proved effective at marshaling its supporters and getting them to write their Congressman The associations successes he adds are the result of its cohesive membership and its demonstrated effectiveness at participating come election time After he left Congress in 1974 for reasons of health he says the voters got sick of me  Mr Hansen started the research institute and began pursuing a doctorate in political science His dissertation which looks at the effects of the mail on Congress is now complete and it draws on interviews with 21 members as well as Congressional staff workers Mr Hansens final conclusion on Congressional mail is that while members may vary the attention they pay to letters and cards none dares go so far as to ignore them altogether They all get very complete information about what their constituents are saying he said They cant afford not to

CUOMO VISITS NEW ROCHELLE TO DEFEND BUDGET PLAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/16/nyregion/cuomo-visits-new-rochelle-to-defend-budget-plan.html,GOVERNOR Cuomo came to Westchester last week to defend his proposed budget and to warn organization leaders and elected officials seeking extra funds that they will either have to do without or find the money at the county or national levels Addressing an audience at New Rochelle High School of more than 1000 students city officials politicians and others the Governor a Democrat seeking reelection answered questions for nearly three hours He drew frequent applause and laughter from the audience The topics addressed by questioners ranged from the New York City Parking Violations Bureau to the proposed docking of the nuclear battleship Iowa at Staten Island from the states role in job training and solving the homeless problem to the Governors views on the death penalty and abortion Mr Cuomo who is mentioned frequently as a possible Presidential candidate in 1988 criticized President Reagans proposed budget saying that while the President himself is loved as a controlled gentle strong unflappable never cantankerous and never belligerent leader his budget kills us The President cut the heart out of what was left of the jobs program took money away from education from child care and from other areas Mr Cuomo said County Executive Andrew P ORourke in an interview later seemed to agree with the Governor Mr ORourke a Republican said I do not think we are going to keep much in the way of Federal funding because of the pattern of Federal disassociation from local government and I dont see the state coming to help us One state representative told me that they would not help us because that would validate the Reagan budget Mr ORourke said He estimated that 130 million in Federal aid to Westchester would be affected citing losses in revenuesharing mass transportation and aid to students Mr ORourke was especially irritated over the Federal governments duplicity in cutting back on funds while continuing the obligations that programs especially in the areas of human care be maintained Id say that if youre not going to send the money dont send the mandates he said Both leaders suggested that the Federal and state budgets faced serious hurdles before being approved Mr Cuomo defended his support for education saying that education aid was increasing throughout the state but local school officials told him that most districts in Westchester would lose money under his proposed formula Dr James R Gaddy Superintendant of New Rochelle schools said the states decision to cut specialaid financing to smallcity school districts  known as Hurd aid by 15 percent for the next school year represented the most serious problem in the history of the school district A New Rochelle homeowner he said pays a typical tax bill of 5700 and should not be asked to pay more He said that a quarter of our citizens are senior citizens living on fixed incomes that property taxes were already high and that 28 percent of the citys property was taxexempt Mr Cuomo citing a theme he would return to repeatedly asked Dr Gaddy Where will I get the money The Superintendant suggested that the state lottery might represent a source But the Governor said that all of the money except for lottery prizes and administration already goes for education All of it Mr Cuomo repeated Ask our Republican State Controller Edward V Regan Should I raise income taxes asked the Governor whose electionyear budget combines the second year of a tax cut with a 75 percent increase in spending He said that 61 cents out of every dollar the state collects goes back to localities We picked up county expenses for Medicaid if we hadnt done that your taxes would be 15 percent higher Mr Cuomo asserted adding that we get the burden for taxing while they get the credit for spending Dr Gaddy said he was not seeking an increase in state aid we simply would like to maintain the level we actually have He said that 12 percent of the school aid or 71 million came from the special aid The cut in Hurd aid would represent a loss of 106 million next year and 245 million the following year when the cut goes to 35 percent Mr Cuomo who sought to link his responses to the county asked at one point Isnt registration down in Westchester a reference to school enrollment Dr Gaddy said not in New Rochelle certainly The Governor was seeking to make the point that state assistance should go to those who need it most He was attacking the socalled hold harmless educational system which insures that school districts with declining enrollments including the majority in Westchester neverless get the same amount of aid as they did the previous year Mr Cuomo said the Legislature routinely restores the cuts he makes in hold harmless aid and we expect it to happen again He suggested at another point that the same results often followed the actions of local legislators whose own bills occasionally gain legislative approval He was responding to a question by M Paul Redd president of the WestchesterPutnam Affirmative Action Program who was seeking restoration of 300000 in state funds for jobtraining programs Mr Cuomo said he would consider doing so but if not youve got Ron Tocci referring to Assemblyman Ronald C Tocci and Suzi Oppenheimer the State Senator from the area to introduce their own legislation The Governor sought also to put complaints and requests in his own terms often referring to his mother and late father He did so when Arlene Kramer head of the New Rochelle Board of Education cited rising home values as a major problem In 1966 a house assessed at 20000 paid 2300 in taxes in 1986 the same assessment paid 3800 and a home assessed at 30000 in 1986 pays 5700 she said Mr Cuomos response to that was to refer to his 84yearold mothers home in Queens where taxes also are rising She pays a real property tax that assumes shes getting wealthier and wealthier he said He referred to his parents several times quoting his father as asking why he was getting into politics when youve been honest all your life His mother he said reacted to his being elected Governor by saying Thats nice but when are going to be a judge a line he delivered with slight trace of Italian accent Mr Cuomo was asked by Joan Weber of the Saw Mill River Association a group of homeowners in the three towns to resist building ramps and underpasses where the Saw Mill River Parkway goes through HastingsonHudson because they would be unnecessary and would change the character of our communities The Governor said nothing would happen until he approved it and if youre right it wont happen He said he disagreed with Mayor Kochs calling former Queens Borough President Donald R Manes a crook because if you tried politicians in the court of public opinion wed all be convicted Mr Cuomo said that most politicians spend their lives working honestly in public service Mr Cuomo said he favored berthing the nuclear ship Iowa at Staten Island because it would bring jobs to the region and because Mayor Koch favored it He agreed that more state help should be provided for alcoholabuse prevention and counseling programs telling representatives of each that more funds might be forthcoming Charles Cola of Yonkers a former vice mayor asked for state support for a plan that would rehabilitate housing as a permanent solution to the housing problem Why not get the county to put up the money I heard it had a terrific year with a 15 million surplus Mr Cuomo replied but said he too would look into it A similar pledge of support was offered to the Rev Vernon Shannon of St Catherines AME Zion Church of New Rochelle

O'CONNOR'S WAY: ASSERTIVE AND HEARD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/17/nyregion/o-connor-s-way-assertive-and-heard.html,John Cardinal OConnor has brought a fresh assertiveness to the role of Archbishop of New York and has expanded the influence of the Roman Catholic Church on the life and politics of the city government and church officials say In his less than two years as Archbishop these officials say the Cardinal has reversed the image of reticence the church had acquired during the previous 15 years and has heightened its political impact He has done this the officials say by means of a forceful personality and a remarkable gift for engaging the media Whether by intuition or by a shrewd understanding of contemporary political dynamics the Cardinal has used this gift to gain significant leverage in a world where the ability to capture the medias attention translates into political power A Formidable Adversary As a result government leaders such as Mayor Koch see the Cardinal as a formidable adversary in matters on which they disagree In an interview at his residence at 452 Madison Avenue near 50th Street the 66yearold Cardinal implicitly acknowledged the impact he has had But he attributed his success to his outspokenness on the moral teachings of the Roman Catholic Church and not to any covert influence Any relationship I have with the city is by way of my public appearances he said I have no intent of trying to develop a hidden network that one could call a power base My tendency is to do things in the open Mobilizing Public Opinion Church officials express pride that the Cardinal has strengthened the churchs image in the public arena Hes mobilizing public opinion within the church and outside the church said Bishop Patrick V Ahern an auxiliary bishop in the archidiocese and the vicar of Staten Island Hes carrying his message to everybody the same as the Pope is The Pope is not an inhouse man Bishop Ahern said He speaks to the world and Cardinal OConnor in the same way speaks to the world The people sitting in front of the tube are not just Catholics Opposing Homosexual Rights The Cardinal a man of orthodox Catholic convictions on matters of faith and morals has made his views widely known on abortion housing for the homeless and other issues And in far more vigorous fashion than his predecessor Terence Cardinal Cooke he has mobilized the archdioceses 411 parishes and its prominent lay members to oppose abortion and to fight a bill in the City Council that would forbid discrimination against homosexuals Government leaders generally express admiration for the Cardinal and his leadership They see him as an effective ally on issues on which they agree But they also foresee the chance of alienating Catholic constituents should they oppose an outspoken and mediawise Cardinal on a particular issue such as the homosexualrights bill that the City Council is to vote on next month Daniel Wolf a special adviser to the Mayor said of the Cardinal I think hell solidify the views of Catholics who are the most traditional Catholics and I think he may well have scared the hell out of a few members of the City Council on the homosexual issue There were people who had no doubts on how they would vote and now he has made it extremely difficult for them He has not given them an out Most observers say however that the Cardinal has a legitimate right to embroil himself in political concerns that are of importance to the church a right they point out that is exercised by Jewish and Protestant leaders as well A Decline In Influence Almost no one sees a return to the days less than three decades ago when the Archbishops residence was known as the Powerhouse by those who believed that it exerted influence over many city policies and the appointment of some city officials Even if that legend were true then government and church officials say the city and its politics have changed too much and the Catholic Church itself no longer commands the same unswerving loyalty from its members Like political organizations labor unions and many other institutions the archdiocese lost considerable influence in the turbulent social changes of the last three decades But it retained the bedrock of its influence in the city  its role as a spokesman for 18 million Catholics in Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and seven upstate counties and its huge institutional presence The archdiocese operates 16 hospitals 330 schools and more than 200 socialservice agencies  services the city could not afford to duplicate  and owns 820 million in taxexempt real estate That inherent influence has been bolstered by the Cardinals new assertiveness officials say I think hes enhanced the image of the archdiocese in the public perception and in fact Mayor Koch said in an interview Hes a smart man who has a commitment to withstand whatever pressures are out there I dont happen to agree with him on some matters but I sure respect him The Mayor prides himself on his friendship with the Cardinal and meets frequently with him dining with him at Chinese and Italian restaurants But he also describes him as a tough very effective adversary when they disagree as they have on homosexual rights I think that if you identify with an issue that he has taken on as a cause in a very public way and if youre on the other side that has some impact and I think people worry about it and they should the Mayor said And theres nothing wrong about that It depends on whose ox is being gored The importance of the Cardinals friendship with the Mayor in expanding the archdioceses political strength is suggested by two incidents which the Cardinal himself freely talks about Many Catholic churches shelter homeless people overnight and they normally are reimbursed by the city for their heating expenses Last spring the Cardinal said some city officials tried to block the reimbursements because the archdiocese had refused to abide by Executive Order 50 a mayoral directive since voided by the courts that prohibited discrimination against homosexuals by organizations doing business with the city The Cardinal complained to the Mayor and the city officials were overruled When I got to Mayor Koch the Cardinal recalled he said that was absolutely ridiculous and the whole thing was called off The Cardinal said that some officials again citing Executive Order 50 had also tried at the last minute to block the archdioceses use of Yankee Stadium in May 1985 for a youth rally and prayer service attended by 40000 youngsters The Cardinal said he had told his staff to tell the city officials If they want Im going to call the Mayor and the media and tell them we cant use the stadium The city officials the Cardinal said changed their minds Governor Cuomo Feels the Pressure Governor Cuomo knows what it is like to feel pressure from the church Last month Cardinal OConnor and the seven other New York State bishops called on Catholics to send postcards to the Governor appealing for him to end Medicaid financing of abortions I will hold all elected officials accountable who do not support my conscientious objections the cards said More than 50000 have been received so far by the New York State Right to Life Committee which plans to present them to the Governor in March Nevertheless Governor Cuomo understands the importance of having the Cardinal as an ally and has asked the Cardinal to support his housing programs as they go through the legislative process In the end thats going to make a big difference because they respect him they know hes not trying to win a race hes trying to help people the Governor said The role of Archbishop of New York perhaps the most important church post in the United States is primarily one of spiritual and moral leadership But exercising this leadership has often taken Cardinal OConnor into the public arena in quite political ways On Jan 9 the Cardinal met with 200 leaders of lay organizations to ask that they join in fighting a City Council bill that would forbid discrimination in employment and housing based on sexual orientation The Cardinal has said he is opposed to the bill because it would legitimize a life style that stands in direct contradiction to the teaching of the Catholic Church In his interview the Cardinal said he had told the lay leaders that he wanted only to make clear the churchs teachings and would leave political strategy to them Youre going to have to determine whether in accord with the mandates of the Second Vatican Council you as lay persons are going to assume your role in publicpolicy issues the Cardinal recalled saying Some Council members contend at least one of the lay leaders went too far During last months contest for majority leader of the City Council William D Fugazy chairman of Fugazy Express the transportation company and a board member of several archdiocesan organizations called a halfdozen Council representatives to tell them of his support for Peter F Vallone the eventual winner He also spoke of his concerns about the homosexualrights bill Some Council members thought he was expressing the Cardinals position on the voting though Mr Fugazy said later that he was not calling on behalf of the Cardinal and had not invoked the Cardinals name However Carolyn B Maloney a Democratic Councilwoman who represents parts of Manhattan and the Bronx said Mr Fugazy did use the Cardinals name when he called her and linked the issue of the Council leadership with the Cardinals opposition to the rights bill He danced around the Cardinal issue Mrs Maloney said He mentioned that Vallone was opposed to the legislation and the Cardinal was opposed to the legislation Mr Fugazy told of Mrs Maloneys account said she misinterpreted their conversation Cardinal OConnor has since said that he authorized no one to speak on his behalf on the issue Captivating Gestures And Tough Talk The Cardinal has most clearly altered the churchs role in the citys life by being an energetic spokesman After 31 years in the military chaplaincy  four of them as a bishop and eight months as the bishop of Scranton Pa he was installed as the citys Archbishop on March 18 1984 in a stately ceremony at St Patricks Cathedral He immediately showed New Yorkers a dry wit and a flair for captivating gestures by donning a New York Yankee baseball cap in the pulpit of St Patricks and gently ribbing Mayor Koch with the question Your honor how am I doing Since then he has repeatedly spoken out against abortion tangling with Mr Cuomo and Geraldine A Ferraro the 1984 Democratic VicePresidential candidate when he said he could not understand how a Catholic in good conscience can vote for a candidate who explicitly supports abortion Both the Governor and Mrs Ferraro said it was their duty in a pluralistic society to support the courtaffirmed right of women to have abortions As Archbishop and after May 1985 as Cardinal Mr OConnor has testifed at Congressional and other hearings on a range of issues supporting more housing for the homeless and questioning the need for the MX missile Unlike his last two predecessors he preaches regularly at the 10 AM Sunday mass at St Patricks Cathedral and his sermon is broadcast that night by WMCA radio After the mass he often meets with reporters Cardinal OConnor defends his assertiveness as perfectly appropriate within the traditional conduct of American political life I get increasingly distressed that when Catholics express their views as citizens there is in some sectors a claim that we are attempting to impose our views on the rest of society the Cardinal told Catholic New York the archdiocesan newspaper in an interview Jan 13 But when other communities demand legislation that may be in conflict with church teaching he said this seems at times to be considered appropriate Catholics are not secondclass citizens The teachings of the church he said in another interview will always jar with contemporary culture and so the church must often play an adversarial role At the same time he said government officials have a duty to resist what they might see as encroachment by the church in their areas of responsibility The church the Cardinal suggested should not abuse its intrinsic influence I abhor the concept Powerhouse he said because it smacks of the use of money manipulative approaches threats rewards of knowing big people prominent people who are able to bring leverage to bear to punish and reward If I wanted to carry out this thing called the Powerhouse I dont have that background I dont have those contacts he said pointing out that he came to the city from Scranton without the ties to influential New Yorkers that his two predecessors had 2 Predecessors With Different Styles An appreciation of the role of the archdiocese today requires a comparison between Cardinal OConnors tenure and the robust era of Francis Cardinal Spellman and the more muted one of Cardinal Cooke Cardinal Cooke burdened for 20 years by the knowledge that he had cancer was according to former aides a leader who preferred to work through the parishes and through his own bureaucracy rather than in the public arena He was never comfortable with the press Even church officials who served during the Cooke era from 1968 to 1983 say he did not cultivate the kind of open relationship with City Hall that Cardinal OConnor shares with Mayor Koch Joseph A Fallon an assistant to former Mayor John V Lindsay whose term overlapped with the Cooke era said that under Cardinal Cooke the archdiocese never used as much influence as it could have to take advantage of money for such social programs as drug education Cardinal Spellman on the other hand was perceived as an extraordinarily powerful churchman who could seek assistance from influential friends in business and politics Many city and church officials say that much of the aura of power that enveloped the Cardinal was a matter of perception rather than reality Cardinal Spellman they say was essentially a shrewd manager and financial administrator who from his installation as Archbishop in 1939 until he died in 1967 built scores of schools churches and hospitals that continue to serve the city well Yet others point to events in the Spellman era that gave his reputed power some credence The book The Power Broker a biography of the public planner Robert Moses written by Robert Caro tells of how Mr Moses in 1955 turned over six acres of former slum housing on the edge of Lincoln Center to Fordham University a Jesuit institution virtually as a gift Mr Moses the book contends depended on the archdiocese for favors in getting his highways bridges tunnels parks and housing projects built But such accounts have been challenged as distorted Msgr Harry Byrne who was in charge of the archdiocesan housing program under Cardinals Spellman and Cooke recalls that the housing clearance that preceded the building of Lincoln Center wiped out much of the parish of St Paul the Apostle Church at 415 West 59th Street You got the impression he said that in view of this loss to the institution maybe the Fordham campus would be a quid pro quo A Different Church For Different Times The Rev Edwin F OBrien a former secretary to Cardinals Cooke and OConnor and now the rector of St Josephs Seminary in Yonkers argues that the churchs relationship to politics is distinctly different today from earlier eras In the days of ward politics he said there were certain channels everyone went through if they wanted something and the church was tied into those channels It was done right in the neighborhoods Those who remember the power the church once exerted can reel off the list of Catholic mayors and Democratic Party leaders until the mayoralty of John V Lindsay in 1965 Many prominent Catholic laymen were active in church fundraising and in the citys political and business life City agencies like the Police and Sanitation Departments were dominated by Catholics who were often discriminated against in private industry But now officials say the political rules have changed and power is more diffuse Politicians using television more often run their own campaigns independent of local political machines Tickets for major elective offices are less frequently balanced along ethnic lines The city and its bureaucracy are more diverse and standards on such moral issues as pornography have changed dramatically The church that Cardinal OConnor leads is also not the same church since the democratizing currents set free by the Second Vatican Council of 196265 Catholics today are more independent willing to examine questions such as birth control or divorce according to their own consciences and the practical needs of their lives Years ago the bishop would be able to tell his people Dont vote for so and so because he voted this way  said Gerald M Costello editor of Catholic New York I cant imagine anyone doing that today The Catholic population has also changed Many Irish and Italian Catholics have left the city and been replaced by Hispanic and black Catholics who one city official said have not yet involved the church as vigorously in their political life A Bigger Budget Than Most Cities The archdioceses influence however is still rooted in its massive institutional presence in the city Thats why you respond to it just as you would to the head of Citibank said Joseph A Fallon a Democratic district leader in the Yorkville section of Manhattan If all the institutions affiliated with Catholic Charities are included the archdiocese has an annual operating budget of 1225 billion larger than most cities In running its institutions the archdiocese and the city share a complex and symbiotic relationship Like other religious groups the Catholic Church depends on government to license and sometimes audit its institutions to let doctors from its medical schools run city hospitals and to get the money its agencies are entitled to under various government programs For example about 17 million in Federal aid for remedial reading and other services for 10000 parochial school students flows first through the Board of Education At the same time the city relies on the archidiocese for essential services It pays the archdiocese more than 80 million a year to take care of foster and other children The archdiocese educates 120000 school children a number that if forced to go to public schools would overwhelm the citys school system The city couldnt possibly deliver all the services they deliver said Mayor Koch They deliver it better than the city agencies could because I believe the extra element of religiosity that fills the bodies of men and women who work on behalf of the church is an extra positive dimension Monsignors and priests in charge of hospitals or schools for the archdiocese regularly sit down with their city counterparts Their dealings as one professional to another suggest that those who demand strict separation of church and state are unacquainted with the facts of life in a complex and diverse city In its search for new political approaches the Archdiocese has made some small but calculated thrusts to support community activism In the sagging parishes of the Lower East Side and East Harlem where stillimposing churches stand amid the desolation of abandoned housing the archdiocese is helping residents rebuild 15 buildings forsaken by landlords and now owned by the city The primary aim is housing But there is a secondary purpose one that also has the Cardinals support What were doing is not just bricks and mortar said the Rev Donald Sakano a 41yearold social worker who directs the archdioceses Office of Neighborhood Preservation Were building people who can exert leadership in their communities which has a ripple effect throughout the whole neighborhood A former city commissioner who has observed the movement says that by taking such a role the church is also giving itself more muscle in the citys political life Im not saying their primary motive isnt the Gospel he said but it also serves the purpose of remaining a major force in the city
"TV REVIEWS; ABC PRESENTS 'CHOICES,''' DRAMA ABOUT ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/17/arts/tv-reviews-abc-presents-choices-drama-about-abortion.html,TACKLING the volatile issue of abortion Choices visits the playing fields of the very rich where presumably momentous decisions neednt be muddled by crass materialistic considerations The ABC Theater presentation at 9 this evening carefully touches on the weightier arguments against and in favor of abortion rights and then in typical televisionmovie fashion ends up squarely in the middle of things with a smidgen of consolation for all sides Commercial television is still squeamish about antagonizing potential consumers of any stripe Choices stars George C Scott as Evan Granger a former judge who even as he retires at age 62 still sits on every board in town Evan lives quite grandly on Fifth Avenue just below the Guggenheim Museum with his second wife Played by the always striking Jacqueline Bisset Marisa 38 is a former concert pianist and now a tour guide at the Whitney Museum This Robert Halmi production written by Judith Parker and directed by David Lowell Rich positively trembles with culture Evan and Marisa blissfully happy for the nine years of their marriage have a sumptuous country house and are planning to live in Greece for four months in a Corfu rental with six bedrooms and a pool Life can indeed be comfortable The trip has to be postponed however when Evans 19yearold daughter Terry Melissa Gilbert arrives home from school and discovers that she is pregnant The father is Scott Steven Flynn a medical student who spends most of his spare time playing croquet in East Hampton Not wanting to force Scott into marriage she decides to have an abortion especially after he admits he is seeing someone else Marisa is sympathetic believing that the choice is Terrys Evan however is furious talking about the sanctity in a sexual relationship that produces a child And Scott when he finds out about the pregnancy decides he wants to marry Terry even though he doesnt love her The sides are thus neatly drawn the two women against the two men  when the clearcut issue is shattered with another development Marisa becomes pregnant and once again Evan is furious In this instance though he argues for abortion pointing out that he and Marisa had agreed never to have children I am done with school plays and birthday parties for 2yearolds he fumes Will Terry give in to her formidable father and marry the somewhat sappy Scott to have their baby Will Marisa listen to her adamant husband and have the abortion to save their marriage Will Evan be exposed as nothing more than a selfish and pompous hypocrite Only one thing is certain television will try to have it all ways Mr Scott keeps popping up in the movie like a guest star whose availability for the filming is limited It feels as if the production was carefully shot around the actor to minimize demands on his time One result is that much of the story is carried by Miss Bisset and Miss Gilbert both of whom are impressively effective even as they grapple with the slippery script Despite all the pretty outdoor shots of New York incidentally much of the film was made in Montreal The cultural veneer of Manhattan is one thing costs are another
CUOMO OPPOSES CARDINAL ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/17/nyregion/cuomo-opposes-cardinal-on-abortion.html,Governor Cuomo and John Cardinal OConnor are still at odds over abortion the issue they clashed over during the 1984 Presidential campaign I flat out think hes wrong the Cardinal said in an interview I dont think that makes him evil It makes him wrong Hes made a serious effort to theologize his way through it and I think hes been unsuccessful Governor Cuomo said that some obvious misunderstandings have been cleared away but that he has not changed his belief that a Catholic government leader in a pluralistic society should not impose his personal religious opposition to abortion on those he governs Some political leaders who have followed the disagreement such as Mayor Koch suggest it may be more than philosophical Asked to describe the Cardinals relationship with the Governor the Mayor said I would characterize it as strained A Statement and a Reply The conflict surfaced after Cardinal OConnor said in a televised news conference on June 24 1984 I dont see how a Catholic in good conscience can vote for a candidate who explicitly supports abortion The issue grew in importance when Geraldine A Ferraro a Catholic who said she would uphold legalized abortion was named the Democratic candidate for Vice President Five weeks after the Cardinal spoke Governor Cuomo publicly challenged him saying the Cardinal was suggesting that no Catholic could vote for him Mayor Koch or Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan  anybody who disagrees with him on abortion The Cardinal replied that he was only making church teachings clear and letting voters decide whether a candidates views were in accord with those teachings On Sept 13 Governor Cuomo defended his position in a speech at the University of Notre Dame saying Catholic public officials know that to assure our freedom we must allow others the same freedom even if it occasionally produces conduct by them which we would hold to be sinful Medicaid Abortions Debated The best thing Catholics could do to diminish abortions he said would be to set an example for others through programs that help women avoid abortions The Cardinal and the Governor have met on several occasions since but have never resolved their argument In a recent interview the Cardinal said the Governor has a great deal to offer on other issues but is misguided about abortion which the Catholic Church compares to the taking of an innocent life What especially troubles him Cardinal OConnor said is that the Governor has not forcefully spoken out against the Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion and that he supports the states financing for abortion through Medicaid without any constitutional requirement to do so The Supreme Court of the United States ruled in 1980 that states have no obligation to pay for abortions Governor Cuomo has said it would be discriminatory to deny women access to the procedure simply because they were poor The Governor in a telephone interview said that while he agreed with the Catholic teaching against abortion it was his prudential political judgment that a constitutional amendment barring abortions would only lead to illicit abortions and a contempt for law similar to that displayed during Prohibition
Most U.S. Abortions Are in First Trimester,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/20/opinion/l-most-us-abortions-are-in-first-trimester-241486.html,To the Editor The Rev Charles F Kiloskis criticism of an editorial on abortion letter Feb 8 was misleading because it created the impression that more than one million abortions are performed annually in the United States in the third trimester He accomplishes this result by first citing a section of the Supreme Courts abortion decision regarding regulation of thirdtrimester abortions and then stating It strains credibility to say there are over one million abortions annually in the interest of the mothers health or life Apparently Mr Kiloski wants us to lose sight of the fact that 913 percent of all abortions in the US are performed in the first trimester His lament that the US has the most permissive laws of any nation in the Western world is questionable For instance while Italys liberalized abortion laws permit elective abortion only in the first trimester any Italian woman over 18 is entitled to a statefunded abortion Moreover the 15 million abortions performed annually in the US is a tiny fraction of the approximately 55 million performed annually throughout the world In any event I believe that no American woman should ever have to look to another country and ask when she will have the same rights as women there STACY R SELDIN Flushing NY Feb 8 1986
High-Tech Babies: a Growth Industry,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/21/opinion/hightech-babies-a-growth-industry.html,Technological babymaking is increasingly being merchandised just like any other consumer product Stateoftheart physicians highpowered lawyers and fastlane entrepreneurs are all working to make hightech coupling big business But the whole enterprise has created a mountain of legal and ethical questions The nation must pause to address them Artificial insemination in vitro fertilization surrogate mothering and embryo transfer are old hat of course to animal breeders They use them to improve livestock faster horses more productive cows beefier cattle A relatively small group of American fertility specialists now uses these techniques to make human babies Unlike animal breeders fertility specialists are producing wanted babies not better ones Their customerpatients are couples who have lost in natures lottery and cannot conceive or carry a pregnancy to term We can understand the desire of infertile couples for children and can sympathize with their desire to have children with whom they share some genetic identity When in vitro fertilization combines the egg of the wife with the sperm of the husband and the embryo is reimplanted in the wife genetic identity is not a problem This situation is the easiest to accept because it has few legal moral or psychological complications However when a pregnancy is induced with either a sperm or an egg that does not belong to the infertile couple the identity of the babys real mother or father becomes more problematical When as is pos sible the endproduct baby involves five different adults two genetic parents one gestational mother and two rearing parents then the words mother or father becomes entirely inadequate But questions such as these have not inhibited the entrepreneurs Devices are patented protective laws sought from state legislatures marketing strategies prepared Fertility services involve substantial amounts of money 5000 to 25000 for each pregnancy And the potential rewards are tempting By some estimates the market for reproductive technologies may involve as many as two million couples in the United States alone Moreover the increasing infertility seen among 20yearolds a rate that has tripled in the past 20 years means that the market can only grow But as the baby business is booming legal and ethical questions are also multiplying For example embryos can be frozen for some period of time and then defrosted and implanted in a receptive uterus While those embryos are outside the body who decides what is to be done with them Do they belong to the genetic parents or the entrepreneurs who provide the service Do they belong to the state And if we do not have an answer to the relatively simple question of who if anyone owns the embryo the question of the moral status of the embryo is far more complex Does it have rights Do we have duties toward it Do we owe an embryo an opportunity to develop so that it can go on to become a child More questions arise Are women entitled to make a profit for gestating a baby Can unmarried men or women avail themselves of the new technology thus having babies without creating families Is using a womens sister or best friend as a surrogate or an egg donor better or worse than involving an anonymous third person If the baby is born physically impaired or retarded who has the responsibility If the abnormality is detected by amniocentesis during gestation should abortion be an option and who should decide Finally how are the parties to this transaction to think about their actions Is the child ever to know about the method of its birth If so how much information should the child have  only that which is deemed to be essential healthrelated data or all of the other biographical information about its heritage that most of us value Whose interests whose preferences whose needs count here Born into a society that is already fragmented by divorce and confused about alternative life styles morals and sexual choices the child may well have serious identity problems at a later time Does such a possibility have to be seriously considered by those who want to undertake unusual reproductive methods Whats wrong with technological babymaking is not just that couples are desperate and thus willing to act now and encounter the consequences later not just that physicians are frustrated by their inability to meet patients needs and therefore embrace the new technology and not just that businessmen are embarrassingly eager to make a profit on babies Whats wrong is that the law is unclear the ethics controversial the psychology uncertain The interests and wellbeing of the babytobemade seem to be the last issues considered and sometimes for example when physicians promise anonymity to the donor or parents require it of the surrogate seem not be be considered at all Individuals contemplating in vitro fertilization especially in its more complex variations ought not only to seek out technical information but also give careful thought to the implications of reproductive technologies It is important to clarify and weigh the varied and potentially conflicting interests  those of the doctors clinics parents the state and the childrentobe And its important to think through possible outcomes including less happy ones to be able to assess rationally the risks and benefits of undergoing the procedure There are approximately 125 infertility clinics now in business throughout the United States Who should make policies concerning their practices In Britain and Australia national commissions have made recommendations and some laws have been passed But the commissions did not always agree for instance in their proposals about the use and control of frozen embryos In the United States we have had inadequate public discussion about appropriate legal policies moral guidelines and medical practices The new Biomedical Ethics Board and Biomedical Ethics Advisory Committee established by Congress under the Health Research Extension Act of 1985 have

TV WEEKEND; 'BLOOD AND ORCHIDS' TO BE SHOWN ON CBS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/21/arts/tv-weekend-blood-and-orchids-to-be-shown-on-cbs.html,THIS Sunday the networks are again pulling out their bigproduction guns as their ratings skirmishes continue At 8 PM NBC is offering a threehour doomsday scenario called The Fifth Missile on Channel 4 At 9 ABC begins a glossy Hitlercummelodrama miniseries based on the Danielle Steel novel Crossings on Channel 7 And also at 9 on Channel 2 CBS will broadcast the first half of Blood and Orchids a fourhour movie that will be concluded Monday night For sheer oldfashioned theatrics spiked with social significance and including Jane Alexander in a role that Joan Crawford would have envied Blood and Orchids is by far the juiciest concoction in the lot Norman Katkovs script based on his novel of the same name is an impressively deft cautionary tale about greed one of the seven deadly sins that has been enjoying some brazen popularity in certain privileged sectors of the contemporary scene The story takes place in 1937 in the United States Territory of Hawaii Four Hawaiian men ranging in age from 18 to 22 are finishing a night of partying when they come upon a badly battered Hester Murdoch Madeline Stowe They take her to a hospital But when questions are asked they panic and flee fearing they will be blamed for the attack The viewer knows from the opening scenes that Hester has been beaten by a Navy lieutenant Bryce Parker Matt Salinger the best friend of her husband Lieut Lloyd Murdoch William Russ Hester had told Bryce that she was pregnant by him He became infuriated when she refused to have an abortion Unfortunately for the four Hawaiian Samaritans Hesters mother is Doris Ashley probably the richest and most influential denizen of Honolulus haole or white establishment Thats where Miss Alexander comes in warning her daughter that you are not going to destroy me with a scandal She insists that Hester charge the four Hawaiians with rape The supposed plight of the poor Navy officers wife enrages not only the local establishment but also a good number of mainland bigots Caught in the middle of this nasty affair is Curt Maddox a bachelor police detective with a reputation for being a loner He is played with downtoearth toughness by Kris Kristofferson who is aging nicely into what looks like a puffy somewhat bruised Robert Stack and sounds like John Wayne Maddox is pressed by powerful interests to bring the Hawaiians quickly to trial but when the detective begins having doubts about their guilt he finds himself threatened Meanwhile the accused have found a lawyer Tom Halehone James Saito a seemingly timid Hawaiian who is thought too weak to battle powerful interests With the battle lines drawn Blood and Orchids directed by Jerry Thorpe for Lorimar Productions robustly roots for the underdogs as it exposes the diseased underbelly of power and exploitation While Doris and her friends chat only half jokingly about governing through divine right the Hawaiian Princess Luahine Haunani Minn speaks bitterly of how exploitation by the sons of white missionaries has reduced her people to one big work force of cheap labor Sundays episode ends with a shocking development neatly calculated to bring viewers back Monday when Jose Ferrer arrives as a lawyer for the establishment with Sean Young playing his young wife whose affair with the dour Maddox will be no more convincing than his affair with a waitress Susan Blakely in the first part But TV movies evidently must have their love interests no matter how pointless Still Blood and Orchids captures a remarkably authentic sense of period and Miss Alexander coldly elegant in her relatively small role creates a scheming villain with an aplomb that leaves Joan Collins looking like an amateur
BOOKS OF THE TIMES; A Playwright's Journal,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/22/books/books-of-the-times-a-playwright-s-journal.html,AN UNNATURAL PURSUIT  OTHER PIECES By Simon Gray Illustrated 244 pages St Martins Press 1595 No doubt few American readers have seen Simon Grays play The Common Pursuit which had a few weeks run at Londons Lyric Theater Hammersmith a year and a half ago and which has as yet received neither a West End nor a New York production Inspired in part by the experiences of Mr Grays friend Ian Hamilton who once ran a small but influential literary magazine the play examines the unraveling lives ambitions and dreams of five gifted Cambridge students who leave behind the university and their highminded intellectual ideals for the more pragmatic rewards and frustrations of the London literary world talkshow appearances petty journalistic assignments lucrative book offers as well as the routine stuff of English social comedy  love affairs abortions adulteries treacheries compromises lingering deaths sudden deaths While working on the show Mr Gray decided to keep a running account of his impressions  spoken each night into a tape recorder and the edited result garnished with a few additional essays is this book The journals start on the day that Mr Gray finished writing The Common Pursuit and end nine months later with the closing of the show and while such a format makes for occasional patches of dullness  the casting sessions for instance tend to blur together into a repetitious morass of trial and error  the volume for the most part resembles the play Its witty episodic and even for the reader unfamiliar with the actual show highly entertaining An Unnatural Pursuit after all not only furnishes a detailed account of the travails involved in a specific production  from negotiating with reluctant producers to finetuning actors accents and inflections  but in doing so also provides the reader with a wonderfully palpable sense of what its like to work in the English theater and what its like to be a writer in London today The dynamics of financing and producing a show the process of rewriting and shaping a play during rehearsals and the emotional parabolas experienced by the company and cast prior to and following opening night are all chattily sketched in by Mr Gray in quick subjective strokes as are his more personal concerns such as not being able to find a cab in London and avoiding trendy restaurants filled with other writers Besides being a memoirist with a gift for making the reader see everything from his own point of view Mr Gray is of course an inveterate playwright  as skilled it turns out at dramatizing his own dilemmas and worries as those of his fictional creations In a charming essay included at the end of this volume titled My Cambridge he describes himself as a young man who was a total liar  a phony esthete a fraud of everincreasing fluency who had polished opinions on novels poems plays films and all pieces of music including those I hadnt read seen or heard And that same impulse toward selfmocking caricature animates the selfportrait in the journals Indeed Mr Gray tends to come across here as one of his own putupon heros  at times an unkempt Butley egotistical manic and frustrated by the sheer intractability of the world at times a more detached Simon in Otherwise Engaged clever successful but nonetheless besieged by upsetting people and events By turns selfdeprecating and demanding petulant and apologetic Mr Gray vacillates wildly between feelings of entitlement Surely people understand that when one hands them a script one expects them to read it within minutes and comment on it both profoundly and favourably for weeks afterwards and rejection could it be he wonders that actors had been turning us down not only because none of the parts was a star part but also because they dont like the characters his emotions ricocheting off the slightest hint of trouble or indifference The producer Michael Codron fails to call him back immediately after reading his play and Mr Gray spends a night fuming then attempted to exonerate him on comforting grounds ie his plane had crashed hed been mugged The plays director Harold Pinter suggests that Mr Grays picture be cut out of the program in order to include one of an actor and the playwright has a fit of indignation made all the worse by Mr Pinters boiling reasonableness A runthrough ends earlier than expected and Mr Gray starts wondering does that mean the play is too short Will we have to stretch it out with heavy pauses long and complicated moves numerous curtain calls Needless to say by opening night the playwright is something of a wreck  his impatience has given way to paranoia his anxiety to selfrecrimination fatalism and a general sense of dread Given Mr Grays tendency to italicize his own emotions the reader is inclined to take all this in with a sort of bemused curiosity already convinced as Mr Pinter writes in a foreword that the playwrights not nearly such a pain as his selfportrait would have you believe Having directed Butley and Otherwise Engaged as well as The Common Pursuit Mr Pinter makes frequent appearances in these journals dressed proverbially in black and trying hard not to smoke as he presides over various meetings and rehearsals As a figure of benevolent reassurance and ferocious geniality however hes decidedly cast in a supporting role  namely that of Mr Grays unflappable and patient alter ego
THE CHANGING WOMEN'S MARRIAGE MARKET,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/22/style/the-changing-women-s-marriage-market.html,Women who defer marriage to go to college and pursue a career are finding that by the time they decide to marry the marriage market has in effect evaporated according to a new study by two Yale sociologists and a Harvard economist Collegeeducated white women who have not married by the time they are 25 years old have only a 50 percent chance of marrying according to the unpublished study which analyzes census data from 70000 households Just 20 percent of the women who reach the age of 30 without marrying can be expected to marry 5 percent of those who reach the age of 35 without marrying will marry and for those beyond 40 perhaps 1 percent will marry the study showed And in general a lower percentage of the total population of women are marrying these days the study showed Yale Sociologists Analysis I think people up until this point have suspected that welleducated women were deferring marriage said one of the sociologists who conducted the study Dr Neil G Bennett an associate professor of sociology at Yale University However it appears from this analysis that much of this marriage deferral is translating into marriage forgone Many women are investing a lot of time in higher education and pursuing careers and in the process theyre deferring marriage he added We are finding out that it reaches a point eventually where the marriage market in effect falls out from under them Dr Bennett said the reasons that fewer women are marrying are complex Essentially the study showed that many women after deferring marriage find that by the time they want to marry there are fewer available men to choose from Those available are either not the kind of men the women want to marry or the men prefer women who are younger not as highly educated or not as successful Sociologists and psychologists who were asked about the results of the survey said that although it was impossible to verify its statistical conclusions until it was published the results seemed to bear out some current theories about marriage patterns The cultural pattern is still for men to choose women who are not their equals even though women are increasingly becoming their equals in their careers and their education said Dr Laurel Richardson a sociology professor at Ohio State University who has written a new book on single women and their options The New Other Woman The Free Press 1795 Dr Richardson said that her research had found a dearth of available men for older women in the United States For example for every 223 unmarried women in their 40s there are only 100 unmarried men in their 40s she said and for every 10 women 40 to 49 years old with a college education there are only 3 single men who are older and better educated The new YaleHarvard study showed that in part because of this imbalance the number of collegeeducated women who marry has dropped significantly Dr Bennett said Whereas only 9 percent of collegeeducated women born in the mid1930s never got married it appears that 22 percent of collegeeducated women born in the mid1950s can be expected to never marry he said These results were especially striking Dr Bennett said because in most other subgroups of the population 90 percent of the women married at some point The 37page study was conducted over the past year by Dr Bennett Dr Patricia H Craig another Yale sociologist and Dr David E Bloom an economics professor at Harvard It examined the data gathered from the Census Bureaus June 1982 Current Population Survey and drew on several other surveys that reflect changes in current marriage patterns The researchers used a mathematical device called a parametric model that based on past and present marriage patterns is supposed to project what proportion of the women covered by the survey would marry and at what age The model also estimated what percentage of women would never marry A Matter of Choice The study did not establish why women surveyed did not marry It did not show for example if the women chose not to or if they could not find suitable husbands It could very well be that many women who reach age 30 having not married are quite content never to marry Dr Bennett said For some group of women just as with some group of men who never marry there will be some lack of emotional fulfillment but we just dont know by virtue of our data just how much heartache there is out there Also it may well be that men are continuing to make unrealistic demands of welleducated careeroriented women demands to which men themselves would never accede he added And that may be why many of these women are not marrying The report offers a number of explanations for its results Dr Bloom the Harvard economist attributed what he called the huge decrease in the number of women who marry primarily to their increased participation in the labor market About 55 percent of the women over the age of 16 are in the labor force in 1986 compared with 34 percent in 1950 and 36 percent in 1955 The fundamental point is both marriage and work are very timeintensive Dr Bloom said Essentially its hard to do both It turns out that a lot of those women who thought they were delaying marriage subsequently find out that their marriageability declines he added They find it difficult to find a marriageable partner and they themselves become less interested in marriage because of the life style they develop There are also fewer reasons for a woman to marry Dr Bloom said Women are more financially independent Contraception and the legality and growing acceptance of abortion have also freed women from the childbearing function to an extent that is unprecedented in history he added Women dont have to get married to have children and they dont have to avoid marriage in order to avoid having children Historically Dr Bennett said women expected to marry someone with higher accomplishments and higher educational attainments than themselves and conversely men in the past expected to marry women who werent quite their equals and were willing to stay home and take care of the household and take care of the kids These expectations are changing and must change further he added In effect there has to be a meeting of the minds otherwise many more people will go unmarried The study did not examine men and their marriage patterns because Dr Bennett said the Census Bureaus data supplied by men were untrustworthy It appears that when men are asked about their marital status on surveys if they are actually divorced they may say they have never been married he said This is presumably because many men do not pay their child support and theyre afraid that the government will pursue them if this was found out The study also showed that contrary to what is commonly thought women are not getting married much later than they used to Dr Bennett said the average marrying age of collegeeducated white women born in the mid1930s was 23 The average age of women from the same group born in the mid1950s was 24 A handful of single women who were asked about the results of the survey said they found them depressing A few said there was a genuine scarcity of men But others said they believed the survey did not reflect a lack of opportunity for women as much as their increasing selectivity Similar Education and Goals I dont want to sound like a snob but if youre collegeeducated and pursuing a career and trying to achieve something right away half the men in the world are no longer interesting to you said Liza Gaynor a 26yearold Yale graduate who is starting her own company in Manhattan You want a man who is as educated as ambitious and as interested in achieving something as you are I think the main point is that women are refusing to lower their standards said Elizabeth Boucher a 26yearold Wall Street stockbroker There are plenty of guys out there who want to get married but its a question of whether its the kind of guy you want to marry And as Miss Boucher pointed out women also said they felt little pressure to get married either for economic or emotional reasons I think women are much less frightened of going out and being alone she said They get so much satisfaction from other parts of their lives that they dont rely so heavily anymore on the man in their life
THE FRON RUNNER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/magazine/the-fron-runner.html,IN THE EVENING DARKNESS WITH his latest mission for President Reagan behind him George Bush stares across his private cabin aboard Air Force Two as its four powerful engines roar in the background The Vice President has the wary look of a marathon runner just before the biggest race of his life Though the primaries are two years off Mr Bush is clearly running for his partys nomination and the words that tumble out of his mouth like his expression reinforce the notion After five years in Ronald Reagans shadow Mr Bush has launched a drive to succeed the President and he has done it with intensity For the record Mr Bush is playing it close to the vest because he officially becomes a candidate only when he declares But no one should get the impression that he doesnt want to be President America faces many challenges he says sounding very much like a campaigner So long as I may be considered qualified to meet those challenges I am eager to do so Its just as simple as that Mr Bush party insiders say is the clear frontrunner for the Republican nomination Right now its his to lose says an aide to President Reagan It is also clear Mr Bush is determined to hold that position He is gathering a trusted and savvy staff around him has formed a political action committee to raise money and spread the word has installed operatives in key primary states and in the last few months has gone on a vigorous speechmaking offensive aimed at broadening his support in the Republican Partys conservative ranks The Vice President has also furthered his cause by serving the President with unflagging loyalty and energy He has logged more than 750000 miles preaching the Reagan gospel and has taken it upon himself to defend his bosss most controversial actions  for instance Mr Reagans visit last year to a German cemetery where SS officers are buried White House officials say that Mr Reagan would anoint Mr Bush without hesitation as the one most suited to carry his conservative revolution into the next decade were it not for the Presidents role as party leader and his desire to stay above the political fray It is clear that Mr Bush has made inroads into the partys conservative factions which have in the past regarded him with suspicion In fact several recent surveys by Republican organizations showed that he is the first choice of party conservatives that he is preferred by more Republicans than the combined percentage of those likely to oppose him in a primary and that he is also rated above any of the most frequently mentioned Democratic contenders Sitting in the cabin of his plane after discarding his dark businesssuit jacket for the more personal flight jacket with George Bush Vice President on it Mr Bush told a visitor I feel fairly comfortable with where I stand That isnt to say that I cant do better personally or I cant pick up support in one area or another where I might not have it right now But Im relaxed with myself Within the political community however a suspicion lingers that Mr Bush who lost when he sought the Republican nomination for President in 1980 and was a loser twice while running for the United States Senate from Texas stands to become the Walter F Mondale of 1988 That is the party frontrunner with the money and organization but without a message that voters are seeking Beyond support for the Reagan agenda in fact it is unclear exactly what Mr Bushs message is Both the Vice President and his aides concede this but contend that Mr Bush most definitely has a message But to spell it out now would risk upstaging Mr Reagan they say What is more in an apparent attempt to be all things to all Republicans Mr Bush has created an identity problem In one recent week for example despite the concerns of some conservative supporters he joined civilrights leaders for an emotional tribute to the Rev Martin Luther King Jr at the Ebenezer Baptist Church in Atlanta joining in their cry of We Shall Overcome Three days later he was among several hundred cheering at a dinner of the New York State Conservative Party The day after that he appeared in Washington before the Liberty Federation and praised its founder the Rev Jerry Falwell for his moral vision for America What is clear in any detailed assessment of his chances to hold the lead is that his most formidable opponent is not necessarily one of a scattering of potential challengers but George Herbert Walker Bush himself HE JOURNEY THAT THE 61yearold Vice President has embarked upon at perhaps the most critical point in his career is being taken without a complete road map The strategy that he and his aides have devised involves a series of tactics rather than a detailed plan The two major elements of the strategy in 1979 were to build upon George Bushs broad Government experience and experience in Republican politics and to concentrate on early and indepth organizational efforts in the early primary and caucus states says Treasury Secretary James A Baker 3d who was then Mr Bushs campaign manager This time aides believe that Mr Bush can garner the nomination on the strength of an appeal to all elements within the Republican Party and then win the general contest with a similar multifaceted approach Moreover they believe that Mr Reagans policies and Mr Bushs strong identification with them will provide an important election benefit Frontrunner is a very precarious situation but if you know how to proceed its the best place to be said Lee Atwater the director of Mr Bushs political action committee and a former top political adviser to Mr Reagan Mr Bushs plans call for following the script he used in the 1982 midterm elections when he traveled the country vigorously campaigning for Republican candidates and serving as Mr Reagans standin About 150 such trips are planned this year roughly the same number taken four years ago On the advice of Mr Baker one of a small core of behindthescenes advisers for the Vice President and other strategists who are publicly working for Mr Bush some other tactical decisions have been made Gone for example are most of those who served in staff positions during Mr Bushs first term as Vice President such as retired Adm Daniel J Murphy his chief of staff Peter Teeley press secretary and J Steven Rhodes chief domestic policy adviser They have been replaced by a team operating out of two locations Craig L Fuller who worked for Mr Reagan now serves as the Vice Presidents chief of staff in the Executive Office Building and Marlin Fitzwater another Reagan staff alumnus is press secretary There is also a group of strategists at Mr Bushs political action committee that includes Mr Atwater Helen Cameron who was in charge of voter registration in the 1984 Reagan campaign and Ron Kaufman special assistant to Mr Atwater Mr Bush also receives advice from such longtime associates as the polltaker Robert Teeter Dean Burch a former chairman of the Republican National Committee and Nicholas Brady a former New Jersey Senator  The forwardsounding Fund for Americas Future has its headquarters on the third floor of a Washington office building eight blocks from the White House Large color pictures of Mr Bush dot the walls and about 20 paid staff members and numerous volunteers are hard at work there Since its creation by Mr Bush last May the fund which has representatives in each of the 50 states has raised more than 39 million through directmail solicitations contributions from supporters and fundraising events The money is slated for the campaigns of Republican candidates in Senate House and state races this November The Vice President can expect this generosity to be repaid politically The fund can also easily shift gears and raise money for Mr Bushs own election Mr Bush has taken other steps including the establishment of an office in Michigan and the dispatching of staff workers to New Hampshire and Iowa where key early primaries will be held He has also visited Michigan the site of precinct delegate contests that are viewed as the start of the primary process five times since the 1984 election and plans another trip next month But the major tactic in Mr Bushs quest for the nomination involves his relationship with Mr Reagan At almost every stop on his travels this point is made in introductions of Mr Bush that he is loyal and that he is close to the President The ability of Mr Bush to present himself in such a manner has greatly enhanced his political standing his aides say Although the relationship between the two men is largely private aides for both say there is a geniune closeness even affection between them Last February Mr Reagan in what came close to an endorsement of Mr Bush as his successor called him the finest Vice President I ever have any recollection of The President would endorse him in the minute said one top Reagan aide noting that he has a longstanding pledge against taking sides in intraparty contests Although the interplay between the two men and the advice Mr Bush provides in weekly lunches between the two and during daily national security briefings is secret aides to the Vice President point to several incidents to describe the relationship between him and the President They tell of how genuinely upset Mr Bush became last spring  the angriest they have ever seen him  when word leaked about his advice to the President on retaining special tax breaks for oil and gas exploration during the development of the taxsimplification plan later offered to Congress He wanted the President to know that he wasnt going to suddenly start to find a way to put into print what he was recommending in small and private meetings Craig Fuller recalls Aides also mention Mr Bushs decision to wade into the controversy last May surrounding the Presidents visit to Bitburg cemetery in West Germany The Vice President decided to act after his wife Barbara told him she had received criticism of the visit while speaking in New York Marlin Fitzwater recalls that He said I have been stewing at home and worrying about it and Im damn tired of people not sticking up for the President  Mr Bush then typed a speech in defense of the President that was later delivered with few changes to the United States Chamber of Commerce The relationship with Mr Reagan has given Mr Bush acceptance among Republican conservatives and hardliners who in recent years have been the partys most active element They range from Mr Falwell and Congressman Robert K Dornan of California on the far right to Angela M Buchanan Jackson who served as treasurer of two Reagan Presidential campaigns and is considered in the mainstream of the conservative ranks George Bush has had a historical problem with the right wing of this party says Mr Atwater The type of problem that deprived Bush of being able to win in 1980 when he knocked Reagan down he said referring to Mr Bushs upset victory in the Iowa primary That problem is by and large behind him But the aide continued Is he the hero of the right or is he going to get a hundred percent No the aide answered reflecting the prevailing view of the political community I T IS THE POTENTIAL candidacy of Representative Jack Kemp of New York who Mr Bush refuses to criticize even in private that generates the most concern within the Vice Presidents camp Some advisers believe that unlike other possible challengers such as Senator Bob Dole of Kansas or former Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee Mr Kemp can mount a strong campaign as the ideological heir to the President and also has a base on the right from which to launch an assault on Mr Bush A desire to prove his conservative mettle was the prime motive for Mr Bushs appearances at a number of conservative gatherings in recent months in which he promoted his credentials in sharp language In a speech in New York he blasted every twobit punk with a knife or a gun who mugs a cleaning lady At a gathering of Mr Falwells Liberty Federation in Washington he hailed the evangelist America is in crying need of the moral vision you will bring to our political life the Vice President told Mr Falwell In December Mr Bush even spoke at a tribute to the late William Loeb the staunchly rightwing New Hampshire publisher who bitterly opposed him in the 1980 campaign These speeches have come at a critical period in which Mr Kemp is seeking to gain a foothold of his own The Bush plan is to cut off any possible confrontation with Mr Kemp in the months ahead and focus instead on campaigning for Republicans and serving as Mr Reagans surrogate But Mr Bush has already run into a barrage of pointed  and unexpected  criticism After the Vice Presidents speech in New York the conservative columnist George F Will wrote The unpleasant sound Bush is emitting as he traipses from one conservative gathering to another is a thin tinny arf the sound of a lap dog Mr Bush said he was surprised by the personal nature of the Will attack and aides say privately that they believe it was an isolated incident that will quickly be forgotten Yet it underscores the doubts some conservatives have with the Vice President and the danger that can occur to a politician even when venturing into what appear to be safe waters The lesson we learned is that we have to be careful and view all that the Vice President does from the perspective of 1988 said Mr Fitzwater Mr Bush said recently of the speech Certainly the people who were there for the most part seemed to think it was all right But did it turn out the way I wanted Obviously no While not disputing the breadth of Mr Bushs support within the Republican Party strategists for some potential opponents question its depth Moreover they explain their own main tactic for now is to depend heavily on Mr Bush stumbling badly If this guy falters some place early what does he fall back on said a top strategist for one rival who did not want his name to be used A S MR BUSH DIScusses such a flap the words that come out are not just defensive they are downright exasperated George Bush has grown weary of explaining his motives and his political philosophy Any fairminded analysis of his record Mr Bush argues would show him to be a conservative In the first place my appearances before the Conservative Party arent something new he says There seems to be a new focus on it in certain quarters but I think that has to do with speculation about 88 and not the reality Similarly with Falwell he says Ive done events with Falwell So what we are seeing is a continuation of what Ive been doing not just with the right wing but with other constituencies What I say is what I believe whether it is at a moderate forum or a conservative forum It is not so much what Mr Bush says before groups of various Republican persuasions however as it is the tone of his remarks which reinforces the notion that he is playing to the audience more than stating a strong political belief For example at a dinner in Washington last July given by the Ripon Society a moderate Republican organization Mr Bush whose appearance was opposed by some of his own staff  argued for tolerance within the party ranks Its because of our ability to debate reasonably with one another because of the solid foundation of common principles that pulls us together because of the fermentation of thought that this combination of unity diversity and tolerance within our ranks has fostered  its because of all this that in the last decade our party has become the party of ideas in America he told Ripon Society members At a memorial service in Atlanta last month on the first legal holiday for the Rev Martin Luther King Jr Mr Bush told an overflow crowd We will work to let freedom ring throughout the earth so that we may carry forward the legacy of Martin Luther King so that Americas message of freedom hope and democracy is heard wherever men and women can hear and so that governments of the people by the people and for the people the only sure and ultimate guarantees of justice  come to characterize all the earth Next to Mr Bush on the podium in Atlanta was Anglican Bishop Desmond M Tutu of South Africa who Mr Falwell had branded as a fraud In the battle for the partys right Jack Kemps supporters have argued that their man is a purer conservative than Mr Bush because he was an early supporter of Mr Reagans economic program while Mr Bush  then an opponent  lambasted it as voodoo economics They say that Mr Bush voted for guncontrol legislation while a Texas Congressman in the late 1960s They point to Mr Kemps cosponsorship of a humanlife amendment against abortion Mr Bushs position on abortion has by his own admission not been consistent In 1980 he supported abortion when pregnancy results from rape incest or when the mothers life is in danger  a stance clearly at odds with Mr Reagans By 1984 when Mr Bush came out against abortion he at first claimed that he could not recall his earlier position During the televised debate with Geraldine A Ferraro he said that there had been an evolution of his thinking as the result of 15 million abortions since 1973 I support the Presidents position  and am comfortable with it from a moral standpoint he said But the level of his conservative purity is only one of the major issues facing the Vice President in his journey Another and perhaps more fundamental one is whether Mr Bush has a vision or message to galvanize public support Not since the 1980 campaign has he had to answer that question And even then aides acknowledge what Mr Bush stood for never fully reached the public Ron Kaufman who in 1980 was head of his Massachusetts organization had this observation When he ran in 1980 the first part of the campaign was to establish the George Who and I think he did a good job We never changed gears quickly enough to the George What That perhaps made George Bush kind of muddled You need an independent identity and its tough to do when your stock in trade is loyalty to the Administration says a leading Republican strategist who hasnt made a choice for 1988 Its not impossible but he needs a message a message that looks forward optimistically the way the President does better than anyone Thats the missing link Another Republican Party loyalist working in the White House sums up Mr Bush this way He strikes me as one who wants to keep on keeping on Aides to Mr Bush say that he does have a message and that it will emerge when the timing is more appropriate I dont think that he is unwilling to let people know where he stands said Craig Fuller But he doesnt want to do it in a way that will ever cause the President to question their relationship He is very comfortable with an operating style that maximizes his effectiveness as a Vice President even if at times it might not work to his longterm political advantage Robert Teeter says There is no question in my mind that in 1988 George Bush has got to tell the country what he thinks and where he will lead But for an incumbent Vice President it is not the thing to do There is no reason M OST MODERN American political leaders have been clearly defined Lyndon Johnson and Richard Nixon were seen as being driven by the cold pursuit of power Jimmy Carter as a populist who evolved from humble origins And Ronald Reagan  the clearest of all  as a dynamic figure motivated by strong ideological tenets To the public Mr Bush seems to lack this sharp definition Basically he is an achiever in this sense  he has lofty goals and reaches for them and once he obtains them moves on says Mr Teeley the Vice Presidents former press secretary and now a Washingtonbased consultant who continues to serve as an adviser to the Mr Bush According to Nicholas Brady one of Mr Bushs most trusted confidants Hes not an ideologue in any sense His philosophy centers around whats fair and whats appropriate and a right sense of proportion Friends and associates describe Mr Bush as being driven by different motives Some assert that he is missionoriented Others cite a strong sense of public duty and patriotism Still others point to a willingness to take risks and a strong sense of compassion Mr Teeley notes for example that as a child Mr Bushs nickname was Havehalf derived from his practice of sharing half of whatever he had with friends What perhaps makes Mr Bush difficult to define is that he is a product of several vastly different experiences He grew up in Greenwich in an atmosphere that one aide described as good family good education and good manners He was the son a United States Senator from Connecticut Prescott Bush and a student at Phillips Academy in Andover Mass After World War II from which he returned a decorated Navy pilot Mr Bush attended Yale where he was captain of the baseball team and graduated Phi Beta Kappa with a degree in economics He then settled in Texas where he became a selfmade millionaire in the booming oil business In 1964 Mr Bush in effect retired from business to pursue a career in politics and public service He ran for the United States Senate that year and lost He was elected to the House of Representatives in 1966 and 1968 before losing a second bid for the Senate in 1970 He subsequently served as chief United States delegate to the United Nations as chairman of the Republican National Committee as head of the United States liaison office in Peking and as Director of Central Intelligence In public Mr Bush projects aspects of all three lives Privately he shows a sensitivity to what he calls the myths that they have spawned including the one he resents the most  that he is a preppy When asked about where he buys his suits he is quick to point out that they are not from Brooks Brothers but from Arthur A Adler in Washington and Norton Ditto in Houston You think of me as wearing buttondown shirts he said on a recent flight from Florida to Andrews Air Force Base Well I havent owned a buttondown shirt in 10 years You think of striped ties  I might have I dont want to be going into much depth on my wardrobe but Id say 3 possibly 2 percent of the ties Ive got are striped Gucci shoes he asks removing a shoe to read the label inside Is that your basic Gucci shoe Its your basic 11D very sensiblelooking Middle American shoe Mr Bush has other image problems Unlike the President he is not a man for the cameras In front of them he seems to lack assurance When making a key point his voice can rise to the point of shrillness and occasionally  as in his debate with Geraldine Ferraro when he appeared to be lecturing his opponent  he comes across as a bully While contending that it did him no lasting harm Mr Bush says now of his performance throughout the campaign Should I have been more pleasant Yes I should have continued to smile and thats one of the things I would have done differently Aides have also begun working with Mr Bush to overcome his habit of adlibbing in speeches a result of trying to maintain eye contact with the audience In doing so he often strays from the text and ends up paraphasing the words thus losing some of their impact In recent months he has been using a Teleprompter and taking a larger role in the preparation of his speeches On the Bush staff there is no Michael K Deaver Mr Reagans muchtouted image man who recently left the Administration to start a public relations business That role is largely Mr Bushs own although Mr Fuller and Mr Fitzwater provide advice I cant imagine Mr Reagan without a Mike Deaver and I cant imagine Mr Bush with a Mike Deaver says one Bush adviser Sitting by a pool during a major Western swing that Mr Bush made last fall a senior adviser recalled how the Vice President had once donned a pair of contact lenses and had rejected them with an I cant live with them Thats the way he is the adviser said take it or leave it Mr Bush enjoys verbal sparring with the press corps Yet when he does only a few insights emerge a few pieces of a mosaic rather than a complete picture of the man As a child the Vice President says he had no interest in politics As a young adult fresh out of the Navy and Yale he struggled on an income of 300 a month But still he preferred taking his chances in the risky oilfield supply business in Texas to a more comfortable position in New York The Bushes  she the daughter of the publisher of McCalls magazine he a Navy flier on leave  were married in 1945 in her hometown of Rye NY They have five children George 39 of Midland Tex John 33 of Miami Neil 31 of Denver Marvin 29 of Alexandria Va and Dorothy Bush LeBlond 26 who lives in Cape Elizabeth Me While Barbara Bush is influential in her husbands decisions friends say it is not in the manner of Rosalyn Carter who served as an adviser to Jimmy Carter or Nancy Reagan who serves as a protector to her husband Barbara Bush declines to discuss her views on key issues saying that she is not the candidate When asked if she would play a role in Mr Bushs decision about his political future she would only say It would not be a family war council that makes the key or some of them domestic decisions They evolve The Bushes appear very much at ease together While returning to Washington from a brief visit to Houston last fall they sat comfortably on the Vice Presidents plane eating yogurt trading goodnatured banter Has her husband changed over the years Mrs Bush is asked No but I keep hoping is the response  and they reminisced about their early bittersweet days in Midland Midland was new people new faces new ventures said Mr Bush He had come to the west Texas town in 1948 fresh out of college I helped to start the YMCA was a director of the bank and helped raise money for a theater We were participating in the wonderful expansion of a wonderful community It was a tremendous experience But one of the Bushes most difficult years occurred in that period when their daughter Robin died of leukemia in 1953 at the age of 3 It was the most agonizing period of our lives the Vice President said as tears formed in his wifes eyes But it drew us together I remember going into the bank holding Robins hand and they asked me where the little girl was who was sick recalled Mr Bush who commuted from Texas to the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center in New York while Mrs Bush remained by their daughters side And here she was three months before her death Today given the advances of medical technology she might still be alive We couldnt understand why this child  we went through all of that as anybody does the Vice President said Whats Gods message Why We went through all of that and came out with a strong sense of faith If the ending would have been different it would have been the greatest experience of our lives A S AIR FORCE TWO GLIDES home from a more recent trip and Mr Bush prepares for arrival in Washington and his next mission for Mr Reagan his thoughts are on the future His close identity with the President now his strongest asset could turn out to be a drawback as Mr Reagans budget and tax plans as well as other policies run into stiff opposition Mr Bush concedes that I am identified with the Presidents policies and will be identified with them and I am not going to change from being identified with them If they are looking good it will be an asset If they are looking lousy it will be a detriment And while no one would discount the impact of an endorsement from Ronald Reagan tacit or otherwise there is also the knowledge that the Reagan Presidency is based more on his enormous personal popularity than it is on the strength of his policies At this point no one can predict how much of Mr Reagans glow will rub off on George Bush Yet friends and advisers to the Vice President contend that he has the ability to be very much his own man His experience in the 1980 campaign reinforced his resolve they say Its as if someone says to you you cant be the champ but you say Yeah but Im a better boxer  Mr Teeley recalls of that year You feel that you are better and that you can win and that you are being prevented from trying as hard as you possibly can Shirley Green a longtime friend of Mr Bushs who has served on his staff says I would suspect that he probably feels that his whole life or at least the last 15 years or more has been one of preparation for the Presidency Not to aspire to it at this stage would be illogical based on the preparation he has had It would be like a runner working up to a marathon and not doing it For now Mr Bush is content to strike a familiar note I want everybody to be for me that can be absolutely he says More importantly I want people who share my views more than any individuals I disagree with Jerry Falwell on some things just like Im sure he disagrees with me on some issues Of course I want him for me Ive never been one who believed that you should start narrowing down your support says Mr Bush who Mr Teeter describes as the one guy to keep all the Republicans in the tent I could probably think of a group or two that I wont want support from says the Vice President But if its under this broad umbrella that is the Republican Party yes I want it
FOLLOW- UP ON THE NEWS; Fight to Wipe Out Rubella in U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/us/follow-up-on-the-news-fight-to-wipe-out-rubella-in-us.html,RUBELLA highly dangerous for pregnant women and their babies was reported on the ropes in the United States Last year the National Centers for Disease Control said that in 1984 there were 752 cases of the disease commonly called German measles This was the lowest total reported since a rubella vaccine became available in 1969 The Federal health agency said it was opening a drive to eradicate all traces of the disease Further gains have been made The provisional total for 1985 was 604 cases and that represents a 20 percent decrease from the 1984 total reports Dr Stephen Preblud chief of the child and adult immunization section at the disease control centers Its a 99 percent decrease from the year with the great number of cases ever reported That year was 1969 and the number of reported cases was 57686 Our expectations are that as long as rubella vaccine gets used by the general population rubella and Congenital Rubella Syndrome will continue to decline Dr Preblud says The syndrome which can be one effect of maternal infection may lead to a stillbirth a spontaneous abortion or birth defects
One Issue That Seems To Defy a Yes or No,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/weekinreview/one-issue-that-seems-to-defy-a-yes-or-no.html,The political fight over abortion which once provoked hopes and fears of a constitutional amendment and a Government more concerned with and involved in the morality of its citizens has settled into trench warfare The troops still assemble regularly Last month 36000 foes of abortion marched on the Supreme Court to protest the anniversary of its decision in Roe v Wade and next month the decisions supporters hope to gather as many or more of their partisans at the Lincoln Memorial But neither side hopes for recent triumphs and a recent New York Times Poll suggests that a key reason for the shift in atmosphere is that Americans do not see abortion in anything like the clear blackandwhite terms discerned by activists on the issue In Washington there is no longer an imminent prospect of a constitutional amendment forbidding or limiting abortions  a fact that represents a strategic success for the groups that call themselves prochoice President Reagan regularly renews his calls for an amendment but it has become clear that he will not spend serious political capital on the fight Instead for organizations such as Planned Parenthood or institutions such as the District of Columbia government which advise or pay for abortions using funds from other sources the battle is over Federal money for abortions themselves And there the recent record is one of tactical victories for the groups that oppose abortion and call themselves prolife Peter Gemma head of the National ProLife Political Action Committee agrees that in the last few years there have been no dramatic gains for his side But he contends that more judges who oppose abortion are being appointed and that his allies have realistic hopes of cutting off Federal appropriations for anyone who does consultation on abortions On the other side Ann F Lewis executive director of Americans for Democratic Action is optimistic because she sees politicians competing for younger voters and concluding that a rigid antiabortion stance is a sure way to discourage them Root Conflicts But The Times Poll indicates two deeply felt conflicts in the public that make unlikely solid support for sweeping changes in either direction First 56 percent of the public said they did not approve of the present legal situation with 40 percent saying they wanted abortion legal only in such cases as saving the life of the mother rape or incest and 16 percent saying it should not be permitted at all But only threefourths of them or 41 percent of the population said they wanted the Constitution amended to make their belief the law of the land Other important conflicts showed up Fiftyfive percent of the public said they believed that abortion is the same thing as murdering a child but 66 percent said they agreed with the statement that abortion is sometimes the best thing in a bad situation Twentyseven percent of the public  23 percent of the men and 31 percent of the women  believed both of those statements The margin of sampling error in the survey was plus or minus three percentage points On both sets of questions it was clear that people with higher incomes and more education were least hostile to abortion For example 50 percent of those with family incomes of less than 12500 but only 27 percent of those with incomes of 50000 or more wanted an amendment to change the law Similarly 64 percent of those who did not have a high school education but just 36 percent of those with college or advanced degrees believed that abortion was the same thing as murder Age mattered more on the issue of the legality of abortion than on questions about what the procedure means morally Fortyfive percent of those 44 or younger said the practice should be legal as it is now only 25 percent of those 65 or older agreed Southerners and Midwesterners were especially hostile to abortion people from the Northeast were least antagonistic The history of polling on abortion has consistently shown that the wording of a question had a tremendous impact on the responses To public opinion specialists that is a clear indication of uncertainty and conflict To an angry Connie Marshner head of the National ProFamily Coalition the recent New York Times polls findings that abortion is seen as both murder and the best thing in a bad situation were incredible She said Those people who agree with both statements havent got a leg to stand on when it comes to criticizing Hitler They are saying murder is all right But to Carol Gilligan associate professor at the Harvard Graduate School of Education and the author of In a Different Voice the figures reflected a pragmatic approach to a very complicated moral argument comparable to one that upholds killing in wartime People can imagine themselves in situations like that she said and cant be quite sure what they would do and so dont want to impose their views on others
LIFE LAY BEYOND THE BRONX,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/books/life-lay-beyond-the-bronx.html,A WIDER WORLD Portraits in an Adolescence By Kate Simon 186 pp New York Harper  Row 1495 THERE are stories so crucial for their audience that each fresh telling and perhaps especially each fresh revision or debunking only heightens the storys power The American immigrant success story for many of us is such a story as Kate Simon has demonstrated before in her previous autobiographical volume Bronx Primitive Portraits in a Childhood This new book picks up where that one ended as the author passes from childhood in the late 1920s A Wider World Portraits in an Adolescence continues into the Great Depression and ends with harsh even bitter emblems of rebirth and survival Bronx Primitive was widely read and admired justly for its vivid picture of immigrant life in New York and for its authors distinctly individual perspective on that life This perspective governs her clean and unpretentious prose style her aristocratic disdain for cant her frank worldliness and the unforced breadth of reference that compares the elevated subway service barns of 180th Street in the Bronx to early Renaissance palaces or teases the reader with a forward leap to an experiment with hallucinogenic mushrooms in Mexico many years later Unsentimental judgmental passionate in dislike and in loyalty coolly meticulous of eye she has applied to her own early life the practical writerly poise developed in a long career as the author of excellent guidebooks Possibly the best known is New York Places and Pleasures That poise in itself gives us confirming evidence of the success story while Miss Simon in every episode of her autobiography reminds us without exaggeration or flinching of the casualties and the costs Some of these can be seen as ugly corollaries of uprooting overcrowding the survival of old repressions amid new pressures for example the casual though furtive sexual use of the childs body by adults of both sexes including relatives more or less fresh off the boat put up for a few weeks in the tiny family apartment The ironic counterpoint to these lowgrade molestations is the repressive badgering of his daughter by the vain puritanically accusing father His simultaneous rejection and thwarted efforts at controlling her Miss Simon implies were more traumatically humiliating than anything she endured at the hands of his friends and relations WHEN the child demands freedom to roller skate to play with Italian friends simply to run the father predicts she will wind up a prostitute as some neighborhood children in fact do and a derelict What he seems to sense and fear is that she is becoming an American woman And whatever that phrase means it seems more threatening to him she feels than that she be fondled at the movies by a widowed uncle or used for masturbation by his niece from Poland When his dream of forging her into a concert pianist who will make him rich dies his anger settles into hatred and sexual accusations The expensive spurned piano embodies his rage The school authorities force him to let her attend high school escaping his cultured patriarchal stifling grip for good This is not the nostalgic world of Abies Irish Rose or Golden Boy But neither is it tinted by selfpity or lament Miss Simons main note is reportorial relish Her straightforward writing strips away blurry expectations from such familiar material as the immigrant familys struggle from greenhorn status the familys internal and external conflicts the waves of cousins from the old country Even the very settings are familiar the neighborhood of Bronx Primitive divided into strips and sectors that are northern Italian southern Italian and JewishGermanPolishGreekHungarianRumanian later the City College and Hunter College advanced summer colonies Harlem and Greenwich Village of A Wider World But Miss Simon makes her times and places new convinces us that we are seeing them and their inhabitants from close up HERE is the cool intelligent somewhat mischievous observer working as nanny for a cultured couple who invite her to meet a celebrated friend I [ was ] often treated as a guest invited to listen to the poetry readings of Mr Essen a director and a failed poet The Yiddish of his verse was simple enough to understand What was difficult were his narrow fields of simile children womens eyes small flowers were all ziggalach young goats  a disconcerting dullness as I made unfair comparisons with the great Romantic poets The same couple provide a more exciting entry into the Cafe Royale gathering place for the luminaries of the Yiddish theater The deep wide room was dazzlingly lit as noisy as a market and as brilliantly gaudily colored as a Gypsy camp We recognized a few of the actors as Essen guests and as Second Avenue billboard posters all of them in full stage makeup cheeks hectic eyes blazing Several of the women wore large embroidered Spanish shawls    One famous tragedienne wore a tall blaringred turban another with heavily kohlcircled eyes sported a yellowed ermine capelet her hands buried in its matching Anna Karenina muff    Davy and I made our way through the darting bodies the tassels the furs the dashing hats and billowing neckerchiefs to the crowded table of a quiet smiling group listening to one drollfaced man He was the famous journalist    who could maintain a conversation or a long monologue on almost any subject in rhymed couplets in Yiddish quite a feat He was adroit funny and gracious enough to invent a lilting set of couplets for us rosy baby lovers  The reference to poetry and to English poetry in particular is important because it represents one of the avenues that lead to the wider world of the books title Three American institutions helped the bright willful child defy the confining expectations that threatened a female poor Jewish immigrant These three ways out and up profoundly democratic and successful were the movies with their glamorous intimations not only of luxury but of an intrepid powerful womanhood the public library and public education embodied by Hunter College and PS 58 but above all by the English department of James Monroe High School The English Department small talkative dedicated material    The indulgent English Department loved all of its promising children with a springtime faith to the point of freeing them from ordinary curriculum rigidities Thus some of us were excused from the routine English classes and permitted to gather as poetry groups as drama classes as classes in Shakespeare May all harried and dedicated high school teachers of literature take heart from this gratitude of a writer who looking back across five or six decades finds in the words English Department a Samarkand of imagination richness and color I hope there are still public schools as demanding stringent ambitious and nurturing as James Monroe appears to have been at its best Miss Simons ability to knock off an essay on almost any subject easily and fairly well led to encouragement by one teacher that she become a music critic the suggestion of another that she continue with further research her essay on the games ballads and street songs of the Bronx The school linked intellectual seriousness and study with personal and social scope a vital process for one who had it dinned into her that Jewish goals had to be modest and those of a Jewish woman more modest still However sustained and patient work held no attraction for Miss Simon who drifted into a more bohemian less scholarly persona made up from books pierced ears a raffish costume based on instinct the movies and garments like a Borsalino hat discarded by welloff babysitting customers The scholarly direction of the school did not pull this selfmade figure into its current nor did the passionate semiinformed radicalism of rent strikes and parents who changed their childrens names from Solly and Benny to Marxele and Trotskele New York City itself with its appetite for charm and excellence and its impersonal ability to discard them exerts the strongest force as Miss Simon moves from James Monroe to Hunter College in the early 30s Her terrain becomes the city of Carnegie Hall and the Lower East Side Ukrainian groceries and Moroccan restaurants mansions in Brooklyn Heights and Czechoslovak craft shops the columns of Heywood Broun and Alexander Woollcott Against this background representative figures embody the world that welcomes and often callously uses the authors gifts women teachers who take up the precocious child and introduce her to the world then drop her abruptly out of sexual jealousy or sexual rejection the black man who sends her back to the Bronx from a Harlem nightclub as too innocent the older man who shows her the city of flower markets bridges views the cultivated dermatologist whose captive wife immensely less liberated than the tough immigrant Jewish and Italian women of the Bronx prepares for him and his male friends the exact feast served a 14thcentury Archbishop of York on his visit to Durham Cathedral Meanwhile the wife picks at scraps in the kitchen a sympathetic successfully victimized embodiment of the world of Miss Simons father Working for this couple the author first hears names like OKeeffe Varese Picabia Bodenheim James Joyce The falseness and oppressiveness of the household like the exploitative quality in the friendship of some of her teacherpatrons appear matteroffactly accepted as tuition costs in Miss Simons education The immense appetite for sophistication for worldliness in its least culpable sense subsumes the desires for love money or education which become forms of that larger quest THE Hunter girls who as part of this quest struggle with poverty  occasionally going without food or heat for the prize of a drink in a real bar a movie ticket or some other token of class are stranger creatures in this narrative than I would have imagined Though they are committed to advanced thought of every kind these young women dream a fascinating and partly atavistic construct of womanhood hodgepodge in detail but emotionally in a way even ideologically coherent Some of us English majors had been sufficiently seduced by books to dedicate ourselves to dreams of lives that echoed the infinite variety of Cleopatra withering and staling as our grandmothers and mothers did were to be avoided at the profoundest costs We would live heroic sorrows and great pleasures as we learned them in Shakespeare in Greek dramas and French novels as we learned them from the daring tough beggingfortheknifeinthebodice Carmen And there were the lush toothsome Belle Epoque women all pearls plumes and rose satin as introduced to us by the Goncourts and Proust If not the Odettes the gallant unfortunates semiloved and thoroughly discarded of Zola and Dreiser and closer to our own time the burners of candles at both ends Edna St Vincent Millay Genevieve Taggard Elinor Wylie This list is a moving report from its place and time another universe as Miss Simon calls it What is most surprising about these romantic wellread members of the Young Socialist League is how little they know about sex and particularly birth control One young woman in this fast bohemian set offers to share the latter on a Friday afternoon Anna of the mischievous face Who wants my pessary I havent got a date this weekend running around from table to table offering her supreme and rare gift Since most of us were too inexperienced to wonder about fit and general usability she frequently found takers This is startling and not merely funny Kate Simons mother a sophisticated woman who spoke excellent English who had contempt for housework and started her own successful business had 13 abortions while having her three children about four per year One of the few entirely benign altruistic figures in these two books another is Mr Brandon chair of the English department at James Monroe High School is Dr James a New England aristocrat whose mission now that he was retired from ordinary practice was to perform abortions for immigrant women at no fee or little For all their Shakespeare Marx and Isadora Duncan the Jewish immigrants were American urban poor exiled as far out of the worlds amenities of knowledge as any ethnic group When Miss Simon as a college student runs a high fever neither she nor her City College boyfriend has the least idea that hospital emergency rooms exist With St Vincents and Bellevue nearby they stagger through subways stairs and platforms to his mothers apartment In the closing episodes of A Wider World Miss Simon describes two abortions of her own a cheap one in a sinister setting which serves its purpose and an expensive Irving Place one in a nice office that nearly kills her The smooth young doctor after his work kisses her on the mouth and strokes her breast then leaves her in the closed office unconscious and bleeding heavily The implied point of these incidents repeatedly is Kate Simons present control and independence she has come through she is writing confirming with some understated bitterness an important national legend In that story pluck talent and desire carry the disinherited child from helplessness up through trials to join a graceful American aristocracy of merit that draws the deserving toward itself The costs and defects of this process propel works as diverse as The Great Gatsby Francis Coppolas Godfather films My Antonia and The Life and Times of Frederick Douglass Kate Simons modest distinctive and feminist account may be all the more essentially American precisely because the transitional climb is a matter not of heroic determination or overwhelming genius but of shining intelligence good luck and a tough likable vitality SHE CAME FROM WARSAW AND CONQUERED To Kate Simon there is little difference between the sharply detailed travel books for which she is well known and her two evocative memoirs of growing up as an immigrant daughter between the two world wars I must have started being a travel writer when we first came to America said Miss Simon who emigrated from Warsaw with her mother and younger brother at age 4 and quickly became a keen observer of her small Bronx community The places I had to get to know very quickly the languages I couldnt understand And all that peeping in places and climbing up on the roof is part of the very primitive beginnings of that kind of curiosity It was as if How can anything happen without my being there to witness and report it  Both Bronx Primitive Portraits in a Childhood and its sequel A Wider World Portraits in an Adolescence are laced with images of almost dreamlike clarity Miss Simon did not keep a journal But what I remember is extraordinarily vivid to me she said in the living room of her East Side apartment filled with clear winter light and the sound of Turandot This too is part of the travel thing  the responses the gathering in A Wider World paints a portrait of an unusually plucky and courageous teenager What gave the young Kate Simon the impetus to escape  spiritually and physically  from the confines of her upbringing and culture Perhaps most of all there was the lure of adventure Any child given the kind of responsibility I had at 4 and 5 must be very precocious in the need for independence I was extraordinarily ambitious to learn the world and to try myself I was not taught that I had to be happy Also I learned endurance Unless you had a fever you went to school Though A Wider World describes some harrowing experiences the author remembers her coming of age as a golden time I was going through what you might equate with a very young knighthood I had stations  places to go and to test and to conquer It was not formal not conscious but it was my own rites of passage  Constance Rosenblum
"W,HAT DID THE FOUNDING FATHERS INTEND?",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/23/magazine/what-did-the-founding-fathers-intend.html,THE CONSTITUTION OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BE 200 years old on Sept 17 1987 and a Bicentennial commission headed by Chief Justice Warren E Burger whose birthday felicitously falls on that date  is under way formulating plans for Constitution Day festivities The celebratory air notwithstanding recent discussions of constitutional values seem to reveal more conflict than shared pride Some examples Last summer in remarks before the American Bar Association Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d criticized the Supreme Courts recent decisions reaffirming the First Amendment requirement that government maintain a strict neutrality toward religion The Attorney General castigated the Court for ignoring the intent of the framers and stated that the Philadelphia Convention would find the doctrine of a strict neutrality between religion and nonreligion    somewhat bizarre In an undelivered portion of his text the Attorney General seemed to question the applicability of the Bill of Rights to state governments In an address last fall Justice John Paul Stevens responded to the Attorney Generals criticisms by stating that some uncertainty may attend an effort to identify the precise messages of the framers Speaking at Georgetown University last October Justice William J Brennan Jr rejected the arrogance cloaked as humility of those relying on the facile historicism inherent in the originalintent theory The Supreme Court has agreed to hear a case in which it will decide whether the right of privacy includes consensual adult homosexual conduct Critics contend that no right of privacy is mentioned in the Constitution or was envisioned by our Founding Fathers In the ongoing debate over original intent almost all Federal judges hold to the notion that judicial decisions should be based on the text of the Constitution or the structure it creates Yet in requiring judges to be guided solely by the expressed views of the framers current advocates of original intent seem to call for a narrower concept Jurists who disregard this interpretation the argument runs act lawlessly because they are imposing their own moral standards and political preferences on the community As a Federal judge I have found it often difficult to ascertain the intent of the framers and even more problematic to try to dispose of a constitutional question by giving great weight to the intent argument Indeed even if it were possible to decide hard cases on the basis of a strict interpretation of original intent or originalism that methodology would conflict with a judges duty to apply the Constitutions underlying principles to changing circumstances Furthermore by attempting to erode the base for judicial affirmation of the freedoms guaranteed by the Bill of Rights and the 14th Amendment no state shall deprive any person of life liberty or property without due process of law nor deny to any person    the equal protection of the laws the intent theory threatens some of the greatest achievements of the Federal judiciary Ultimately the debate centers on the nature of judicial review or the power of courts to act as the ultimate arbiters of constitutional meaning This responsibility has been acknowledged ever since the celebrated 1803 case of Marbury v Madison in which Chief Justice John Marshall struck down a Congressional grant of jurisdiction to the Supreme Court not authorized by Article III of the Constitution But here again originalists would accept judicial review only if it adhered to the allegedly neutral principles embalmed in historical intent In the course of 36 years on the Federal bench I have had to make many difficult constitutional interpretations I have had to determine whether a teacher could wear a black armband as a protest against the Vietnam War whether newspapers have a nonactionable right to report accusatory statements and whether a school system might be guilty of de facto segregation Unfortunately the framers intentions are not made sufficiently clear to provide easy answers A judge must first determine what the intent was or would have been  a notoriously formidable task An initial problem is the paucity of materials Both the official minutes of the Philadelphia Convention of 1787 and James Madisons famous notes of the proceedings published in 1840 tend toward the terse and cursory especially in relation to the judiciary The Congressional debates over the proposed Bill of Rights which became effective in 1791 are scarcely better Even Justice William Rehnquist one of the most articulate spokesmen for original intent admitted in a recent dissent in a case concerning school prayer that the legislative history behind the provision against the establishment of an official religion does not seem particularly illuminating One source deserves special mention The Federalist Papers  the series of essays written by Alexander Hamilton James Madison and John Jay in 1787 and 1788  have long been esteemed as the earliest constitutional commentary In 1825 for example Thomas Jefferson noted that The Federalist was regularly appealed to as evidence of the general opinion of those who framed and of those who accepted the Constitution of the United States The Federalist however did not discuss the Bill of Rights or the Civil War amendments which were yet to be written Moreover the essays were part of a political campaign  the authors wrote them in support of New Yorks ratification of the Constitution The essays therefore tended to enunciate general democratic theory or rebut antiFederalist arguments neither of which offer much help to modern jurists In light of the following passage from The Federalist No 14 I believe Madison would be surprised to find his words of 200 years ago deciding todays cases Is it not the glory of the people of America that    they have not suffered a blind veneration for antiquity    to overrule the suggestions of their own good sense    Another problem with original intent is this Who were the framers Generally they are taken to be the delegates to the Philadelphia Convention and the Congressional sponsors of subsequent amendments All constitutional provisions however have been ratified by state conventions or legislatures on behalf of the people they represented Is the relevant intention then that of the drafters the ratifiers or the general populace The elusiveness of the framers intent leads to another more telling problem Originalist doctrine presumes that intent can be discovered by historical sleuthing or psychological rumination In fact this is not possible Judges are constantly required to resolve questions that 18thcentury statesmen no matter how prescient simply could not or did not foresee and resolve On most issues to look for a collective intention held by either drafters or ratifiers is to hunt for a chimera A reading of the Constitution highlights this problem The principles of our great charter are cast in grand yet cryptic phrases Accordingly judges usually confront what Justice Robert Jackson in the 1940s termed the majestic generalities of the Bill of Rights or the terse commands of due process of law or equal protection contained in the 14th Amendment The use of such openended provisions would indicate that the framers did not want the Constitution to become a straitjacket on all events for all times In contrast when the framers held a clear intention they did not mince words Article II for example specifies a minimum Presidential age of 35 years instead of merely requiring maturity or adequate age The First Amendment is a good example of a vaguer provision In guaranteeing freedom of the press some of our forefathers perhaps had specific thoughts on what publications fell within its purview Some historians believe in light of Colonial debates that the main concern of the framers was to prevent governmental licensing of newspapers If that were all the First Amendment meant today then many important decisions protecting the press would have to be overruled One of them would be the landmark New York Times v Sullivan ruling of 1964 giving the press added protection in libel cases brought by public figures Another would be Near v Minnesota a case involving Jay Near a newspaper publisher who had run afoul of a Minnesota statute outlawing malicious scandalous and defamatory publications The Supreme Court struck down the statute in 1931 forbidding governmental prior restraints on publication this ruling was the precursor of the 1971 Pentagon Papers decision The Founding Fathers focused not on particularities but on principles such as the need in a democracy for people to engage in free and robust discourse James Madison considered a popular government without popular information a Prologue to a Farce or a Tragedy Judges then must focus on underlying principles when going about their delicate duty of applying the First Amendments precepts to todays world In fact our nations first debate over constitutional interpretation centered on grand principles Angered at John Adamss Federalist Administration advocates of states rights in the late 18th century argued that original intent meant that the Constitution like the Articles of Confederation should be construed narrowly  as a compact among separate sovereigns The 1798 Virginia and Kentucky Resolutions which sought to reserve to the states the power of ultimate constitutional interpretation were the most extreme expressions of this view In rejecting this outlook a nationalistic Supreme Court construed the Constitution more broadly The important point here is that neither side of this debate looked to the stated views of the framers to resolve the issue Because of his leading role at the Philadelphia Convention Madisons position is especially illuminating Whatever veneration might be entertained for the body of men who formed our Constitution he declaimed on the floor of Congress in 1796 the sense of that body could never be regarded as the oracular guide in expounding the Constitution Y ET I DOUBT IF STRICT proponents of original intent will be deterred by such considerations Their goal is not to venerate dead framers but to restrain living judges from imposing their own values This restraint is most troublesome when it threatens the protection of individual rights against governmental encroachment According to current constitutional doctrine the due process clause of the 14th Amendment incorporates key provisions of the Bill of Rights which keeps in check only the Federal Government Unless the due process clause is construed to include the most important parts of the first eight amendments in the Bill of Rights then the states would be free in theory to establish an official church or inflict cruel and unusual punishments This doctrine is called incorporation Aside from the late Justice Hugo Black few have believed that history alone is a sufficient basis for applying the Bill of Rights to the states In his Georgetown University address Justice Brennan noted that the crucial liberties embodied in the Bill of Rights are so central to our national identity that we cannot imagine any definition of liberty without them In fact a cramped reading of the Bill of Rights jeopardizes what I regard as the true original intent  the rationale for having a written Constitution at all The principal reason for a charter was to restrain government In 1787 the idea of a fundamental law set down in black and white was revolutionary Hanoverian England in the 18th century did not have a fully written unified constitution having long believed in a partially written one based on ancient custom and grants from the Crown like the Magna Carta To this day the British have kept their democracy alive without one In theory the KinginParliament was and is unlimited in sovereign might and leading political theorists such as Thomas Hobbes and John Locke agreed that governments once established by a social contract could not then be fettered Although not a Bill of Rights the Magna Carta King Johns concessions to his barons in 1215  was symbolic of the notion that even the Crown was not allpowerful Moreover certain judges believed that Parliament like the king had to respect the traditions of the common law This staunch belief in perpetual rights in turn was an important spark for the Revolutionary conflagration of 1776 In gaining independence Americans formed the bold concept that sovereignty continually resided with the people who cede power to governments only to achieve certain specific ends This view dominated the Philadelphia Convention Instead of merely improving on the Articles of Confederation as they had been directed to do the framers devised a government where certain powers defined and thereby limited  flowed from the people to the Congress the President and the Federal judiciary Alexander Hamilton recognized that the basic tenets of this scheme mandated judicial review Individual rights he observed in The Federalist No 78 can be preserved in practice no other way than through the medium of courts of justice whose duty it must be to declare all acts contrary to the manifest tenor of the Constitution void Through a written constitution and judicial enforcement the framers intended to preserve the inchoate rights they had lost as Englishmen The narrow interpretation of original intent is especially unfortunate because I doubt that many of its proponents are in favor of freeing the states from the constraints of the Bill of Rights In fact I believe the concern of many modern intentionalists is quite specific outrage over the rightofprivacy cases especially Roe v Wade the 1973 Supreme Court decision recognizing a womans right to an abortion The right of privacy of course is not mentioned in the Constitution Whether one agrees with this controversial decision or not I would submit that concern over the outcome of one difficult case is not sufficient cause to embrace a theory that calls for so many changes in existing law S OME OPPONENTS of strict interpretations of original intent too have been guilty of taking an extreme position Some for example have suggested that invoking the framers is only a cloak to hide more modern and malevolent intentions This view however ignores the threat of abuse of power posed by a lifetenured judiciary Unless restrained in some fashion judges are capable of usurping authority better left to the democratic branches Judicial critics often refer to the 1907 comment of Charles Evans Hughes who later became Chief Justice of the United States that We are under a Constitution but the Constitution is what the judges say it is The power of judges to declare laws unconstitutional does appear at odds with majority rule Why should a handful of Supreme Court Justices  or any Federal judge  appointed for life be able to invalidate the will of the peoples elected representatives as expressed in a duly enacted statute How does one reconcile this power with our commitment to democracy As Hamilton foresaw in The Federalist No 78 and Chief Justice Marshall established in Marbury v Madison review of legislation by nonelected judges is in fact justified by their mandate to enforce the entirety of the law including when there is any conflict the supreme law of the land the Constitution If judicial decisions are based on political notions instead of legal principles that imprimatur is lost One can therefore understand why a clear guide to constitutional interpretation is thought necessary History tells us of grave abuses of power when judges feel unrestrained Consider for instance the infamous Dred Scott decision in 1857 Dred Scott was a slave whose master had taken him into the Louisiana Territory and under the terms of the Missouri Compromise was thus made a free man Scott however later was taken to the slave state of Missouri With the aid of abolitionist lawyers Scott brought a suit in Federal court to obtain his freedom on the grounds he had been emancipated On appeal the Supreme Court ruled against him Hoping to settle the slavery issue through judicial fiat instead of political compromise the High Court decided blacks were not citizens and Congress could not regulate slavery in the territories After noting the subjugation of blacks at the time of the Constitutions adoption Chief Justice Roger Taney concluded they had no rights which the white man was bound to respect The opinion was vociferously denounced in the North The Court has rushed into politics raged The New York Tribune without other purpose than to subserve the cause of slavery Instead of healing sectarian strife the Courts exercise of power most likely hastened the Civil War The Justices likewise suffered ultimate defeat when they attempted to halt the advent of the modern welfare state The Federal judiciary in the early decades of this century regularly invalidated social legislation such as child labor statutes and minimum wagemaximum hours laws Claiming that the due process clause embodied economic liberty judges relied on the rubric of substantive due process to impose their own views on the nation This period is known as the Lochner era after a famous case in which the Supreme Court struck down a New York statute prescribing a 10hour workday for bakery employees Lochner was the owner of a bakery who was prosecuted for violating the statute The Justices believed that the government lacked the authority to interfere with private contractual arrangements In a powerful dissent Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes denounced the Courts imputation of laissezfaire capitalism to the Constitution The Fourteenth Amendment does not enact Mr Herbert Spencers Social Statics The Lochner era came to a close when the Supreme Court ultimately accepted President Roosevelts New Deal programs These examples indicate the need for judicial impartiality and restraint but if original intent is an uncertain guide does some other more functional approach to interpreting the Constitution exist One suggestion is to emphasize the importance of democratic process As John Hart Ely dean of the Stanford Law School forcefully advocates this approach would direct the courts to make a distinction between process the rules of the game so to speak and substance the results of the game Laws dealing with process include those affecting voting rights or participation in society the Supreme Court correctly prohibited segregation for example because it imposed on blacks the continuing stigma of slavery Judges however would not have the power to review the substantive decisions of elected officials such as the distribution of welfare benefits Basically such an approach makes courts the guardians of democracy but a focus on process affords little help when judges decide between difficult and competing values Judicial formulation of a democratic vision for example requires substantive decisionmaking The dignities of human liberty enshrined in the Bill of Rights are not merely a means to an end even so noble an end as democratic governance For example we cherish freedom of speech not only because it is necessary for meaningful elections but also for its own sake T HE TRUTH IS THAT no litmus test exists by which judges can confidently and consistently measure the constitutionality of their decisions Notwithstanding the clear need for judicial restraint judges do not constitute what Prof Raoul Berger a retired Harvard Law School fellow has termed an imperial judiciary I would argue that the judicial process itself limits the reach of a jurists arm First judges do not and cannot deliberately contravene specific constitutional rules or clear indications of original intent No one would seriously argue or expect for instance that the Supreme Court could or would twist the Presidential minimumage provision into a call for sufficient maturity so as to forbid the seating of a 36yearold I doubt in any event that Federal judges would ever hear such a question The Constitution limits our power to traditional cases and controversies capable of judicial resolution In cases like the hypothetical one regarding the Presidential age the High Court employs doctrines of standing proving injury and political question to keep citizens from suing merely out of a desire to have the government run a certain way Moreover the issues properly before a judge are not presented on a tabula rasa Even the vaguest constitutional provisions have received the judicial gloss of prior decisions Precedent alone of course should not preserve clearly erroneous decisions the abhorrent separate but equal doctrine survived for more than 50 years before the Warren Court struck it down in 1954 The conventions of our judicial system also limit a jurists ability to impose his or her own will One important restraint often overlooked is the tradition that appellate judges issue written opinions That is we must support our decisions with reasons instead of whims and indicate how our constitutional rulings relate to the document A written statement is open to the dissent of colleagues possible review by a higher court and the judgment sometimes scathing of legal scholars In addition the facts of a given case play a pivotal role Facts delineate the reach of a legal decision and remind us of the cases and controversies requirement Our respect for such ground rules reassures the public that even in the most controversial case the outcome is not just a political ruling Judges are also mindful that the ultimate justification for their power is public acceptance  acceptance not of every decision but of the role they play Without popular support the power of judicial review would have been eviscerated by political forces long ago Lacking the power of the purse or the sword the courts must rely on the elected branches to enforce their decisions The school desegregation cases would have been a dead letter unless President Eisenhower had been willing to order out the National Guard  in support of a decision authored by a Chief Justice Earl Warren whose appointment the President had called the biggest damnedfool mistake I ever made Instead of achieving the purple of philosopherkings an unprincipled judiciary would risk becoming modern King Canutes with the cold tide of political reality and popular opprobrium lapping at their robes My revered predecessor on the Court of Appeals Judge Learned Hand remarked in a lecture at Harvard in the late 1950s that he would not want to be ruled by a bevy of Platonic Guardians The Constitution balances the danger of judicial abuse against the threat of a temporary majority trampling individual rights The current debate is a continuation of an ageold and perhaps endless struggle to reach a balance between our commitments to democracy and to the rule of law Although my office forces me to take a very direct part in the ongoing dialogue all Americans have a stake in what my judicial colleagues and I say about the Constitution At bottom the debate is the consequence of our experiment now two centuries old in giving our fundamental ideals written expression in a Constitution And that is cause for celebration
BRIEFING; Smeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/25/us/briefing-smeal.html,After a month of skirmishes at Catholic University a speech by Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women is finally set to occur tonight having been moved offcampus by law students And the student chapter of the National Lawyers Guild has proclaimed today Eleanor Smeal Day to protest what it says is a curtailment of academic freedom The conflict began when undergraduates invited the womens rights advocate to speak on campus Jan 28 Pressure from students who believed the address would focus on abortion led to a withdrawal of the invitation The law students promptly renewed the invitation but the administration saying they had filed notice too late to comply with procedural guidelines for appearances open to the entire student body ruled that the speech could be heard only by law students with undergraduates and the press explicitly barred The law students rescheduled the address to Feb 25 to comply with rules for allcampus events but university officials then said that in no event would university facilities be made available The address Womens Issues in the Eighties will be given at the Capital Hilton 16th and K Streets at 730 PM with the speaker waiving her 1500 honorarium
CONGRESS; Wheels Are Spinning Over the Senate's Rules,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/26/us/congress-wheels-are-spinning-over-the-senate-s-rules.html,Capitol Hill is used to rebellions For more than a decade junior lawmakers have been demanding more power from their elders and often getting it But now the Senate is confronted with a counterrevolution and the furor is coming from the front benches not the back ones Senator Bob Dole the majority leader and Senator Robert C Byrd the minority leader have cosponsored a package of changes in rules that would make it easier for the leaders to set the legislative schedule and harder for individual members to get in their way Its pretty hard to set the agenda over here Senator Dole said today The leadership is powerless unless members are willing to give them authority The Senate has 100 separate power centers added Senator Daniel J Evans a Washington Republican who backs the changes Im afraid the Senate has splintered as a result Its outrageous that the majority leader doesnt have the opportunity to set the schedule of the Senate without thought of a filibuster But the proposed changes have drawn a bombardment of criticism from lawmakers who say the changes will alter the basic character of the institution In their view the ability of even one senator to thwart and frustrate the leadership is an essential ingredient of the American system and a critical guarantee against the tyranny of the majority as Senator John Heinz a Pennsylvania Republican put it Senator Jesse Helms a North Carolina Republican added Most of the criticisms of the Senate I consider to be virtues of the Senate As a result the leaders are trying to negotiate a compromise with their critics and the outlook for the changes is still uncertain This sharpedged collision over the nature and purpose of the Senate actually developed by accident Earlier this month the chamber started debating a proposal to change the rules to allow its proceedings to be broadcast on televison and radio but many lawmakers began to realize that exposing their arcane customs to the viewing public might open them to embarrassment and ridicule As Senator Lawton Chiles a Florida Democrat put it The Senate doesnt work very well My gosh if we let people see whats going on here weve got to make it work better This concern about the Senates television image played into a longstanding view in some quarters that the legislatures rules were being abused by a small group of members who were more interested in making political points than in passing bills Accordingly the two party leaders decided that they could use the television issue to force through changes in the rules that they had been contemplating for a long time One of their main proposals would make it impossible to conduct a filibuster against a motion to take up a bill Such delaying tactics often frustrate the leaders efforts to bring a particular bill to the floor But Senator William L Armstrong a Colorado Republican argues that by blocking a bill from reaching the floor a lawmaker can force others to negotiate a compromise that eventually produces better legislation A second proposed change would severely curtail the ability of a lawmaker to continue a filibuster after the Senate has voted to end it Under current rules an ingenious and determined lawmaker can keep a filibuster going almost indefinitely Senator Evans maintains that this unlimited delaying tactic is an abuse of the rules and the original purpose of the filibuster Members should be allowed to slow down the debate and make sure an issue is subjected to close scrutiny but they should not be allowed to kill it in Mr Evanss view Ultimately he said the majority in any body has to have the right to conduct its affairs Senator Helms responds that it would be a tragic mistake to erode the filibuster in any way This is the only legislature in the world he said where a minority of one can get up and oppose a proposal as long as his stamina permits A third major proposal would bar all nongermane amendments from a particular bill if threefifths of the body agreed to do so Under current rules virtually any amendment is in order on any bill and members complain that they are forced to vote repeatedly on unpalatable issues by colleagues who want to embarrass them politically and raise campaign contributions from special interest groups We have to vote on abortion 4000 times around here said Senator Chiles But Mr Armstrong says many major bills have passed only because they were attached to unrelated measures The latest example he said was the legislation adopted last year mandating a balanced Federal budget It was added as a rider to a measure raising the national debt ceiling Underlying these specific arguments is a basic philosophical disagreement Some say it is necessary to sacrifice a few rights now enjoyed by individual members so as to make the entire body more efficient and responsive People utilize the rules in ways that they were never intended to be used Senator Evans said They use them for personal concepts and ideas and issues Its created such chaos in the Senate that we cant get anything done Were approaching gridlock and that was not intended by the Founding Fathers But opponents of rules changes say that the rights of the individual senator are paramount and that the chamber can always do its work if it mirrors the public will When the country is ready for legislation Senator Armstrong said when the Senate is ready for legislation we can pass something here with breathtaking speed
MANILA AFTER MARCOS: VATICAN VIEW; CHURCH ACTIVISM RAISES QUESTION OF POPE'S STAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/27/world/manila-after-marcos-vatican-view-church-activism-raises-question-of-pope-s-stand.html,Vatican officials said today that the vocal part played by the Roman Catholic Church in the Philippines had raised difficult questions about the churchs political role and about Pope John Paul IIs campaign to distance priests from political activity But the Vatican generally welcomed the outcome of the struggle in which President Ferdinand E Marcos was deposed At the end the thing was for the best a high Vatican official said Up to this moment I think everyone in the world has a feeling of relief The only official comment today came from the Pope himself whose statements on the conflict had been remarkably cautious Doesnt Mention Marcos or Aquino In a brief address to 7000 pilgrims and tourists at his regular weekly audience today the Pope once again chose prudence avoiding the exultant statements of many Western leaders He did not mention either Corazon C Aquino the opposition leader who became President on Tuesday or Mr Marcos In the past few days I expressed my sentiments for the beloved Philippine people inviting prayers that in that difficult and worrying situation a peaceful and just solution without recourse to violence might be reached John Paul said Today I want to repeat to those people that I continue to be close to them with affection and I wish that all again find unity of hearts in pursuing the true good of the nation he said I entrust my wish to most holy Mary who is so venerated by the Philippine people asking her to protect and sustain it in the not easy course of its national history he said Vatican officials said the caution of the Popes remarks was especially striking in view of the central role played by the Philippine church especially Jaime Cardinal Sin the Archbishop of Manila  in overthrowing Mr Marcos John Pauls statements the officials said reflected his discomfort with an overt political role The Philippine church showed no such reluctance the officials noted The important steps it took included the Catholic bishops call for resistance to Mr Marcos in a statement in which they described the Feb 7 presidential elections as unparalled in the fraudulence of their conduct Catholic Radio Voiced Opposition The Catholic station Radio Veritas became the main voice of the opposition After Defense Minister Juan Ponce Enrile and Lieut Gen Fidel V Ramos rebeled against Mr Marcos Cardinal Sin told Radio Veritas listeners Our two good friends have shown their idealism I would be very happy if you could support them now The Cardinals call was crucial in galvanizing the opposition to Mr Marcos and bringing demonstrators to the military base where the two men had established themselves It has never happened that the church has put itself to the service of a revolution in this way a Vatican official said Mr Marcos a Catholic was so enraged by the churchs role that at one point he denounced the bishops for using priests and nuns not only to help the opposition but to destroy the electoral process Vatican officials acknowledged that the overt role the church played seemed to clash with the Popes criticisms of political activism by priests particularly in Nicaragua where the church has barred four priests in the leftist Sandinista Government from exercising sacral functions Differences Noted An influential Vatican official said I have already been asked the question How can the Pope be against the priests in Nicaragua and tolerate Cardinal Sin The Vatican offers several answers to this question Officials note that the priests in Nicaragua held political office while Cardinal Sin and the opposition priests sought no political offices Moreover the activist Catholics in Nicaragua were allied with Marxists and against the Archbishop of Managua Miguel Cardinal Obando y Bravo In the Philippines priests allied with the Communist New Peoples Army are a tiny minority The vast majority of activist priests and nuns are arrayed behind Cardinal Sin and in support of moderate peaceful change Vatican officials said that the Pope had great confidence in Cardinal Sin and that the Cardinal had succeeded in defending a moral position and upholding the churchs interests in his battle with the Marcos regime Always on the Right Side Sin was a key man said a Vatican official reflecting the views of other Vatican officials He has always managed to be on the right side The officials also noted that the church had played an important role in the opposition elsewhere  with the Popes support One case they said was Haiti where JeanClaude Duvalier was driven from power this month In a trip through Central America and the Caribbean in March 1983 the Pope strongly attacked social injustice and political repression in Haiti The attack which emboldened the church to intensify its criticism of Mr Duvalier included an explicit defense of the churchs right to speak out against misery hunger and fear The church has a prophetic mission in this field inseperable from its religious mission the Pope said Some Unease Acknowledged Still officials here acknowledged that there was some unease in the Vatican over the extent to which the Philippine church had assumed a leading role in the political struggle The first clear response came on Feb 16 when the chief Vatican spokesman Joaquin Navarro Valls issued a carefully worded statement expressing support for the Philippine bishops Coming a day after the bishops had denounced the elections as fraudulent the statement was interpreted as supporting their action But over the next week Vatican officials sought to discount the idea that the Pope himself was endorsing wholeheartedly every aspect of the bishops statement The Popes own comments on Feb 17 a prayerful call for a peaceful resolution of the conflict supplanted the Saturday statement as the main declaration of Vatican policy As intense consultations between the Philippine church the Marcos Government and the United States continued over the next week the Vatican became increasingly reluctant to make any further public statements Divisions in Philippine Church Vatican officials also noted that there were divisions within the Philippine church and a Vatican official said the Marcos family was close to some Filipinos in the Curia the Vaticans central administration There was a kind of VaticanFilipino circle that was very plugged in very proMarcos a Vatican official said Imelda Marcos had also cultivated a number of Cardinals The official said the Marcos family had emphasized its fight against abortion divorce and Communism In the end Vatican officials said the events in the Philippines underlined the extent to which the churchs political activities are often beyond the direct control of Rome A Vatican official asked about why the church had acted as it did in the Philippines smiled and said with a touch of irony Its a local problem Cardinal Sin should know why You should ask him Perhaps most striking officials said is the extent to which the hierarchy  once regarded as a reliable supporter of conservative forces  is now willing to align itself with movements for social change Vatican II Cited They trace the change to the social teachings of the Second Vatican Council 196265 and of Popes John XXIII and Paul VI And they note that despite John Pauls reputation for conservatism on religious issues and his opposition to Communism he has spoken out often on human rights and social justice Msgr William F Murphy the undersecretary of the Pontifical Commission on Justice and Peace argued that there was an inevitable tension between the churchs desire to speak out on moral questions  which inevitably involve government policies  and to avoid direct involvement in politics The fundamental fact is that the church has to proclaim certain values that have repercussions in the social sphere Monsignor Murphy said The announcement of these values themselves may indict certain governments and certain regimes We cannot meddle in politics he added but that doesnt mean we can retire to the sacristy
CATHOLIC PRESS RIGHT TO DISSENT WITHIN CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/us/catholic-press-right-to-dissent-within-church.html,Many of the same Roman Catholics who placed a 1984 advertisement advocating the right to hold diverse views on abortion have reserved a second fullpage advertisement in The New York Times Sunday that criticizes the church hierarchy for its reprisals against those who dissent The new advertisement signed by more than 1000 Catholics including five priests and 40 nuns says some of the 97 signers of the first advertisement have been threatened with dismissal from religious orders and have lost teaching positions and speaking engagements at Catholic institutions We believe that Catholics who in good conscience take positions on the difficult questions of legal abortion and other controversial issues that differ from the official hierarchical positions act within their rights and responsibilities as Catholics and citizens it says The new advertisement is regarded as provocative even by some liberal Catholics The editors of The National Catholic Reporter for instance warned Catholics not to sign it because it was a deceitful dishonest and divisive effort that could exacerbate conflict 3 Nuns Among New Signers The first advertisement which some saw as clouding the churchs unequivocal prohibition against abortion touched off a furor The Vatican demanded that the 24 nuns and four priests who signed it publicly repair the scandal or face expulsion from the priesthood or their religious orders At least seven nuns have taken undisclosed steps that successfully resolved the Vatican complaints against them and the four priests have publicly retracted their action Frances Kissling executive director of Catholics for a Free Choice who is on the steering committee that originated both advertisements said three nuns who had signed the first advertisement had also signed the one scheduled to run Sunday She said she had pledged not to identify the three before its publication In addition 12 nuns who signed the first advertisement have prepared a statement to be made public Sunday applauding the courage of the current signers and advocating the right to responsible dissent Both advertisements again focus attention on what constitutes dissent from church teaching and what steps the church should take to assert its teaching authority Solidarity Is Affirmed In an interview several weeks ago after plans to run the new advertisement were announced Russell Shaw a spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said Its off the wall to assert that dissent from church teaching on something as serious and clearly taught as the immorality of abortion is an acceptable position for a Catholic It simply is not he said But he said he was relieved the latest advertisement did not put that ridiculous confusing assertion on the table that somehow dissent from church teaching is just as legitimate a position as acceptance of church teaching He suggested Vatican officials had been particularly angered because the first advertisement implied that approval of abortion was a legitimate Catholic position The new advertisement carries a headline saying We affirm our solidarity with all Catholics whose right to free speech is under attack It goes on to recall the 1984 advertisement which appeared a month before the national election while Geraldine A Ferraro a Catholic who was the Democratic VicePresidential candidate was being assailed for supporting abortion in her role as a public official Chill on Speech Asserted Since that time the new advertisement says many of the signers and their families have been penalized by segments of the institutional Roman Catholic Church Such reprisals consciously or unconsciously have a chilling effect on the right to responsible dissent within the church on academic freedom in Catholic colleges and universities and on the right to free speech and participation in the US political process Miss Kissling said that among the most recent incidents that prompted the 36137 advertisement was the excommunication of the director of Planned Parenthood in Rhode Island We feel that the purpose of the Vatican reprisals against women religious and other reprisals is to frighten Catholics into being silent she said It is therefore important that we send a strong and clear message that we will not be silent and that such reprisals on the part of the church will lead to more speaking out not less Breaking of Higher Law The members of the Committee for Concerned Catholics which arranged the advertisements include the novelist Mary Gordon Rosemary Radford Ruether who is professor of applied ethics at Garrett Evangelical Theological Seminary and Mary Buckley a professor at St Johns University The Catholic bishops Committee for ProLife Activities chaired by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago said the churchs teaching on abortion is binding not only because the church says so but because this teaching expresses the objective demands placed on all of us by the inherent dignity of human life A Catholic who chooses to dissent from this teaching or to support dissent from it is dissenting not only from church law but from a higher law which the church seeks to observe and teach the panel continued Such dissent can in no way be seen as legitimate alternative teaching
FIRST FAMILY'S FOIBLES: A DRAMA IN TWO ACTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/style/first-family-s-foibles-a-drama-in-two-acts.html,When Patti Davis elder child of President and Mrs Reagan signed a contract to write a semiautobiographical novel about coming of age as the daughter of a Republican with hardy good looks and a persuasive voice who becomes Governor of California and then President of the United States she did not mention the fact to her parents Actually they found out in the press the 33yearold author was saying the other day Five minutes after I got a book deal I read about it and so did everybody else Now Miss Davis is embarking on a publicity tour for Home Front Crown 1595 the revealing book she has written with Maureen Strange Foster The tour opens in New York on Monday and winds up three weeks later in Seattle with no scheduled stops in Washington I Still Havent Heard Weeks have passed since she wrapped a copy of the book and mailed it to her parents she said but I still havent heard whether they read it or not Then realizing the irony she laughed and said Ill probably find out in the press After years of shunning the White House limelight both of the Reagans children Patti and Ron have gone public in their fathers last term with irreverent impressions of the First Family Both have been accused of capitalizing on family connections the daughter denies the charge the son cheerfully pleads guilty People are saying well this is just an autobiography and all she did was change the names but thats not true at all Miss Davis said in a telephone interview from Santa Monica Calif where she lives with her husband Paul Grilley a yoga instructor No Tear Gas Like the books heroine she has differed with her parents on significant issues including nuclear power abortion premarital sex marijuana and the Vietnam War But unlike the heroine she said I was too young to be in an antiwarmovement demonstration and Ive never been around tear gas ever Describing her book as a blend of fact and fiction she said her technique was to take conflicts and dilemmas I went through in speaking at antinuclear rallies and opposing my father and superimpose the antiwar movement Suddenly she said the conflicts become less ominous easier to handle when I gave them to another character I could have her deal with them in ways that maybe I hadnt Miss Davis who uses her mothers maiden name in her acting career said her agent was discussing the possibility of a television movie based on the book with her in the starring role As an actress she said its the best role thats come my way and Id be a fool to give it up to somebody else Asked about reports that she and her coauthor received a sixfigure advance for the book Miss Davis sighed and said I dont really talk about money I just think thats so private In any case she said her motive in writing the book was not money Nor was it an attempt to capitalize on her position The way to capitalize would have been to write an autobiography and sort of an expose This is a part of my life and I havent done anything sensational with it I hope Ive done something creative and entertaining By contrast her 27yearold brother Ron a ballet dancer turned contributing editor of Playboy magazine and correspondent for ABC Entertainment publicly boasts about trading on the family name But he disapproved of trashing my folks in a mean way he has said In his opening monologue as a guest host of NBCs Saturday Night Live a couple of weeks ago he joked that he was there because my father is President of the United States and went on to take part in several skits that poked fun at his parents One skit a takeoff on the movie Risky Business showed him dancing through the White House in shirttails and skivvies after a telephone call in which he assured his mother and father played by two male comics that nothing untoward would occur while they were away at Camp David The following Monday there was a review from the White House A spokeman quoted the Reagans as saying He was funny He was at ease We enjoyed it After a press conference on Tuesday the President was asked about his younger sons acting debut and replied Like father like son There has been no White House review of Home Front although the First Ladys press secretary Elaine Crispen has been asked about it on two occasions Mrs Reagan has the book but has not read it she replied Home Front is described on its jacket as a candidly autobiographical novel about growing up in the public eye during the other Vietnam War  the war at home Two of its central characters are a genial but ideological father and a strongwilled woman fiercely loyal to her husbands dream the Presidency The books heroine becomes not only an estranged daughter but a political libability As the book opens the First Family is moving into the White House and the young son is saying So this is the company housing they gave you huh Dad Ducking in and out rooms to inspect the furnishings the mother exclaims Good grief I just cant wait to redecorate I Didnt See It Later in the book the daughter unable to express her political views to her father writes him a poem Poem the father says Gee you know there are so many other things on my desk I guess I didnt see it Miss Davis refused to say how closely fact paralleled fiction She conceded however that she shared the heroines desire to climb into the limousines front seat so as to be mistaken for the chauffeurs daughter She said she also shared the heroines anger and frustration at not being able to speak out when she disagreed with her father on issues because it would hurt him politically All four children in the First Family  Patti and Ron as well as Maureen who is Mr Reagans daughter by his first wife Jane Wyman and Michael his adopted son  have publicly differed with their father But perception in recent years has been one of increasing closeness One sign that Patti Davis had grown closer to her parents was seen when she was married in Los Angeles in August 1984 It was the first of his childrens weddings that Mr Reagan had attended since being elected President He was in California when Ron got married in New York in 1980 and at Camp David when Maureen was married in California in 1981 Miss Davis said that she still feels close to her parents and that the book helped her to work through some of the hurts and pains of growing up in the public eye At one part in the book the daughter really clarifies her feelings to her parents she said The father says These people in the movement theyre just using you and the daughter says Maybe they are using me but how is that any different from what youre doing Either way Im being treated as an appendage of you Where do you end and I begin  That Miss Davis says is the question the book asks but does not answer completely At the end of Home Front theyre all under the same roof and still talking she said They still have their differences but theres a tolerance there I very deliberately didnt wrap everything up in ribbons because I dont know that theres any more resolution to these problems than just that
COALITION SEEKS WIDER PENALTY IN RIGHTS LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/02/28/us/coalition-seeks-wider-penalty-in-rights-law.html,A national coalition of civil rights groups today urged Congress to restore antidiscrimination enforcement powers that were curbed by a Supreme Court decision two years ago The coalition released two reports charging that in the two years since the Supreme Court decision numerous assertions of sex discrimination were going unchecked by the courts and the Federal Government Both reports also found growing evidence of discrimination on the basis of race and disabilty A Pledge to Redouble Efforts Members of the coalition which includes such organizations as the National Organization for Women the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People and the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund pledged at a news conference to redouble efforts and to employ bold new strategies to win passage of a bill that would overturn the Court decision The Supreme Court ruling of Feb 28 1984 involving Grove City College in Pennsylvania narrowed the Federal law that prohibits sex discrimination in schools and colleges that receive Federal financial assistance The Court held that Title IX of the Education Act Amendments of 1972 banned sex discrimination only in specific programs or activities receiving Federal aid and not in the entire institution At the time various womens rights advocates civil rights groups and their allies in Congress predicted the Courts ruling would have broad repurcussions that could undermine antidiscrimination provisions under Title VI of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 and Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which bars discrimination against people with disabilities Efforts to pass a bill designed to reverse the Court ruling have been stalled by attempts to attach an amendment to the bill limiting abortion rights The bill the Civil Rights Restoration Act would bar all discrimination in schools and other teaching facilities that receive Federal funds The United States Catholic Conference which has long been a strong supporter of civil rights efforts objected to the bill asserting that some of its provisions could be used to force Catholic hospitals that receive Federal aid to perform abortions The Catholic group is pushing for amendments that would gurantee no cutoff in Federal aid to Catholic hospitals that refused to perform abortions The House Judiciary Committee and the House Committee on Education and Labor approved different versions of the bill last year But sponsors did not push for floor action because of the abortion dispute A similar bill is before the Senate Cant Defeat Rights Bill Ralph Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights whose group is a member of the coalition charged at the news conference that members of the radical right are using the bill to push through their own legislative agenda They cant defeat civil rights bill on its merits so they will try to kill it with amendments that have nothing to do with the bill he said The new coalition wants Congress to move ahead on the bill without any amendment As part of the strategy to pressure Congress for action The League of Women Voters today unveiled 15000 petitions it said were signed by members and supporters urging passage of the bill A report prepared by the Womens Law Center a private nonprofit group that is a member of the coaltion and a separate one prepared by the Disability Rights Education and Defense Fund Inc detailed more than a 100 cases of what the studies said were discrimination based on sex and on disability at colleges and other educational institutions receiving Federal funds Marcia D Greenberger a lawyer at the Womens Law Center said that since the Grove City decision numerous claims of sex discrimination in education have gone unaddressed because Federal funds could not be tracked directly to the department professor or activity accused of discrimination even though the school itself received Federal money
REPRIMANDED NUNS PUSH DISSENT ISSUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/02/us/reprimanded-nuns-push-dissent-issue.html,Two Roman Catholic nuns who signed a second advertisement supporting the right to dissent from the churchs teaching on abortion after they were reprimanded for signing the first say they are fighting for a less hierarchical church The issue is whether theres a right to dissent  whether theres a right to dialogue said one of them Sister Patricia Hussey The issues are control and authority and attempts by the hierarchy to impose themselves in our lives Sister Patricia and Sister Barbara Ferraro said they signed the second advertisement to demonstrate solidarity with those who have been oppressed for signing the first They said abortion was not the issue The advertisement lists their names among 15 in a concluding paragraph reading This ad was coordinated by the Committee of Concerned Catholics Other Catholics even some liberals called placing the advertisement provocative 1984 Reaction by Vatican The women members of the Sisters of Notre Dame in Charleston WVa were among 24 nuns and four priests who signed an advertisement in October 1984 saying there was a diversity of opinions among Catholics on abortion Vatican officials who felt that the advertisement implied there was more than one Catholic position on the issue said the nuns and priests had created a scandal and ordered them to retract the statement or face dismissal from the priesthood and from their orders The priests retracted their statements and seven nuns took undisclosed steps that resolved the Vatican complaints against them The cases of the remaining 17 nuns have not been resolved The second advertisement appears in The New York Times today signed by more than 1000 Catholics including five priests and 40 nuns It accuses the church hierarchy of reprisals saying some of the 97 signers of the first advertisement lost teaching positions and speaking engagements at Catholic institutions Rights and Responsibilities We believe that Catholics who in good conscience take positions on the difficult questions of legal abortion and other controversial issues that differ from the official hierarchical positions act within their rights and responsibilities as Catholics the new advertisement says It says reprisals have a chilling effect on the right to responsible dissent Among those who signed were Sisters Barbara and Patricia and another nun who signed the 1984 advertisement Sister Rose Dominic Trapasso a Maryknoll missionary listed in todays advertisement as being in Peru I dont see any problem with this ad Sister Barbara said in a telephone interview All of us have a right to talk without feeling we are under threat of any kind of oppression from Rome Sister Barbara who is 42 years old and Sister Patricia 36 entered the convent at the time or soon after the Second Vatican Council 19621965 was held in Rome They say they were heartened by the democratic changes encouraged by the documents from the council an assembly of the churchs bishops We entered when there was talk of superiors said Sister Patricia who is from Massachusetts Now we have begun to operate in a collegial model of mutuality where we try to make decisions by consensus This is a model the church can learn from instead of imposing things from the top down Church Is the People of God Sister Barbara said the Second Vatican Council clearly called all people to be part of the decisionmaking process But she said the hierarchy excluded from that process women affected by such issues as abortion and birth control The church is talking about its own hierarchical position but the church in my understanding is the people of God said Sister Barbara We are very loyal to what the church is about and very Catholic Sister Barbarasaid she signed the second advertisement because she was upset that the livelihoods of academics and other lay people who signed the first had been jeopardized She is not worried about her own livelihood she said because while she is a member of a religious order she is not employed by the church She and Sister Patricia are codirectors of Covenant House in Charleston which has a program for the homeless run by a board of members of many faiths The directors have told both women their jobs are safe The two nuns declined to discuss their views on abortion Concession by Vatican Aides The issue has never been abortion said Sister Barbara The issue is a call to dialogue the right of men and women in the church other than the hierarchy to have the right of free speech After the first advertisement appeared the nuns were questioned about their actions in telephone calls from their orders headquarters in Rome Delegates from the order have also met with them in Washington DC and Massachusetts The delegates said Sister Patricia have been supportive and have told them that Jean Jerome Cardinal Hamer head of the Vaticans Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes acted harshly in calling for their dismissal Sister Barbara said she would refuse to sign a statement demanded by the Vatican that says she supports the churchs teaching on abortion
CATHOLICS AND ABORTION: ISSUE IS RIGHT TO DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/us/catholics-and-abortion-issue-is-right-to-dissent.html,How far can Roman Catholics go in dissenting from the teachings of the church and still consider themselves good and loyal Catholics That issue has been raised once again by an advertisment in The New York Times yesterday advocating the right to dissent from the churchs teachings against abortion The more than 1000 signers of the advertisement including five priests 40 nuns and several academics argue that Catholics who in good conscience take positions on the difficult questions of legal abortion and other controversial issues that differ from the official hierarchical positions act within their rights and responsibilities as Catholics and citizens But Joseph Cardinal Bernardin in a statement anticipating the appearance of the ad said that the churchs position that abortion is morally wrong is a binding one on Catholics because it expresses both church law and the higher natural law of the dignity of human life Dissent from the churchs position on abortion and support of dissent are wrong he said In an interview several weeks ago the Cardinal chairman of the American bishops Committee for ProLife Activities said that Catholics are expected to give their assent to church teaching especially something that has been taught consistently from the very beginning This he said was made clear in one of the documents of the Second Vatican Council The Constitution of the Church We do have an obligation to give assent he said Many Theological Wrinkles The issue of dissent has many theological wrinkles Interviews with theologians indicate dissent from some teachings is less serious than from others There are some kinds of dissent that could place a Catholic outside the embrace of the institutional church and others that would not Moreover while some teachings may be ironclad there may be legitimate differences over how those teachings can be applied The Rev Richard P McBrien chairman of the theology department at the University of Notre Dame in Indiana says people fall outside the church when they dissent from a defined doctrine that has been labeled as infallible or is considered to be so such as the teaching of the divinity of Christ or the Immaculate Conception If I were to dissent from the papal teaching on birth control he said I might be a disloyal Catholic but it doesnt have the effect of putting me outside the church If one were to reject a defined doctrine of the church one could not be a Catholic Abortion he said is not a defined doctrine The Ending of Lives Nevertheless he said dissent from the abortion teaching is far more serious than dissent from regular attendance at mass or even the prohibition against the use of contraceptive devices he said The issue is what is at stake he said If I refuse to have children and use birth control Im not killing anyone but if I have three abortions Im ending three lives according to church teachings Abortion also carries a harsher penalty within formal church law Among the handful of violators subject to excommunication in the churchs new Code of Canon Law is a person who procures a successful abortion The authority of the teaching against abortion is strengthened by the overwhelming agreement among Catholic theologians that abortion is wrong There is wider disagreement on the birth control teaching The authority of the birth control teaching Father McBrien suggested was muddied after a majority of a papal commission that considered the issue in the 1960s said birth control was acceptable in some cases While Pope Paul VI effectively overruled the commissions recommendation in a 1968 encyclical the teaching authority of the Pope was in fact hurt the priest said More Consultation Seen The birth control enyclical has changed the landscape more than anything since Vatican II because lots of people who before had never thought about assent or dissent were affected he said You had a new attitude among rankandfile Catholics where they didnt automatically accept a church teaching Since then he said American bishops have been far more careful to consult a broad spectrum of Catholics before emphasizing a teaching The Rev Charles E Curran a professor of moral theology at Catholic University whose independent stands have drawn Vatican concern supports the churchs position on abortion but believes the church has to be big enough that some people within the church can dissent Moreover he said one can hold that abortion is completely immoral and still believe it should be permitted as a matter of state or Federal law In the application of principles he said you have to recognize a pluralism of positions allow prudential judgments Facing the Consequences Father McBrien pointed out that a Catholic may depart from a serious church teaching when after proper reflection and study of differing viewpoints the person is convinced the teaching violates his or her conscience Every human being has a duty to follow his or her conscience he said St Thomas Aquinas said that if youre convinced your conscience is still your proper guide you have an obligation to act against an official teaching of the church However he said Catholics who reach the end of this philosophical road must take the consequences They cant complain if theyre not particularly welcome to give talks at major Catholic conventions or to be hired as consultants to bishops or professors at a university he said The signers of the new advertisement criticized the Catholic hierarchy for reprisals against those who had signed an October 1984 advertisement saying there was a diversity of opinions among Catholics regarding abortion The reprisals the second ad said included threats of dismissal from religious orders dismissal from teaching positions and cancellations of speaking engagements Just like Martin Luther King was willing to go to jail these people cant have it both ways Father McBrien said They cant expect to continue in the Catholic Church with the same access to Catholic institutions that they would have had before
NEW GENERATION OF WOMEN'S PUBLICATIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/03/style/new-generation-of-women-s-publications.html,Just when the womens movement seemed to be running into trouble as the political fervor of the 1970s gave way to the pragmatism of the 1980s a new generation of grassroots womens magazines and newspapers has emerged around the country The 1986 edition of the IndexDirectory of Womens Media published last month in Washington by the Womens Institute for Freedom of the Press reflects the strength and diversity of this trend This years directory  there has been one every year since 1975  lists 331 womens periodicals in the United States alone as well as 81 womens presses and 48 womens bookstores The first edition of the directory listed 131 periodicals and 22 presses The editor of the directory Martha Leslie Allen says that 75 new womens publications have sprung up every year for at least a decade although a large number also die Paula Kassell a member of the Womens Institute and founder of the newspaper New Directions for Women published every two months said There is a neverending fount of women out there who want to communicate and bring people together Many of these newspapers and magazines have only a few thousand readers but Mrs Kassel said the circulations add up to a fantastic number Number and Variety For Miss Allen there is something even more important Its not just the numbers that are growing every year but also the variety of the publications she said The new periodicals are reaching different kinds of women  working women religious women sportswomen and others until now uninterested in or unenthusiastic about womens issues Some of the publications call themselves feminist others do not Many still emphasize the issues of abortion equal rights and equal pay that have occupied the feminist movement for more than a decade Others while still concerned with womens getting ahead are giving the word feminism new connotations Some may even be reluctant to use the word Mrs Kassel said but the driving force behind them all is concern for womens equality The entries in the IndexDirectory range from the colorful  Spiritual Mothering Journal or Fighting Woman News a quarterly about womens martial arts and selfdefense  to the scholarly Womens Studies Review In a catalogue arranged according to ZIP code Eidos Erotica for Women By Women is listed immediately before the Harvard Womens Law Journal On Subject of Health Various entries are devoted to health Consuming Passions Newsletter for women with eating disorders or suffering from compulsive eating habits the National Womens Health Network News and Childbirth Alternatives Quarterly Several cater to working women both white collar and blue collar They range from National Business Woman and The Executive Female to Firework a monthly newsletter for women who are firefighters and Tradeswomen Magazine described as the only national publication by and for women in nontraditional bluecollar jobs Others such as Broomstick for women older than 40 show a wry humor in their titles A number of publications are lesbianoriented One striking trend is the growing number of regional publications LA Woman Woman in Washington and Vermont Woman to name only a few New papers are coming out all over the country Mrs Kassel said The South for example is waking up and not just the South Gloria Steinem says that this growth of new publications is because not in spite of the setbacks that have frustrated the womens movement in recent years the defeat of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment for example and the rise of a powerful movement opposed to abortion In her view the backlash is inevitable something that happens to all political movements and a tribute to our success Besides she says the backlash has encouraged activist women by making it clear that nothing will happen automatically In her view This opposition has only increased peoples feeling of need for alternative media Women feel that no one is going to give them anything and they know they have to do it by their own efforts Lack of Communication Southern Feminist published every two months in Athens Ga is in some ways typical of the new publications Its editor Sharron Hannon said that it grew out of the ERA ratification effort Working in the early 1980s as a fulltime volunteer in the campaign to ratify the equal rights amendment she was frustrated by the lack of communication among activists and the poor coverage they received Here in the South she said we have a harder struggle We need to know that there are others out there who are also concerned It can be very lonely being a feminist in the South Her response in July 1984 was to put out the first issues of Southern Feminist Friends and family put up the money articles came from associates in the ratification movement and the Georgia chapter of the National Organization for Women She and a friend put together the first issue in her kitchen  they still work there and still receive no salaries  with help from her husband and children A classified ad in Ms magazine announced the appearance of the new paper but there was no money for more publicity Today Mrs Hannon prints 5000 to 10000 copies of each issue and just manages to break even Other feminist writers and editors have reacted to the adverse climate by moving away from the angry separatist language often heard in the early years of the movement Martha Leslie Allen sees a marked shift in tone  You dont see as much of the kind of personal wearevictims type of response Today its more What are we going to do about it Sojourner which has published in Boston since 1975 is by now a kind of institution among feminist publications a successful business in its own right with a circulation of 25000 and a model for many newer regional papers It is like most of those publications a selfconsciously grassroots effort with an extensive letters section and transcripts of local womens conferences It is also very much dedicated to creating networks by putting activists in touch with other activists and encouraging recruits to volunteer their time But like many of the newest magazines Sojourner reaches beyond the politicized core of the womens movement Its editor Shane Snowden says The younger women coming along want publications that speak to more than the traditional womens issues of abortion equal rights and equal pay According to Miss Snowden readers want articles on what she calls womens spirituality and womens health They are more interested in literary matters and need sophisticated advice about careers and personal relations They are in short more lifestyle oriented Some of the newer magazines have gone even further to appeal to a more general audience of women In some ways Sherren Leighs own career mirrors the changes in the womens movement She calls herself an aging flower child but before 1973 when she founded Todays Chicago Women she was working in an advertising agency Today she publishes a wellheeled monthly directed at professional and executive women Unlike many of her counterparts nationwide she has a good salary a secretary and an ample staff The focus of the paper is on women getting ahead  each issue features a profile of a successful Chicago woman as well as columns of career counseling and financial advice  but it does not shy away from features on fashion makeup and interior decorating Miss Leigh seems somewhat concerned by this Still she said pragmatically If youre going to sell you have to look at what the advertisers want This pragmatism is reflected in the pages of her paper which like many of the new publications is filled with practical advice for women who want to help themselves and other women Some ads for shops or health care facilities and other services say explicitly that these services are for women by women Kate Rand Lloyd editor at large of Working Woman magazine believes that changes in the womens movement have created a new role and new readership for womens magazines A decade ago she recalls feminists were baffled by the question Why dont women support other women In those days to her at least the answer was obvious The powerless never support the powerless Today however things are different Successful Women There is Mrs Lloyd said a growing movement of successful women who are supporting other women supporting them with investments and campaign contributions organizing services to help battered women and rape victims Gloria Steinem sees much the same kind of trend What pleases her most about the new magazines is the readership they are attracting Its no longer just the people who have time to go to the meetings she said
U.S. GROUPS URGE VATICAN TO ACT ON ABORTION AD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/04/world/us-groups-urge-vatican-to-act-on-abortion-ad.html,Vatican officials said today that antiabortion groups in the United States were urging action against the signers of advertisements asserting the right of Roman Catholics to dissent on the issue The remarks by the officials came in response to questions concerning an advertisement in The New York Times on Sunday The advertisement which carried the names of more than 1000 Catholics asserted the right to responsible dissent within the Church Msgr Giulio Nicolini a Vatican spokesman said the Vatican would have no immediate response But the officials predicted that the Vatican would take steps this year on the issue The officials acknowledged that there were differences with American Catholics on the issue of dissent The Rev Diarmuid Martin an official of the Pontifical Council for the Family said in an interview that Americans were so sensitive because they come from a democratic tradition and live in an authoritarian Church He said he used the word authoritarian not in a bad sense of authoritarianism but in the sense of having clear lines of authority Father Martin who attended a meeting of antiabortion activists here this weekend said American Catholics opposed to legal abortion were pressing the Vatican to take action They are saying that for the sake of the prolife movement the Vatican must bring this question to a conclusion Father Martin said He said the issues involved transcended the advertisements and covered matters ranging from the role of Catholic universities to the rights and responsibilities of Catholic theologians The advertisement on Sunday raised the issue of higher education referring to the chilling effect that Vatican reprisals had on academic freedom Vatican officials said the dispute was likely to affect a current study of the state of American religious orders and a document on the status of Catholic universities around the world Archbishop John R Quinn of San Francisco who heads an ad hoc committee evaluating religious life is in Rome this week for discussions The education document from the Congregation for Catholic Education is seeking to reinforce the Catholic identity of Churchrelated universities and to insure orthodoxy in theology philosophy and cannon law The document and the discussion surrounding it have bred fear among Catholic scholars that academic freedom could be hindered
BISHOPS RESIST U.S. SUBPOENA OF DOCUMENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/nyregion/bishops-resist-us-subpoena-of-documents.html,The National Conference of Catholic Bishops said yesterday that it would not comply with Federal court subpoenas asking it to turn over internal documents on its antiabortion activities and that it would be willing to risk a citation for contempt of court The conference while not a defendant has been embroiled in a fiveyearold lawsuit by a group called Abortion Rights Mobilization and more than 20 other plaintiffs seeking to have the Internal Revenue Service remove the taxexempt status of the Roman Catholic Church The plaintiffs contend that the church in vigorously opposing abortion has engaged in political activities that are restricted under the tax laws On Feb 26 Judge Robert L Carter of Federal District Court in Manhattan issued subpoenas for a variety of documents of the conference dealing with possible political activities by the church and any antiabortion activities that might be considered political Among the documents are those relating to the bishops Pastoral Plan for ProLife Activities a 10yearold plan that was substantially revised last year Deadline Has Passed Yesterday was the deadline for turning over the documents but the conference  the chief organization of Catholic bishops in the United States  told Judge Carter it would disobey the order The conference was convinced that the subpoenas raised grave constitutional issues of jurisdiction religious liberty and other First Amendment concerns and that these concerns could affect all religious organizations said William Ryan a spokesman for the conference which has its headquarters in Washington The conference he said would rather accept a contempt citation and seek a review of the issues in the Federal appellate courts Any penalties would be held in abeyance during an appeal Mr Ryan said he could not recall another occasion when the conference had refused to honor a subpoena We told the judge that its not any lack of respect but we felt it had to go to a higher court he said The Catholic conference is not engaged in political activities Mr Ryan added It is fighting a matter of principle whether a thirdparty group can get the Catholic Church to turn over documents Marshall Beil the attorney for the plaintiffs argued that Judge Carter had already dismissed questions of religious liberty in authorizing the subpoenas
SUPREME COURT; BLACKMUN ON SEARCH FOR THE CENTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/08/us/supreme-court-blackmun-on-search-for-the-center.html,Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun is constantly aware that the Supreme Court ruling for which he is best known the 1973 decision legalizing abortion could someday be reversed But if it goes down the drain Justice Blackmun recently told some law students in Washington Id still like to regard Roe v Wade as a landmark in the progress of the emancipation of women Justice Blackmuns public evocation of a parental interest in an opinion he wrote would have been highly unusual a few years ago By custom Justices rarely discuss their work beyond the bench But the tradition has been breached with increasing frequency of late notably by Justice Blackmun who has seemed to enjoy the casual recounting of anecdotes about the Court and its members almost as if to say So whats the harm in talking about this Hungry for Information His remarks about the abortion ruling were made last month at George Washington Universitys National Law Center in a speech in which he also gave his evaluation of the Courts political makeup and discussed how he and his colleagues got along in an atmosphere thick with collegial disagreement Americans have a surprisingly high level of interest in their courts he said particularly the Supreme Court People seem to be hungry for information he added Justice Blackmun first discussed his view that the Court was moving to the right in a speech at a Washington mens club 18 months ago The press was not invited but accounts nonetheless reached the public The same was true of his talk at the law school which one student taped As Justice Blackmun sees the current ideological makeup of the Court it has become more conservative since Sandra Day OConnor became the first woman on the Court in 1981 He described his own role as a jurist struggling to maintain the ideological center on a Court that has moved rightward Critical of Presss Labels Even as he defined the political cast of his colleagues he cautioned against easy acceptance of the labels of conservative and liberal He criticized news organizations as trying to fit the Justices into such categories If one likes to classify and to label he went on four of the Justices are presumed to be Democrats and the five others Republicans But there are other ways of course in which labels can be affixed he said Our friends of the press do this when they try to divide between the socalled conservatives and the socalled liberals When a Justice on any given case does not fit the preconceived notion Justice Blackmun went on the press and the media are troubled and confused But he seemed to use labels himself as he described the Court I with others have been trying to hold the center he said I think weve been fairly lucky in how weve come out in the past two years even though were short a shoe Before Justice OConnor replaced Potter Stewart on the Court Justice Blackmun said that I had always put on the left Justices William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall and on the right Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Justice Rehnquist Five of us he said were in the middle Current Ideological Breakdown Now I think it is fairly clear he said that Justice OConnor is on the right and so the division now would be two four and three breaking the Court down to left center and right He offered the caveat that such division did not hold for every case In the criminal field I think Byron White is distinctly a conservative he said One gets into racial problems however and Byron is distinctly to the left of center I think its the old John F Kennedy influence if you like Justice White was in the Justice Department under President Kennedy who later named him to the court Justice Blackmun said the Justices worked hard at getting along despite philosophical disagreements There are moments of tension of course and I can see some coming up he added He described one such disagreement concerning the number of cases the Court agrees to hear The Chief Justice he said feels it is not necessary to take some cases because it is acceptable to allow tolerable conflict out there in lower court rulings Justice White feels that no conflict is tolerable Justice Blackmun added Frequency of Reversals When asked by a student about the 1973 ruling on abortion Justice Blackmun said he supposed his audience would divide on whether they agreed with it Thats fine he added You have convictions Stay with them Thats what this country is all about But he said he wanted to emphasize that he knew any case is likely to go down the drain at one time or another We overrule two or three every year he said Roe v Wade he went on is being attacked from every possible direction But whatever happens he said its been on the books for 13 years now I think it was right when it was decided he concluded I think its right now His assessment of the ruling in terms of the emancipation of women brought a resounding cheer from the students
"LONG ISLAND OPINION; ROLE MODELS, BUT NOT GOOD MODELS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/nyregion/long-island-opinion-role-models-but-not-good-models.html,MY first reaction to some of the contemporary statistics about teenage pregnancy is incredulity I simply find the numbers too difficult to comprehend Colleagues tease me suggesting that I abandon my value system and join the reality of the post1984 world In spite of myself I cringe when I read that outofwedlock births in New York City have reached epidemic proportions Alas whatever occurs in the Big Apple somehow filters down to suburbia a few years later The number of incidents wont be as high but suburban cases will increase and our statisticians will unanimously agree that the upward curve is mathematically significant How did it happen I anguish for the young woman for the family and for the innocent newborn child The family once the sacred pedestal of American values is disintegrating Our churches are groping for answers Because other support systems have failed our schools are being asked to assume more and more responsibilities in areas that were once outside the educational domain There is no way to find an instant cure for the ills of society but that doesnt mean we shouldnt explore means to address the trend The pendulum that were told will swing back needs an energy force to reverse its direction A determined citizen organization should let its voice be heard The voice should not be extreme but united The righttolifers and those who support the right to abortion the liberals and conservatives the Republicans and Democrats the various ethnic groups all must see their cause as secondary to the preservation of our society We must develop some united goals and then the objectives to move toward the ideal Many years ago our professional athletes posed smoking cigarettes and young people responded to the obvious message These ads have ceased because of a combination of reasons and public condemnation was clearly a major factor We let it be known that it wasnt going to be economically advantageous to a company to use this form of Madison Avenue hype to hurt our children The outcry succeeded in awakening a sleeping Congress usually content with the money they gained for their campaigns from the tobacco industry to ban such advertisements Thus we have a model for action Here are some forms of action that should unite most groups that suffer from what I call oneissue blindness  Couldnt those who favor the right to legal abortions explore along with their adversaries programs to educate against premarital sex  Couldnt both sides unite to inform the media that publicity about actresses posing with their children born out of wedlock may influence adolescents and add to the staggering rate of teenage pregnancy  Couldnt we begin to let the major networks know that we do not want the afternoon soaps to graphically depict simulated sex drug abuse and Xrated topics during a Grated time slot I suspect that there will be an outcry that some of these ideas are violating the First Amendment privileges of our Constitution Im merely counseling restraint not control Acknowledgment if not awards could be given to television stations that honestly adhere to the original intent of the family hour reduce the illicit sexual subplots of daytime soaps create Grated heroes maximize the air time of good news and wholesome activities and finally downplay the indepth reporting of violence and those who commit crimes Good role models are difficult for young people to discover With ballplayers involved in drug abuse television hosts joking about getting high the media accepting and even glorifying the extramarital affairs of entertainment personalities is it any wonder that our young people are confused about who are the good guys There are Hollywood marriages that have lasted a lifetime businesses and politicians who are ethical and moral young people who truly care about others Maybe its time to consciously emphasize the good and to limit the air time of the less wholesome aspects of society We all accept that courtesy is contagious So too does good news beget good feelings Lets not be ashamed of our wholesome role models They truly deserve to have top billing

coordinator of the event explained in an interview the rationale behind the style show Fashion is the mirror of society Mrs Manning said Through the ages womens styles have provided us with a reflection of the times  political social and economic After World War I she said women began to realize their equality and the tight corsets that had squeezed their bodies into painful hourglass shapes began to disappear Along came the flappers who flouted convention at every opportunity And in the 1940s women went off to factories frequently in jumpsuits You dont do assemblyline work in a pretty little frilly dress Mrs Manning said With the 1950s she went on the postwar mentality reflected womens return to the home and clothing took a more revealing constricted look tight skirts high heels and a revitalization of the hated girdle The womens movement raised the consciousness of apparel designers shoe manufacturers and society in general said Mrs Manning We went from tight skirts and spike heels that made us wobble to loose comfortable clothing refusing to be treated as sex objects and refusing to dress that way Besides revealing womens history through clothing the fashion show disclosed another fact Dresses in grandmothers time were much smaller than those of today Women in general appeared to have been more petite There was some difficulty Mrs Manning admitted in

Pitcher Inn in Red Bank and April 8 at the Ramada Inn in Rochelle Park For information about free school and community performances call 201 5227038 The group was begun by Dr Gary B Rosenberg director of the Adolescent Center at Fair Oaks as part of a substanceabuse program in the New Providence school system in 1983 The idea was to have kids in the hospital talk to kids in the schools Dr Rosenberg said We thought that its better to have a peer talk to a peer about his own experiences to identify with the theme that everyone has worries and problems And that there is a positive and negative way of dealing with those problems In the 20 or so middle and high schools the group has traveled to songs poems and skits about family difficulties are dramatized Then audience and actors get together in small groups to discuss solutions to the problems presented We found that the kids in the school have similar problems to those in the hospital Dr Rosenberg said The show really stirs up a discussion among the students afterwards We tell the school officials to be prepared for this to follow it up As for the members of the Adolescent Outreach Performance Group taking their own show on the road is a big part of their learning to cope with the world with growing selfconfidence These kids in reaching out to help other kids get a real high Dr Rosenberg said Women in northcentral Morris County will suffer a lack of affordable and available health services because of the recent budget decision of the countys Board of Chosen Freeholders according to Joyce BatorRabinoff of Randolph Township president of the Morris County chapter of the National Organization for Women The issue is health care for low and marginalincome women for family planning needs said Mrs BatorRabinoff What worries Mrs BatorRabinoff and her colleagues in the area is the decision of the county not to increase Planned Parenthood of Northwest New Jerseys funds from last years 10000 to 20000 but instead to split the money between the family planning agency and two pregnancy counseling groups Birthright of Dover and the Friendship Crisis Pregnancy Center of Morristown The countys Human Services Advisory Council which evaluates grants for human services agencies opposed financing for both Birthright and the crisis center on the following grounds proposed financing would be for purposes other than direct services services would duplicate that of the Morris County District Office of the states Division of Youth and Family Services and the lack of information or referral for family planning by these groups Mrs BatorRabinoff said that Planned Parenthood in Morris County served 8500 women There are another estimated 7000 women out there not getting services because of lack of funds for outreach and education to them she said One reason for the increase in womens needing healthcare services she said was the merger last fall of Riverside Hospital in Boonton Township and St Clares Hospital in Denville Riverside had provided birthcontrol information and services abortions and sterilization St Clares a Catholic facility has eliminated the services In terms of transportation its very difficult for women of the Boonton area to get to Morristown Memorial or Dover General Mrs BatorRabinoff said We have a lot of poor women in this rich county However Alex DeCroce director of the Board of Freeholders said Frankly this is a moral issue When you have youngsters going into different agencies and getting all kinds of contraceptives parents arent too happy The two pregnancy counseling agencies Mr DeCroce said are providing a service that is necessary shelter homes for pregnant teenagers Some of the financing is to aid in the search for such homes As for the need for womens health services he said There are not a large number of poor women in this area And transportation is a poor argument They can get to Dover or Morristown from Boonton or Netcong if they have to From April 5 through 9 the Monmouth Reform Temple in Tinton Falls becomes a temple of art Its classrooms are converted into galleries while the children and teachers study their religion next door And the faithful flock of temple members become art mavens  selecting hosting teaching childrens workshops conducting school tours and providing food and drink for visitors The 16th annual Monmouth Festival of the Arts will have 200 artists and craftsmen as well as theatrical artists such as a mime and juggler a theater troupe and a dance company The show is unique said Laurie Lowenstein of Lincroft chairman of the festival because were not simply a sales vehicle It serves as a museum so that people can  and do  come just to look Of course its also the best buy in town Admission is 3 for adults 2 for students and the elderly Artists whose works will be on display include the painter Sara Eyestone of Ocean Township designer of the official commemorative plate of the Statue of Liberty Elisa B Chalem

LIBERALS: THEIR OWN WORST ENEMY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/09/magazine/liberals-their-own-worst-enemy.html,BACK WHEN I WAS A KID AN ENTERprising 14yearold at my summer camp decided to conduct a poll bunk by bunk on the Presidential race then under way It was a couple of days after Lyndon B Johnson had the Democrats assembled in Atlantic City in 1964 nominate him by acclamation The result of the poll something like 124 for LBJ and one for Barry Goldwater stunned more than a few of us we couldnt figure out who had voted for Goldwater Upon investigation it turned out to have been a kid who habitually walked around with a deck of washable playing cards and wore a Tshirt bearing an illustration of a fiery car wreck The camp geek And it was additionally ascertained even his allegiance to the Republican candidate was shaky it was based on an obscure family connection to William E Miller Goldwaters running mate who years later would turn up fittingly in one of the early Doyouknowme American Express commercials I found myself thinking back on that long ago summer  when virtually everyone I encountered seemed to be politically to the left of center and proud of it  one recent Sunday after stumbling upon a depressing little something deep in the morning paper Headlined A Liberal by Any Other Name May Get More Votes it confirmed with actual data what most people had known before only from being alive that this is a godawful time to be a liberal Indeed according to The New York TimesCBS News Poll cited in the article while the term conservative elicited a positive reaction among better than twothirds of those prepared to venture an opinion the term liberal made more than half say they think worse of someone to whom it was applied How I wondered over my raisin bran and not for the first time had it come to this How so quickly had we liberals gone from societys good guys on our way to imposing our own moral vision upon the future to something very like pariahs How above all had it come to pass that rightwing Republicans of all people had ended up with a stranglehold on the very issues  those involving moral values and ethical responsibility  that had once been virtually conceded to the left A large part of what happened of course is altogether obvious history itself Exactly a year before we junior liberals cast our ballots for LBJ at summer camp many of us had listened transfixed as the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr in Washington articulated a common dream in 1965 Stokely Carmichael talking black power would expel young whites en masse from the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee initiating a fundamental change in the character of the civilrights movement In his acceptance speech that summer of 1964 Johnson lingered over the war against poverty but three weeks before the headlines had been about the Tonkin Gulf Quite simply the convulsions of the late 1960s not only turned liberals against one another but stripped liberalism itself of the moral certitude that had made it so potent a force in the first place and more than that the upheavals allowed liberalisms adversaries to associate it in the public mind with disorder and chronic naivete a stigma that has persisted through all the years since And now  need it even be observed  were at the nadir Its not just that our old adversaries are prospering the geek in the Tshirt is probably chief executive officer of some corporation by now but that we ourselves seem so woefully out of sync with the prevailing mood All around us not just in the State of the Union address but on movie screens in print in commercials for automobiles and beer and life insurance we find an unabashed reverence for traditional values Yet for many liberals these very words ringing as they do with nostalgia for a time when patriotism order and the primacy of the nuclear family were unquestioned verities in American life are suspect suggesting provincialism intolerance and meanness of spirit Faced with a President beloved beyond all rational measure we sometimes actually find ourselves embarrassed to argue positions that he has managed to characterize as softheaded or softhearted In liberal circles all of this has for years now been cause for bottomless frustration We know what the problem is all right just as well as we knew it during the time of Nixon and his silent majority  not simply the guy in the White House but the average boob in the streets unable or unwilling to see through him And what do you do about that Blaming the unenlightened electorate is in its odd way a comforting notion For what we have been far less comfortable acknowledging what many of us liberals are loath to deal with even as a theoretical proposition is that our predicament might also be of our own making that though in the American philosopher Morris Raphael Cohens definition liberalism involves the willingness to examine all premises in the light of available evidence too often we have been prisoners of a dogma at odds with others daytoday experience that routinely there is a gulf between our ideals in the abstract and the specifics of our own lives that most directly to the point our cynicism about traditional values appears to reflect the kind of insensitivity to the human condition that in other circumstances we are the first to deplore It is all in all not terribly surprising that as Peter D Hart the pollster for Walter F Mondale puts it For the Democrats the values issues were never a central agenda item The perennials tend to be the economy and war and peace Meanwhile Richard Wirthlin Harts Republican counterpart compiled extensive research data confirming that as he puts it In voters minds those issues frequently override all others We found a real contrast between Ronald Reagan and the much more loosely defined value structure of Walter Mondale Occasionally you heard the Democrats talk about values theyd use the rubrics but the passion wasnt there Wirthlin pauses You cant mouth values Youve got to feel them Edward J Rollins director of the 1984 Republican campaign sounds very much the same theme What it comes down to he says flatly is that not too many liberals are concerned with those matters themselves  and so truly dont understand how important they are to other people One of the great mistakes the liberals keep making is in refusing to recognize that Reagans appeal isnt based just on the fact that hes a charming guy He also deeply feels things about right and wrong about fairness  that an awful lot of other Americans also feel Taking this in I feel a powerful impulse to begin climbing the nearest wall This from the camp that gave us James G Watt to protect the environment and William Bradford Reynolds to enforce civil rights policy For the right notes Paul Smith of the Childrens Defense Fund which has lobbied vigorously against Administration cuts in social spending the family is some Darwinian creature expected to make its way alone against all predators How this can be seen as resurrecting traditional values truly puzzles me But then it is worth noting that Ed Rollins is a onetime Democrat himself in fact at 42 a Roman Catholic the son of a local labor leader he is a veritable prototype of the man that got away If in fact the right has been staggeringly successful in seizing the terms of the debate appropriating the word morality as code for its own social agenda and managing for instance to identify the American Civil Liberties Union in the public mind as the criminals lobby  it is no less true that we liberals have failed to empathize with profound popular concerns Worries about declining values and standards of behavior have been evident everywhere from public opinion surveys on crime to Ann Landerss mail Many people feel that somehow things in this society have been spiraling out of control But we liberals have tended to dismiss those concerns as illegitimate Once within memory liberalism made emotional sense to most Americans  it was not only generous in its larger social vision but it seemed to be responsive on a gut level to daily concerns  these days though it sometimes seems to demand that we deny fundamental aspects of ourselves I dont mean to belabor the down side A case can certainly be made that there is movement among liberals on this score some of it striking Mario Cuomo New Yorks Governor for instance has identified himself as closely with the broad concept of family as any national Democrat in memory On the local level liberal politicians otherwise known in terminological selfdefense as progressives  have increasingly been taking the initiative on two of the issues most chronically ceded to the right crime and the inadequacies of the criminal justice system at long last some of them are making the case that it is appropriate to empathize above all with the victim For years says Tom Hayden a founder of Students for a Democratic Society now the Democratic Assemblyman for Californias 44th District and certainly among the most prominent of these politicians in the face of rising crime liberals acted like social psychologists Thats just not right Burglary and rape should provoke outrage So should a juvenile justice system that teaches 17yearolds that crime does pay The landmark agreement between General Motors and the United Automobile Workers on the companys projected Saturn plant  a pact mandating both worker participation in decision making and salaries partially based on performance  is more than merely a recognition by the bellwether UAW of changed economic times In an era in which labor is widely perceived as indifferent to the general welfare it is an affirmation by this most liberal of unions of responsibility to the social whole Weve got to break away from the notion as the UAWs director of public relations Peter G Laarman puts it that labor is a bad actor in the economy It must be understood that trade unionism is fundamentally rooted in community All of this is immensely heartening Still more generally it remains the case that those liberals who insist on going on about values and personal responsibility tend to be seen by other liberals as somehow tainted by creeping Reaganism Any such preoccupation is alien to liberals practical political experience to start with and it is additionally suspect on the more substantive ground that it is regarded somehow as being bound up with religion Which in its way suggests just how far gone we are Certainly extreme sensitivity to the churchstate question is always in order and never more so than during the Reagan years But what liberals seem to have forgotten what we desperately need to relearn is that as Bruce Babbitt the Democratic Governor of Arizona puts it there is something called civic morality a shared body of values based on the JudeoChristian and republican traditions that is the underpinning of our society Too often lately weve found ourselves drifting into moral neutrality BILL HONIG HAS DONE MORE THAN just give the matter serious thought 10 years ago while teaching elementary school in a lowerclass black neighborhood in San Francisco as a means of sorting out his own feelings he composed a 100page paper on the subject What happened How was it that we as a society and most especially those of us who had historically prided ourselves on our moral rigor seemed to have grown so alarmingly inattentive to the matter of standards What he concluded was that not only had the social upheaval of the 1960s and early 70s turned numberless liberals into cynics  that was obvious  but that it had ripped liberalism itself from its intellectual moorings Throughout the 50s he observes the liberal creed was intimately bound up with individual responsibility  one had an obligation to be a consciously good person But suddenly we found ourselves in a climate with its emphasis on systems that belittled moral responsibility Broad agreedupon values were no longer seen as ennobling  they were restrictive and repressive Today as Californias State Superintendent of Public Instruction Honig is best known in the rest of the country  and among liberals tends to be seen as very nearly heroic  for standing up to textbook publishers who bowing to fundamentalist pressure had made it a practice to underrepresent evolution in biology texts But on his home turf Honig who 15 years ago abandoned a promising career in corporate law to join the teacher corps is often perceived as conservative occasionally he is even seen as an ideologue of the extreme right In a recent book Last Chance for Our Children he writes of his surprise upon learning after he had spoken before some honor students at the University of California at Los Angeles that one of the professors had reacted by assigning a paper on the hazards of the Moral Majority taking over the schools He laughs about that incident now Isnt that amazing he says But Honig continues to be much troubled by the mentality it represents Quite simply since his surprising 1982 election as head of the nations largest public school system following a campaign that stressed backtobasics high expectations and the responsibility of the public schools to communicate ethical standards he has found his most intractable critics on the left He has tangled with progressives on various aspects of his socalled Excellence agenda Teachers union leaders initially opposed his proposals to grant merit pay and to streamline the firing of incompetents Hispanic activists are still upset over his view that bilingual instruction should be a means of integrating students into the regular curriculum not an end in itself But he has most often been challenged for his unrelenting emphasis on values These people are constantly saying Give me a consistent conceptual value I say honesty and immediately they come back with I can think of plenty of times when you shouldnt be honest Well you know what my answer is to that So what Mostly overwhelmingly its better to be honest than dishonest And people have got to know that People have to feel connected to a shared moral community There is a yearning for morality that I think is genetic  and far too many of us in this society have a hole in our souls because day to day it just isnt there Why do you read Pride and Prejudice Just for character and narrative No because its a powerful way of saying Heres what noble behavior is  look for the real and watch out for the sham  Honig pauses Look for the real and watch out for the sham In Honigs view the stakes can hardly be overestimated America is still an experiment he says The jury is still out on whether you can take a huge country keep it pluralistic enshrine liberty and individual development and not have it fly apart Thats always been the tension in this society Can you combine individual push with common social purpose Well that should be our task to make sure that it does survive  because we are still a beacon for the rest of the world I truly believe that we have something remarkable to say about how you form a society and how you live a life THIS KIND OF UNSELFCONSCIOUS AFFIRMATION of Americanism continues to make most of us to the left of center more than a little uneasy Still smarting from our own Vietnam experience at once too jaded and too mindful of peer expectation to embrace so seemingly sectarian an ardor we have allowed the right free rein to obliterate the distinction between love of democratic institutions and crude jingoism  a condition that was hardly addressed let alone resolved by the ritual flagwaving of the 1984 Democratic National Convention in San Francisco People are always telling me says Anthony T Podesta president of People for the American Way a liberal organization that they dont even bother to open our direct mail because they assume were a rightwing group Scott Rains coordinator of a group called Prolifers for Survival based in Chapel Hill NC knows all about such liberal assumptions  and the inflexibility of the dogma with which they are so bound up All people on the left have to do is hear our name and theyre furious he says Liberals are not inclined to listen to opposing views on any subject but an opposing view on abortion is seen as outright heresy The most youre allowed to say is that you have qualms but still support it Even friends of mine make it very clear that they regard me as a tool of the right In fact Rains like a great many of the groups 2000 members is a veteran of the antiwar movement and the members of his organization are as involved in promoting the nuclear freeze and other peace issues as in opposing abortion What we are arguing is moral consistency he says It seems to me that if youre truly in favor of life  against capital punishment and nuclear war  then youve also got to start asking yourself some very very hard questions about abortion Many of us will on both philosophical and practical grounds take serious issue with such an argument But that in no way justifies the refusal to acknowledge the depth of feeling that prompts it or the impulse often a reflex to cast the author of such a view as an ideological Judas There is to cite a particularly striking recent example of that reflex the matter of Tipper Gore wife of Tennessees Democratic Senator Albert Gore Jr and the great rocklyrics controversy Mrs Gore cofounded along with among others Susan Baker wife of the Secretary of the Treasury the Parents Music Resource Center The group has campaigned for a labeling system for records aimed at alerting parents to sexually explicit or violent content A mother of four with a background in psychology Mrs Gore has become convinced that we as adults are both arrogant and myopic in failing to understand the effects of mass media on the young All were saying is Lets look at what were doing to our children for heavens sake lets look at what were doing to ourselves Is that really so unreasonable The issue here she says is limits recognizing that something has gone terribly wrong in our culture and trying to address it What this is about is censorship responds Danny Goldberg president of Gold Mountain Records who has led a counterattack on the Parents Music Resource Center Mrs Gore is trying to impose her own blacklist As far as Im concerned shes another McCarthy an agent of the far right For most of us raised in liberal households Goldbergs assertion packs no small wallop Three buzzwords in as many sentences And in fact it might well be that Goldbergs absolutist First Amendment stand should prevail on the merits Even Mrs Gore though generally at pains to characterize the labeling proposal benignly as consumer information admits to understanding why so many of her critics might see this particular issue as a constitutional question But after hearing out both the principals one is struck less by the specifics of the dispute than by its character above all by a defense of freedom on Goldbergs part that seems utterly to preclude a free exchange of ideas His adamancy notwithstanding Tipper Gore is hardly of the right indeed in philosophical terms she has much in common with Goldberg himself Nor as he asserts has she undertaken this fight because shes married to a Southern Democrat who thinks its a cool way to appeal to Southern bigots Indeed rather than ostracize those who ask the difficult questions  who in one way or another demand that we bring a more rigorous value system to bear on our view of the social order  liberals ought to recognize them as the resource they are Ferment intellectual as well as ethical has been too long absent in our ranks If vigorously espousing other such views has been dicey Glenn C Lourys challenge to an even more sacrosanct slice of liberal dogma that part dealing with poverty and race has been utterly foolhardy Loury is a black professor of political economy at Harvard and currently a fellow at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton Lately he has been arguing in print that while a profound commitment to social justice on the part of government is essential and that while traditional antipoverty programs are often of enormous benefit solutions to many of the problems that have come to be seen as intractable cannot finally be imposed from without Im convinced he explains that there is a behavioral dimension to the problems of innercity crime unemployment educational underachievement teenage pregnancy and family instability that absolutely necessitates a discussion of values The position that people are inevitably victims and cant be held to standards  that dysfunctional behavior is basically a civilrights matter  aside from being condescending on the face of it has pushed out the possibility of discourse and impoverished the poverty debate The reactions to Lourys views have occasionally been encouraging I recently got a letter he says from a retired black schoolteacher whos worried about the attitudes of black kids today and the attitude of liberal white teachers who are unwilling to push them But most of the response from liberals has been predictable The message he notes dryly is that Im a meanspirited neoDarwinian reactionary Reaganite tool He recognizes that distortion of his positions by both sides is a virtual inevitability and so he has been obliged to come to terms with it The alternative he says is to be silent about important questions when you think you have something important to say The history of the last 20 years argues that one should take ones risks IT IS NOT NECESSARILY EMPTY OPTIMISM TO suggest that the present state of affairs among liberals could be readily turned around By virtually every measure conservative philosophy in the social arena remains further out of sync with popular sentiment than our own Even Ed Rollins concedes that Ronald Reagan is the only person with his beliefs who could be elected today If Jack Kemp said the same things about abortion I seriously doubt he could get away with it And fundamentalist influence within the Republican Party is hardly on the wane In fact by 1988 the Rev Jerry Falwell and the Liberty Federation his new political organization could well emerge as a major political liability for the Republicans When it comes right down to it asserts former Representative John Buchanan a moderate Alabama Republican who was cut down by the Moral Majority in 1980 We Americans are not a meanspirited people Ours is a tradition of freedom and pluralism and diversity and given half a chance we will reject a doctrine so authoritarian and devoid of compassion But it is not via an ideological version of negative advertising that we can hope to reclaim the public spirit It will not be enough merely to point up the gap between our adversaries professed piety and their evident impatience with the niceties of constitutional law It is not enough even to make the case that by rendering the successatanycost ethic so harrowingly respectable the right has itself fostered a nationwide epidemic of precisely the sort of amorality it professes to deplore It is rather for us liberals to assert on our own terms that values do matter to embrace collectively the proposition that an unembarrassed sense of morality is essential both to the formulation of public policy and to the life of the culture itself L IKE MANY OTHERS who have lately grown impatient with what he calls the liberal litmus tests Brooklyn Assemblyman Daniel L Feldman coauthor of the recent New York State law mandating that covers of pornographic magazines be kept under wraps tends to be outspoken Last spring he was among those who flew to Bitburg West Germany to protest the Presidents visit But he is also enormously attentive to nuances A former aide to Elizabeth Holtzman when she was a Representative from Brooklyn the author of a thoughtful volume on governmental reform and a lawyer with a history of defending civil liberties Feldman angered more than a few of his constituents in 1984 by helping to kill another piece of values legislation one intended to keep minors from browsing through pornographic materials I felt then he tells me and I feel now that that bill created First Amendment problems This one doesnt This one has however created other problems for him Even my father doesnt like the bill Hes 82 and a libertarian and he has good instincts Weve never disagreed on any issue before He pauses Believe me its hardly my idea of a good time being perceived as some sort of rightwing crazy But Ill tell you something like this really drives it home How in the world did we take up the view that people walking into a grocery store should have to be assaulted by pornography The Constitution doesnt say that Noticing a stack of uncorrected midterms on the desk before him  he also teaches at a couple of local colleges he seizes upon an intriguing metaphor Pornography is an elective course The Constitution protects your right to take it but it doesnt require you to take it The problem really is that weve been so lazy for so long He pauses then unexpectedly smiles Who knows maybe thats the one good thing that will come of Reagan Maybe hell be the one to force us out of our intellectual stupor
O'CONNOR WARNS MEDICAL SCHOOL CHOICE IS CHURCH LINK OR ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/nyregion/o-connor-warns-medical-school-choice-is-church-link-or-abortion.html,The Archdiocese of New York is threatening to drop its support of a medical college that it saved from financial failure eight years ago unless two city hospitals affiliated with the school stop performing abortions John Cardinal OConnor the Archbishop of New York said in an interview that if the hospitals Lincoln and Metropolitan did not stop performing abortions the school New York Medical College would either have to give up its 24 millionayear contract to supply them with medical services or drop its ties with the archdiocese The Church or the Two Hospitals The choice for the college is either the church or the two hospitals Cardinal OConnor said If the choice is the two hospitals that would be it he said adding he would be forced to sever the ties the archdiocese made with the college which is in Valhalla in Westchester County eight years ago The Cardinal said that abortions violated Catholic principles and the sacredness of the human person and that they should not be performed by physicians or in any hospital affiliated with the archdiocese Catholic principles and concepts of Catholic medical practice would be violated he said and there is no way we could continue together The president of the college John J Connolly said whatever the Cardinal said will have to be considered by the board of trustees He said that the college was looking for a stronger relationship with the archdiocese and that he hoped the relationship could include the current contract with the city hospitals The colleges association with the church began in 1978 when the archdiocese achieved a dominant position on the schools board of trustees in exchange for lending the hospital 10 million and rescuing it from threatened bankruptcy New York City awarded the college the medical affiliation contracts at Lincoln Hospital at 234 East 149th Street in the South Bronx and Metropolitan Hospital Center at 1901 First Avenue at 97th Street in Manhattan in 1979 Because of its ties with the archdiocese the colleges contract at the two hospitals includes a unique provision that requires the city to hire outside physicians to perform abortions so that the colleges medical staff and teaching faculty would not be involved However as early as 1979 Msgr Eugene V Clark a spokesman for the archdiocese expressed doubt that the provision was compatible with Catholic principles The Archdiocese of New York will never through contract or other means cooperate with abortion nor will any agencies it controls ever do so he said at that time City hospital officials also said the arrangement was hardly ideal The Cardinal who became the Archbishop of New York in 1984 strongly indicated last week that he could no longer live with the provision either They Trouble Me Very Deeply At a college faculty meeting Wednesday night and in an interview on Friday he said that abortions  no matter who was performing them  were unacceptable They trouble me very deeply he said At the same time the Cardinal raised the possibility of the college being transformed into a fullfledged archdiocesan institution that would have a new public identity as a Catholic medical school Such a Catholic identity he said would create even more pressure to end any affiliation that allowed abortions With that in mind the Cardinal said he would discuss the issue at dinner this evening with Mayor Koch and Victor E Botnick the chairman of the New York City Health and Hospitals Corporation the agency that operates the citys municipal hospital system Both the Mayor and Mr Botnick have repeatedly affirmed their support of the citys public policy that abortions are a valid and needed medical service particularly in the predominantly poor neighborhoods served by the two hospitals Their statements would seem to weigh against the halting of abortions at either hospital Other medical schools have expressed interest in taking over the affiliation with the hospitals if New York Medical College withdraws a top city hospital official said yesterday A Possible Choice If efforts to stop abortions at the two hospitals do not succeed the Cardinals conditions would seem to force the college either to give up a lucrative contract or to face a break with the archdiocese that would leave the college without the considerable financial resources of the church But the Cardinal predicted that talks with the city would be cordial and extended and would ultimately succeed thus making any choice unnecessary At Lincoln Hospital abortions are restricted to Saturdays when most of the colleges supervising medical faculty is off duty The chief of obstetrics and gynecology at Lincoln Dr Winfred Reguero said the restriction meant a three to fourweek delay for some patients In some cases he said patients are referred to another municipal hospital or to private abortion clinics At Metropolitan Hospital abortions are performed within the hospitals ambulatory surgery service Numbers Compared A spokesman for the citys Hospitals Corporation said the 847 abortions performed at Lincoln and the 946 at Metropolitan last year were comparable to the numbers performed at other municipal hospitals Moreover Mr Botnick said no patient seeking an abortion or birth control services would be turned away from any municipal hospital After the initial agreement in 1979 Planned Parenthood of New York City criticized the conditions under which abortions were performed at both hospitals and has been monitoring the situation The director of Planned Parenthood Alfred F Moran said last week that the long delays at Lincoln Hospital were denying poor and teenage women of badly needed abortion services He also said that birth control services at both hospitals were not encouraged and that such practices only led to abortions that could be avoided The last thing in the world I want to do is control the medical college he said The Cardinal said that if the college became an archdiocesan institution he would personally be willing to raise funds for it But he said the colleges medical practices must be compatible with Catholic philosophy and impregnated with the sacredness of the human person He also said that if the college became a Catholic institution it would help consolidate and improve the quality of medical services provided at 17 Catholic hospitals in the archdiocese He said academic freedom would not be threatened and no faculty member would be asked to leave Issue of Academic Freedom According to a faculty member at the meeting Wednesday the Cardinal used hypothetical examples to define what he regarded as academic freedom in a college in which the faculty and student body have a large percentage of Jewish members He was quoted as giving the following example If a physician on the faculty said to a patient There is no God just your medication is keeping you alive then his association with the college could not continue But he said a Catholic identity would not mean nuns patrolling the halls the firing of nonCatholics or a preference to Catholic students The Cardinal said he would support the transformation even if it meant forfeiting 225 million a year in state financial aid for the school State aid is given to all medical schools in New York on a student per capita basis However a state constitutional amendment forbids such aid to sectarian institutions under the principles of separation of church and state Obviously it would not want to lose it and we would do what we could to meet state requirements he said adding that lawyers were confident that the college would not be penalized If they are wrong he said he was prepared to forfeit the aid and make up the funds from the private sector The Cardinal said he faced a similar loss of public funds when he refused to conform to Mayor Kochs executive order said anyone with contracts with the city could not discriminate against homosexuals in hiring practices The order was overturned by the State Court of Appeals last year We were talking Catholic then and we are talking Catholic now the Cardinal said NEW YORK MEDICAL BEGAN IN 1860 With more than 700 students New York Medical College in Valhalla NY is the thirdlargest private medical school in the country It provides medical services to more than 35 hospitals in the metropolitan area many of them Catholic institutions Founded in 1860 as a private medical college in New York City the college has graduated more than 13000 physicians It is one of the few medical schools in the country that is not a part of a university One of its first major affiliations was with Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital But when the hospital and the medical college sustained a series of financial losses and internal problems in the 1970s an agreement was reached with the Archdiocese of New York in 1978 under which the college accepted 10 million in financing in return for giving the archdiocese majority control of the Board of Trustees At the time archdiocesan officials said their objective was to help increase and unify archdiocesan health services that were scattered in Catholic hospitals throughout the region The archdiocese converted Flower and Fifth Avenue Hospital into an institution for the mentally and physically handicapped and the medical school was moved to its Grasslands Reservation campus in Westchester County For several years the college was plagued by internal problems caused by rapid growth and confusion over the role of the archdiocese in its daytoday operations Although the archdiocese has consistently maintained that the college is an independent institution trustees and faculty members who have resigned contended that the school was in fact being run by the health and hospitals division of Catholic Charities an archdiocesan agency In 1982 the college ranked as Westchesters 24th largest employer It also attracted 16 million in research and service contracts
"80,000 IN MARCH TO CAPITOL TO BACK RIGHT TO ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/us/80000-in-march-to-capitol-to-back-right-to-abortion.html,At least 80000 marchers supporting the right to abortion passed the White House today and gathered at the Capitol in what some leaders of the womens movement called a sign of its rejuvenation The march organized by the National Organization for Women was aimed at getting the womens movement back into the streets in the words of NOWs president Eleanor C Smeal It was also a counter to the annual antiabortion marches that have been held on Jan 22 After the marchers reached the West Front of the Capitol today Mrs Smeal said Im convinced youre going to see a total turning of the tide on womens issues and if we dont well be out again Stop Playing With Our Lives Our message is simple Mrs Smeal told the crowd You cannot play with womens lives any longer stop playing with our lives Leaders also plan to lobby Monday for legislation to cut off Federal funds to colleges that have programs that discriminate on the basis of race sex age or disability The legislation intended to overturn a decision that the Supreme Court made in 1984 has been bottled up in the House because of an antiabortion amendment Among those leading the march today were former Representative Bella Abzug Democrat of New York Mary Kay Place the actress Gloria Steinem the editor Representative Don Edwards Democrat of California and Bill Baird an advocate of birth control Among the others were Mary Ann Sorentino who has been excommunicated by the Roman Catholic Church for being executive director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island Organizers said they were surprised at the number of people who joined the march which they said was 125000 and which the Park Police put at 80000 Marchers were still leaving the Mall at 14th Street when the leaders reached the Capitol three miles away Mrs Smeal had earlier said she was hoping to exceed the attendance of this years antiabortion march which drew about 36000 people according to the police The previous years antiabortion march drew about twice that number White and Purple Today the organizers of the march had clear and warm weather after several days of nearrecord cold White and purple the colors of the suffragettes at the turn of the century were worn by many The songs and chants many of them updated to reflect the days theme echoed the sounds of the 1960s The marchers were not allowed to stop on Pennsylvania Avenue outside the White House President Reagan who has addressed the last two antiabortion marches at the White House was at Camp David It was outside the White House that a man who identified himself as the Rev Jerry Horn approached the marchers with what he said was a human fetus in his hands He was arrested as he tried to join the march and charged with disorderly conduct There were some small demonstrations by other opponents of the right to abortion In a news conference this morning Judie Brown president of the American Life League said the organization was seeking to have Mrs Smeal excommunicated from the Roman Catholic Church At the rally Mrs Smeal mocked the suggestion that her support for the right to abortion could lead to her excommunication or to her leaving her job as president of NOW My grievous sin she said is that I support options for eveyone in a pluralistic society You Cannot Sacrifice Women I am in the mainstream of Catholic lay thought she added You cannot sacrifice women on the altar of selfrighteousness Its time for women once again to not to allow themselves not to be pushed backward Mrs Smeal said in an interview before the beginning of the march She acknowledged the march as an important test for her leadership She won back the presidency of NOW last year after a campaign that emphasized the need for renewed confrontation on women issues The only reason the Reagan revolution is working is people are not standing up and saying enough she said But supporters said that despite the marchs success the womens movement has to be better organized and effective on a local level Representative Patricia Schroeder Democrat of Colorado Mrs Smeal and others said that the womens movement has lost ground in the five years of the Reagan Administration partly because people were just sitting tight until after Mr Reagan left office The erosion has gone on and on and on said Mrs Schroeder Most of just met in small groups and just wrung our hands Miss Steinem also echoed the need to carry the success of the march into organization It depends on what we do when we get home she told the rally As part of the continued organization effort the leaders used the rally to collect money for future activities A second march is scheduled for Los Angeles next Sunday Mrs Schroeder said she thought the unexpectedly large turnout for the march was partly because people saw what President Corazon C Aquino was able to do in the Philippines We saw a woman in the Philippines take on something much tougher than the United States Congress and the President she told the crowd

"AS 'FRENCH DIFFERENCE' FADES, POLITICAL CONSENSUS EMERGES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/world/as-french-difference-fades-political-consensus-emerges.html,A week before legislative elections that are likely to bring a major political realignment many people in France are searching for ways to sum up the five years since the Socialist Government came to power promising fundamental change Amid the flood of analyses and retrospectives one basic element seems to stand out It is that France long so proud of its eccentricities and its differences has become more like the rest of the world in behavior as well as mood France has long represented an idea both of cultural glory and of inner conflicts so arcane that most of the French assume that those living outside the hexagon  as they call their roughly sixsided country  are unable to understand them But by the admission of many of its more thoughtful citizens France has become by necessity rather than choice more open to the outside world more receptive to its influences and more like other democratic countries in political behavior Serge July the editor of the daily newspaper Liberation has called this complex and often subtle phenomenon a normalization of French life terming it the chief result of the leadership of President Francois Mitterrand In Mr Julys formulation contained in a recently published book the Socialists have rendered France the extraordinary service of making it finally an ordinary democracy open to the world market of ideas and values similar to the competing industrial democracies It is not that this result was intended Indeed Mr Mitterrand gave every indication of wanting to maintain practices and patterns that distinguished France from most other countries while at the same time introducing a radical Socialist program But because of a kind of ruse of history Mr Mitterrand instead presided over deep changes in several domains In its first year Mr Mitterrands Government pursued an expansionist economic policy that was in itself an act of defiance toward the rest of the Western world which had adopted the creed of austerity But in the face of a shrinking economy the Socialists backpedaled adopting austerity measures that they had earlier rejected and in so doing aligning France with most other major Western countries The change Mr July says amounted to an opening to the world a determined refusal to retreat to our own protected softness Mr Mitterrand he says succeeded in aligning the hexagonal democracy with the AngloSaxon model and submitting the national economy to all the constraints of the world market No Longer Cut in Two One of Frances characteristics is that it has viewed itself as cut in two separated into such deeply antagonistic camps that political compromise has been difficult But in recent years many public opinion surveys have shown that the French share with other Europeans the tendency to move toward a large area of consensus so that many are basically in the center regardless of their political selfimage Similarly the differences between the major political parties have so decreased that it has become conceivable for the country to move from the party of the right to the party of the left and back again  as in other democratic countries  without disturbing everyday life The elections next Sunday are expected to return a conservative majority to Parliament and force Mr Mitterrand to govern with a rightist Prime Minister and Cabinet France is a conservative country that changes only with great difficulty a senior Socialist official said But my belief is that like the United States we will eventually have two big political forces one more or less conservative the other more or less liberal and power will alternate between the two Some elements of change are obvious This year for example France for the first time gave licenses for private television stations The result was a flood of American programming and perhaps more important of American broadcasting styles But beyond the increasing cultural openness  another example is the growing number of people who speak English  deeper French attitudes and institutions may have become more like those of other countries losing aspects of their Frenchness Poses of Independence To an American or an Englishman or a German what might be called the French difference has always been part mystery part annoyance part historical inevitability The French who consider themselves the oldest unified European people have felt that national prestige was always tied up with the ability to strike poses of total independence The greatest practitioner of this ability was Charles de Gaulle who restored French prestige after the German occupation of World War II But he did so in part by giving value to what might be called the aristocratic or monarchical tradition in French history behaving toward the rest of the world with a combination of aloofness disdain and apparent serenity A basic element of French political life for example was the strength of the classic left itself a legacy of the deep feeling that society was divided into a privileged caste on one side and the common people on the other While the Socialists as one party of the left were always firmly democratic they were outnumbered by the Communists who were able to count on nearly 25 percent of the vote Some here now feel that the greatest change of the Mitterrand years will turn out to have been the drastic decline of the Communists who are expected to get 10 percent of the popular vote in the election next Sunday Socialists New Stress At the same time the Socialists have dropped much of the radical vocabulary that they used a few years ago substituting a stress on a mixed economy and on the need to create enterprise The Socialists have thus emerged as a party not too different from the Democratic Party of the United States stressing social policies but not differing from the conservatives in their essential view of their country We speak the same language today in the opposition as in the Socialist Party Edmond Alphandery a rightist member of Parliament said in a magazine interview recently It is no longer a dialogue of the deaf This new situation has depended on something else the emergence of a kind of popular middle ground the new if unspoken consensus of the French public The leftright split is assumed to determine everything two opinion specialists Olivier Duhamel and Jerome Jaffre wrote recently in the magazine Le Nouvel Observateur But examining the polls shows a different scenery Zones of consensus are forming Disagreements are not what they are assumed to be Specifically the French public has lined up behind a moderate degree of social protection and basic freedom of choice in private life There is little opposition to abortion for example either on the left or on the right Virtually nobody wants to dismantle the social security system Even on the right few designate themselves conservatives and on the left only a minority considers itself Marxist A Dose of Americanization Meanwhile economic pressures have caused France to be more receptive to the outside world even if that involves a powerful dose of Americanization Max Gallo a former Government spokesman who is editor of the proSocialist daily Le Matin gave a whimsical example of how things have changed the signing by Prime Minister Laurent Fabius late last year of a contract for a Disneylandstyle amusement park on the outskirts of Paris It was remarkable to see Laurent Fabius present at the Disneyland signing ceremony and presenting it as a great economic and cultural project Mr Gallo said It was something that would have been heretical to the left before Mr Gallo was talking about heresy in the Socialist tradition although an official French welcome to Disneyland  symbolic of the mistrusted AngloSaxon culture  would have been anathema to Charles de Gaulle as well But the contract for Disneyland was dictated by economic necessity The project will create thousands of jobs and draw millions of tourists to the Paris area and that is why it was sought by the Socialist Government
"POLITICS; KEMP, SWIVELING RIGHT AND LEFT IN SPEECHES, AIMS FOR ULTIMATE GOAL",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/10/us/politics-kemp-swiveling-right-and-left-in-speeches-aims-for-ultimate-goal.html,This is not the Grand Old Party any more As Representative Jack F Kemp spoke those words chopping the air with both hands for emphasis swiveling from left to right like a quarterback handing off to a running back many of the people in the audience for the Waukesha County Republican Partys Lincoln Day dinner looked quizzically at one another Weve got to be the party of labor the Buffalo Republican continued and there were more puzzled glances Economic growth doesnt mean anything if it leaves people out If we trust our ideas we have to take them into the ghetto into the barrio and into the trade union hiring hall Franklin Roosevelt made his party the party of hope and now we must do the same thing for the party of Lincoln To judge from their comments afterwards the Republican loyalists gathered that snowy night in Oconomowoc west of Milwaukee had expected something a little different stuff on abortion and school prayer and a strong defense one man said Surprising Audiences All Over Jack Kemp has been surprising audiences all over the United States for the last year or so with his unorthodox blend of hardline foreign policy social conservatism and populism If his ideas have not yet sunk in on the national level they are becoming clearer to people in Washington and in the states where voters will have an early impact on the 1988 Presidential campaign Michigan and Iowa and New Hampshire A man without a statewide base to say nothing of a national constituency he has nevertheless managed to establish himself as the principal alternative to Vice President Bush for the Republican nomination In the process he has at least temporarily eclipsed such betterknown figures in his party as Alexander M Haig Jr former Secretary of State Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the majority leader and former Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee Kemp has his problems says an adviser to one of his rivals but he has done astonishingly well in positioning himself so well so early One of those problems may be nailing down the conservative base that he will need in challenging Mr Bush The Vice President has courted the movement Republicans assiduously this year  so assiduously that the conservative columnist George Will among others has accused him of spinelessness  and his work has paid dividends A recent poll of conservative activists gave Mr Bush 363 percent Mr Kemp less than half that much backing Conservatism and Individuality The conundrum facing Mr Kemp is this It is largely his departures from conservative orthodoxy  on such issues as righttowork laws sanctions against South Africa and the recently enacted budgetbalancing measure  that has given him enough individuality to present himself as a credible national candidate and yet that individuality makes it hard for him to present himself as the conservative alternative to Mr Bush So far he has managed to do both as suggested in an offhand comment by one of the most prominent ideologues in the Reagan Administration The Vice President said this ideologue poses for pictures with people like me and Jeane Kirkpatrick but Jack Kemp listens to what we tell him Many Speeches a Month Now 50 years old stockier than he was in his days as a Buffalo Bills quarterback Mr Kemp plans to announce an exploratory committee for the Presidency early next year His strategy is to finish a strong second in Michigan and Iowa then win in New Hampshire But he is already running winging back and forth across the country making 20 or more speeches a month even though he is up for reelection in the 31st District this year By his own account he is still underfinanced and understaffed but with two years to go until the first primary he believes he has plenty of time He said in an interview Reagan dominates the party and only the hyperactivists are ready to think about postReagan Republicanism yet Clearly Mr Bush from his perch in the White House will try to take the bigmoney bigname route to the nomination His political action committee raised almost 4 million in 1985 as against Mr Kemps 12 million But the New Yorker is making headway his political action committee the Campaign for Prosperity and his foundation the Fund for an American Renaissance should each raise more than 2 million this year Names on the Computer John Maxwell an organizer with roots in the key early caucus state of Iowa runs the political action committee and is expected once this years congressional races are out of the way to be a central figure in the Kemp campaign So is John Buckley a nephew of the conservative columnist William F Buckley Jr as Mr Kemps press secretary and constant companion on the road Both Charles Black and Roger Stone of the successful Washington political consulting firm Black Manafort Stone  Kelly are already working part time for Mr Kemp Another principal Lee Atwater is committed to work for Mr Bush Mr Black who may well take charge of the overall strategy said the names of 100000 recent donors were already on a computer and suggested that a strong national finance committee would be in place within nine months Theres a message a view a theme to what I want to do Mr Kemp said in his staccato manner in a flight from the Midwest to Washington Thats my great advantage over Bush if I can build on it He cant depart an iota from Reagans view so how is anyone to know what hes about what hell fight for what hell work for I can say Id put Jeane Kirkpatrick into the State Department promise to deploy Star Wars tell them that Id send antitank weapons to Jonas Savimbi in Angola Message of Opportunity Bush is tied to a negative posture on the economy Mr Kemp went on and I want to keep him there  cut the deficit maybe raise taxes pain and suffering the Eisenhower model Im going to keep talking about growth about opportunity like Jack Kennedy We can do better  Bizarre as it seems the contest for the Republican campaign is well and truly launched no matter how coyly the hopefuls answer reporters questions about their intentions Twenty years ago Presidential drives lasted a year 10 years ago they lasted two years now they last three years This month alone Jack Kemp will appear in no fewer than eight states
SCIENCE WATCH; Legal Abortions Decline,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/science/science-watch-legal-abortions-decline.html,The number of legal abortions in the United States fell by more than 4 percent from an estimated 1574000 in 1982 to 1508000 in 1984 according to an analysis of reports from state health departments The rate of abortions fell even more by 5 percent because the number of women of childbearing age rose slightly in that period The 1984 rate was 269 abortions per 1000 women 15 to 44 years old down from 288 in 1982 reports Stanley K Henshaw in the journal Family Planning Perspectives The number of women under age 25 who normally have the most abortions actually declined during the period When adjusted for age differences then the abortion rate fell only slightly over the two years from 288 to 277 per 1000 women of childbearing age The abortion rate rose through the 1970s leveled off around 1979 and then fell significantly for the first time in 1983 according to Dr Henshaw who is deputy director of research at the Alan Guttmacher Institute in New York From 1983 to 1984 there was a very slight decline but it was too small to be statistically reliable Births did not increase in 1983 and 1984 so the decline in the abortion rate reflects a decrease in the pregnancy rate wrote Dr Henshaw In 1984 Dr Henshaw calculated about 25 percent of the nations pregnancies ended by abortion and 4 percent by miscarriages and stillbirths
WOMEN LOBBY CONGRESS ON ABORTION RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/us/women-lobby-congress-on-abortion-rules.html,Hundreds of women went to Capitol Hill today to argue with their Congressmen that civil rights statutes should protect their right to have an abortion paid for by an institution receiving Federal funds The battle over abortion policy has snarled legislation designed to restore the scope and force of civil rights laws that were weakened by a Supreme Court decision two years ago Opponents of abortion have supported amendments that would leave institutions free to omit abortion services from health care plans even if they received Federal aid With time starting to run short in the Congressional session the womens groups that organized the lobbying efforts today seek to press the House leadership into moving ahead with a bill that drops all antiabortion amendments The next week will be crucial in determining whether Congress deals with the matter this year according to Judith Lichtman executive director of the Womens Legal Defense Fund But many supporters of civil rights on Capitol Hill say that a bill requiring religious institutions to provide abortions is not politically realistic I dont think the votes are there even though I wish they were said Representative Barney Frank a Massachusetts Democrat Some Seek Compromise Some of these legislators are trying to work out a compromise but the legislative deadlock persists Its unclear how many people on either side want to buy a compromise Mr Frank said Most of the lobbyists came to Washington over the weekend to participate in a march supporting a womans right to a legal abortion Their activities reflected their belief that opponents of abortion have been winning the political battle in recent years and they wanted to demonstrate that advocates of free choice also represented substantial political power I just wanted to be here I wanted my face to be here said Mara Natkins who holds a masters degree in public health from Yale I think it makes a difference if you show up We have to show people that we really care and have the numbers The complex legislative issue grows out of a Supreme Court decision in 1984 saying that Federal civil rights statutes apply only to the specific part of an institution receiving Federal aid not the entire institution For example a university that received a grant for medical research would still be free to bar women from competing in intercollegiate athletics or to avoid building wheelchair ramps to the library Original Intent Cited Many lawmakers felt that the decision violated the original intent of Congress which was to cover all elements of an institution with antidiscrimination laws Legislation was quickly introduced to reverse the court ruling and it passed the House in 1984 but died in the Senate In their lobbying the womens groups said they wanted a clean bill that simply restored the rights that existed before the Supreme Court decision in the Grove City case In their view this includes regulations adopted in 1975 which say that if any institution receiving Federal funds offers a health care plan to its students and employees it must include abortion services But opponents of abortion led by the Roman Catholic bishops saw this legislation as a threat in two ways First of all they argued the measure would actually widen the scope of civil rights laws by including for example a hospital affiliated with a university that received Federal benefits The second quarrel is over which institutions could be exempt from the civil rights laws on the basis of their religious beliefs Under existing law institutions controlled by religious groups can qualify for a waiver Many Have Transferred However in recent years a number of institutions that were once owned by religious groups have transferred control to lay boards of directors To deal with these problems the Education and Labor Committee in the House added an amendment stating that no institution would be required to provide abortion services Representative Tom Tauke an Iowa Republican who cosponsored the amendment said that without such a rider the bill could never pass We dont think theres any way that Congress will accept legislation that mandates abortion he said The womens groups retort that the Tauke amendment would severely weaken the bill and deprive women of rights they had before Theres no compromise as long as they insist on an antiabortion amendment said Pat Reuss legislative director of the Womens Equity Action League Meanwhile many of the women who came to Capitol Hill today said that the Supreme Court decision limiting the scope of civil rights laws was already having a noticeable impact Real world harm is being done to people Mrs Lichtman asserted Amy Tavrow a recent grauate of Brandeis University said that three women had recently been denied tenure at the Massachusetts school and that their legal remedies were now severely restricted Leah Binder who works for a publishing company in Portland Me said that one Brandeis professor who was found guilty of sexual harassment of women was still teaching at the school Theres no protection anymore Miss Binder said
Working Profile: Alfred H. Kingon; Being a Fly on White House Wall and Loving It,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/us/working-profile-alfred-h-kingon-being-a-fly-on-white-house-wall-and-loving-it.html,On the wall of Alfred H Kingons office of the West Wing basement rests a large photograph of three men  President Reagan Donald T Regan the chief of staff and Mr Kingon himself  all staring puzzled and skeptical across a table at a crucial White House meeting on tax issues It is Mr Kingon says with a faint smile perhaps his favorite photograph For him the tableau highlights in its way the power he has accumulated since he was brought to the White House last year by Mr Regan when the former Treasury Secretary changed jobs with James A Baker 3d In fact the objects of the three mens skepticism unseen in the photograph were Mr Baker and his key aide Richard G Darman who were arguing for certain tax breaks When I worked on Wall Street what intrigued me was the interaction between Government and business and I always wished I could be a fly on the wall at some of the meetings of the White House Mr Kingon said I am doing now what Ive always wanted to do Its Got Its Down Side As secretary to the Cabinet and as one of the closest aides to Mr Regan Mr Kingon plays a central role in domestic agricultural economic and trade policy It is a role that has stirred criticism of him because of his relative inexperience and left him aware of the limits and vulnerabilities of working in the White House I used to think this would be the most wonderful place in the world to work said the slender 54yearold former Wall Street investment adviser and publisher of Financial World and Saturday Review Now that Im here and I see it functioning I realize its got its down side Its the most defensive job and the most defensive operation in town It gets to be How did this happen or How can I get out of that But its a tremendous adventure just unbelievable Mr Kingons adventure involves overseeing the domestic and economic policy councils two units comprised of Cabinet officers who shape virtually the entire range of the Governments programs except foreign policy As Cabinet secretary he serves in essence as liaison between the Cabinet and the White House Beyond criticizing his inexperience in Government some White House officials complain that Mr Kingon and several other aides to Mr Regan are technocrats who have sliced the ideological fervor out of some of Mr Reagans speeches and blurred the Presidents comments on issues ranging from abortion rights to arms control and relations with the Soviet Union Mr Kingon a fiscal conservative who worked actively for Mr Reagans election in 1980 while on Wall Street said that the dispute between White House speechwriters under Patrick J Buchanan and Mr Regans aides had been overblown and was institutional in nuture One of the things you learn here is you cant be ideologically pure said Mr Kingon speaking in the accent of a childhood spent in the Crown Heights and Midwood sections of Brooklyn When you come inside these gates you dont have the options you had on the outside I can remember a decision in the agricultural field going in and telling the President this is what youre going to hear and these are the options and thinking as I went through them that none are any good and if I was on my soapbox at Financial World I would have blasted away Youre in this place and you have a responsibility to make Government work Even though your heart might want it your mind says you must make Government work You have to give the President the option to set his own priorities he said He has the political instincts And he knows you cant have everything you want at one time One of my jobs is to let him choose  what do you want to fight for this year That can be troublesome Mr Kingons power is considerable but is obscured by his efforts to stay behind the scenes Last year for example he quietly blocked Attorney General Edwin L Meese 3d and Mr Buchanan from getting Mr Reagan to sign an executive order that would have altered guidelines on racial hiring quotas in Federal contracts Mr Kingon insisted that the Cabinet council first discuss the matter Mr Kingons circuitous passage to the White House began with a number of lowlevel jobs on Wall Street after his graduation from Union College in Schenectady in 1953 and night school at New York Universitys Graduate School of Business Administration In the 1960s he grew affluent on Wall Street serving as investment adviser security analyst and portfolio manager for the Businessmans Fund a mutual fund With a partner Robert Weingarten he formed a company that bought a weekly magazine Financial World which he edited for a decade in the 1970s and turned in into a successful monthly It was then that he met not only Mr Regan who ran Merrill Lynch  Company but also Mr Reagan in 1979 then a Presidential candidate He was a dinner guest at Financial World Mr Kingon said of Mr Reagan I sat next to him We began talking about ideas and I mentioned to him that I had read this strange book by Hilaire Belloc a British writer who wrote very conservative very antiindustrial revolution books To my surprise Reagan not only knew the guy he began quoting paragraphs by him While on Wall Street Mr Kingon who is married and has a child said he began contemplating the notion of working in Washington I kept saying that if I believed all this stuff that I was writing about supply side economics lower taxes monetary policy  I should get involved he recalled I was fascinated with the interaction of Government with people Politics began to fascinate me more and more as the place where the ideas come together In the Middle Ages it was the church and in the Renaissance it was the universities but now you had priests and professors running for Congress Meantime Mr Kingon and his partner made what he terms their biggest mistake when their company purchased the ailing Saturday Review in 1980 We said wed be willing to risk a halfmillion dollars Mr Kingon said with a laugh Well 32 million and two years later    Mr Kingon was an Assistant Secretary of Commerce in 198384 and later transferred to the Treasury He concedes there were some surprises when he came to the White House We underestimated the amount of time and energy needed to deal with Congress he said We underestimated I think the sheer amount of work It just comes at you On some days you get 45 or 50 phone calls I just cannot answer these calls It saddens me because in the beginning I said to myself that I wasnt going to be this kind of guy
FETAL TESTS CAN NOW FIND MANY MORE GENETIC FLAWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/11/science/fetal-tests-can-now-find-many-more-genetic-flaws.html,THE couple already had two children afflicted with the grim reality of cystic fibrosis They could not face having another The disease It causes digestive problems breathing problems lung infections with an almost continual threat of death from early childhood onward The woman ended her next pregnancy by abortion But now she is pregnant again and plans to have this baby Genetic testing that has become available only within the last several months has given her solid assurance that the child will be free of the disease This is the human side of a revolution in diagnosis of genetic diseases that is unfolding today because of scientists growing ability to find and interpret the messages of the human genes Today such diagnoses are becoming available for an ever increasing roster of disorders caused by a fault in one or another single gene among the 50000 to 100000 that humans possess Individually most of these diseases are quite rare although cystic fibrosis afflicts an estimated 30000 Americans and Duchennes muscular dystrophy appears about once in every 5000 males born alive Prenatal detection of the classic form of hemophilia has become possible within the last year as has been the case with cystilemma fibrosis What one expert called reasonably good detection of muscular dystrophy has been possible since last fall Phenylketonuria an important cause of mental retardation usually known as PKU has been detectable in the fetus for about two years the blood diseases sickle cell anemia and thalassemia also known as Cooleys anemia have been detectable longer Earlier methods have allowed detection of at least 50 other genetic diseases including Downs syndrome and TaySachs disease But the new DNA studies are safer for the fetus than some of the earlier techniques and have added important diseases never before detectable in the womb Most of these methods require that the diagnostician know what disease to look for But in the future some experts see the possibility of comprehensive genetic profiles And these could also show exceptional risk of a major illness such as heart disease diabetes or even schizophrenia There are genetic components in these diseases too but in most cases it is a matter of predisposition based on the combined effects of several genes and environmental factors With the new predictive abilities come some sobering ethical and social problems of which specialists are very much aware Only a handful of laboratories today are capable of doing the new tests and they are expensive yet many thousands of people might benefit Furthermore the everincreasing ability to detect genetic disease early in fetal life is likely to sharpen the debate over abortion and generally exacerbate the dilemma of parents and doctors when diseases that used to be unforeseeable acts of God can now be predicted in advance A different kind of dilemma confronts the experts in Huntingtons disease a genetic disorder that causes no symptoms early in life but grave mental deterioration and death in middle age Is a diagnostician justified in telling a person who may carry the fatal gene defect that he tests positive if there is a 10 percent chance that this grim prediction is wrong In some disorders experts say the growing ability to detect faulty genes appears to be reducing substantially the number of cases of the disease in the population The hereditary blood disorder beta thalassemia is a striking example according to Dr Haig H Kazazian Jr of Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in Baltimore I think we are having an impact on the incidence of that disorder he said There are no national figures but he said information from diagnostic clinics in the Northeast allows the educated guesstimate that the number of new cases has dropped by 50 percent or more in recent years in some parts of this country and in some parts of the Mediterranean basin where the disease is common Dr Kazazian who heads what is probably the largest center in the country for diagnosis of human genetic diseases through DNA studies said he expects the new tests will have a major effect on the incidence of hemophilia and Duchennes muscular dystrophy in the next few years He does not expect much overall impact on cystic fibrosis because present testing can be used effectively only for families in which there is already one case Carrier Test Next Step Dr Arthur L Beaudet of Baylor College of Medicine in Houston said most new cases of cystic fibrosis are children born to couples who have not previously had an affected child He believes the next important step is to develop a carrier test so that two potential parents can know in advance whether either or both carry the gene defect that produces the disease I think a carrier test is an almost certain predictable goal Dr Beaudet said You can guess whether it is going to take one year or five but it certainly can be achieved Specialists do not expect the new tests to eliminate diseases from the population But they do expect the research will lead to the discovery of more specific genes that cause such diseases and that these discoveries may lead to better understanding and treatment There are several related ways of detecting a singlegene disorder in a fetus or of proving that a child or adult is a carrier They all are based on the fact that the messages of heredity in all living things are carried in the chemistry of DNA deoxyribonucleic acid The long twisted strands of this master chemical of heredity are made up of four different subunits repeated in various combinations thousands and even millions of times The combinations constitute the universal code for the regulation and production of everything a cell makes The four subunits the chemicals adenine guanine cytosine and thymine are identified usually by their initials The sequence GAT for example is the code ordering a cell to add the amino acid leucine to a protein under construction Other combinations are the codes for all of the other 19 amino acids that make up the myriad of different proteins that are the main ingredients of living things If the DNA subunits A G C and T are the letters in the genetic alphabet the genes and the amino acids for which they are the blueprints might be thought of as the paragraphs and the genetic information in each of the 23 pairs of chromosomes are the chapters of the encyclopedia of each persons heredity One Error and Many Symptoms Altogether the human genetic apparatus is an immense archive of about three billion subunits of DNA Just one error among the three billion can produce all the symptoms and biological derangements of a disease such as thalassemia or muscular dystrophy Even though a gene may contain several hundred to a few thousand subunits of genetic message scientists can sometimes detect the state of a known gene from as few as 19 or 20 subunits by preparing two oligonucleotide probes that are matched up against the patients DNA One probe matches the known normal gene and the other the erroneous version In this way it is possible to tell if the patient has one copy of the defective gene or two or none Many of the diseases are recessive a term that means the the faulty gene must be inherited from both parents for the disease to occur A person who has only one copy will be a carrier but ordinarily will not develop the symptoms of the disorder Cystic fibrosis is such a case Some other diseases Huntingtons chorea for example are dominant genetic disorders in which it takes only one copy of the misspelled gene to cause disaster When the gene is known it can be studied with the aid of the DNA probes The group at Johns Hopkins has specialized in study of thalassemia in which about 40 different genetic spelling errors are known most of them errors in one or another single letter Different population groups are likely to have different errors Most natives of Sardinia who are either patients or carriers of thalassemia all share the same specific error Altogether there are about eight that predominate in the countries that rim the Mediterranean Enzymes to Cut Fragments The other main testing scheme available today is useful even when the gene has not yet been found It depends partly on the fact that genes close together on a chromosome are likely to be inherited together Special chemical scalpels called restriction enzymes cut strands of DNA when they encounter particular sequences of the four subunits One for example cuts the strands in the middle of the sequence GGCC More than 100 different restriction enzymes that cut in different places are known Using a large battery of these scientists can chop up all of the complement of DNA from a persons cells into many thousands of fragments A mutation of a normal gene whether diseasecausing or harmless may change the short sequence recognized by an enzyme so that a cut is no longer made at that point This produces a fragment that is not the normal size These variations are called restriction fragment length polymorphisms known in the vernacular of the molecular biologists as RFLPs By comparing the DNA of a cystic fibrosis patient with that of another family member the difference in the DNA fragments can be seen and fragments that go with the faulty gene can be identified even though the gene itself is still unknown In 1978 Dr Y W Kan and colleagues at the University of California San Francisco studying sickle cell anemia were the first to use RFLPs for diagnosis RFLPs have been used recently to find such genetic markers for cystic fibrosis Huntingtons chorea and several other diseases A Massachusetts biotechnology company Collaborative Research Inc has probably produced more of these useful fragments than anyone else Company scientists contributed to the discovery last fall of the first useful genetic marker for cystic fibrosis Dr Helen DonisKeller its director of human genetics estimates her group has produced well over 500 useful RFLP probes The test systems are also leading to the discovery of more and more specific genes that are abnormal and causes of a genetic disease For the American Society of Human Genetics Dr Beaudet of Baylor has compiled annual lists of gene identifications made by many research teams Last years edition contained more than 300 different human gene segments of known function most of them discovered in the last two years Last week Dr Waclaw Szybalski of the University of Wisconsin Medical Schools McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research described the development of a new kind of restriction enzyme that can be fabricated to cut DNA at any desired point Others said the method has great potential usefulness Current reseach is making important strides in detection of more and more of the estimated 3000 or more different singlegene defects But major diseases such as heart disease and other widespread causes of human death and disability are far more complex in origin Susceptibility is believed to be governed by several perhaps many different genes modulated by the total effects of life style and all other aspects of environment Possibility of a DNA Map But the emergence of recombinant DNA technology in general and the uses of restriction fragments in particular seem capable of bringing even these complex diseases within reach of genetic analysis experts say Five years ago Dr David Botstein of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Dr Raymond L White and Dr Mark Skolnick now of the University of Utah and Dr Ronald W Davis of Stanford University proposed the use of restriction fragments to make a map covering the entire 3 billion subunits of human DNA In a recent conversation Dr Botstein said about 50 to 150 such fragments evenly spaced throughout the 23 pairs of human chromosomes could do the job If funds were available such a map could be completed within five years he said An individuals DNA matched against these probes might reveal varying degrees of inborn natural susceptibility to some of mankinds major diseases Experts said it would take wisdom to handle this kind of information without abusing its possibilities but it could also suggest elements of life style that individuals could use to minimize the risks to their health The links between cigarette smoking and lung cancer are known to every educated American yet most also know that many smokers live their entire lives free of the disease The less fortunate ones learn their own susceptility too late A genetic linkage map might allow parents to know early sometimes even before the child is born that he or she must be particularly careful to avoid smoking for example or should live on a diet prudent from the viewpoint of heart disease I think that will be the big factor in this diagnostic area in the next 10 to 15 years said Dr Kazazian of this broadening horizon of genetic detection It is amazing how far we have come in just a short time he added That is the impressive thing I never would have dreamed it 10 years ago
BLACK CHURCHES JOIN THE FIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/12/garden/black-churches-join-the-fight.html,FAMILY planning clinics are not the only groups galvanized into action against teenage pregnancy An increasing number of black churches across the country are also creating pregnancyprevention programs and support groups for young mothers Although the majority of infants born to teenagers are white according to a study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute black teenagers bear proportionally many more children than their white counterparts Of every 1000 black teenagers 163 gave birth in 1984 compared with 83 for every 1000 white teenagers The surge in the number of programs on teenage sexuality and pregnancy is new to the majority of black churches according to ministers and theological experts Its not like when I was growing up recalled the Rev Jeannine Moore who runs a shelter for young homeless mothers at the Second Baptist Church in Los Angeles Then a girl had to stand up and apologize in front of the church to be reinstated Now weve come full circle to ignoring it Our first stab at it was only last year Many ministers say they have to struggle with congregation members teenagers and other clergy to bring the issue into the open The whole question of teenage pregnancy comes to us in a whisper and we fall into the trap We answer with a whisper said the Reverend Lorenzo A Lynch of the White Rock Baptist Church in Durham NC We dont deal with other things like drug prevention like that Many ministers and experts on the black church agree that the training of most clergy leaves them illequipped to grapple with the complexities of this national trend The problem is fundamentally sexual but it is also economic and cultural said C Eric Lincoln professor of religion and culture at Duke University There are many ministers who are sophisticated enough to know we arent just talking body chemistry but who have not yet been able to develop a proper response A year ago the Chicago Theological Seminary won a grant of 343000 from the Carnegie Foundation to train young seminarians to cope with such sensitive issues as teenage pregnancy According to Dr Kenneth Smith president of the seminary students go to 10 participating churches and work with children at risk for a year Five of these churches are sponsoring programs on teenage pregnancy Were trying to help seminarians develop a leadership and administrative style so that they can help all in the community Dr Smith said The Baptist Methodist and Pentecostal ministers who are running programs for teenagers and young mothers uniformly disapprove of abortion They are also united in their desire to help young black men more But their ideological responses to teenage pregnancy differ widely Some ministers who cannot condone teenage sexuality counsel youths to abstain Others consider guidance on sexuality and contraception their moral responsibility Many merge the two approaches I think I hold up the ideal first  to abstain from sex before marriage Mr Lynch said If they cant live with that I counsel them to get with their family and seek some kind of protection Some churches have been engaged in counseling programs for years Since 1980 the Abyssinian Baptist Church of New York City has sponsored a tutorial program called Alakiko which has a budget of 30000 According to the Rev Calvin Butts director of the Social Action Committee at Abyssinian a dozen young women volunteer to sponsor an adolescent girl and discuss with her personal hygiene sexuality and contraception as well as educational choices savings plans and cultural history A similar program for young men will begin this year he said In Washington the Shiloh Baptist Church created the Family Life Center in 1981 to provide recreational activity for parents teenagers and senior citizens According to Mattie Robinson director of Shilohs Department of Mission the center has regularly offered workshops on pregnancy prevention for teenagers seminars for young mothers on their role as parents and job training in food services for many of the areas unemployed youth The centers money comes from the Ford Foundation Other churches however are limited in finances and personnel My programs are primarily individual which is sad but true Mr Lynch said Look at how much time it takes to get to 20 teens
ARCHDIOCESE TO KEEP LINKS TO MEDICAL SCHOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/12/nyregion/archdiocese-to-keep-links-to-medical-school.html,The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York says it will not require a private medical college affiliated with the archdiocese to give up a 24 million contract with two municipal hospitals in which abortions are performed Last week John Cardinal OConnor warned in an interview with The New York Times that if abortions continued at two hospitals the school the New York Medical College would have to choose between giving up the city contract or breaking its ties with the archodiocese he said abortions violated Catholic principles and the sacredness of the human person and should never be performed by any physician or in any hospital affiliated with the archdiocese But after a dinner meeting Monday night with Mayor Koch the Cardinal and the Mayor said there was no problem with the contract which includes a provision that requires abortions at the two hsopitals to be performed by outside physicians hired by the city The Rev Peter G Finn a spokesman for the archdiocese was asked yesterday if the Cardinals opposition to abortion still applied to the two city hospitals the Metropolitan Hospital Center in Manhattan and Lincoln Hospital in the Bronx or to any other hospitals affiliated with the medical college and in which abortions are performed I have no comment other than the fact that the Cardinals position on abortion is quite coherent clear and consistent Father Finn said He said The Timess article gave an indication of conflict but in fact that conflict does not exist not as far as the city nor the archdiocese nor the medical college can determine In addition to the two city hospitals the college which is considering closer ties with the archdiocese has affiliations with 17 Catholic hospitals and 15 other private and public hsopitals Abortions are performed at several hospitals affiliated with the college
VATICAN TELLS PRIEST TO RETRACT VIEWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/12/us/vatican-tells-priest-to-retract-views.html,The Vatican has ordered the Rev Charles E Curran a liberal theologian at Catholic University of America either to retract his views on birth control and other sexual issues or face the loss of his authorization to teach Roman Catholic doctrine The ultimatum was revealed today at a crowded news conference at which the 51yearold Father Curran made public a letter he received late last year from Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger the prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith warning of discplinary action The congregation is the Vaticans monitor of theological conformity Father Curran said he refused to retract his teachings but had offered to promise never to teach sexual ethics at Catholic University a subject he said he had not taught for 15 years anyway The compromise proposal he said was transmitted to Rome by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago chairman of the universitys board of trustees but Cardinal Ratzinger did not indicate a willingness to accept it As a result Father Curran said he was waiting for the Vatican Congregation to act on its threat a process he said could take many months Examinations Conclusive Phase A statement released last night by Archbishop James A Hickey of Washington chancellor of the university confirmed the Ratzinger letter and said that what was at issue was Father Currans continued authorization to teach in the name of the Catholic church The congregations examination of Father Currans license the statement said is reaching the conclusive phase The Rev William J Byron president of the 7000student university in the nations capital said in an interview that if the Vatican takes away Father Currans authorization he could no longer be employed as a member of the theology faculty at Catholic University one of three departments chartered by the Vatican However he said Father Curran a tenured professor of moral theology could teach in one of 30 other departments Father Curran said that a transfer to another department would be unacceptable because it would violate both his tenure and his academic freedom Father Curran who was in Rome on Saturday for a twohour meeting with Cardinal Ratzinger is a popular campus figure and his supporters have scheduled a news conference Wednesday to announce a petition drive In a similar controversy in 1968 Father Curran was dismissed as a result of a public statement that birth control was permissible A fiveday student strike ensued and he was reinstated Cardinals Letter Detailed The letter from Cardinal Ratzinger dated Sept 17 1985 asked Father Curran to reconsider and retract these positions which violate the conditions necessary for a professor to be called a Catholic theologian The letter said Father Curran had violated Catholic teachings that artificial contraception is wrong that abortion and euthanasia are unspeakable crimes in all circumstances that masturbation premarital intercourse and homosexual acts are intrinsically immoral and that marriage is an indissoluble bond between two persons It must be recognized the letter continued that the authorities of the Church cannot allow the present situation to continue in which the inherent contradiction is prolonged that one who is to teach in the name of the Church in fact denies her teaching The controversy fundamentally reflects a tension between those with a clear hierarchical view of the church where direction and teaching flow from the top and those who hold a more democratic view and believe that the doctrines of the church are developed in consensus with the people of the church Given the American democratic experience the tension with Rome is felt with particular keenness in this country Right to Dissent Held Pope John Paul II has been trying to reassert orthodox Catholic teachings and to discipline those who stray The Swiss theologian Hans Kung was stripped of his status as a Catholic theologian in 1978 and the Brazilian theologian the Rev Leonardo Boff an exponent of liberation theology social activism in behalf of the poor was ordered last year to maintain a period of silence Both Father Curran and Father Byron said they could not recall any American theologian whose authority to teach in a theological faculty had been removed Father Curran maintained that he had a right to dissent from church teachings that have not been declared infallible On particular issues there is no doubt that many Catholic theologians and faithful do disagree sharply with official teachings such as those on contraception sterilization and the indissolubility of marriage he said From this it should be evident that the positions taken by me are neither radical nor rebellious but are in the mainstream of contemporary Roman Catholic theology I find myself at home in the church and its as much my church as anyone elses Father Curran said to a sustained round of applause from student supporters A Final Judgment Father Currans writings on moral theology have been under investigation by the Vatican since 1979 The letter from Cardinal Ratzinger indicated that the Congregation was now in a position to bring this inquiry to its conclusion and that the inquirys results were presented to the Pope on June 28 and were confirmed by him It was clearly a final judgment Father Curran argued adding that the letter indictated he had two months by which to retract his views The letter contended that Catholic theologians do not teach on their own authority but by virtue of the mission they have received from the church In order to guarantee this teaching the letter continued the church claims the freedom to maintain her own academic institutions in which her doctrine is reflected upon taught and interpreted in complete fidelity This freedom of the Church to teach her doctrine is in full accord with the students corresponding right to know what that teaching is and have it properly explained to them Father Curran a priest under the jursidction of the Diocese of Rochester argued that the key issue in his struggle with the Vatican is the right to dissent from any church teachings that are not dogmas or doctrines that have been defined as infallible Accuser and Judge It is unjust to single me out for disciplinary action of any type when so many other Catholic theologians hold the same basic position he said He also assailed the Congregation for performing the roles of both accuser and judge Father Curran said he felt he had been singled out because of the public uproar caused by his dismissal and reinstatement in 1968 and because he has written prolifically on moral theology Terming his positions neither defiant nor disrespectful he maintained that he was not challenging the teaching role of the churchs hierarchy But he said the hierarchy must also recognize that academic decisions must ultimately be made by peers in the light of Catholic faith and the ongoing search for truth
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/13/garden/hers.html,It was always the look on their faces that told me first I was the freshman dormitory counselor and they were the freshmen at a womens college where everyone was smart One of them could come into my room a golden girl a valedictorian an 800 verbal score on the SATs and her eyes would be empty seeing only a busted future the devastation of her life as she knew it She had failed biology messed up the math she was pregnant That was when I became prochoice It was the look in his eyes that I will always remember too They were as black as the bottom of a well and in them for a few minutes I thought I saw myself the way I had always wished to be clear simple elemental at peace My child looked at me and I looked back at him in the delivery room and I realized that out of a sea of infinite possibilities it had come down to this a specific person born on the hottest day of the year conceived on a Christmas Eve made by his father and me miraculously from scratch Once I believed that there was a little blob of formless protoplasm in there and a gynecologist went after it with a surgical instrument and that was that Then I got pregnant myself  eagerly intentionally by the right man at the right time and I began to doubt My abdomen still flat my stomach roiling with morning sickness I felt not that I had protoplasm inside but instead a complete human being in miniature to whom I could talk sing make promises Neither of these views was accurate instead I think the reality is something in the middle And that is where I find myself now in the middle hating the idea of abortions hating the idea of having them outlawed For I know it is the right thing in some times and places I remember sitting in a shabby clinic far uptown with one of those freshmen only three months after the Supreme Court had made what we were doing possible and watching with wonder as the lovely first love she had had with a nice boy unraveled over the space of an hour as they waited for her to be called degenerated into sniping and silences I remember a year or two later seeing them pass on campus and not even acknowledge one another because their conjoining had caused them so much pain and I shuddered to think of them married with a small psyche in their unready and unwilling hands Ive met 14yearolds who were pregnant and said they could not have abortions because of their religion and I see in their eyes the shadows of 22yearolds Ive talked to who lost their kids to foster care because they hit them or used drugs or simply had no money for food and shelter I read not long ago about a teenager who said she meant to have an abortion but she spent the money on clothes instead now she has a baby who turns out to be a lot more trouble than a toy The people who hand out those execrable little pictures of dismembered fetuses at abortion clinics seem to forget the extraordinary pain children may endure after they are born when they are unwanted even hated or simply tolerated I believe that in a contest between the living and the almost living the latter must if necessary give way to the will of the former That is what the fetus is to me the almost living Yet these questions began to plague me  and Ive discovered a good many other women  after I became pregnant But they became even more acute after I had my second child mainly because he is so different from his brother On two random nights 18 months apart the same two people managed to conceive and on one occasion the tumult within turned itself into a curlyhaired brunet with merry black eyes who walked and talked late and loved the whole world and on another it became a blond with hazel Asian eyes and a pug nose who tried to conquer the world almost as soon as he entered it If we were to have an abortion next time for some reason or another which infinite possibility becomes not a reality but a nullity The girl with the blue eyes The improbable redhead The natural athlete The thinker My husband ever at the heart of the matter put it another way Knowing that he is finding two children somewhat more overwhelming than he expected I asked if he would want me to have an abortion if I accidentally became pregnant again right away And waste a perfectly good human being he said Coming to this quandary has been difficult for me In fact I believe the issue of abortion is difficult for all thoughtful people I dont know anyone who has had an abortion who has not been haunted by it If there is one thing I find intolerable about most of the socalled righttolifers it is that they try to portray abortion rights as something that feminists thought up on a slow Saturday over a light lunch That is nonsense I also know that some people who support abortion rights are most comfortable with a monolithic position because it seems the strongest front against the smug and sometimes violent opposition But I dont feel all one way about abortion anymore and I dont think it serves a just cause to pretend that many of us do For years I believed that a womans right to choose was absolute but now I wonder Do I with a stable home and marriage and sufficient stamina and money have the right to choose abortion because a pregnancy is inconvenient right now Legally I do have that right legally I want always to have that right It is the morality of exercising it under those circumstances that makes me wonder Technology has foiled us The second trimester has become a time of resurrection a fetus at six months can be one womans late abortion anothers premature viable child Photographers now have film of embryos the size of a grape oddly human flexing their fingers sucking their thumbs Women have amniocentisis to find out whether they are carrying a child with birth defects that they may choose to abort Before the procedure they must have a sonogram one of those fuzzy blackandwhite photos like a love song heard through static on the radio which shows someone is in there I have taped on my VCR a public television program in which somehow inexplicably a film is shown of a fetus in utero scratching its face seemingly putting up a tiny hand to shield itself from the cameras eye It would make a potent weapon in the arsenal of the antiabortionists I grow sentimental about it as it floats in the salt water part fish part human being It is almost living but not quite It has almost turned my heart around but not quite turned my head
U.S. SEEKS TRUSTEE FOR ROBINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/13/business/us-seeks-trustee-for-robins.html,The Justice Department today asked a Federal judge to appoint a trustee to take control of the A H Robins Company charging that company officers had improperly spent money after the large pharmaceutical company filed for reorganization last year under Federal bankruptcy laws In a motion filed in Federal District Court in Richmond the Government said that Robins was in civil contempt of an order requiring it to seek court permission before paying off debts incurred before it filed for protection from its creditors Payments to Officers A lawenforcement official familiar with the case said that Robins had improperly paid corporate officers and executives about 12 million in compensation and had paid nearly 56 million in other debts The Richmondbased pharmaceutical company sought protection from creditors last August after it was besieged by damage suits from women claiming they had been harmed by its Dalkon Shield intrauterine birthcontrol device If the court motion is approved by Judge Robert R Merhige Jr Robins executives would be replaced by an independent courtappointed trustee Under Chapter 11 of the bankruptcy code Robins would normally be permitted to retain its existing management Robins Statement A Robins spokesman Roscoe E Puckett Jr said late tonight that appointment of a trustee was unwarranted The disputed payments were made in the belief that they were proper in the ordinary course of the companys business he said Robins regrets any violation of the courts order and is taking appropriate steps to bring itself into compliance The actions of those involved were in no way intended to violate the order Under court order Robins was required to receive permission to pay off debts incurred before the Chapter 11 filing The order was apparently an attempt to be fair to all creditors who had a claim on the companys assets Todays motion was filed by an Assistant United States Attorney S David Schiller on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service one of the creditors The motion asked that the company be required to identity all directors officers managers employees and counsel who participated in the decisions to make payments and in the actual payments of funds in violation of the court order Robins is out of control and only appointment of a trustee can set it back on course Mr Schiller told The Associated Press Computer Costs Drug Royalties A lawenforcement official said that the company in addition to the 12 million in deferred compensation also improperly paid out millions of dollars in other debts including computer costs and drug royalties In a written statement read to reporters Mr Puckett the Robins spokesman acknowledged payment of certain prepetition obligations But the statement said that the suggestion that such actions amount to contempt is unwarranted as is the suggestion that a company with the performance record of Robins needs a trustee to oversee its operations In filing for court protection last year Robins said claims involving the Dalkon Shield threatened its viability The company said it had become clear that the 615 million fund it had established early last year to deal with the claims would not be enough to pay damages to thousands of women who said they had been harmed by the device At the end of 1984 Robins listed 309 million in assets The company has released no estimate of its total liability in the Dalkon Shield claims but some financial specialists have said it could be as high as 2 billion April 30 Deadline Robins has set an April 30 deadline for women who claim they have been harmed by the device to notify the company About 200000 women have filed claims Thousands of women have complained of pelvic infections sterility and spontaneous abortions because of the device and a few deaths have been reported About 28 million of the intrauterine birthcontrol devices were sold in the United States from 1971 to 1974 when the product was discontinued The claims process too has been tied up in court because of infighting among the plaintiffs Judge Merhige was scheduled to hear a number of motions in the case on Friday including whether a claimants committee that was dissolved last week should be revived
BANKRUPTCY WOES AT ROBINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/14/business/bankruptcy-woes-at-robins.html,When the A H Robins Company filed bankruptcy proceedings seven months ago it was seeking a way to handle thousands of claims from women who said they were injured by its Dalkon Shield birth control device But now the bankruptcy strategy seems to be backfiring Federal prosecutors in Richmond are seeking to oust the management of the 120yearold pharmaceutical company including E Claiborne Robins the chairman and grandson of the companys founder and E Claiborne Robins Jr the president  and turn the companys operations over to a trustee appointed by the court The Problems of Bankruptcy The Federal move and a continuing fight over who will represent the women claiming injury underscore how traumatic and cumbersome the bankruptcy process may be as a means of resolving mass lawsuits The choice of bankruptcy proceedings by solvent companies facing such claims has been controversial ever since the Manville Corporation filed for reorganization in 1982 under the weight of thousands of asbestos claims At that time critics said that the company was avoiding its debt to society by escaping into bankruptcy Bankruptcy court is not a panacea said Harvey Miller a New York bankruptcy lawyer The appointment of a trustee is a possibility companies have to consider And even if no trustee is named the reorganization process is traumatic changing the company from a private operation into one that operates in a goldfish bowl leaving management much less control A filing under Chapter 11 of the Federal bankruptcy laws automatically freezes all claims against a company until a reorganization plan is approved In Robinss case that included more than 5000 lawsuits over the Dalkon Shield But the filing also puts the company into the control of the bankruptcy court To protect the assets that will be available to creditors companies in bankruptcy must have approval to make all but the most routine payments Possibility of Trustee And if a creditor charges that the management is dishonest or grossly incompetent the bankruptcy court can remove existing management and install a trustee of its own choosing  a drastic move that is rarely made That trustee then has responsibility for running the company and may choose to allow certain executives some operating role On Wednesday S David Schiller an Assistant United States Attorney in Richmond asked the court to appoint a trustee to run Robins Mr Schillers motion charged that since the bankruptcy filing on Aug 21 Robins has made improper payments of more than 68 million in knowing and willful violation of a court order requiring the company to get permission for payments The disputed payments the motion said were 12 million in deferred compensation to officers and 56 million in royalty and other payments Mr Schiller acting on behalf of the Internal Revenue Service which is owed 62 million by Robins said the company was in civil contempt of the court order and argued that Robins was out of control and only appointment of a trustee can set it back on course Robins should not be violating an order designed to protect the very creditors toward whom it has a fiduciary obligation the motion said Such conduct is both fraudulent and dishonest The company acknowledged that it had made payments without the permission of the court but said they had been honest mistakes The suggestions that such actions amount to contempt is unwarranted as is the suggestion that a company with the performance record of Robins needs a trustee to oversee its operations said Roscoe E Puckett Jr a spokesman for the company in a prepared statement The payments were made in the belief that they were proper in the ordinary course of business The actions were in no way intended to violate the court order He did not elaborate The motion for a trustee is to be heard on April 21 Other Problems But the departments actions are not the only problem in the Robins case With almost 200000 Dalkon Shield claims filed since the company went into Chapter 11 and as many as 1200 more pouring into the Richmond courthouse every day  charging that the intrauterine device caused pelvic infections sterility and spontaneous abortions  the bankruptcy proceedings are mired in confusion The committee of 38 lawyers appointed to represent the claimants was dissolved by United States District Judge Robert R Merhige Jr two weeks ago after that committee asked to be allowed to replace its bankruptcy counsel Murray Drabkin At a March 4 hearing in Richmond Judge Merhige decided to keep Mr Drabkin as special counsel and instead to replace the 38lawyer committee with a smaller group which has not yet been named Shortly thereafter several members of the committee asked Judge Merhige to disqualify himself saying he favored the Robins side An Internal Battle Meanwhile the lawyers on the committee have been embroiled in a heated internal battle According to the chairman of the group Mary Beth Ramey and the former chairman Bradley Post one of the members Paul Rheingold kept advertising for more Dalkon Shield cases even after the committee passed a resolution against members doing so As a result they say Mr Rheingold was removed from the committees executive panel and threatened with the loss of his place on the committee At the March 4 hearing Mr Rheingold a New York City lawyer who has amassed more than 1000 Dalkon Shield cases told Judge Merhige that the committee was not functioning properly Mr Rheingold who says he is no longer advertising and violated no committee ruling says he is seeking a seat on the new committee Miss Ramey and other members of the disbanded committee say they will ask Judge Merhige to reconsider and reconstitute the old committee That battle could culminate today when Judge Merhige is scheduled to rule on a slew of legal motions including whether he should step down and who should represent the claimants Earlier this year as part of the bankruptcy proceeding Robins has run advertisements advising women who used the shield that any claims against the company must be filed by April 30  and many more claims than expected have filed Some lawyers now expect that as many as 300000 women may file Dalkon Shield claims When Robins went into bankruptcy it had more than 5000 cases

Abortion Is a MAn's Problem as Well as a Woman's; Augustinian Sense,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/15/opinion/l-abortion-is-a-man-s-problem-as-well-as-a-woman-s-augustinian-sense-144986.html,To the Editor Your poll on attitudes toward abortion Week in Review Feb 23 found that 55 percent of Americans agreed with the statement that abortion is the same thing as murdering a child At the same time 66 percent agreed with the apparently contradictory statement that abortion is sometimes the best thing in a bad situation A possible explanation for the disparity is that some of those who accepted the abstract classification of abortion as murder had been taught to associate this classification with religion and morality but when these same respondents were asked to consider reallife situations they fell back on their innate common sense If respondents who agreed to the description of abortion as murder thought they were voting on the side of religion and against atheism they were mistaken The overwhelming majority of Protestant denominations and the Conservative and Reform branches of Judaism reject the idea that abortion is murder and it is they not the antiabortion advocates who follow biblical teaching in this matter Only one passage in the Bible relates to abortion Exodus 2122 describes a case in which the loss of a fetus occurs if men quarrel and one strike a woman with child The punishment is a fine unless the woman is hurt Augustine one of the architects of Christian theology and a Roman Catholic saint commented on this passage in On Exodus The law does not provide that the act pertains to homicide for there yet cannot be said to be a live soul in a body that lacks sensation when it is not formed in flesh I think that Augustine was using common senseEDGAR VILLCHUR Woodstock NY Feb 25 1986
THE VATICAN FINDS A FIGHT IN AMERICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/weekinreview/the-vatican-finds-a-fight-in-america.html,It is said that the three subjects that should never be broached in polite company are sex religion and politics Last week all three combined with a vengeance in the Vatican The central figure was a wellliked Catholic theologian the Rev Charles Curran A tenured professor of moral theology at Catholic University of America in Washington DC Father Curran made public a letter from the Vaticans Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith giving him an unpleasant choice Either change his liberal views on such matters as birth control homosexuality divorce masturbation and abortion or be barred from teaching as a Catholic theologian Father Curran is fighting the ultimatum which was issued by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger with the approval of the Pope Liberal Catholic academics are backing him contending that the Vaticans order threatened academic freedom His home bishop backed him too If Father Currans status as a Roman Catholic theologian is brought into question said Bishop Matthew Clark of Rochester I fear a serious setback to Catholic education and pastoral life in this country The battle has been a long time coming It is being fought over an array of questions on which the distance between the Vatican and many American Catholics is great The churchs teachings on sexuality have been mocked in plays and in radically different ways both Mary Gordon and the Rev Andrew Greeley have enjoyed success with novels that treat themes relating Catholicism and sexuality The substantial attention for a recent academic work Judith C Browns Immodest Acts The Life of a Lesbian Nun in Renaissance Italy suggests the extent of the interest in such subjects Traditional Catholics no doubt have a legitimate complaint when they contend that outside the Vatican their views on sexuality do not get much of a hearing To those who oppose premarital sex birth control and divorce the church can hardly be faulted for holding to views it has maintained for centuries Although those opposed to church teaching seem to be motivated by compassion wrote the Revs Richard M Hogan and John M LeVoir in a book on Pope John Paul IIs teachings on sexuality in effect they are pessimistic about our possibility of ever overcoming the effects of sin Many traditionalists also link birth control to abortion arguing that a contraceptive mentality creates a disrespect for human life Surely consistency is there Sixteen centuries ago St Augustine condemned as unnatural and sinful those sexual acts in which intercourse did not take place in a vessel fit for procreation From St Augustine to John Paul there is a direct line though to the surprise of many this Pope tends to more joyous and lyrical in his discussion of sexuality than the dour Augustine But by many measures the churchs sexual teachings especially on birth control are falling increasingly on deaf American ears Father Greeley and his sociological colleagues have argued that the churchs ban on contraception seems to have been the occasion for massive apostasy and for a notable decline in religious devotion and belief On birth control especially Father Curran speaks for what according to poll after poll is a majority of American Catholics The Roman Catholic theology of sexuality has been frequently criticized in the past because it was too negative and gave an undue importance to sexuality he wrote several years ago All must admit the negative and even inhuman approach to sexuality which existed in the past both in Catholic theory and practice but fortunately a much more positive approach is beginning to prevail Indeed so many Catholic moral theologians agree with Father Currans approach that supporters are asking why he has been singled out Is it because he led the American dissenters to Humanae Vitae Pope Paul VIs encyclical banning birth control The Vatican says no adding that other liberals may face penalties too But that will not make its position any stronger in the United States Not incidentally Father Currans academic interests include a fascination with the relationship between being a Catholic and being an American At least some Vatican officials believe that Americas democratic traditions can make it harder for American Catholics to accept life in a hierarchical church Too often authority in the church acts as if all the people of God were dumb sheep or illiterate masses who must be directed from without in all they do Father Curran has written Those are fighting words and the Vatican is fighting back But one of the curious aspects of the case is that the Vatican which seemed to enjoy a tactical advantage against American signers of statements in favor of legal abortion has now taken on a much broader set of issues Many of Americas leading liberal Catholics have been reluctant to stake their right to dissent on the abortion question alone Father Currans own quarrels with the church on the subject are relatively mild and he freely concedes that the vast majority of Roman Catholic authors accept the traditional teaching or disagree only to a slight extent But birth control and sexuality are another matter Hanging his case on those issues as well as academic freedom is Father Currans hope And Romes challenge
"ANOTHER CAUSE, ANOTHER CONCERT FOR PETER, PAUL AND MARY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/arts/another-cause-another-concert-for-peter-paul-and-mary.html,There are framed gold and platinum albums on the wall of Mary Traverss midtown office reminders of the millionselling hits she sang as a member of Peter Paul and Mary in the 1960s Hanging next to them however are other kinds of citations  including for instance one from the Korean Institute for Human Rights Twentyfive years after Miss Travers first sang with Peter Yarrow and Paul Stookey the trio has been marking its anniversary with concerts for causes  standard operating procedure for the popfolk singers who have played more than 300 benefits for causes and candidates in the past three years alone In the wake of such socially conscious rock events as Live Aid for famine relief Farm Aid to publicize the farm problem and the allstar antiapartheid single Sun City Peter Paul and Mary might well feel like elder siblings The groups recent 25th anniversary show at Washingtons Kennedy Center was a benefit for the Free South Africa movement which is working to end apartheid A photograph in the program showed the singers alongside Mr Yarrows daughter and Miss Traverss mother getting arrested on the steps of the South African embassy  my first time with plastic handcuffs Miss Travers said This Tuesday the trio will open From Bleecker to Broadway  a sixday eightshow engagement at the Minskoff Theater and Peter Paul and Marys first Broadway shows ever  with a soldout benefit for the New York City Coalition for the Homeless that will raise approximately 40000 Another cause another concert In the 1960s Peter Paul and Mary brought folk songs childrens songs and brandnew protest songs  All My Trials Puff the Magic Dragon If I Had a Hammer Blowing in the Wind  to a gigantic pop listenership along with concert tours they sang at civilrights marches antiVietnam rallies and political benefits In the 1980s while folkstyle music has virtually disappeared from the pop charts Peter Paul and Marys worldwide audience still turns out to see a group whose agenda continues to mix social activism with threepart vocal harmony They say they are in the tradition of Seegers Raiders  paying tribute to the folk singer who has been an activist musician since the 1940s The trio is no longer indivisible Peter Paul and Mary split up in 1970 two years after Mr Stookey converted to Christianity and adopted Noel as his first name I had a family he said and unless I stopped touring and attended to them I wasnt going to have them much longer Peter Paul and Mary remained on good terms and reunited occasionally for benefit concerts In 1978 they began working together more steadily Meanwhile Miss Travers and Mr Yarrow have mixed political organizing and solo performing careers Mr Stookey sings Christian music with a group called Bodywork To a large extent now Mr Stookey said we walk our own roads and we bring to the group what we find arresting  an arrangement or new lyrics or changing lyrics Inevitably theres a discussion Right now were debating the issue of abortion because the Christian and the political perspectives are somewhat different This is a relationship with all three of us that has gone through terrible fights and wonderful making up Mr Yarrow said These days Noel and I write the songs and Mary writes the poetry and the speeches Twentyfive years ago Miss Travers said I used to get onstage and not open my mouth and not want to open my mouth to talk The other night at a meeting my job was to present an organized piece of material and to lay out a course of action and I was very organized and did it Peter looked at me and shook his head and he said To think we thought you were dumb  Mr Stookey has lived in Maine since the mid1970s Mr Yarrow and Miss Travers both have homes in Connecticut and Miss Travers also maintains an apartment and office in Manhattan I write songs while driving down the highway from Connecticut Mr Yarrow says I pick up the pencil and write without looking at it later I see if I can make it out Peter Paul and Mary say they are heartened by the increasing social activism of rock Even though Live Aid and Farm Aid were very comfortable and accessible gestures Mr Yarrow said which did not involve alienating a group that would object to ones involvement they were important steps for pop music Theres something happening in the world and with the technology that could unite us Its moving again and its a great joy that we can participate And we have something to share now that we didnt have then  were experienced Singing Blowing in the Wind all the places weve been Miss Travers said it takes on a different meaning everywhere When you sing the line How many years can a people exist before theyre allowed to be free in a prison yard for political prisoners in El Salvador if you have sung it to a group of union organizers  who have all been in jail  in South Korea if youve sung that song to Soviet Jews who have been refused exit visas if youve sung it with Bishop Tutu the song breathes lives it has a currency If we were wearing spangled tights and singing Fly Me to the Moon or hits of the 50s Mr Stookey said I dont think wed still be so involved with what were doing Peter Paul and Mary are no longer under contract to a major record label were waiting for someone to find us I guess Mr Stookey said We have a records worth of new material to perform and at most concerts a third to a half of the material we do is brand new created within the last year and a half At current concerts the group offers for sale a single written by Mr Stookey  El Salvador Trio members have gone on factfinding missions to Central America the Soviet Union and elsewhere over the past week they have accompanied politicians on visits to shelters for the homeless in New York City to draw attention to the problem What can Peter Paul and Mary do in the context of homelessness Mr Yarrow said Well we have a platform now Its been 25 years and weve been made responsible in a way by our research and our serious commitment I think folk music is terrific he concluded I think classical music is terrific too I played the violin when I was a kid But when I saw that music can activate energies and articulate thoughts and be a vehicle for people to move forward  when I saw it as a unifying force I said Thats for me  I want to do that And thats why Im still doing it 25 years later
POLITICS; KING TESTS WATERS UPSTATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/nyregion/politics-king-tests-waters-upstate.html,IN A year when more prospective candidates have been dropping out of races than entering them Nassau County Comptroller Peter T King is the only nonincumbent Republican actively campaigning to get on the partys state ticket for November Mr King has started the preliminary campaigning mostly upstate where he is little known that he hopes will lead to his selection to challenge Attorney General Robert Abrams when the Republican State Committee designates its statewide ticket in early June In the meantime Mr King is going through the classic ritual of a candidate who barely registers on the political Richter scale outside Nassau County He is attacking the Democratic incumbent which gets him some press attention He is displaying his political wares to Republican Party leaders at breakfasts lunches dinners and other meetings He is even attempting to appeal to what he calls traditional Democrats  mostly conservative and Roman Catholic by his positions against abortion and for the death penalty These positions also presumably would make him acceptable to the Conservative and Right to Life Parties although neither party has yet endorsed any statewide candidates On a recent day in Buffalo Mr King went through the campaign rituals he will be performing with increasing frequency He appeared on an earlymorning television interview program had a news conference in midmorning met with officials of the police union and had lunch with the Erie County Republican Chairman Victor Farley and other Republican leaders from western New York Then there were several radio interviews and meetings with the two top Republican officials in Erie County Mayor James D Griffin of Buffalo a maverick Democrat who has criticized Governor Cuomo and County Executive Edward Rutkowski a Republican The days events were what is known as touching the political and media bases Its a different world Mr King said as he echoed other downstate politicians who are often amazed at the media attention they get upstate compared with the New York City area where there are far more politicians competing for public attention Mr King a 41yearold lawyer from Seaford has not formally announced his candidacy yet because he said party leaders have asked him not to so as not to point up the fact that the Republicans are still searching for a candidate for governor The gubernatorial candidate will be the key to putting together a Republican ticket with at least some ethnic religious and geographic attractions  factors that could be an important consideration in whether Mr King is the eventual Republican nominee for attorney general At the moment the Republican ticket would appear to be very heavily tipped toward the suburbs Westchester County Executive Andrew P ORourke is generally considered the most likely Republican candidate for governor although he is hardly champing at the bit Two Republican incumbents who will be seeking reelection Senator Alfonse M DAmato and State Comptroller Edward V Regan are also suburbanites from Nassau and Westchester respectively although Mr Regans original political base was Buffalo That leaves only the lieutenant governor and attorney general posts to be filled and Mr Kings identification with suburbia and the fact that both he and Senator DAmato are Nassau residents could be a drawback to his candidacy Republican leaders said What Mr King has going for him however is that he is willing to take on Mr Abrams who is considered a strong vote getter In addition Mr King is the product of a Nassau Republican organization that is respected in Republican circles  an affluent operation that represents a county that in recent years has usually produced the largest vote of any county in the state on Election Day Nassau and Suffolk Counties together now account for about a sixth of the overall state vote Joseph N Mondello the Nassau Republican chairman has already sent two letters praising Mr King to Republican county leaders around the state Four years ago the Republicans picked a political unknown Frances Sclafani then an assistant Suffolk district attorney as the partys attorney general candidate This year Mr King and Senator DAmato are the only Long Islanders seeking places on the Republican ticket Presiding Supervisor Thomas S Gulotta of the Town of Hempstead was viewed as a potential state candidate but he said he was not interested Until now Mr King who is also a party leader as a member of the executive committee of the Nassau Republican organization was best known outside Nassau as a strong advocate of civil rights for Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland He has said that if he becomes the Republican nominee he hopes that IrishAmerican groups will play an important role in his campaign just as other ethnic and fraternal groups have been of considerable importance in the campaigns of other candidates including Governor Cuomo in the past Mr King said he is challenging Mr Abrams because he thinks the Attorney General is vulnerable and too liberal He has criticized the incumbents silence on the Gary McGivern clemency case Governor Cuomo recommended clemency for Mr McGivern who was serving a prison term for participation in the murder of a deputy sheriff but the clemency proposal was rejected by the State Parole Board The Ulster County District Attorney who prosecuted Mr McGivern Michael Kavanagh has been highly critical of the Governor and is considered a potential Republican statewide candidate and possibly a competitor for Mr Kings bid for attorney general Mr King has also reiterated criticism by Ronald Goldstock the Special State Prosecutor for Organized Crime that Mr Abrams is more concerned with producing press releases than with prosecuting organized crime figures Mr Abrams has said that he remained silent in the McGivern case because he had no role in the matter Mr Goldstock has since withdrawn his criticism of Mr Abrams Campaign funds will be a key problem for Mr King who has said he hopes to raise 15 million But in his two races for Nassau Comptroller and before that in a race for Hempstead Town Councilman he has never raised more than 40000 he acknowledged Republican politicians said the Nassau Republican Party will have to put its fundraising muscle at Mr Kings disposal if he is to raise a substantial amount Any fund raising at the moment is hindered however by the widespread perception that Mr Abrams is a formidable candidate who will be hard to defeat Contributors do not like to join losing causes That could change however not so much because of any keen criticism of Mr Abrams but rather the possibility that the Governor might turn to Mr Abrams as the lieutenant governor candidate That would leave the attorney general race without an incumbent with a builtin head start Such a development might not be a total blessing for Mr King however The lack of an incumbent and thus the prospect of a tighter race could attract other Republicans to the attorney general contest thus giving Mr King competition in his own party If Mr Abrams seeks reelection Mr King might get the nomination without much fuss if for no other reason than he is the only willing candidate so far If he should lose to Mr Abrams however all might not be lost Nassau politicians noted Mr King would retain his present post and gain exposure and experience for a likely contest with Mr Gulotta for the Republican nomination for Nassau County Executive in 1989
O'ROURKE LOOKS AT GUBERNATORIAL ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/16/nyregion/orourke-looks-at-gubernatorial-issues.html,COUNTY Executive Andrew P ORourke who last week continued to weigh the decision of whether he wanted to be the Republican candidate seeking to unseat Governor Cuomo in November has begun to address some of the issues he believes should be raised in the campaign Whoever runs against Cuomo is going to have plenty of ammunition Mr ORourke said during an interview in which he discussed the shifting of state responsibilities to municipalities the distribution of hydroelectric power abortion and the death penalty Close associates of Mr ORourke said last week that the County Executive had been persuaded to delay announcing his candidacy until after the county Republican dinner on Thursday so as not to upstage the guest speaker Vice President George Bush State and national Republican officials have indicated that the nomination is Mr ORourkes if he wants it Although he declined in the interview to divulge whether he wanted the nomination Mr ORourke noted that there are plenty of differences between himself and Mr Cuomo The Governors apparent popularity now is while hes not running against anyone and while no one is talking about issues to confront him Mr ORourke said As County Executive Mr ORourke has criticized Mr Cuomo for a lack of hydroelectric power in Westchester and the downstate region and he said that he was sure that would be an issue in any campaign While some say that a call for hydroelectric power redistribution will be unpopular in some parts of the state Mr ORourke said that it depends on how it is packaged There are ways of redistributing the power he said What bothers me is that over 60 percent of the legislators come from New York City and I dont think a bill has ever been introduced to do anything to help the situation Mr ORourke said that the Republican candidate will talk about the welfare mess that exists in New York State and about the fact that as we lose more and more aid from various places we still have this huge cumbersome network of regulations that prevents us from even spending our own money wisely Some State Democratic officials anticipating his candidacy have charged that Mr ORourke has increased taxes in Westchester while Mr Cuomo has lowered state taxes Mr ORourke said however that the states surplus which allowed for lower taxes was created from the backs of localities the result of shifting responsibilities to the municipalities and forcing them to find additional revenues I wouldnt even campaign on that issue Mr ORourke said If somebody said did you raise taxes Id say sure To run a government if you need to do that you raise taxes The people who run on lowering taxes no one believes that Nobody believes things go down unless somebody is paying for it somewhere If you have a surplus in your house either you got a raise somewhere or you cut back on something Its got to come from somewhere As an example he cited the state requirement that the county house prisoners who he said should be in state institutions I dont want the state to use our prison as a holding jail so that they dont have to build another jail he said He noted that the state reimbursement rate is 20 a day while it costs the county 80 a day to provide for these prisoners Millions of dollars of county money has gone to feed and house state prisoners without so much as a thank you from the State of New York he said Its things like that that bother me He said that if state officials would do their job and tax for their job and not force us to tax for their job we have enough assets in Westchester County to run our own house If the state assumed what Mr ORourke called its legitimate duties would personal taxes then be increased I think what you have to do is look at the whole picture he said New York has lost people has lost businesses and it is the total tax picture that gets people There are efficiencies that should be built into government that Im not prepared now to say werent done but apparently look as though they werent done Mr ORourke said a special commission should have been created to investigate the whole mess in New York City a reference to the recent disclosures of corruption among city officials Mayor Koch has done great things for New York City Mr ORourke said but added that public confidence has been shaken He said that if he were governor he would have appointed such a commission and he wondered aloud why Mr Cuomo had not taken that step The people of New York deserve that kind of response he said Mr ORourke who personally opposes abortion said that he unlike Mr Cuomo would be against Medicaid funding of abortion Ive said that often he noted I wouldnt change that People would have to accept me on that basis Mr ORourke also restated his longstanding support of the death penalty for firstdegree murder We never should have got rid of it in the first place Saying he did not know if reinstatement of the death penalty would act as a deterrent to crime he explained I think society has a right to demand a grave punishment for grave crimes committed against society And a death of a human being is the gravest of crimes and I would think that society has a right to demand the death penalty Mr Cuomo has consistantly vetoed bills that would reinstate the death penalty Mr Cuomo is often mentioned as a contender for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988 and Mr ORourke said that one of the Governors major problems in getting reelected was that he is running for two jobs at the same time Hes going to get schizoid having to concern himself with what he says in Westchester or in New York State and what its national implications are Mr ORourke said Discussing how an ORourke candidacy would affect the operations of the countys government the County Executive said All of us have to concern ourself with our ability to do the job that were elected to I think obviously on an economyofscale basis its easier to be County Executive and run for Governor than it is to be Governor and run for President of the United States If you are a decentralizing person and have a good group working for you that certainly makes it easier if youre away Mr ORourke said referring to his own style of administration I believe in a commandlike structure he explained The people that work for the County of Westchester wouldnt be working here if I didnt have confidence in their ability So they run their departments with a minimum amount of interference from me  certainly nothing like a daytoday oversight  and I get involved as a problemsolver as a setter of policy He noted that as chairman of the Board of Legislators he had had no difficulty with his predecessor Alfred B DelBello running for Lieutenant Governor on the Democratic ticket in 1982 After Mr DelBellos election to that position Mr ORourke was named County Executive In 1983 he was elected to fill out the remaining two years of Mr DelBellos term and last November he was elected to a full fouryear term I like to believe and I do believe that Im important to the running of the County of Westchester he said However I know that the county would survive if I didnt make it home tonight and that part of that survival is based on the good solid underpinning of people in Westchester County I think Ive made a difference in Westchester But it isnt a difference that Westchester wouldnt survive if I went somewhere else if I got out of office Calling himself a good crisis manager Mr ORourke cited strikes and earthquakes and hurricanes and Indian Point and the Mianus Bridge as examples of challenges he had met We run a bipartisan government he added We dont look at peoples party registrations when we hire them And Ive been interested in the kinds of things I think people are interested in whether its welfare reform or the arts Im very happy with the record this administration has made He said that some of the programs of which he was proud were inherited from the former administration My feeling was there has to be continuity in government and the good programs you keep he said The same thing would happen if I ran on the state level Financing is believed to be the key variable in Mr ORourkes decision about the candidacy Although he emphasized the importance of the issues Mr ORourke conceded if I go into this race it will be because I believe that the money will be raised to run a credible campaign He set a figure of at least 5 million You certainly dont need 10 million he said alluding to what he said was the war chest Mr Cuomo had amassed for a reelection bid He said he expected his good friend Senator Alphonse M DAmato to campaign for him should he run and he hinted that President Reagan might make a personal appearance on behalf of an ORourke candidacy Some political observers have suggested that if Mr ORourke ran for Governor and lost he would be the logical choice to run against Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1988 You mean after getting the privilege of running against Cuomo you get the privilege of running against Moynihan Mr ORourke said with a laugh I mean that isnt exactly the way to increase your longevity in this business If youre saying Does the party owe you something I think they probably do Mr ORourke continued But that doesnt really mean much I cant think of anything the Republican Party has that I really want There was a time that I was very interested in becoming a judge and I was thwarted by the party They thought I was too independent And that time has come and gone He added I never go into a race to lose Ive run 11 times and Ive won 11 times and thats a reasonable score If I go into this race it will be to win It wont be to give the incumbent a sparring partner
POLITICS; EVANGELISM AND A FIGHT WITH PERIL TO BOTH SIDES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/17/us/politics-evangelism-and-a-fight-with-peril-to-both-sides.html,Last fall 50000 copies of a fundraising letter signed by the Democratic national chairman went out describing in typically partisan directmail language a potential Republican Presidential candidate too radical even for Ronald Reagan If this man should be elected President the letter warned he would abolish public education outlaw all abortions set quotas for bornagain Christians in Government jobs and begin a massive military buildup in preparation for an inevitable nuclear showdown with the Soviet Union The Democratic chairman Paul G Kirk Jr was referring to the Rev Marion G Pat Robertson a 55yearold fundamentalist evangelist from Virginia Beach Va whose Christian Broadcasting Network reaches 30 million cable television subscribers with a mixture of religious and family entertainment programs including the 700 Club  for which Mr Robertson is the host Rebuke From Evangelist The letter did not solve the Democratic National Committees financial problems but it did provoke a sharp rebuke from the evangelist He dismissed Mr Kirks characterization of his views as utter nonsense accused the Democratic chairman of virulent antiChristian bigotry and challenged him to debate religion and politics on national television This is a debate that some in both parties would like to avoid For Democrats it could risk reinforcing the cultural and political alienation from the Democratic Party that many evangelical Christians feel especially in the South a region crucial to the partys comeback strategy Republicans on the other hand worry that it could cost them the support of young voters who are uneasy about the social agenda of the religious right We have to walk a very careful line said Edward J Rollins who directed Mr Reagans reelection campaign in 1984 and occasionally advises Mr Robertson on political matters Most of the young voters we had success with in 1984 were more libertarian than conservative My preference is that we debate politics and not religion Shift in Voting Detailed In his letter Mr Kirk said his staffs research showed that the votes of 22 million Christian fundamentalists shifted from a proDemocratic 5643 edge in 1976 to a 8119 Republican sweep in 1984 Polls find most Christian fundamentalists vote for or against a candidate not on the basis of some narrow test but for many of the same complex reasons that sway other voters But more than most voting groups they seem sensitive to any candidate who is perceived as a threat to their values and views of American life Despite the risks some Democratic strategists view the Republican Partys relationship with the religious right as a vulnerability worth exploiting politically The Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee as part of its strategy for helping Democrats in this years House elections has produced radio and television commercials linking Republican candidates to the Rev Jerry Falwell of Lynchburg Va one of the most controversial of the television evangelists who have crossed the line into politics Falwell Runs Behind Fonda That Mr Falwell has high negative ratings in public opinion polls is not disputed by either party and Democratic strategists are urging their partys candidates as one put it to push the Falwell button in their campaigns Mr Falwell who already has endorsed Vice President Bush for President in 1988 received a lower favorable rating than Jane Fonda the actress and liberal activist in a recent national public opinion poll conducted by Robert Teeter Mr Bushs polltaker If there is anything that puts a shudder into young voters its the right wings social agenda said Martin D Franks executive director of the committee Until we figure out some better way to go after young people Im happy with this one But in challenging Mr Falwell or Mr Robertson on the political front Mr Franks said The key is to be precise enough to communicate to people that were not opposing Christian evangelism but trying to make sure that extremism whether it be religious or ideological doesnt trample on the rights of others Mr Franks said that unlike Mr Falwell who makes my hair stand up when I see him on television Mr Robertson comes across as a more polished and less threatening figure Anytime you have that message in a pretty box its a difficult problem he said A Very Positive Direction Mr Robertson said recently that he had not made up his mind whether to run for President in 1988 adding that things are moving in a very positive direction In a recent Presidential preference poll of its subscribers The Conservative Digest reported that Mr Robertson was the choice of 19 percent of 2400 respondents second only to Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York at 26 percent Mr Bush came in third with 14 percent More than any other potential Republican contender Mr Robertson hits the social issues that arouse and energize conservatives Republican strategists are concerned that a Robertson candidacy could restrict the partys efforts to broaden its appeal by reigniting an emotional debate on such issues as abortion school prayer and homosexuality These are just not the kind of issues we need at the top of our agenda in 88 said one key Republican

CHURCH AIDES SAY O'CONNOR MEANT NO THREAT TO COLLEGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/19/nyregion/church-aides-say-o-connor-meant-no-threat-to-college.html,Officials of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York say John Cardinal OConnor never meant to threaten to drop church support of a medical college affiliated with two city hospitals that perform abortions An article in The New York Times March 10 reported that the Cardinal had said that if the hospitals Lincoln and Metropolitan did not stop performing abortions New York Medical College would either have to give up its 24 millionayear contract to supply them with medical services or drop its ties with the archdiocese The choice for the college is either the church or the two hospitals Cardinal OConnor said in an interview at the time Catholic principles and concepts of Catholic medical practice would be violated he said then and there is no way we could continue together That Conflict Does Not Exist On the day the article appeared a spokesman for the archdiocese the Rev Peter G Finn said the college would not have to give up its affiliation contract He said The Timess article gave an indication of a conflict but that in fact that conflict does not exist not as far as the city nor the archdiocese nor the medical college can determine Asked to elaborate last Friday Msgr James P Cassidy director of health and hospitals for the archdiocese said the Cardinal might have believed he was responding to a theoretical question He said the Cardinal might also have been unfamiliar with all the details of the sevenyearold affiliation contract between the school and the hospitals You could set up a theoretical case about what should be done and what shouldnt be done and then apply them any way you want Monsignor Cassidy said You cant expect the Cardinal to know every detail of affiliation The archdiocese helped rescue the medical college from financial failure eight years ago and the college is contemplating strengthening its association with the archdiocese as a means of improving its fundraising capabilities The college has been affiliated with the two city hospitals since 1979 under a contract that specifically requires that any abortions be performed by outside physicians so the colleges medical staff and teaching faculty will not be involved

NEW JERSEY OPINION; HUMANITARIAN ACTS CAN HAVE UNFORESEEN RESULTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-humanitarian-acts-can-have-unforeseen-results.html,WE OFTEN act in ways that we think are humane yet that turn out later to have consequences that cause suffering This happens in our personal lives but more importantly in social policies too More importantly because social policies can affect the lives of thousands even millions Let me present some examples from very different areas IMMIGRATION When refugees flee from countries such as Haiti or Cuba it seems humane to accept these immigrants How could we do otherwise Yet the consequences of accepting even encouraging immigrants from such countries means that the government of the country gets rid of its dissidents Most of those who might overthrow an oppressive regime are now in some lessoppressive country becoming citizens of a new homeland FAMINE People in various nations have experienced famine again and again When a new country receives attention from the press there is a flood of help And then the focus passes We are concerned about Ethiopia but we have forgotten Uganda What does the food do It prolongs the survival of people for a month or a year or more What quality does their life have Probably incredible suffering near starvation unemployment hopelessness Typically little is done to help the country increase its food production or to encourage birth control steps that might alleviate the problem in the future PSYCHIATRIC EXCUSES Dr Seymour Halleck a psychologist and the author of The Politics of Therapy has repeatedly shown how giving people psychiatric excuses for special consideration prevents reform For example the fact that the rich and the educated could find doctors to provide psychiatric reasons for a legal abortion meant that these people had no need to press for reforms But the rich and the educated were the very people who could press for and achieve reforms Dr Halleck makes the same point about providing psychiatric excuses to avoid military service and he has given an example from his work at a university To get out of a dormitory contract a student needed a psychiatric reason Dr Halleck regularly provided such excuses until he saw that by letting the dissatisfied leave the dormitories he was preventing reform He stopped granting psychiatric excuses Within a year a tenant group had pressed for and obtained important changes in living conditions STREET PEOPLE Mental hospitals are not the best places for people to live in Being in an institution leads to mental deterioration and various kinds of pathlogical behavior similar in fact to that seen in caged animals in a zoo It seemed humane to release people from such institutions but what was the result A major result was that these former patients were physically and psychologically abused by the owners of the halfway houses in which they stayed they preferred to wander the streets alone Now we have thousands of street people huddled over hotair vents in the winter Is this better Many other analagous examples could be given What often seems to be a quick humane solution to a problem can lead to greater suffering in the future  consequences that we failed to anticipate We are humane But often in being so we cause suffering And too often we have moved on to a new humane project so that we do not see the suffering we have caused
POLITICS; SHOREHAM KEY TO SPECIAL VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/23/nyregion/politics-shoreham-key-to-special-vote.html,THE political potency of the Shoreham nuclear power plant issue is evident as the campaign for a special election for the Suffolk County Legislature begins in the SmithtownBrookhaven area Both majorparty candidates Barbara Barnett the Democrat and Donald Blydenburgh the Republican  are also running on second lines on the voting machine ad hoc antiShoreham and antiLong Island Lighting Company parties The parties were set up specifically to reinforce the candidates antiShoreham positions and give the majorparty candidates another line on the ballot in the May 6 special election After that the parties will fade away until the next election Republicans set up their special line Concerned Citizens Against Lilco to counter the special Democratic line Ratepayers Against Lilco which polled as many as 1000 votes each for Democratic candidates for the County Legislature last year The identification of Democrats with opposition to Lilcos effort to open its Shoreham plant which is completed but which has not received a Federal commercial operating license was viewed by many politicians as a substantial factor in Democratic successes last November The 18member County Legislature is now almost evenly divided  with eight Democrats seven Republicans and two Conservatives The special election is to fill the vacancy created by the resignation of a Republican Donald Allgrove of Smithtown who has moved out of the state because his wife is ill He defeated Mrs Barnett by about 900 votes in the general election last November The Shoreham issue was also the critical factor in the decision by the Conservative Party to foresake its usual alliance with the Republicans and run its own candidate Anthony DiPerna in the special election Mr DiPerna is a retired school administrator and an adjunct profesor at St Johns University Harold Haar the Smithtown Conservative Party chairman said the party could not support Mr Blydenburgh because of his antiShoreham stance Mr DiPerna supports opening the plant The Right to Life Party cooperated with the Republicans according to officials in both parties by not nominating Mr Blydenburgh A candidate is entitled to no more than two lines on the voting machine and Smithtown Republicans said they saw Shoreham as a more potent issue than abortion However Ken Diem the Right to Life Party leader in Smithtown said the party would nevertheless campaign for Mr Blydenburgh Another important factor in the special election will be the position of the popular Smithtown Supervisor Patrick R Vecchio a Democrat who has won consistently in a Republican town and now presides over a town board that is 4to1 Democratic Mr Vecchio has cultivated an independent image to the point of often battling with his own Democratic Party and appointing Republicans like Mr Blydenburgh to town offices Mr Blydenburgh is the Town Attorney Smithtown Democrats have asked Dominic J Baranello the Suffolk Democratic chairman to persuade Mr Vecchio to campaign actively for Mrs Barnett an environmentalist and community activist She is a member of the Smithtown Conservation Board Mr Vecchio was reported by his office to be on vacation and unavailable for comment He is considered a potential candidate for Suffolk County Executive next year and thus possibly susceptible to Baranello pressure Whatever the outcome of the special election Gregory J Blass the newly elected Presiding Officer of the County Legislature will retain his post for the next two years He was elected by teaming up with Mr Allgrove and the Democrats over the opposition of William M Blake the Suffolk Republican leader Mr Allgroves reward was the No 2 position in the County Legislature Deputy Presiding Officer Mr Blass prodded by Mr Blake attempted to have a Republican elected as his deputy but Democratic legislators forced the election of the senior Democratic legislator John J Foley of Blue Point Greg is always talking about fusion government said Philip Nolan of Islip the Democratic minority leader of the County Legislature Id like to see the performance match the rhetoric The election of Mr Blass and Mr Foley largely as a result of Democratic votes indicates the unusual division in the Legislature where an ostensible RepublicanConservative majority cannot work its will That split may be further aggravated after the May 6 special election

A Revolution Looms In American Health,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/opinion/a-revolution-looms-in-american-health.html,The revolution in the American way of health will be as profound and turbulent as any economic and social upheaval our nation has experienced At stake are not only billions of dollars but who lives who dies  and who decides Science serves up biomedical breakthroughs that hold the promise of miraculous cures and the threat of unacceptable costs The aging of the population  in the first quarter of the next century 60 million Americans will be over 65  signals the dawn of the fourgeneration society in which it will soon be common to have two generations of the same family in retirement on Medicare receiving Social Security and nursing care In law and religion a confounding mix of issues bewilders our judges and theologians At the same time the spirited air of competition is for the first time swirling through the health industry Fed up with years of waste the big buyers of care  governments corporations and unions  are demanding the facts changing the way doctors hospitals and other providers are used and paid and reshaping financial incentives that have encouraged patients to seek unnecessary care And a host of new health care providers is scrambling to get their business The early signs are encouraging hospital admissions lengths of stay and occupancy rates dropped in 1984 and again in 1985 Medicare which many feared would go bust by the early 1990s looks solvent until late in that decade Cigarette consumption has been going down But the facts make it clear that the health care revolution is just beginning And the facts are startling enough to shake up even the most complacent purchaser of health care Item When doctors dont have to get advance approval 20 percent to 25 percent of the patients they admit to hospitals shouldnt be and those who should are kept there for too many 500 days Largely by requiring that all nonemergency nonmaternity hospital stays be approved in advance by a second medical opinion the Chrysler Corporation cut 100 million from its health care bills over the past three years and provided its employees with better care Item Corporate and government health programs are paying as much as 60 billion for medical procedures that are unrelated to the health needs of patients With no apparent difference in health status residents in three Massachusetts communities Fairhaven Fitchburg and Framingham  are 15 times more likely to have their tonsils removed than residents of other areas in the state where antibiotics are used to treat tonsillitis at far less cost The rate of major cardiovascular surgery is twice as high in Des Moines as in Iowa City for patients with the same symptoms  and with no noticeable difference in health results A comprehensive study of 44 million Medicare beneficiaries has further documented the erratic geographic variations in medical practice Item Those who go to feeforservice doctors are twice as likely to have coronary bypass surgery as those who belong to health maintenance organizations  and four times more likely than their European and Candian counterparts  for no apparent reason except that feeforservice doctors receive payments to make repairs rather than payments to keep us healthy Item A relatively small number of patients account for a large proportion of health costs More than 30 percent of Medicares money goes to patients with less than a year to live In 1984 a mere 34 percent of Chryslers insured accounted for 435 percent of the companys health care payments These high cost cases often involve chronic or terminal illnesses and more often than not are related to life styles Millions of dollars can be saved and pointless anguish avoided by using home health and hospice care and by promoting healthier life styles Item The cockeyed malpractice system costs far more than the 4plus billion in premiums last year Billions more are wasted on tests by doctors anticipating possible lawsuits Item Medical technology makes it possible to provide at home and in the doctors office diagnosis and treatment for example chemotherapy dialysis intravenous therapies and feeding that once could be delivered only in a hospital Today nurses can perform many tasks once reserved for doctors such as examining diagnosing and treating many wounds and sprains and common ailments Early results of a Memorial SloanKettering program indicate that many cancer patients can be treated just as effectively on an outpatient basis as in the hospital Item Each of us can do more for our own health than any hospital doctor medicine or drug Smoking has killed and maimed more Americans than all our wars and automobile accidents combined Alcoholism and alcohol abuse is the No 4 disease in America More than half of the dramatic 25 percent decline in deaths from heart disease over the past 15 years is attributable to changes in diet and quitting smoking A program at Johnson  Johnson encouraging employees to quit smoking and eat and exercise properly has slashed absenteeism by 20 percent and hospitalization by 35 percent recapturing three times the cost of the companys effort If the big buyers of health care act on these facts in less than 10 years we can have a health care system efficient enough to provide higher quality care for all at the same price we are paying for a sick care system that leaves 33 million Americans without adequate care Half the hospital beds can be closed down in less than 10 years The number of doctors particularly specialists can be sharply curtailed Their monopoly over the practice of medicine can be eased to allow paraprofessionals to provide many medical services just as competently and far less expensively Government and private insurance programs can cover more care in the home and the doctors office Instead of paying doctors a fee for each service to treat us after we are sick corporate and government purchasers can pay doctors an annual fee to keep us healthy or a preset feeforillness if we do get sick Individuals can be given financial incentives to pursue healthy life styles Those who smoke dont keep their weight and cholesterol levels in acceptable ranges and miss periodic medical or dental checkups can be charged more The medical malpractice system can limit recovery to a modest amount for pain and suffering and to the amounts necessary to pay medical bills replace lost income or compensate for the inability to function because of disability Lawyers contingent fees can be sharply cut For doctors malpractice reform can begin at home with strengthened disciplinary systems that clean out incompetents Lots more information can be given to purchasers of health care how much hospitals and doctors charge how often they treat different ailments and perform various medical and surgical procedures what their drugdispensing practices are how often doctors put patients in hospitals and how long they keep them there At this stage in the revolution the private sector holds the key to success Politicians who must pander for private contributions for their election campaigns cant stand up to the clout and money of the hospitals medical equipment manufacturers and physicians But corporate America has discovered that the health industry takes a huge bite from profits It has also discovered that it can offer employees better care at far less cost If we fail to create an efficient health care system we will also find ourselves involved in a debate over death control  who lives and who dies  far nastier than the controversy over abortion and end up with government bureaucrats deciding who gets the next heart or kidney hip or knee operation and who is entitled to expensive anticancer therapy The debate over death control could pit sons and daughters against parents and grandparents And unlike fetuses the old can speak and vote The uncertainties are not in knowing what to do not in science not in economics The uncertainties lie in our ability to discipline ourselves and in our will to act with courage and compassion A health care system as efficient and fair as it is miraculous is at long last within our reach if we have the daring and persistence to finish the revolution
AROUND THE NATION; Abortion-Notice Law Takes Effect in Ohio,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/us/around-the-nation-abortion-notice-law-takes-effect-in-ohio.html,A state law requiring physicians to notify parents of unmarried minors seeking abortions went into effect today after a Federal judge refused to block it Federal District Judge John Manos today refused a request by the American Civil Liberties Union of Ohio for a temporary restraining order But Linda Sogg an ACLU lawyer predicted the law would be struck down next week when another Federal district judge hears a request for a preliminary injunction The law requires physicians to give at least 24 hours notice to the parents or legal guardian before the abortion could proceed Minors who fear emotional physical or sexual abuse by parents can ask a juvenile court to waive the requirement
Working Profile: Patrick J. Buchanan; Eating Lightning Bolts and Liking the Taste,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/25/us/working-profile-patrick-j-buchanan-eating-lightning-bolts-and-liking-the-taste.html,Seated in shirtsleeves in a cramped windowless office only yards from the Oval Office Patrick J Buchanan recalls that his fierce conservatism is steeped in a Washington family that is improbably even more conservative than he is One of his closest relatives says the White House communications director has three political heroes Senator Joseph R McCarthy Gen Francisco Franco and Gen Douglas A MacArthur I guess Im a leftist deviationist compared to that said Mr Buchanan laughing Hardly Within the last year the provocative 46yearold former columnist radio commentator and aide to President Nixon has adhered to a conservatism that has privately distressed some aides to Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff and publicly angered even some Republican legislators Most recently they contend Mr Buchanan cost the White House votes when he suggested that legislators were siding with Communism by opposing the Reagan Administrations 100 million aid package for the antiSandinista rebels in Nicaragua The House rejected the aid proposal last Thursday 222210 No Policy to Defend Nonsense  thats silly answered Mr Buchanan The Democrats attacked Pat Buchanan because they are not comfortable attacking the President They spent two weeks defending their patriotism which no one contests because they have no policy to defend The point is the liberals who are now beginning to concede we have a cancer in Central America have no policy of their own for dealing with it Within the White House Mr Buchanan oversees speechwriting and communication and has carried on an aggressive battle with Mr Regan and his staff over Presidential approaches to various issues He favors a forceful antiCommunist promilitary stance on international matters and an economically and socially conservative stance on domestic matters opposing abortion and favoring sanctioned school prayer for example His batting average remains about 5050 He argued for example against imposing limited sanctions against South Africa but lost He strongly favored a Presidential veto on emergency farm credit legislation last year and won Last September he endorsed a strong freetrade antiprotectionist speech by Mr Reagan and in November he helped write a toughly worded antiSoviet speech before Mr Reagans trip to Geneva to meet Mikhail S Gorbachev the Soviet leader In both these instances Mr Buchanan was overruled by the chief of staff in favor of more accommodating oratory But on the dominant foreign policy issue of the moment Nicaragua Mr Buchanans oratory seems to mirror the strongly held views of Communism that have marked Mr Reagans political career In spite of the White House loss last week Mr Buchanan and others are convinced that a Senate vote this week and a scheduled reconsideration of rebel aid legislation in the House will turn the tide in favor of the Administration Among Republicans who have openly criticized Mr Buchanan for his uncompromisingly tough words is Representative Steve Gunderson of Wisconsin Its Pat Buchanans comments that every Democrat tells me about he said before the House vote on rebel aid last Thursday If we lose today it will be his fault Mr Buchanan brushes aide the criticisms that he was redbaiting on the Nicaragua issue in an article he wrote for The Washington Post and seeking to engage in a scare campaign that may have backfired Look Pat Buchanan is a lighting rod he said Theyve had various lighting rods Don Regan was the lightning rod last fall Im a man of some controversy Im enjoying every bit of it In the article he said the vote on rebel aid would reveal whether the Democratic Party stood with Mr Reagan or with Daniel Ortega Saavedra the Nicaraguan leader and the Communists On Capitol Hill Democrats and even such Republicans as Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum of Kansas were outraged The only two individuals whose motivation has been challenged by name are Pat Buchanan and Ronald Reagan said the White House communications director I havent mentioned the name of a single Democrat Nicaragua is an issue which engages the heart as well as the mind he said Its an issue of Communism versus antiCommunism It is perceived by both on our side and the other side as a moral issue an issue of right and wrong and on issues like this emotions run deep and passions run deep and strong We recognize this but we have no apologies I wouldnt change a single syllable of what I wrote A gifted talker Mr Buchanan said he was convinced that the Administration would ultimately persuade the American people and Congress about the dangers of Nicaragua and the need to support the rebels I look at it like this he said Were like a group of doctors here Were sitting down and looking at a patient we want to save What weve been saying early on is Gentlemen all the symptoms are there  this is cancer And what the other side is saying is Look this is a tumor but its not cancerous And I think as more and more of the evidence comes in more and more Democrats and Republicans will come to believe that these people who told us it was cancer appear to be right I Have No Departure Date Mr Buchanan said that despite periodic rumors that he was unhappy at the White House he had no plans to leave Im really enjoying it now he said I have no departure date I think theres a real potential for Ronald Reagan who could be a great pivotal figure in American history He compared Mr Reagan with President Kennedy whose leadership and style stirred young people and drew them into politics Ronald Reagan is doing that for the conservative movement he said Reagan has given the conservative movement a touch of class a touch of majesty and never again will they be able to say the things they say about conservatives  because of Reagan because of his policies because of the manner in which he carried himself Reagan is a class act and everyone knows it On another subject he said that his relations with Mr Regan at this point were warm I actually think hes pleased he said with his controversial choice of communications director
BUDGET-BALANCING AMENDMENT LOSES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/26/us/budget-balancing-amendment-loses.html,In a dramatic loss for the Republican leadership and President Reagan the Senate this evening barely defeated a constitutional amendment to require a balanced Federal budget The vote was 66 to 34 in favor one vote short of the required twothirds majority Senators on both sides of the issue said approval in December of the new budgetbalancing law whose main Senate Republican sponsors were Phil Gramm of Texas and Warren B Rudman of New Hampshire was the key factor in the debate Senators agreed that the new law allowed several past supporters of the amendment to vote no The Senate had approved a budgetbalancing amendment in 1982 by a vote of 69 to 31 Supporters called the loss today a severe blow and said the voters will need to change the makeup of the Senate this fall to give a chance of winning in 1987 Bob Dole the Senate majority leader who like Mr Reagan was a strong supporter of the amendment shook his head in disappointment as the rollcall ended with him unable to switch the one vote he needed to win 2 GOP Leaders Assailed Other Republicans who supported the amendment immediately criticized two members of their leadership who voted no They were John Heinz of Pennsylvania and John H Chafee of Rhode Island both of whom also voted no in 1982 Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah said A lot of our senators who are up this year are very upset about it Ten Republicans joined 24 Democrats in defeating the proposal The other 43 Republicans and 23 Democrats voted yes Senator Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona criticized Mr Reagan as making too few phone calls in lobbying for the amendment Obviously he didnt make enough Mr DeConcini said after the vote Mr Reagan has had only limited success with other items on the conservative agenda that he began to push when he came into office including abortion and school prayer A supporter of the amendment Senator Paul Simon Democrat of Illinois said Senators think GrammRudman has passed and that will do the trick Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware the ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee agreed We have GrammRudman  lets see how it works he said Thats my rationale for not voting for it 4 Switched to Oppose It The key votes that led to the defeat came from four Senators who voted yes in 1982 but voted no today These were Mark O Hatfield of Oregon and Robert T Stafford of Vermont both Republicans and Robert C Byrd of West Virginia and Quentin N Burdick of North Dakota both Democrats Over the years those pushing for a balanced budget amendment have lobbied state legislatures to call for a constitutional convention and 32 of the required 34 have done so at one time or another But no legislature has done so recently with Kentucky being the most recent to balk On March 11 the Kentucky House voted for a resolution calling on Congress to balance the budget but not for a constitutional convention Republican leaders said this morning that they were still short of the twothirds vote required to approve the amendment But late in the day proponents were arguing that they had switched some votes Supporters had already made changes in the proposal two weeks ago in an effort to win votes In addition supporters thought they had gained momentum with the support of Mr Simon who backed the proposal after the Judiciary Committee made a change in a provision for rises in revenue Provisions of Proposal Under the amendment voted on today tax laws could not changed to increase revenue unless approved by a majority of the whole House and the whole Senate As Congress is currently constituted this would require 51 senators and 218 representatives voting in favor Under the provision won by Mr Simon however there would be no yeartoyear limit on how much revenue could increase based on normal economic growth as opposed to through changes in the tax laws Spending would not be allowed to exceed revenue in any year unless war was declared It would take a threefifths vote of the whole House and the whole Senate to approve a deficit in any year The amendment would also require the President to submit a balanced budget and require a threefifths vote of each house to raise the debt ceiling Amendments to the Constitution are proposed either by a constitutional convention or by a twothirds vote of the House and the Senate They take effect only if ratified by threefourths of the state legislatures Opponents such as Slade Gorton Republican of Washington argued that the Constitution is not the place to set fiscal or economic policy The Constitution is no place for Congressional graffiti he said Other opponents like Alan Cranston Democrat of California said the amendment ignored the fact that Congress and the White House had not yet come close to agreeing on how to meet the 144 billion deficit ceiling for 1987 under the new budgetbalancing law What we and the President should be doing instead is agreeing on how were going to meet the GrammRudman deficit target for the fiscal year breathing down our necks Senator Cranston said
CHOOSING AN ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/27/garden/l-choosing-an-abortion-022186.html,TO THE HOME SECTION Anna Quindlens essay was excellent And I say that despite the fact that I believe unequivocally that abortion is all wrong I understand that many who do not believe as I do have gone through their own agonizing soulsearching and have arrived at a different conclusion As a woman a mother and a Catholic I have been pained and dismayed by the bitterness generated by both pro and antiabortion factions We dont need two marches on Washington we dont need two groups hurlng charges at one another We need one group of concerned citizens that will work together to eliminate the poverty and hopelessness that contribute so mightily to the abortion picture Few major issues are resolved by groups in which there is 100 percent consensus Only by working together and by respecting the honest views of those who differ with us can we make progress toward a better society Even as I write this I recall that I was harshly criticized  by a friend who believes as I do about abortion for suggesting that pro and antiabortion forces must work together to eliminate the need for abortions BETTY J COSTABILE Racine Wisconsin

CHOOSING AN ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/27/garden/l-choosing-an-abortion-022486.html,TO THE HOME SECTION I have rarely been impressed with the reasoning of those who even marginally oppose the right to choose abortion They often do so with a hysteria that precludes understanding However Anna Quindlens article [ Hers March 13 ] was presented with such clarity and sincerity as to be beneficial to those on either side of the abortion issue Ms Quindlen has spoken eloquently for many of us I wholeheartedly believe that many women are equally ambivalent None of us loves the thought of abortion Yet it will continue to be a reality legal or no as long as unwanted pregnancies continue to be a reality Whether a woman thinks of an early pregnancy as a little blob of formless protoplasm or a complete human being in miniature will determine her level of ambivalence However her right to choose should never be contested LEE ROTHBERG RN Matawan NJ
SCHOOLS' VIEWS SOUGHT ON PROPOSED VATICAN RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/28/us/schools-views-sought-on-proposed-vatican-rules.html,The Vatican is seeking educators comments on proposed rules designed to give the church greater control over what is taught and who teaches it in Roman Catholic colleges and universities around the world The draft says The ecclesial community feels the need that the Catholic character of her universities be more evident and powerful It then proposes rules for faculties for directing schools and for designing curriculums From American Catholic educators the response was nearunanimous opposition to many of the proposals especially those dealing with faculty hiring and promotion The paper says for example All teachers who are to be chosen nominated and promoted in accordance with the statutes are to be distinguished by academic and pedagogic ability as well as by doctrinal integrity and uprightness of life 28 Pages in the Report The 28page report Proposed Schema for a Pontifical Document on Catholic Universities was drafted by the Vaticans agency for overseeing Catholic education and was released in April 1985 In defining the relationship between the church and Catholic universities the document noted that the church had the power to strip schools of their designation as Catholic The Vatican circulated the proposals to the 550 Catholic colleges and universities in the world and invited them to respond In their replies the American Catholic educators assert that the proposed rules could threaten academic freedom and jeopardize their schools independence by imposing outside restrictions on professors and curriculums Some American educators also contend that adherence to the proposals could jeopardize Federal aid to their colleges Close to Unanimous He Says David Johnson associate director of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities which is coordinating American responses said the reaction was close to unanimously opposed The proposals could be a lot of trouble a real lot of trouble he said In a response last month the association summed up the objections of American schools and called for wide revisions The association includes 235 schools about 40 percent of all the Catholic institutions of higher education in the world The most criticism Mr Johnson said focused on the proposals on hiring and promotion of faculty members Mandate Is Specified As well as calling for the use of doctrinal and moral standards in evaluating teachers the paper says Those who teach theological studies in any institute of higher studies must have a mandate from the competent ecclesiastical authority One question those provisions raise according to Roger L Flakey professor of English at Georgetown is whether a theology professors mandate could be withdrawn if he or she favored legal abortion or use of artificial means of birth control In such a case Professor Flakey said the competent ecclesiastical authority might demand a tenured professors dismissal while the school could feel compelled to honor the professors tenure Incident at Catholic University In a recent incident the Vatican ordered the Rev Charles E Curran a theology professor at the Catholic University of America to retract his views on birth control and other issues or lose his church approval to teach If Father Curran lost this approval he would be barred from teaching in the theology department at the university The Vatican can exercise such control over the theology philosophy and canon law departments of Catholic University because it is chartered by the Vatican itself Mr Johnson said But he said that if the proposals were adopted they would extend the Vaticans authority to these departments in all other Catholic schools A professor at Georgetown or Notre Dame could run into exactly the same problem that Charlie Curran has Mr Johnson said Michael Garvey a spokesman for Notre Dame said that the proposals were opaque and that it was not clear whether the churchs control over the curriculum in Catholic universities generally could extend to all disciplines or only to theology philosophy and canon law Others have also worried that the church has attempted to control differing views too rigidly An advertisement in the March 2 issue of The New York Times for instance condemned church reprisals against academics and activists who took positions contrary to the Vaticans The 1000 Catholics who signed the advertisement said such incidents were having a chilling affect on academic freedom in Catholic colleges Further Antagonism Feared That prospect worries educators in those universities who complain that adoption of the new document could further antagonize Catholics already concerned about academic freedom in the church Its difficult to resolve this tension between a Catholic university as a place of inquiry and as a representative of a larger body said Mr Garvey Mr Garvey said the document was full of fluffy statements about what it is to be a Catholic university For example he said a statement that the curriculum should always take Catholic teaching into account was not clear Is there a Catholic way to teach nuclear physics he asked A New School Supports Draft One school that has officially expressed its support for the proposals is Christendom College a nineyearold Catholic school in Front Royal Va Robert C Rice the academic dean of Christendom acknowledged that the school was almost alone but he said he thought other Catholic institutions were trying to have their cake and eat it too They dont want to be bound by Catholic doctrine but they still want to call themselves Catholic schools Mr Rice said The document says No university even if it is in fact Catholic may bear the title Catholic university except by the consent of the competent ecclesiastical authority That provision according to Mr Johnson would give power to an authority outside the university which most schools would be reluctant to do since the universities tell the Government that their boards act as the final decisionmakers He said schools need to make such a pledge when they accept Federal financial aid But Damian P Fedoryka president of Christendom College disagreed A Catholic school making a commitment to accept the counsel of an ecclesiastical authority he said would not jeopardize its Government financial aid because the board itself would voluntarily accept the authority of the church rather than the churchs exerting its authority over an unwilling board Constitutional Context Cited There were differing opinions among educators about why the church was circulating such a document now Some cited the conflict between church and state in the Soviet bloc others saw a drift of American schools toward more secular education as the cause Others said the proposals were not out of line with Pope John Paul IIs wishes to make the church more orthodox The Rev William J Byron president of Catholic University of America said he believed any final draft would have to take account of the concerns of American schools The constitutional context would have to be respected he said But Father Byron said it might be impossible to draft a single statement to encompass the differing situations of American universities and those in countries such as Poland The differences will be aired at a conference in Rome tentatively scheduled for late this year or early in 1987 Mr Johnson said

RELIGIOUS BOOKS: SEVEN THAT MADE A DIFFERENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/books/religious-books-seven-that-made-a-difference.html,THE religious revival confronting us is    primarily a literary tourdeforce having very little to do with American life as a whole William Phillips the editor of Partisan Review wrote in his magazines 1950 symposium Religion and the Intellectuals It was a rash claim and not just because the postwar revival ended up reaching well beyond those who had heard of T S Eliot In a religious tradition that has been obsessed with texts ever since the Ten Commandments literary tours de force should not be taken lightly In fact religion in the West has gone in large measure by the book This is not just a matter of the Book of Exodus and the Epistle to the Romans or of St Thomas Aquinass Summa Theologica and John Calvins Institutes of the Christian Religion There are also the lesser texts  the saints lives and the tracts and the popular theologies that capture a particular place and time and then quietly fade away It is these above all that enable us to trace our common spiritual life Which are the texts that signify the most Of making many books there is no end says Ecclesiastes And no formula exists to pick the key ones out Number of copies sold influence regardless of sales capacity to convey a current wisdom  all are relevant considerations In the end however it comes down to deciding on the religious story that is there to tell Since World War II American religious sensibilities have run a winding course What follows are seven books that seem to mark it out Near the top of the bestseller list on Easter Sunday in 1949 was the autobiography of a sensitive young man with literary ambitions A dust jacket testimonial from the Rev Fulton J Sheen the monsignor of the airways proclaimed it a twentiethcentury form of the Confessions of St Augustine and indeed Thomas Mertons Seven Storey Mountain bore some resemblance to that granddaddy of spiritual autobiographies Like St Augustine carousing his student days away in fourthcentury Carthage Merton had succumbed to such physical and intellectual debaucheries as New York offered a Columbia undergraduate in the 1930s wine women and some Communist fellowtraveling I had refused to pay any attention to the moral laws upon which all our vitality and sanity depend he wrote I had at last become a true child of the modern world    In devouring pleasures and joys I had found distress and anguish and fear A LONGING for religion together with the discovery of medieval literature and philosophy led him first to become a convert to Roman Catholicism and then to leave the world entirely and become a monk The Christians are right the pagans are wrong sang the 11thcentury Song of Roland the similarly blunt paean Merton raised to Catholicism triumphant was a far cry from the more ecumenical spirit of his later years His book nonetheless exerted a more than Catholic appeal in the age of anxiety Its title referred to the seven levels of purgatory through which Dantes tarnished souls had to struggle upward to Paradise Mertons personal journey up from the leftish godless 30s was only one of many Among his fellow journeyers was Will Herberg the prewar Marxist theorist who became a postwar theologian A Jewish disciple of Americas leading Protestant pundit Reinhold Niebuhr Herberg prescribed prophetic faith as the cure for the secular idolatries of the time above all Communism and in 1955 he published Protestant Catholic Jew which he called an essay in religious sociology and in which he examined how such faith was faring in the United States Herberg contended that ethnic divisions among Americans were disappearing for good leaving behind only the triple melting pot of his books title At a time when largescale immigration was thought to have ceased and when ethnic particularity was less celebrated than it would come to be this reformulation of American pluralism was both plausible and pleasing What tensions there were among the churches Herberg attributed merely to the transition from a Protestant nation to a threereligion country a common anchorage in the American way of life would prevent religious conflict from getting out of hand He was less sanguine however about the prospects for faith itself Like other neoorthodox religious thinkers Herberg saw America as at once the most religious and the most secular of nations  enthusiastically churchgoing yet showing little evidence of actually living its several faiths But wasnt this just what made for pluralistic toleration Yes he said but what he hoped for was a deeper JudeoChristian bond Needed to transform the inner character of American religion this authentic JewishChristian faith had less to fear from overt and avowed unbelief than from the secularized piety of the contemporary religious revival With the characteristic ambivalence of social thought in the 50s Protestant Catholic Jew a book of religious sociology in the prophetic mode ended up deploring the very way of life it had pronounced benign A decade later Herbergs neoorthodox conundrums were swept away by another socioprophetic book The Secular City by Harvey Cox In ebullient tones Mr Cox announced the good news that secularization far from being the enemy of religion represented an authentic consequence of biblical faith Christians he said should support and nourish a process that disenchanted nature desacralized politics and deconsecrated values Growing up in rural Pennsylvania had immunized Mr Cox to Protestant nostalgia for smalltown churchly community In his book he celebrated technopolis where the living was free and mobile and the style pragmatic and profane The church to be where the action is as he put it needed to behave accordingly  coolly promoting social progress while exorcising prejudice and hidebound unsecular thinking Mr Cox did not go as far as the radical theologians who had recently made headlines by proclaiming the death of God Softening the proclamation he merely declared a moratorium on God talk Since in the secular city the political was replacing the metaphysical as the characteristic mode of grasping reality it was only right for religious folk to drop theology and pick up urbanology But Mr Cox like many a liberal professor in 1965 was less clear than he thought about the whereabouts of the action His neosocial gospel for the New Frontier looked backward not forward By that time the mainstream reformism of the civil rights movement was already turning disconcertingly radical And when it came to grasping reality in the late 60s the metaphysical mode proved not so uncharacteristic after all In 1968 the year the decade finally dislocated itself the University of California Press brought out an ethnography unique in the annals of American academic publishing  Carlos Castanedas Teachings of Don Juan In it a graduate student in anthropology at the University of California at Los Angeles goes off to the Southwest to research a thesis on medicinal herbs and meets a Yaqui Indian said to be very learned in peyote The Indian who turns out to be a sorcerer eventually accepts the student as his apprentice Instructed in the preparation and use of several hallucinogenic plants the student encounters a realm of nonordinary reality where among other things he experiences several theophanic visions of Mescalito peyotes personification In the end he terminates his quest to become a man of knowledge when it threatens to persuade him of the actual existence of this separate reality BEING the diligent doctoral candidate he is the student cannot abandon his skeptical Western self Did this or that apparently impossible thing really happen to me You cannot think like that he is told such a question makes no sense Near the end of his fouryear apprenticeship he smokes a mushroom mixture and becoming a crow flies alongside three silvery birds His master pronounces these birds the only thing of great value in the entire experience What was so special about them They were just birds Not just birds  they were crows Were they white crows don Juan    Why did their feathers look silvery Because you were seeing as a crow sees A bird that looks dark to us looks white to a crow William James in a famous image once likened the demonstration of spiritualism to upsetting the law that all crows are black It is enough if you prove one single crow to be white Now it looked as if finding the white crow required not Jamesian science but an altered state of consciousness Was the Yaqui sorcerer engaging in subtle repartee with the spirit of the Harvard professor Not exactly for Mr Castanedas ethnographic enterprise was in reality a fiction General recognition of this however took some time Mr Castaneda received his PhD for the third Don Juan volume Journey to Ixtlan in 1973 Meanwhile the mythical don acquired millions of vicarious followers eager to keep up with his creatordisciples trips outside the reality of President Nixons America At the same time Mr Castaneda was leading the way into the brave new world of psychedelic anthropology another figure on the UCLA campus was busy adapting his own calling to the age of Aquarius A staff member of the local Campus Crusade for Christ Hal Lindsey worked his own teachings up into a small volume in 1970 Though scarcely noticed at publication by even the evangelical press The Late Great Planet Earth became the bestselling book of the decade with scores of printings ultimately churning out close to 16 million copies IT was a tale of biblical prophecy told in countercultural vernacular and it went like this Soon the Israelis will rebuild the Temple in Jerusalem and conclude a treaty with the dictator of the Revived Roman Empire also known as the Antichrist All saved Christians will then be seized into heaven The Rapture or Jesus ultimate trip whereupon there will be a sevenyear period of tribulation involving first the invasion of Israel by an ArabAfrican conspiracy headed by Egypt followed by an invasion by the Russian confederacy Russia and its allies will then be destroyed with Roman tactical nuclear weapons and shortly thereafter the climactic battle of Armageddon will commence between the forces of the empire and a 200millionman Chinese Army Before humanity succeeds in destroying itself Jesus will come to earth for the second time along with the enraptured saints and establish his 1000year reign Then after a brief rebellion by Satan final judgment will occur So says the Bible Known technically as dispensational premillennialism this way of envisioning the end times had been worked out and debated for a century in fundamentalist circles with the latest current events always being brought into prophetic line It was a smug antiestablishment creed predicated on the utter corruption of all but the small remnant of the saved and in the postwar period it had lost ground to the more inclusive evangelicalism of the Rev Billy Graham and his associates at Christianity Today While Israels capture of Jerusalem during the SixDay War  which seemed to bring nearer the requisite renewal of Temple sacrifice  may have helped restore the waning influence of dispensational theology that cannot come close to explaining the popularity of Mr Lindseys book Perhaps it was simply the prospect of getting off the planet as quickly as possible away from Cambodia and Saigon Watergate and OPEC from the Rev Jim Jones and the Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini In the 70s you didnt have to be bornagain to reach for notions of Apocalypse Now And if as it seems the country was passing through a crisis of legitimacy that too was indicated in The Late Great Planet Earth It is clear Mr Lindsey wrote that the United States cannot be the leader of the West in the future Thanks to student rebellion Communist subversion and wholesale moral decay America would in all likelihood be relegated to a mere appendage of the Roman Antichrist The counterstroke came in 1980 with the Rev Jerry Falwells Listen America For while that author was also a dispensationalist he was in no way interested in throwing in the national towel His book began to be sure by emphasizing how Americas sinful ways had brought her to the brink of ruin But then in the tradition of the American jeremiad it proceeded to call for the repentance and revival that would return the land to its original moral purity God has blessed this nation because in its early days she sought to honor God and the Bible the inerrant Word of the living God Mr Falwell wrote Denouncing the sin meant promoting the mission for just as our Founding Fathers firmly believed that America had a special destiny in the world so Mr Falwell believed that America with more Godfearing citizens per capita than any other nation on earth was the last logical base for world evangelization City on a Hill New Jerusalem Light Unto the Gentiles  here was a gospel for the Reagan dispensation It was also a political tract the platform of a new political organization Mr Falwell had created Moral Majority Inc to weld Biblebelieving Christians and other moral Americans into a force capable of putting the country back on a firm biblical footing Listen America told what that task required a strengthened patriarchal family with no new rights for women children or homosexuals no abortion tougher restrictions on pornography and drugs increased military spending and premillennially unwavering support for the State of Israel Politicians were to be judged by how their votes measured up on this set of issues Mr Falwell knew that his Baptist brethren had long been skittish about mixing religion and politics but now it was either stand up and be counted or face the children when they asked Mom and Dad where were you the day freedom died in America Four years later with the religious right an established fact of American life Richard John Neuhaus posed a neoconservative version of this question in The Naked Public Square Repudiating the original prophecies of Herberg and Mr Cox he judged JudeoChristian faith alive and well in the population at large and called the secular city a myth But between the disappearance of mainline Protestantisms cultural hegemony and recent secularizing rulings of the courts religion had lost its voice in the affairs of state Democracy a fragile and imperiled artifice requires that voice he argued for without a transcendent or religious point of reference conflicts of values cannot be resolved Where were you the day democracy fell apart in America MR NEUHAUS a Lutheran theologian who had won his political spurs opposing the Vietnam War harked back to the liberal intellectuals who just after World War II worried that democracy without religion could not inspire American citizens to a defense of the West As he beckoned faith back into the public square however he was notably unspecific about what it was supposed to do  possibly because on any particular issue the JudeoChristian consensus is not so easily determined The question of abortion his prime exhibit for a current unresolved conflict of values is clearly not settled by either Scripture or JudeoChristian history Yet what Mr Neuhaus finally seemed to be calling for was less a set of JudeoChristian policy recommendations than the reestablishment of a shared world of moral discourse The moral majoritarians had kicked a tripwire alerting us all to what it means to abandon a religiously based moral common denominator Has common moral discourse really become impossible in mid80s America Is the American democracy really so at risk Mr Neuhaus tended to assert rather than demonstrate his central claim But if the religious revival confronting us is not primarily a moral majoritarian tour de force then The Naked Public Square will have expressed something larger in American life as a whole Someday a book will mark that out too
OMAHA ASKS IF AN UNWED MOTHER CAN BE A FIT ROLE MODEL FOR TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/us/omaha-asks-if-an-unwed-mother-can-be-a-fit-role-model-for-teen-agers.html,To the officers of the Omaha Girls Club it was a question of propriety They felt that Crystal Chambers a parttime arts and crafts teacher could not be a good role model for teenage members when she became pregnant out of wedlock So they dismissed her To Miss Chambers it was a question of discrimination She contended that as a black woman she was unjustly dismissed by the clubs predominantly white board So she filed a multimilliondollar suit against the club alleging that her civil rights had been violated The Girls Club a private nonprofit group founded in 1975 serves more than 10000 girls most of them black at two centers in Omaha Nearly 60 percent of the clubs staff is black What began five years ago as a labor dispute there is now part of a national debate over teenage pregnancy The debate intensified earlier this month when a Federal district Judge in Omaha ruled that the club had acted within its rights in dismissing Miss Chambers The evidence has shown that the Girls Club did not intentionally discriminate against the plaintiff and that the policy is related to the Girls Clubs central purpose of fostering growth and maturity of young girls wrote Judge C Arlen Beam On Wednesday attorneys for Miss Chambers filed an appeal in the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit One Lawyers Experience The case has sharply divided Omaha Nebraskas biggest and most ethnically diverse city There are those who see Miss Chambers who finished two years of college and was scheduled for a promotion to a fulltime position at the time of her dismissal as a positive role model Others felt the club acted within its rights in dismissing her Anything short of that they argued would be tantamount to condoning her pregnancy at a time when the club was trying to send an opposite message to teenage girls One of Miss Chamberss lawyers is Mary Kay Green a former City Council member who helped found the Girls Club in the early 1970s She said she chose to represent Miss Chambers because of the discrimination she herself faced years ago after bearing twins out of wedlock No one is saying teens should become pregnant Miss Green said in a telephone interview from her office in Omaha But rather than punishing those who do we should be finding ways to help them Miss Green noted that according to national projections nearly 70 percent of black women will have babies out of wedlock Judge Beams decision she said has the effect of rescinding Federal legislation barring discrimination in employment as it applies to black women Our First Responsibility There were 2636 babies born to teenagers in Omaha in 1983 the latest year for which figures are available Less than 3 percent of the teenagers giving birth that year were married The Girls Club proposed its policy against unwed employees who are pregnant in 1981 and adopted it in March 1982 A month later Miss Chambers told center officials she was pregnant She was told that in accordance with the new policy she would have to leave when her pregnancy became obvious Miss Chambers was the first employee to be dismissed under the new rule and there has been one other since We considered the impact the policy would have on employees said Mary Heng executive director of the club But we felt our first responsibility was to the clubs members Many of these teenagers look up to our staff and turn to them for advice and direction What message are we sending out if we dont set a proper model for these girls But some charge that the club failed to consider the consequences of its policy Dr Harriette McAdoo a professor of sociology at Howard University who was a trial witness for Miss Chambers argued that the policy was hardly likely to reduce the rate of teenage pregnancy and if anything would force women such as Miss Chambers into poverty The only option for these women she asserted was abortion Depending on Welfare If a girl became pregnant the only way to keep her job was by having an abortion said Dr McAdoo The only other solution was for the girl to resign from her job and go on welfare to support herself and her child Those who knew Miss Chambers who is now 27 described her as one of the most popular teachers at the club Since her dismissal she has worked infrequently and has lived mainly off welfare payments Miss Heng who described herself as a feminist said the clubs staff members and directors had carefully considered the implications of the policy and intended to stick by it Robert D Mullin Jr the Girls Clubs attorney said in his closing trial arguments that the Chambers case could be viewed as a conflict of interest While Miss Chambers did not actively express the view that outofwedlock pregnancies were acceptable he said her actions did that This message is at odds with the clubs mission said Mr Mullin When the mission conflicts with the treatment of employees rights then the rights of the employees come second
HAVING IT ALL IS TOO MUCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/30/books/having-it-all-is-too-much.html,A LESSER LIFE The Myth of Womens Liberation in America By Sylvia Ann Hewlett Illustrated 461 pp New York William Morrow  Company 1795 A YOUNG lawyer friend of mine once worked out this response to the prospective employers query whether marriage might conflict with her fasttrack career Im so glad you asked I believe that men have struck a perfect balance between personal and professional lives Reasonable accommodation of private lives Nonsense Humanization of the work world Who needs it Ive made it clear to my friends and family that love affection friendship and human emotion play a small role in the life of a real professional And what if the interviewer asks about children Not to worry Test tube babies for me That way I can wait until Im 40 50 even 60 before I start a family until my career is really well established Im no fool Sylvia Ann Hewlett the vice president for economic studies at the United Nations Association the author of The Cruel Dilemmas of Development and the mother of four children describes superwomen with a good deal less humor She relates powerful personal stories of women herself and others and puts these poignant stories in a social and historical context These women seek success in careers conceived on the assumption that every professional man has a wife to entertain for him ghostwrite for him and maintain a haven from the heartless world At the same time these women seek to be wives and good mothers in a world in which good mothering  extending to the childs future SAT scores  demands sophisticated art and science and a lot of time Women who want all this confront dismal choices They can singlemindedly pursue a career given the job market and persistent sexism however odds are great that their career will not be what they had hoped They can devote themselves to family though that course is both emotionally and financially precarious Or if they are truly selfindulgent they can try to do it all and live without sleep or the satisfaction of ever doing anything as well as they could Sylvia Hewlett addresses fundamental feminist concerns Feminists with a materialist view of society argue that the momathome dadatwork arrangement persists because it meets the needs of our prevailing economic order  employers needs for flexibility are better met by a worker who has no major obligations outside the workplace These feminists argue that changes in the economic order are absolutely necessary for sexbased equality But other feminists argue that women are trapped in these impossible choices because notions of gender stress the virtues of connection and nurturing in women and independence and economic achievement in men This group seeks to enhance the social and economic value attached to the work of caring for the young and old and vulnerable that has traditionally been assigned to women Still other feminists surely the vast majority  struggle in a thousand intellectual and material ways to create accommodations that would give women what men have always assumed is their due as human beings  a measure of satisfaction in both love and work Drawing on a wealth of anecdotal evidence the author suggests that the claim that women can have it all is responsible for the impossible choices facing women today Ordinary women she asserts see feminists as traitors because they undermine the traditional familysupport systems for other women and their children But blaming feminists for such destruction is simply incomprehensible if only because they dont have that kind of political and economic power Have feminists encouraged men to leave their wives and children for younger less demanding women Promoted the notion that it is all right for men to ignore basic obligations of financial and emotional support for their children Prevented women  and increasingly men  from earning a salary sufficient to support a family in minimal decency The author also asserts for example that many feminists think that a woman has less right to a leave [from her job] for childbirth than if she were incapacitated in a skiing accident I know no feminist who subscribes to this proposition and women throughout the land have struggled to persuade employers legislators and courts that the needs peculiar to women  including pregnant women whether they want an abortion or a baby  must not be subject to discrimination or treated as less important than the needs they share with men Feminists support extending health insurance including leaves  to pregnant women AS a remedy for the conflict she sees between the demands of home and wage market Sylvia Hewlett proposes that feminists ally themselves with organized labor to create a just and equitable world for women She asserts that such a world now exists in Western Europe although feminists there are far more skeptical than she that paradise has been achieved Certainly such an alliance makes sense When the Supreme Court despite the arguments of womens rights activists held that discrimination against pregnant women is not sexbased it was a coalition of feminists and organized labor that persuaded Congress to amend the Federal antidiscrimination law to make plain that discrimination on the basis of pregnancy is discrimination on the basis of sex But the validity of this suggestion will not undo the damage A Lesser Life is likely to cause Problems of sexism run deep and strike close to home An analysis claiming that feminists are responsible for the impossible choices confronting women and all people today is comforting particularly to those who have no interest in change It is also wrong
JOHN PAUL ASSAILS DEALERS OF DEATH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/03/31/world/john-paul-assails-dealers-of-death.html,Pope John Paul II in a passionate but somber Easter message assailing human callousness declared today that man has often made death the method of his existence on earth Denouncing terrorism torture war and abortion John Paul told a crowd of 200000 people in St Peters Square that man unfortunately resigns himself to death and not only accepts it but inflicts it Men continually inflict death upon others he said people who are often unknown innocent people people not yet born The Pope also reiterated his invitation to the leaders of all the worlds religions to meet in Assisi the home of St Francis this fall to pray together and work toward a common program for peace The Victory of Life It will be an opportunity to reaffirm before man terrified by the threats of death our commitment to the victory of life he told the crowd which overflowed the square down the Via della Conciliazione which runs into the sqaure and off to side streets The Popes litany of evil was tempered by a message of hope and by a brilliant spring day that brought out a festive flagwaving crowd called forth from many nations After delivering his traditional message called Urbi et Orbi to the City and the World John Paul in golden vestments issued Easter greetings in 49 languages including Hebrew Arabic Russian Bulgarian and Swahili The Pope who visited India last month also offered his wishes in three of Indias main languages Hindi Tamil and Malayalam The ceremony preceded by an Easter mass was attended by Secretary of State George P Shultz an Episcopalian and his wife Helena who is Roman Catholic The Pope received them in a private audience on Saturday The Shultzes left for the United States this afternoon In his address John Paul spoke of violence as the product of a human failure to look beyond this life to the transcendent No Immortality on Earth Man resigns himself to death when he aspires only to the things of the earth when he seeks only those things he said The earth alone does not conceal within itself the leaven of immortality Man not only resigns himself to death but he has ofen made death the method of his existence on earth he declared his robes billowing in the breeze Is not the method of death found in the method of violence the method of the bloody conquest of power the method of selfish accumulation of wealth the method of the struggle against poverty that thrives on hatred and the longing for revenge the method of intimidation and the abuse of power the method of torture and terror the Pope asked The passage appeared to prefigure the Vaticans new document on the theology of liberation expected to be released this week The document is expected to denounce inequalities that foster suffering among the poor while virtually ruling out violence in the pursuit of social change The Pope said that the resurrection of Jesus from death the core of Christian belief was itself his uprising against death a sign that God does not resign himself to mans death Gods challenge to man he said is the great challenge of peace

JOSEPH KENNEDY GETS A WIDER FIELD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/us/joseph-kennedy-gets-a-wider-field.html,The Democratic primary for Congress in the Eighth District of Massachusetts is months away but the field of candidates which once numbered more than a dozen is thinning rapidly In recent weeks three state legislators a member of the Boston City Council and a South End lawyer have withdrawn The reason can be summed up in a name Joseph P Kennedy 2d Mr Kennedy 33 years old the eldest son of Robert F Kennedy is considered so far ahead that opponents have been giving thought to whether the race is worth the effort I got out because I wasnt going to win State Reprresentative Thomas Vallely said of his withdrawal two weeks ago after spending almost 400000 on his campaign It adds up to a matter of realism 3 Others Are Given the Edge Nine candidates remain but on the basis of polls according to people in political circles three contenders are most likely to challenge Mr Kennedy for an appreciable share of votes They are State Senator George Bachrach Melvin King the runnerup in the citys last mayoral election and James Roosevelt Jr a lawyer who is a grandson of Franklin D Roosevelt Bunched behind them are Robert Cappucci Robert OConnell Thomas Gallagher Carla Johnston and George Spiegel The feeling in political circles now is that pressure will increase on those remaining to clarify their positions As the race focuses down the debate will become sharper said Mr Roosevelt who is 40 years old Even though the filing deadline is June 3 and the primary election is Sept 16 news organizations and the candidates are already polling voters The results indicate that Mr Kennedys lead is sizable A Third of the Vote in Polls Various surveys showed that he had at least a third of the votes when there were more candidates in the race No other contender had even 20 percent A plurality not a majority is needed for nomination Not one to take victory for granted there are twothirds out there who arent with me as a first choice or havent made up their minds Mr Kennedy said  he announced last week that he had the endorsement of five members of the Boston Celtics He has chosen to make his first bid for elective office by seeking the seat being vacated by Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr the Speaker of the House The Eighth District is the one where his uncle John F Kennedy won his first election for Congress in 1946 Range of the Eighth District The district which includes part of Boston straddles the Charles River embracing Arlington Belmont Cambridge Somerville Waltham and Watertown It is so much a Democratic stronghold that little attention is being paid to the Republican primary in which Clark C Abt a Cambridge consultant is a leading contender Most of the Democratic candidates say they consider themselves to the left of Joseph Kennedy in a district where liberal predilections evoke Manhattans Upper West Side Probably on the emotional issues most of them are to my left Mr Kennedy said Im reluctantly prochoice on abortion and I think judges and juries should have the right to impose the death penalty But on economic issues which are most important to me Im as strongly or more in favor of aiding the elderly and the poor as anyone A litmus test in the district is the question of United States aid to the rebels fighting the Sandinista Government of Nicaragua All the leading contenders including Mr Kennedy oppose such aid But I probably differ with them on El Salvador where I favor military aid Mr Kennedy said of his opponents I qualify that by saying there should be no bombing of civilians and Duarte should have control over the military Strategies of His Rivals Each of Mr Kennedys three major opponents has a specific strategy Mr Bachrach 34 whose constituency as a threeterm State Senator includes about a third of the voters in the Congressional district emphasizes that he is an established votegetter with a record of service to the district There will be a contrast in issues as Mr Kennedy continues to move to the right where his constituency is Mr Bachrach said I will hold fast to my progressive constituency where I have always been Mr King 57 who was a State Representative for 10 years before he ran for mayor says he is best qualified to empower the people He said he would organize his constituency to take an active role in dealing with issues such as improving the economy of the region and obtaining peace in the Middle East He also favors cutting the military budget by one third Mr Roosevelt said he planned to try to engage Mr Kennedy in a debate on specific issues including campaign financing and tax policy Mr Roosevelt said he was gratified by polls showing that recognition of his name had doubled among voters in the last two months but he concedes that it is an uphill battle to get Roosevelt as widely recognized as Kennedy After all were in Massachusetts Mr Roosevelt said
CONNECTICUT OPINION; WAITING OUT A PREGNANCY SCARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/nyregion/connecticut-opinion-waiting-out-a-pregnancy-scare.html,EVERY morning during those long tumultuous days when I was convinced I was pregnant I woke with two images One was of a child of about 8 years old shouting as he climbed an endless green slope and then just as he reached the top vanishing like a character in a Bergman movie into white nightgownlike shadows The other image was of a thimblesized embryo with eyes fingers knees and toes curled up like some precious but forgotten ring in a wad of cotton at the bottom of a hospital trash bin Almost daily the man whose child I thought I was carrying telephoned me from England Across 3000 miles of ocean our voices slightly delayed as they bounced off satellites swirling in the heavens we discussed the options If the test was positive and I decided to have an abortion he would fly to Connecticut to be with me You shouldnt have to go through this alone he said gently He insisted on paying for it  489 which I didnt have I was moved and touched In the long scratchy pauses I asked myself the obvious but still forbidding question Would not such a caring man make a good father even a good husband About the other option about having the child we spoke only obliquely We had known each other a little over a month We met by chance at a pub in Oxford He was teaching a summer course at Oriel College I was vacationing in England For three delirious weeks we were together almost steadily  boating along the Thames watching outdoor productions of Shakespeare lying for hours among the hollyhocks in the Christ Church meadow reading poetry Though we spoke vaguely of meeting again  he lived and worked in Illinois  we sensed that our romance would vanish as swiftly as the bright red poppies that burst forth each day in the verdant English fields and are gone the next morning Neither of us imagined that our midsummer nights dream would fade into this the burningly serious business of bringing new life into the world life that would thrust both of us toward a dark and uncertain future I grew terrified Terrified to have the child Terrified not to Late at night I poured over books on childbirth I stared at enlarged photos of cells embryos and fetuses I learned to my astonishment that a 3weekold embryo is onetenth of an inch long that it already has a heart that beats a brain with two lobes the beginning of a spinal chord a vigorous circulatory system I learned that at two months when most abortions are performed the embryo has a human face with eyes ears nose lips and tongue that it even has the distinctive nevertobeduplicated palm prints that form a tiny M on the hand Although I had always believed that abortion was a womans legal and inalienable right for the first time I considered the disturbing alternative The embryo was a miniature human creature to destroy it was to destroy something miraculous an awesomely complex bit of dancing pulsing life As I passed the familiar but now portentous sight of women wheeling babies in shopping carts at the supermarket there were moments of panic I was 31 My childbearing years were diminishing And even though the glossy magazines at the checkout counters promised otherwise  Mother 45 Gives Birth to Healthy Triplets  I knew there would come a time when my body like the magic hen in Jack and the Beanstalk would no longer lay its splendid golden eggs I remembered what my mother said to me years ago when I told her in a moment of feminist rage that I had no intention of having children and ruining my life as she had ruined hers I remembered her answer given on a lazy summer afternoon the day before I went off to college gently steadily and with a certitude I didnt know she possessed Having you and Heidi was the best thing I ever did Ive never regretted it for one second Youve been the greatest joy of my life Biology is destiny How often we feminists had fumed over that Freudian bit of humbuggery But now counting the days until my pregnancy test I considered the implications of refusing to permit my body to fulfill itself Never to be a mother Never to see my own eyes hair and smile reflected in the gaze of my child Never to treasure the moment when my child utters his first word takes his first step sings his first song Never to witness and relive all the poetry of childhood  the climbing of trees the skipping of stones To say to my mother and her mother and her mother before her all of whom I carry within me like a shell whose patterns bear witness to centuries of waves to say to these generations No Not to continue Days later when the pregnancy test came back negative I felt both relieved and infinitely sad Relieved because I was freed of the agony of having to choose Sad because life might not say yes to me again
VATICAN BACKS STRUGGLE BY POOR TO END INJUSTICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/06/world/vatican-backs-struggle-by-poor-to-end-injustice.html,The Vatican today issued its longawaited document on Christian Freedom and Liberation a defense of the right of the poor to struggle against injustice and a warning against totalitarianism and revolutions that lead to new forms of slavery The 59page instruction was issued at a news conference at which Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger its principal author said its goal was to update Roman Catholic social teaching with an eye more to ethical than political ends The document seeks a balance between criticisms of unbridled capitalism and of Marxism It includes a strong defense of the right of the oppressed to revolt  even as a last resort to use armed struggle to put an end to an obvious and prolonged tyranny But it repeatedly warns that movements seemingly aimed at liberation and decolonization can degenerate into tyrannies which scoff at human rights with impunity The people thus reduced to powerlessness the document said merely have a change of masters Situations of grave injustice require the courage to make farreaching reforms and to suppress unjustifiable privileges But those who discredit the path of reform and favor the myth of revolution it says not only foster the illusion that the abolition of an evil situation is in itself sufficient to create a more humane society they also encourage the setting up of totalitarian regimes The document is important as one of the most comprehensive and authoritative statements of Pope John Paul IIs pontificate on social and political questions It carries the Popes formal approval and his aides said he had reviewed it carefully The statement comes at a time of intense debate in the church over what its political role should be and how it should interpret the Christian Gospels strong statements on behalf of the poor In recent years Catholics  notably in the Philippines and Nicaragua have played a central role in social movements that overthrew dictatorial regimes The church or segments of it have also been active against the Governments in Poland Chile South Korea and other countries In the United States the Roman Catholic bishops have taken strong stands on nuclear war and economic issues as well as abortion Cardinal Ratzinger the prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith and one of the leading critics of the theology of liberation had promised the new document when he released a searing critique of liberation theology 18 months ago Uses Word Liberation Although the document repeatedly used the word liberation it made no specific references to liberation theologians More than a third of it was taken up with discussion of the nature of God the religious meaning of freedom and the role of personal sin as the root of human alienation In doing so Vatican officials said the document was indirectly warning against a tendency it considers prevalent among some leftwing Christians to transform Christs teachings into a primarily political message Its hardly a minority view that religion has something to do with God said the Rev Thomas J Herron a Philadelphian who is on Cardinal Ratzingers staff This document is simply insisting on what should have been obvious for the last 15 years that liberation theology should above all be theology Father Herron added The Holy See is trying to divert the tendency in some theologians to collapse theology into politics Defense From Latin America Advocates of liberation theology argue that they are not primarily concerned with politics and that they have strengthed the churchs commitment to social and political justice They have often said the Pope and Cardinal Ratzinger see Marxism purely in Eastern European terms and lack an understanding of Latin America Cardinal Ratzingers article seems to come from a European who reads European phenomena and tendencies into a nonEuropean context wrote the Rev Juan Luis Segundo a leading advocate of the theology in a reply to Cardinal Ratzingers first document The Vatican document today included several pointed warnings against any social doctrines that seemed to limit the churchs concern to the poor alone or that encouraged the struggle of one class against another in order to eliminate the foe In declaring the churchs love of preference for the poor the document added The special option for the poor far from being a sign of particularism or sectarianism manifests the universality of the churchs being and mission This option excludes no one The very phrase love of preference for the poor was an attempt Vatican officials said to displace the phrase preferential option for the poor which is the rallying cry of the leftofcenter church in Latin America The latter phrase regarded in the Vatican as too overtly political emphasizes the churchs obligation to support the social struggles of the poor At another point the document makes a direct attack on the cultivation by leftwing movements of the peoples churches that often join the popular piety of the poor to leftwing political action The Sandinista Government in Nicaragua has supported these movements within Catholicism angering the Pope who sees it as an effort to divide the church The document praised the religious devotions of the poor saying It is the poor the object of Gods special love who understand best and as it were instinctively that the most radical liberation which is liberation from sin and death is the liberation accomplished by the death and resurrection of Christ Earthly Plan an Illusion Later on it added But it would be criminal to take the energies of popular piety and misdirect them toward a purely earthly plan of liberation which would very soon be revealed as nothing more than an illusion and a cause of new forms of slavery To do so the document said is to surrender to the ideologies of the world and to the alleged necessity of violence Cardinal Ratzinger declined in response to a question to say whether the passage specifically referred to Nicaragua He and his aides said it was a general reference to efforts to manipulate popular piety for political ends But the document also included language that all but endorsed the course taken in the Philippines by Jaime Cardinal Sin Archbishop of Manila Cardinal Sin led the church in nonviolent resistance to the Government of former President Ferdinand E Marcos In the section defending armed struggle the document said this should be only a last resort and added Indeed because of the continual development of the technology of violence and the increasingly serious dangers implied in its recourse that which today is termed passive resistance shows a way more comfortable to moral principles and having no less prospects for success

WNET REFUSES TO AIR PBS PROGRAM ON ISRAEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/09/movies/wnet-refuses-to-air-pbs-program-on-israel.html,A publictelevision program consisting of three films with sharply divergent views on the borders of Israel has stirred a heated dispute within public broadcasting Some stations including WNET in New York and WETA in Washington have refused to carry the broadcast scheduled for tonight That refusal prompted the head of news and public affairs for the Public Broadcasting Service to issue an unusual statement supporting the program and disagreeing with the stations not carrying it The program which has been criticized by the American Jewish Committee the national Jewish group that publishes the magazine Commentary is called Flashpoint  Israel and the Palestinians and is part of an experimental PBS series produced by station KQED in San Francisco The idea of the series its producers say is to present a sort of video OpEd page similar to that of a newspaper in which conflicting viewpoints openly biased compete for the viewers judgment The first installment in the series considered the subject of abortion and featured films produced by both sides of the abortion issue The Center of the Dispute The Flashpoint installment features two halfhour films produced by Israeli film makers and an hourlong film made by the American film maker David Koff Mr Koffs film called Occupied Palestine is at the center of the dispute Occupied Palestine presents a strongly antiIsraeli view of life under Israeli military rule in the West Bank and the Gaza Strip This is an opportunity for people who are living and have been living under military occupation to express their experiences and their perceptions of what it means to live under occupation and why they struggle against it Mr Koff said Of the 165 licensees in the PBS system only 6 stations are refusing to carry the program for content reasons according to Barry Chase the vice president for news and public affairs for PBS Of those WETA and WNET are the largest and according to the producers of the program serve the most important audiences It clearly takes away from the national importance of the broadcast not to be seen on WNET and WETA Mr Chase said Mr Koff accused WNET and WETA of a lack of nerve in refusing to air the program They dont want to take the heat he said But officials at both stations maintain that the films in the program especially Occupied Palestine are biased propagandistic and generally unworthy of air time All 3 Films Are Inferior All three films are inferior to anything we have aired previously on the subject of the West Bank and Gaza said Gerald Slater the vice president of WETA George L Miles the vice president of WNET said the station conferred with WETA on the matter and arrived at the same conclusion Were not ducking it said Mr Miles Were trying to present fair representative wellrounded programs And this is not it Beverly Ornstein the producer who assembled tonights package for KQED in San Francisco said WETA and WNET were missing the point of the series They say the films are biased and full of distortions Miss Ornstein said I say That is correct These are partisan films produced written and directed to portray a partisan point of view The purpose is to present a partisan forum to present partisan views in an unfiltered manner like an OpEd page on a newspaper  Some stations such as KTCA in Minneapolis disagree with the whole concept of partisan programming and plan not to carry any in the series WNET did not carry the abortion program but WETA did There certainly is a sensitivity here Miss Ornstein said Its one that I can understand and appreciate I know that some stations have been under some difficult pressure I understand that difficulty I hope though that weve provided the stations with an overall package so that its balanced and has perspective She was alluding to the fact that the three films were clearly identified as being strongly partisan LI and Jersey Broadcasts Although WNET is the major publictelevision outlet in the New York metropolitan area others in the region including the four of the New Jersey Public Broadcasting Authority and Channel 21 on Long Island will carry the broadcast tonight Were airing it because we feel were providing a valuable public service said Janice Oppenheimer a spokesman for Channel 21 In the Washington area the program will be carried by WHMM of Howard University considered the secondary publicbroadcasting station in the market David Gordis the executive vice president of the American Jewish Committee said his group had urged its local chapters to persuade their publictelevision stations not to run Flashpoint or failing that to replace Occupied Palestine
"ACROSS L.I. SOUND FROM SHOREHAM, A NUCLEAR PLANT IS MET WITH YAWNS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/12/nyregion/across-li-sound-from-shoreham-a-nuclear-plant-is-met-with-yawns.html,The people who live along this stretch of New England coastline have much in common with their neighbors in Suffolk and Nassau Counties just across Long Island Sound Residents of both shores enjoy sheltered harbors and sandy beaches On either side of the water are tackle shops offering shiners and sandworms and nautically named restaurants serving grog and grub Both areas also happen to have imposing new citadels of high technology perched by the sounds edge nuclear power plants that are completed and heading toward commercial operation That is where the similarity abruptly ends On Long Island citizen groups and many local politicians with the support of New Yorks Governor and United States Senators are strenuously opposing the opening of the Long Island Lighting Companys 46 billion 820megawatt Shoreham nuclear power station carrying out their fight in the courts and in the halls of government Shoreham has not yet received its license from the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and if its opponents prevail it never will By contrast here in Waterford where Northeast Utilities 382 billion 1150megawatt Millstone 3 nuclear power plant has been licensed and is to begin commercial operation within a few weeks the public reaction has been nonchalance People here are not in the least upset said First Selectman Lawrence J Bettencourt Waterfords chief elected official Its really not an issue Interviews with other residents of the area confirmed that view Im not worried and I certainly havent seen anybody selling their houses said Sheila Helgeson who works at A Thyme to Cook a gourmet shop And over at Mitchell College Charles McElaney a 23yearold life sciences major said Ive never really heard people talking about it Right now drinking and driving is the hot issue on campus Mr Bettencourt said nuclear power had not been debated in any local election that he could recall On Long Island however nuclear power ranks right along with abortion and defense spending as among the thorniest issues a politician faces Such divergences can be found from site to site across the United States experts on the nuclear industry say For example there has long been intense opposition to the opening of a nuclear plant in Seabrook NH while at the new Hope Creek plant in southern New Jersey its no big deal according to Lisa Salamon a spokesman for the plants owner the Public Service Electric and Gas Company Familiar With Nuclear Industries The explanations offered vary depending on who is asked Residents of Waterford and the surrounding towns point out that they have been living amid nuclear industries for a long time The Millstone 1 and Millstone 2 nuclear plants adjacent to Millstone 3 have been in commercial operation since 1970 and 1975 respectively Just up the Connecticut coast are a division of General Dynamics that builds nuclear submarines and a Navy nuclear submarine base Many military families live near the base as well as around the Coast Guard Academy in nearby New London Theres a lot of employment around here connected with nuclear power said Fran Moreno owner of the Made To Be Loved Doll Hospital in the neighboring community of Niantic within sight of Millstone 3 People have come to understand it and accept it It doesnt frighten us On Long Island by comparison chain reactions are currently occurring only at two small nuclear reactors used in physics research at the Brookhaven National Laboratory But Jeffrey Newman a public relations consultant and the vice president of the Coalition for Safe Living an umbrella organization of 35 groups opposed to Shoreham has other thoughts on why Long Island residents have not learned to stop worrying and love the nuclear reactor He argued that consciousnesses have been raised on the island in regard to the nuclear power issue largely because of the heated debate over the long delayed opening of the Lilco plant Shoreham received its construction permit 16 years ago this month Mr Newman along with other opponents of Shoreham also maintains that the peculiarities of Long Islands geography make the area particularly inappropriate for a nuclear power station People in Connecticut would at least have a fighting chance to get away in case of an accident he said But you cant evacuate this island If youve ever tried to go to New York from the Hamptons in summer you know theres no way youre going to move people rapidly out of the way of a plume of radiation leakage Proponents of nuclear power such as Anthony J Castagno a spokesman for Northeast Utilities counter that the chances of a nuclear accident that would require a wholesale evacuation are almost negligible And even in a worstcase scenario he and others stress the need would be to move people up to 10 miles away from Shoreham rather than completely off the island Mr Newman answered by saying that thousands of frightened residents would flee no matter what Based largely on that view Suffolk County leaders have refused to cooperate with Lilcos emergency planning Emergency Planning Praised Over in Waterford that puzzles people We were the first municipality in the country to have an emergency plan Mr Bettencourt said Ive never had to use it for a nuclear accident of course but we have used it several times for other emergencies for instance during Hurricane Gloria last fall The mechanisms are the same and they work very well A leading Shoreham opponent Maurice Barbash the Suffolk County builder who heads Citizens to Replace Lilco said that what concerned him most was neither the concept of nuclear power nor the geography of Long Island As a builder why do I fear the plant Mr Barbash asked Because I dont think we know what went into it My opposition to Shoreham is based on the record of mismanagement there As evidence of past mismanagement he cited findings by New York States Public Service Commission that almost 14 billion of the plants costs had not been prudently incurred And as evidence of current mismanagement he cited recent findings by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission of serious deficiencies in the Shoreham radiochemistry program which tests reactor coolants and other liquids for compliance with nuclear and environmental regulations Lilco has since suspended the employees said to be responsible for those deficiences and hired a consultant to retrain personnel and repair the program Spokesmen for the corporation noted that the physical integrity of the plant had been thoroughly examined by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission and that both the plant and its procedures underwent continual testing Reflecting on all this Mr Bettencourt wondered whether a communications failure might not lie at the heart of Long Islands nuclear conflict The way I look at it from what I read it seems that nobody there is talking to the other guy he said Here we have a problem we all sit down together and we try to work it out

NEW DIRECTIONS IN BIOLOGY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/13/education/new-directions-in-biology.html,Biology has entered a golden age Students today live in a world with testtube babies synthetic vaccines miracle crops and cloned mice On the horizon are such developments as supercows and magicbullet cancer cures In tinkering with the molecules of life biologists have helped set in motion a virtual transformation of American society Pundits say we are experiencing a cultural mutation that is leading to a sciencebased postindustrial society In the face of such monumental change whats a biology teacher to do According to experts on science education a growing number of instructors at the high school and college levels have dropped traditional methods of teaching biology Various new biology curriculums are being used instead throughout the nation But the transformation is still slow The difference between old biology and new biology the experts say is profound In old biology the student memorizes names of plant and animal phyla labels parts of the grasshopper studies the sexual behavior of microbes and of course dissects a frog In the most popular textbook you wont find much of anything that is controversial says Dr Gerald Skoog outgoing president of the National Science Teachers Association According to Dr Leroy Lee the associations incoming president Ninety percent of biology teachers use the traditional text 95 percent of the time All their effort is directed at getting students prepared for the nextlevel science course The emphasis of the old biology is on rote memorization the student in a firstyear biology course learns as many new words as are presented in a firstyear foreignlanguage course Biology is held to be a discrete discipline with no overlap into physics chemistry or other sciences A result of this teaching approach is major forgetting says Dr Paul Hurd professor emeritus of education at Stanford University The student refrain has long been What good is this stuff going to do for me At the very time that biology can and ought to be of greatest service to humankind we find the biology curriculum stuffed with information that has little potential for application But the new biology according to several proponents deals with basic concepts of biology as carried to its uses in society The animal studied is the human being not the frog Instead of teaching biology for the sake of biologists biology is taught for the sake of humans Dr Hurd says Courses in the new biology are organized around large biosocial themes population issues genetic profiles pollution of the biosphere biotechnology human development and health and disease The themes raise realworld problems such as famine in Africa destruction of the rain forests rising levels of carbon dioxide and coastal flooding gene therapy abortion the cost of artificial hearts and whether to spray outdoor crops with genetically altered bacteria When biology is related to social and human problems Dr Hurd says issues of values and ethics inevitably arise Students need to realize he says that science and technology are never valuefree or ethically neutral The goal of the new biology then is not to teach judgments about problems that have a biological basis Science is the search for relative truth never absolute truth according to the newbiology proponents and students should learn to be comfortable with scientific uncertainty and realize that biology presents many questions for which there are no answers According to Dr Hurd more than 100 national reports have been issued since 1980 on the inadequacies of science education The charge he says is that students are completing high school scientifically and technologically illiterate  foreigners in their own culture Lacking essential knowledge and skills he says they threaten the nations competitive edge A major goal then is to engage students in the subject matter What does biology do for me How does it help me understand myself and other people There are examples of innovative programs in virtually every state In California many high school students can take a sixweek minicourse or a fullsemester statewide course of physical anthropology called Stones and Bones Plaster casts of 15 of the worlds most famous fossils were donated by the Louis Leakey Foundation of Pasadena Calif Students make replicas of fossil finds discuss human origins and learn about ecological and climatological change According to the Los Angeles Unified School District the course has motivated many innercity students to stay in school and study more science At the Brandywine School District in Claymont Del high school students can elect a halfyear course called Human Ecology They learn basic principles of mental health stress reduction and warning signs of teenage suicide The course describes physical development over the human life span and the influence of social instititions on human and environmental issues Students volunteer a minimum of 25 hours in community service In Minnesota students learn how a type of bacteria resistant to antibiotics threatens the meat industry In Iowa they learn about the value of preserving various crop varieties In Wisconsin they consider the potential impact of genetically improved farm animals such as supercows that give 10 times as much milk as ordinary cows on the local milk industry Despite many exemplary programs in the new biology the fact remains that biotechnological issues are not discussed in most classrooms in proportion to their importance today says Dr Skoog of the National Science Teachers Association Innovation is met with stubborn resistance he says some parents for example do not think schools should teach ethics to students And he contends that specialinterest groups including fundamentalists who oppose the teaching of evolution try to intimidate teachers and school officials In response Paul Bartz education editor at the BibleScience Association in Minneapolis says If the religious sensitivity of the atheist child has to be protected in the classroom then the sensitivities of conservative Christian children ought to be protected by not teaching ethics that are in opposition to what is taught at home A childs religious training and ethics ought to be taught at home but not challenged in the classroom Textbook publishers tend to stay neutral Dr Skoog says and often exert selfcensorship as a result IN HIGHER education there is also a reform movement under way to teach biology and other sciences in more relevant contexts to both science majors and nonmajors In recent years nearly 1000 colleges and universities have started to offer courses or majors in the combined influences of science technology and society These STS courses as they are known says Dr Rustin Roy director of the science technology and society program at the University of Pennsylvania are the glue that makes science understandable By integrating science human values and society he says STS is citizen education It is scientific literacy for a scientific world Universities have always done an excellent job in training research biologists says Dr Clifford Grobstein who teaches bioethics at the University of California at San Diego But rarely are biologists trained in ethics or public policy And failing to teach biology in social and ethical contexts has serious consequences according to proponents of the new biology such as Dr Hurd A population that feels victimized by biotechnology and threatened by those who command knowledge he says cannot make sound decisions research scientists need an educated and informed public to understand their work
"SIMONE DE BEAUVOIR, AUTHOR AND INTELLECTUAL, DIES IN PARIS AT 78",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/15/obituaries/simone-de-beauvoir-author-and-intellectual-dies-in-paris-at-78.html,Simone de Beauvoir the author whose work included The Second Sex a provocative and influential polemic on the status of women died yesterday at Cochin Hospital in Paris She was 78 years old and lived in Paris The cause of death was not immediately disclosed but Claude Lanzmann the director of the film Shoah and a longtime friend said she had been in poor health since undergoing an operation in March Miss de Beauvoir who was for many years a central figure in leftwing French intellectual circles also wrote novels a play and nonfiction ranging from political commentary to autobiography Her death came the day before the sixth anniversary of the death of her longtime companion the French existentialist philosopher and critic JeanPaul Sartre on April 15 1980 Simones de Beauvoirs death stresses the end of an era Prime Minister Jacques Chirac said yesterday Her committed literature was representative of certain movements of ideas that at one time had an impact on our society Her unquestionable talent made her a writer who deserves her place in French literature In the name of the Government I salute her memory in respect An Authentic Heroine Gloria Steinem said yesterday that if any single human being can be credited with inspiring the current international womans movement its Simone de Beauvoir Betty Friedan yesterday called Miss de Beauvoir an authentic heroine in the history of womanhood Over the years The Second Sex remained the book for which Miss de Beauvoir was known worldwide and which made her an important theorist of militant radical feminism and a heroine of the womens movement The book published in France in 1949 and in the United States in 1953 was her own favorite It was translated into more than a dozen languages was honored and excoriated and sold more than a million copies in a paperback edition in the United States alone The 1953 Knopf hardcover edition and a paperback edition published in 1974 by Vintage are still in print Its basic premise  from which it took off for more than 700 pages of compelling exasperating indictment was best summed up in two sentences One is not born but rather becomes a woman No biological psychological or economic fate determines the figure that the human female presents in society it is civilization as a whole that produces this creature intermediate between male and eunuch which is described as feminine Condemned US Role in Vietnam Throughout her life Miss de Beauvoir was active in causes that advanced or supported her beliefs  from a 1960s international tribunal condemning the United States role in Vietnam to the signing of a manifesto with 340 other women in 1971 admitting to having had an abortion in defiance of existing French law Her disillusionment with Marxism in practice was recurrent  regime after regime from the Soviet Union through Algeria to Cuba disappointed her hopes But she long advocated what she thought of as the concept of authentic international revolution and the civil rights even of those with whom she disagreed Although she proclaimed at 19 that I dont want my life to obey any other will but my own she in fact spent much of her life  from 1929 when she and Sartre met as students at the Sorbonne until his death in 1980  as the closest companion of Sartre They lived not in the same apartment but always near each other saw each other daily spent their annual sixweek vacation in Rome together were completely open about their liaison We have she said once pioneered our own relationship  its freedom intimacy and frankness She added with characteristic candor We had also rather less successfully thought up the idea of the trio  She wrote that she turned down Sartres offer of marriage because she knew he did not want it but that their relationship was central to both their lives and essential love in Sartres phrase They made allowance at least in theory for contingent relationships of less importance As she conceded this was not always a success but the relationship with Sartre was always the one that mattered I knew that no harm could ever come to me from him  unless he were to die before I did she said once and at another time commented that Since I was 21  when she met Sartre  I have never been lonely Basic Existentialism Although her major theoretical contributions were to feminism Miss de Beauvoirs writings both novels and nonfiction were also regarded as brilliant expositions of basic existential belief that is that man is responsible for his own destiny Men may make of their own history a hopeless inferno a junkyard of events an enduring value she wrote in 1947 a sentence that itself could be a definition of existentialism Sartre encouraged her literary ambitions and was credited by her with pushing her into the investigation of womens oppression that led to the rage and accusation of Le Seconde Sexe The book caused a storm of outrage in France and an equal furor in the United States Philip Wylie called it one of the few great books of our era Dr Karl A Menninger described it as a scholarly and at the same time pretentious and inflated tract on feminism In 1954 Miss de Beauvoirs novel Les Mandarins The Mandarins won the Prix Goncourt and stirred scandalized delight with what were regarded as thinly disguised portraits of Sartre Albert Camus and other leading French intellectuals The author never admitted that it was a roman a clef but did concede that the novel included an account of her affair with Nelson Algren the American writer to whom she dedicated the book It appeared in the United States in 1956 Her first novel LInvitee published in France in 1943 and in the United States as She Came to Stay in 1954 concerned itself with a trio with the triangular relationship among a man and a woman long attached and a second younger woman Miss de Beauvoir although criticized for longwindedness said that she felt she had been influenced by Hemingway and that she admired the writing of Kafka Proust and Joyce She was a slow meticulous daily writer FourVolume Autobiography Her other novels included The Blood of Others 1948 All Men Are Mortal 1955 Les Belles Images 1967 and The Woman Destroyed 1968 She also wrote four volumes of autobiography  Memoirs of a Dutiful Daughter 1958 Force of Circumstance 1963 The Coming of Age 1972 and All Said and Done 1974  and a play The Useless Mouths 1954 A tour of China led to The Long March in 1958 just as a tour of the United States had produced  or provoked  America Day by Day in 1953 Her attitude toward the United States did not mellow with age and she wrote in the early 70s The moment a nationalist or a popular movement seems to threaten its interests the United States crushes it She went on to say that friends predicted the imminent collapse of the country adding Perhaps this collapse may set off a revolution on a worldwide scale I do not know whether I shall live long enough to see it but it is a comforting outlook With Sartre she also engaged in acts of political protest In 1970 for example they were arrested for selling a banned Maoist newspaper  which they were doing to protest the ban not in support of the papers positions In 1960 they were both banned from appearing on Frances statecontrolled radio or television because they had signed a manifesto supporting the right to refuse military service in Algeria which was fighting for its independence from France at the time Only a few years later in 1967 they were put on a list of boycotted authors by a semiofficial Algerian newspaper because of their support for Israel Throughout her life Miss de Beauvoir continued her political activism speaking out on issues heading committees making speeches signing manifestos The condition of women was perhaps her primary cause followed some years later by a similar outrage at the conditions of old age These she wrote about in The Coming of Age in 1972 arguing that for once women had the advantage Old age is better for women than for men she told an interviewer in 1974 First of all they have less far to fall since their lives are more mediocre than those of most men And then they still have their homes their housework cooking their children all the feminine culture Conveyed Emotional Toll The problems of women in France early in this century figured in a collection of five early stories by Miss de Beauvoir that was published in the United States in 1982 under the title When Things of the Spirit Come First Earlier Miss de Beauvoir had written about death specifically that of her mother in the ironically titled A Very Easy Death 1966 Although she had never been close to her mother the book was unusually free in its expression of emotion Her mother had been a devout woman her father a skeptic and unbeliever Later Simone Lucie Ernestine Marie Bertrand de Beauvoir born in Paris on Jan 9 1908 was to say that this disequilibrium which condemned me to a perpetual soulsearching largely explains why I became an intellectual After conventional studies she went to the Sorbonne for a degree and diploma in philosophy which she planned to teach It was there that she met Sartre a fellow student three and a half years older than she It was the first time in my life she wrote that I felt intellectually inferior to anyone else For about two years after leaving the Sorbonne Miss de Beauvoir remained in Paris In 1931 she obtained a teaching appointment in Marseilles and in 1933 in Rouen By 1938 she was back in Paris teaching and in October she began work on what would be her first published novel By 1943 she had given up teaching to write and in 1945 she joined Sartre in the editing of Les Temps Modernes a monthly review Miss de Beauvoir was somewhat humorless uncompromising and passionate in her convictions She remained convinced that as she wrote in The Second Sex a totally new society would be needed but became increasingly convinced that meaningful change in the status of women would not necessarily evolve from change in the forms of government I think that for the proletariat or a government representing it to own the means of production is not enough to change the relationship between people she said in the mid70s Thats what is really important to change relationships between people At about the same time Miss de Beauvoir acknowledged that There hasnt been the change Id hoped for in womens condition In 1976 some 25 years after The Second Sex she told an interviewer that she was uncertain about the coming of the hopedfor revolution But the changes that women are struggling for she said yes that I am certain of in the long run women will win Miss de Beauvoirs survivors include a sister Helene de Beauvoir WRITINGS ABOUT WOMEN A man who is compelled to go on materially and morally supporting a woman feels he is victimized But if he abandons without resources the woman who has pledged her whole life to him she will be quite as unjustly victimized The evil originates in a situation against which all individual action is powerless Women are clinging they are a dead weight and they suffer for it the point is that their situation is like that of a parasite sucking out the living strength of another organism Let them be provided with living strength of their own let them have the means to attack the world and wrest from it their own subsistence and their dependence will be abolished  that of man also There is no doubt that both men and women will profit greatly from the new situation  From The Second Sex Alfred A Knopf translated and edited by H M Parshley In my family it was always held that the things of the spirit came first Papa devoted his life to the study of literature and Mama to the practice of the Christian virtues while Marcelle and Pascal were dedicated to the worship of beauty and the inner life As soon as I was three years old Marcelle taught me to read and when I was seven I made my first Communion with an extraordinary degree of piety I was always very advanced for my age because they paid so much attention to me at home Papa used to read Pascal and the tragedies of Corneille and Racine after dinner and I was allowed to listen that forms ones mind  I was always first in examinations and at the end of term the old ladies of the Institut Ernestine Joliet embraced me more heartily than any of the other pupils These worthy schoolteachers were not overburdened with diplomas but as far as devotion and morality were concerned they were second to none they wore long black skirts and plumcolored silk blouses that caressed my cheeks when they pressed me to their bosoms  From Marguerite one of several short stories about French women rebelling against their upbringing in

Red Cross She learnt to ride a bicycle again to go to her office She thought of doing dressmaking at home after the war When that time came I was in a position to help her But idleness did not suit her She was eager to live in her own way at last and she discovered a whole mass of activities for herself She looked after the library in an observation sanatorium just outside Paris as a volunteer

"O'ROURKE, WESTCHESTER'S CHIEF, TO OPPOSE CUOMO",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/17/nyregion/o-rourke-westchester-s-chief-to-oppose-cuomo.html,Andrew P ORourke the Westchester County Executive announced his candidacy for Governor yesterday with the virtual assurance that he would be the RepublicanConservative challenger of Governor Cuomo With no competition for either nomination the official designation of Mr ORourke at Republican and Conservative state committee conventions in late May appears to be a formality Governor Cuomo a highly popular Democrat who is acknowledged even by Republicans to be the early favorite is expected to announce his candidacy for a second term about the same time Realistically the only candidate is ORourke said Serphin R Maltese the Conservative Party leader echoing his Republican counterpart Anthony J Colavita who said he had abandoned the traditional neutrality of a state chairman to support Mr ORourke Mr ORourke offered some generally lowkey criticism of the Governor It was couched in humor except for references to the New York City corruption investigations He noted several times that the Governor was from Queens where the scandals began unfolding and added at one point It seems to me that he might know whats going on Later in Albany Mr ORourke said Hes from Queens Its impossible that he wouldnt know something about it Recalling that he had appointed a former Democratic opponent Ogden R Reid to investigate possible corruption in the construction of a Westchester garbage incinerator Mr ORourke said with a broad smile I challenge Governor Cuomo to appoint Lew Lehrman to look into the problems of New York City The Governor defeated Mr Lehrman a Republican in the 1982 election In response to questions Mr ORourke took direct issue with Governor Cuomo on three often heated subjects  the death penalty legislation banning discrimination against homosexuals and the use of Medicaid funds for abortions Mr ORourke supports capital punishment and opposes the homosexual and abortion provisions A spokesman for the Governor Gary Fryer said Mr Cuomo would not comment on the ORourke statements Even before the campaigning gets under way the contest for Governor has taken on extra significance as Mr Cuomo has emerged as a national figure for his outspoken views on major issues even though he has said repeatedly that he is not a candidate for President However he has not ruled out such a candidacy Both White House and Republican National Committee aides said they were watching the race closely William Lacy director of the White House office of political affairs and William I Greener deputy chief of staff of the Republican National Committee said they had talked to Mr ORourke and his aides and would decide how much help to give him as the campaign developed Mr Lacy said Mr ORourkes selection had averted disaster  token opposition to Mr Cuomo Republican and Conservative leaders who surrounded Mr ORourke at a news conference in the Hotel Roosevelt viewed him as the point man in a state and national Republican effort to defeat the Governor or at least cut down the Cuomo victory margin in what could be one of the first skirmishes of the 1988 Presidential campaign Has Met With President Mr ORourke has met with the President at the White House and will be singled out by Mr Reagan at a Republican fundraising event in New York tomorrow according to Mr Lacy Mr ORourke referred to the Governors national ambitions and set the state election in an ideological context when he said that beyond disagreements on specific issues with the Governor the telling difference between us is our belief in the proper role for government I believe that government ought to be like a good relative or close friend always close at hand ready to step in when needed or asked but always sure to knock first continued Mr ORourke in an obvious allusion to the liberal Governors frequent references to the family of New York and the need for compassionate government to help the less fortunate Several Issues Cited On specific issues Mr ORourke said in his formal announcement at the Roosevelt that he would emphasize the staggering increases in state spending high taxes the states handling of soaring increases in malpractice insurance and the exodus of industry and people from the state He said state spending had jumped 43 percent during the Cuomo administration while inflation had increased 15 percent He described Governor Cuomos talk of fiscal responsibility and cost containment as hollow words The Republican candidate charged that the Governor had at first delayed and then had stymied action on malpractice insurance Is there anyone in charge at the Executive Mansion he asked He also said Mr Cuomo had direct responsibility for cost overruns and delays at the Jacob K Javits Convention Center along the Hudson River on Manhattans West Side The construction was supervised by the State Urban Development Corporation However State Comptroller Edward V Regan a Republican said later in a telephone interview that the overruns were modest in comparison with other largescale public works projects and added What the Governor could have done differently I dont know Mr Regan had boasted in his 1982 television commercials of the convention center and his oversight of it Despite his position on abortion Mr ORourke said he would not seek the RighttoLife Party endorsement Some of his advisers believe that the Right to Life line would ultimately cost him more votes than it would provide
TV VIEW; BALANCED JOURNALISM NEEDN'T PRECLUDE A POINT OF VIEW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/20/movies/tv-view-balanced-journalism-needn-t-preclude-a-point-of-view.html,Once more an argument in public television once more the same ramparts are mounted The casus belli this time is Flashpoint  Israel and the Palestinians twoandahalf hours of recent primetime programming that the Public Broadcasting Service called a brave new venture and that some of its member stations rejected as not very good Flashpoint was made up of two halfhour films that favored Israel a onehour film that did not and some 30 minutes of chitchat and discussion The main point of contention was the onehour film Occupied Palestine an examination of the lives of Palestinians under Israeli rule Some stations WNETChannel 13 among them rejected it as biased PBS said that bias was besides the point Flashpoint it said was a noble experiment in freespeech television a chance for partisans to express their views Back off a moment now to get Flashpoint in perspective It was put together by KQED in San Francisco which has developed a format called theme night In itself this is not a terrible idea On theme nights independent film makers with opposing views on the same topic have an opportunity to have their films shown The first theme night The Abortion Battle was presented by PBS last September WNET and some other stations declined to show that too Undismayed PBS pressed on with Flashpoint Say immediately that in terms of television Flashpoint was not gripping stuff It is unlikely that many viewers of the stations that showed it stayed around the full twoandahalf hours The first two works Two Settlements Etzion and Hebron and Peace Conflict had all the intensity of industrial films that big corporations sometimes show new employees In theory they presented the uncensored views of highly partisan proIsrael film makers In reality it was hard to find much that anyone save Yasir Arafat might have censored The worst thing the two films did journalistically speaking was to give the religious right wing in Israel a free ride In Israel the religious right and sometimes the secular left is contentious We didnt get much sense of this in the films As propaganda the films were pallid Occupied Palestine however was more like the real thing It did not quote the Protocols of the Elders of Zion that famous antiSemitic document although it didnt miss it by much At one point a Palestinian defined Zionism as Jewish capital allied with international capitalism allied with British imperialism Somewhere the ghosts of old Nazis must have cheered Occupied Palestine also spoke of the razing of Arab villages All who returned for their belongings were killed by the Jews a Palestinian said and quoted from what purported to be the 1948 diary of an Israeli soldier Other soldiers he supposedly wrote smashed the skulls of Arab children The commanding officer meanwhile threw two Arab children into a house and then blew it up The fewer the Arabs who remained he was quoted as saying the better A couple of things should be noted about this package One is that the proIsrael films were indeed proIsraeli but they werent particularly antiPalestinian or antiArab Occupied Palestine on the other hand wasnt so much proPalestinian as it was antiIsraeli Indeed its denunciations sometimes looked very much like oldfashioned antiSemitism dressed up in a new political nomenclature At one point it gave us a glimpse of a fundraising dinner by American Jews The money raised Occupied Palestine strongly suggested would be used to buy weapons to murder Arabs We were not far removed here from the films produced under the Third Reich Thus a question Why was this shown In a lofty message to its member stations PBS said there were only two logically consistent grounds for objecting to Flashpoint  One was that freespeech television in which a small portion of the PBS schedule provides a format for the unvarnished expression of partisan views is unworthy of even that small part of the schedule The other was that the expression of such views should not be even an experimental part of public televisions business AntiSemitism apparently did not count At the same time it seems fatuous to argue that public television needs a format for the unvarnished expression of partisan views A format isnt needed ordinary programs can be partisan enough A recent halfhour film Witness to Revolution The Story of Anna Louise Strong characterized the late Miss Strong as a woman ahead of her time who left a legacy of social conscience and personal commitment In real life Miss Strong devoted herself to apologizing for Stalin and all his grisly works Another recent film Guatemala When the Mountains Tremble sanctified Guatemalan guerrillas and blamed the United States for the massacre of peasants In fairness to PBS it should be noted that it added a panel discussion to the Guatemala documentary Some guest experts argued politely with the codirector about her sense of journalism We wanted to give an emotional understanding she replied It was never meant to be a textbook account She also spoke about the value of a highly lyric and stylized form of documentary This was nothing more than a defense of documentaries as vanity films It doesnt matter what a documentary says but only how it says it truth is not determined by facts Meanwhile responding to criticism of public television Barry Chase a PBS vice president agreed in a recent newspaper interview that there did seem to be a problem The imbalance among documentary makers he was quoted as saying at the moment is toward the left Apparently not many conservatives produce documentaries One supposes that the Corporation for Public Broadcasting which disburses Federal funding to PBS could begin an affirmativeaction program for conservatives but it is unlikely this will happen On the other hand there is a way out If we accept the premise that news and publicaffairs programs should receive Federal subsidies which does after all blur an American tradition about an independent press it is reasonable to insist that the programs practice balanced journalism This does not mean that programs cannot take a point of view The notion that a film maker must dispense with journalistic canons to produce for example a documentary sympathetic to Palestinians or critical of Israelis is nonsense A recent PBS documentary The Paper Curtain proved this It took a point of view The ideological exclusion clauses of the McCarranWalter Act should be suspended foreigners should not be denied visas to the United States because of their political beliefs At the same time the documentary practiced balanced journalism The documentary maker Paul Lewis of station WXXI in Rochester put the issue in perspective and then he made his case This was responsible journalism Partisan vanity films are the last refuge of the journalistic hack
THE AMERICAN WOMAN'S LIBERATION: IS IT A MYTH?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/21/style/the-american-woman-s-liberation-is-it-a-myth.html,In 1939 American women earned 63 cents for every dollar earned by men Fortyseven years later after a world war a sexual revolution and the emergence of the most radical and vocal feminist movement in the world American women earn 64 cents for every dollar How could the discrepancy have changed so little in almost half a century The economist Sylvia Ann Hewlett who uses these figures in her new book A Lesser Life The Myth of Womens Liberation in America William Morrow 1795 says part of the blame lies with the American womens movement Female writers and leaders of the womens movement have had passionate and sharply divided reactions to the book Several wellknown feminists such as Robin Morgan and Betty Friedan have criticized it harshly Im accused of blaming the victim Dr Hewlett said in a recent interview But the womens movement is not the victim The victim is the American working woman and her children Dr Hewlett said that womens movements here and abroad had traditionally sought to improve womens lives through different strategical approaches breaking into two major camps those activists who fought for legal and psychological equality and those who worked to achieve social reform and material benefits In Western Europe she maintained social reform was the dominant strain since the beginning of the centuryReform was effected mostly by having a womens section within the established organs of power  the political parties and the labor unions  that fought to institute special benefits for women to ease their double burden as workers and mothers In the United States the emphasis especially in the feminist revival that began in the 1960s was raised consciousness and a fight for equality by pressure groups who agitated outside the structures of power Now a lot of the evidence is in Dr Hewlett said and she has concluded after three years of research that American working mothers have fallen behind their European counterparts in social benefits and general quality of life Bleak Economic Future An economist and vice president of the United Nations Economic Policy Council Dr Hewlett has marshaled a wealth of statistical data and crosscultural studies to support her contention that American women and children face bleak and deteriorating economic futures Why Isnt America one of the worlds most childoriented countries Not really Dr Hewlett points out Seventyseven percent of this nations poverty is borne by women and children Arent American women the most independent and liberated in the world Fifty percent of American marriages end in divorce Dr Hewlett answers Afterward the standard of living of exhusbands rises 42 percent while that of wives and children falls 73 percent What about fathers Arent they the most involved and helpful compared with those in the more traditional European countries Twothirds of custodial mothers receive no child support Dr Hewlett answers Fortynine percent of American fathers dont see their children for at least a year after a divorce Dont we have the most radical and effective womens movement materially improving the lives of millions of women Maternity Leave In the United States Dr Hewlett points out more than 60 percent of working mothers have no right to any maternity leave which is a basic guarantee in 117 nations Social support for working mothers in the form of highquality child care free prenatal and delivery costs flexible work schedules and financial support to divorced mothers of small children all of which are guaranteed in most Western European democracies are still unavailable in this country There is a great deal of public piety in this country Dr Hewlett said but very little public policy She believes that the lack of social supports for working mothers stems from three sources First Dr Hewlett said we have this baroque 1950s vision of domesticity in this country We had a baby boom that was 20 years long Many policy makers see the 1950s as the golden era Day care became a dirty word in the 50s and this attitude still persists Second Dr Hewlett said she believes the Reagan Administration bears additional responsibility for undermining the relatively small safety net for women that did exist She points to a cutback on nutrition programs for pregnant women and the fact that 25 percent less public money goes into day care now than in 1980 Third she feels that the womens movement by concentrating on equality on cloning the male model forgot that most women need social support if they are to have an equal chance to compete with men in the job market Many womens leaders in the late 1960s were fleeing the Norman Rockwell world of the 50s Dr Hewlett said and families were seen as the problem not the solution We attempted to be men much more aggressively than European women did We forgot that 90 percent of us have children and that unless we help women resolve their double burden as mothers and workers they are bound to remain secondclass citizens She points out that 73 percent of American mothers now work outside the family mostly because they have to Dr Hewlett has an answer for the argument that equal opportunity would rule out unequal treatment in the form of special privileges for women Im interested in equal results she said not only equal treatment Betty Friedan who in her 1981 book The Second Stage also supported childcare programs and the restructuring of work home and family to ease domestic burdens defends the drive for equality by the American womens movement especially its emphasis on passing the Federal equal rights amendment Sylvia Hewlett says women shouldnt fight for equality she said She wants to go back to reactionary things like getting special protection for women But these things are all wrong They have to be sought only in the name of equality If these are asked for only as protection for women it would give employers reason not to hire women as they did before we demanded equality and forced them to open up more jobs and positions for women Dr Hewlett acknowledges that American women are far ahead of their European contemporaries in one way greater access to jobs and promotions in the private sector But she makes a passionate case for realigning the movements priorities toward social supports that would strengthen the American family a goal she claims most women share By largely ignoring working mothers and their children the womens movement has allowed the ultraright to take over the family she said Even the terminology prolife profamily  became rightist slogans I think thats why the membership of NOW has dropped by onethird since 1980 I think its because of the almost exclusive concentration on abortion rights and ERA We should march for abortion rights but also for prenatal care and maternity benefits We would get more support I am a feminist I would like to see the movement more vigorous
Abortion Issue Weaves an Intricate Web,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/22/us/abortion-issue-weaves-an-intricate-web.html,More than two years after the Supreme Court narrowed the scope of four key civil rights laws an effort in Congress to overturn that decision has evolved into one of the most tortuous legislative dramas in recent memory The drama may soon enter its last act unless the bills supporters in negotiations under way manage to free it from the political web of abortion and religion in which it is enmeshed If this were simply a matter of a bill that was dying for lack of support the story might be important but hardly novel But the Civil Rights Restoration Act is a bill or at least a concept that nearly everyone claims to favor The House of Representatives where the bill now lies dormant actually passed it once in June 1984 by a vote of 375 to 34 It never came to a vote that year in the Senate and so had to be reintroduced the next year in the House where it is now a case study in the power of the abortion issue in Congress to derail almost any legislative effort Grove City College v Bell The Supreme Court decision that started the debate Grove City College v Bell had nothing to do with abortion The Justices were called on to interpret Title IX of the Education Amendments of 1972 a law that bars sex discrimination in schools and colleges receiving Federal financial assistance The Court ruled on Feb 28 1984 that only the specific department or program receiving Federal funds rather than the institution as a whole was barred from discriminating Since athletic departments for example rarely receive Federal money colleges were freed of the obligation to provide equal opportunity for women in their sports programs The decision accepted the Reagan Administrations view of the law and rejected the view presented by a large bipartisan group in Congress By a vote of 414 to 8 the House had passed a resolution affirming that the scope of Title IX was institutionwide Congress submitted a friendofthecourt brief to that effect signed by 49 Senators and Representatives among them Senator Bob Dole the Kansas Republican who is now the Senate majority leader The fallout from the Grove City decision extended beyond education because three other important civil rights laws are worded in a similar fashion The Reagan Administration announced that it would also give a narrow reading to the laws barring discrimination against the handicapped discrimination on the basis of age and discrimination based on race in federally backed programs The Civil Rights Restoration Act would overturn the Grove City decision by stating that all four laws bar discrimination by entire institutions not just by individual programs While none of the four laws say anything about abortion regulations adopted in 1975 to implement the education law require schools and colleges to treat all pregnancyrelated conditions including termination of pregnancy like any other temporary disability for the purposes of their employee medical insurance plan sick leave and student health services In 1985 the United States Catholic Conference which had supported the restoration bill in 1984 asked for an amendment to remove abortion from the scope of this protection We didnt catch it the first time around the Rev J Bryan Hehir an official of the Catholic Conference in charge of social and political issues said last week in explaining the changed position Catholic institutions themselves have always been exempt from the regulation under a separate provision of Title IX that insures that schools controlled by religious organizations will not have to violate their religious tenets But once aware of the regulation Father Hehir said we couldnt have the bishops in the position of agreeing that abortion is like everything else even for nonCatholic institutions when we believe that abortion is not like everything else Some who have followed the issue speculate that the change reflected internal church politics notably the heightened priority the antiabortion effort assumed in the 1984 Presidential election In any event the churchs new stance made the bill a lightning rod for antiabortion sentiment and the 1984 majority evaporated The House Education and Labor Committee sharing jurisdiction over the bill with the Judiciary Committee adopted two amendments One in effect overturned the regulation The other broadened the religious tenet exemption by freeing from compliance with the law those institutions affiliated with as well as those controlled by a religious organization The Judiciary Committee rejected both amendments and suddenly one bill had become two The Judiciary Committee version essentially the bill that passed in 1984 lacks the votes to pass today The Education and Labor Committee version could probably pass but the bills original sponsors including the womens and civil rights groups that helped draft it view the amended bill as an antiabortion vehicle and do not want to bring it to the floor The episode has severely strained the customary civil rights coalition of which the Catholic Conference is a longtime active member Ralph Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights an umbrella organization of 185 groups that includes the Catholic Conference said Regrettably the Catholic Conference with its rich civil rights heritage is being used as a legitimate front by those who seek to kill the bill No one is willing to predict what will happen next except that time will run out if there is no movement within the next month or so Only quick action by the House can preserve a chance of getting a bill through the Senate where the climate is even more hostile Several members of the House Democratic leadership have been trying quietly for the last few months to devise compromise language Among them are Representative Thomas S Foley of Washington the majority whip and Representative Mary Rose Oakar of Ohio secretary of the Democratic Caucus Both are Roman Catholics Miss Oakar opposes public funding for abortion and Mr Foley describes himself as having a 100 percent prochoice voting record A Question of Conscience I think were getting close Mr Foley said Abortion is an issue on which the leadership simply cannot draw a line in the sand he added Its a question of conscience of judgment and when you try to force the issue you cant pass a thing According to Miss Oakar Everyone has lost sight of the focal point getting a bill I think its possible to find language that everyone can live with she said They dont have to love it they just have to be willing to agree to it for the sake of the larger picture I just wish the abortion issue would go away she said adding But it never will

increasingly distraught and fearful of another arm of United States intelligence the Central Intelligence Agency She told the jury that Mr Hunt had placed greater and greater pressure on her to feed him information about Soviet activities in this country She said that they broke off their relationship because both their spouses were suspicious She testified that Mr Hunt was crying frequently and was often angry He was afraid of the CIA she said He offered me to go to another city with him and if possible another country but his people will find him anyway and they will kill him New Test for

RHODE ISLAND AT 350: ECONOMY (AND SCANDALS) UP,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/27/us/rhode-island-at-350-economy-and-scandals-up.html,This was supposed to be a good year for Rhode Island The tiniest state is celebrating the 350th anniversary of its founding by Roger Williams After decades of industrial decline Rhode Islands economy seems to have finally turned around For the first time in recent years per capita income now exceeds the national average its tax burden has dropped below the national average and in March its unemployment rate fell to 43 percent the fifth best figure in the country Gov Edward D DiPrete has public opinion polls on his desk showing that twothirds of Rhode Islands 955000 residents now feel good about their state as against only onethird in 1984 before he was elected But the mood of celebration has been dampened by an extraordinary series of scandals and trials They have touched many of Rhode Islands most prominent public figures and institutions including the states Chief Justice a Bishop of the Roman Catholic church Brown University and the Fleet National Bank the states largest Malfeasance and Corruption The scandals have been so pervasive said J Stanley Lemons a professor of history at Rhode Island College in Providence that they seem to confirm Rhode Islands reputation for malfeasance and corruption It is a mark that dates to the 17th century when the state was known as Rogues Island because of the haven it offered pirates In recent years Providence has been the headquarters for organized crime in New England The cases have also touched off bitter disputes When the Fleet National Bank and three of its vice presidents were indicted earlier this month in connection with a scandal at a state agency that grants lowinterest mortgages to qualified home buyers the bank charged it was the victim of a politically motivated witch hunt In turn the state Attorney General Arlene Violet a Republican and a former Roman Catholic nun has accused the bank of trying to frustrate the investigation by withholding records subpoeaned by a grand jury In addition to the bank officers implicated in the case Governor DiPretes former chief of staff Robert D Murray was found guilty of filing false documents to obtain a lowinterest mortgage from the agency the Rhode Island Housing Mortgage Finance Corporation A state trooper who once chauffered the Governor pleaded guilty to the same charge Testimony by Crime Figures Chief Justice Joseph A Bevilacqua has been embroiled in a prolonged dispute over charges that he has links to mobsters Last year he was censured and left the bench for four months after an investigation by a special state tribunal into allegations that he violated the canons of judicial ethics When Chief Justice Bevilacqua former speaker of the state House of Representatives decided to return to the bench last Novemeber impeachment proceedings were initiated against him by the Legislature The Sons of Italy a fraternal organization protested that the Chief Justice was being unfairly persecuted The House Judiciary Committee in preliminary hearings on the Bevilacqua case this spring has heard from a stream of organized crime figures The atmosphere in Rhode Island has become so highly charged that even Bishop Louis E Gelineau the Roman Catholic bishop of Providence recently took to television to deny rumors that he had been arrested The rumors arose after three parish priests and a religious brother who is the principal of a Catholic high school were charged with sexual misconduct with children One priest the Rev Paul H Leech has been convicted and sentenced to three years in prison A Diocese in Total Disarray The Bishops position is particularly sensitive because 65 percent of Rhode Islands population is Catholic The states Catholic community has also been shaken by a number of other disputes including an order by Bishop Gelineau that forced Attorney General Violet and Elizabeth Morancy a Democractic state representive to resign from their religious orders Earlier this year the church disclosed that Mary Ann Sorrentino a Catholic who is director of the states Planned Parenthood Federation had been excommunicated because she does not oppose abortion This is a diocese in total disarray with its own dirty linen to keep clean Mrs Sorrentino said in an interview Its a puzzlement that they focus on women when there are such problems in the hierarchy of the diocese Youll notice that the church hasnt taken any action against the doctors and hospital administrators who are directly connected with abortion Why not Its because they are men and powerful And there are more scandals This month a prominent heart surgeon Dr Felix M Balasco was sentenced in Federal District Court in Providence to 10 years in prison for taking kickbacks to implant pacemakers in the hearts of elderly patients who did not need them A female senior at Brown University Dana E Smith and a Providence insurance agent have been indicted for participating in a prostitution ring The agent Stanley Henshaw 3d is a past president of the Rhode Island State Association of Life Underwriters Smallness May be a Factor Why are there so many scandals in Rhode Island which is only 48 miles from top to bottom and 37 miles across at its widest point Fourteen national parks are bigger Some residents think its size is a key factor In a sense were a citystate where interrelatedness is a phenomenon of the place said State Representative Morancy If you dont know someone you know someone who does In such a small environment she said things tend to get magnified and news travels fast Mr Lemons the history professor who is the coauthor of a history of Rhode Island says he believes that some of whats happened is coincidental He also traces the problem to Rhode Islands past Williams the founder arrived here after Massachusetts ousted him for sedition and heresy Tradition of Selling Votes In the 17th century ministers in other New England settlements often refered to Rhode Island as The isle of errors or the sink into which all the other colonies dump their heretics Mr Lemons recalled Late in the 17th century as Newport catered to visiting pirates like Captain William Kidd it earned the nickname Rogues Island More important Mr Lemons suggested was that in the two decades before the American Revolution Rhode Island held elections for governor that were marked by open vote buying It was the Yankees who started the practice Mr Lemons said In the 19th century as Irish and FrenchCanadian immigrants arrived the Democrats and Republicans vied to buy their votes Rhode Island developed such a reputation for political corruption that in 1905 Lincoln Steffens wrote an article about it called A State For Sale But the current crop of scandals is almost enough to make people forget Claus von Bulow the Newport socialite who was acquitted after two trials on charges of trying to murder his wealthy wife Former Mayor Vincent A Cianci Jr of Providence who resigned after pleading no contest to charges of assaulting his wifes lover with help from a policeman has reappeared as a popular radio talk show host Mr Lemons and Governor DiPrete argue that the current impeachment proceedings against Chief Justice Bevilacqua represent progress In the past said Mr DiPrete you could never have gotten the Legislature to take this kind of action

ABOUT EDUCATION; WHAT IS PROPER ROLE FOR EDUCATION DEPARTMENT?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/04/29/science/about-education-what-is-proper-role-for-education-department.html,NEW controversy has erupted over the role of the Federal Department of Education Is its task primarily to administer programs enacted and funded by Congress Or should it seek to influence what schools and colleges teach Two recent incidents have angered those who believe that the Federal Government should not try to impose its views on teaching and curriculum In Denver the departments regional office circulated a report critical of the University of Denvers Center for Teaching International Relations The center trains high school teachers in international affairs In Washington Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr the Connecticut Republican who heads the Senate Education appropriations subcommittee attacked the department for what he considered an improper critique of American history textbooks In both instances the departments critics were concerned that it was trying to impose conservative doctrine on the schools The Denver case was touched off by a report Blowing the Whistle on Global Education  written by Gregg Cunningham a lawyer for the departments regional office The document denounced instruction given to the high school teachers as capitulationist and anticapitalistic It charged that in dealing with the threat of nuclear war the program ignores any discussion of the value of freedom as a concept worthy of the ultimate sacrifice and that life after global war is invariably described in the most horrific possible terms but life after the loss of liberty is never mentioned Mr Cunningham denounces as pacifistic a listing of strategies for the resolution of international conflict which includes nonviolence bargaining and compromise He revives charges that American liberals delivered China to Communism by using their influence to bring down Chiang Kaishek and that they invited disaster in the Philippines by opposing Ferdinand E Marcos On human rights Mr Cunningham complains that the center fails to deal with the rights of the unborn by not opposing abortion University spokesmen rejecting the charges called the centers approach balanced Andrew F Smith president of Global Perspectives in Education which promotes a knowledge of world affairs in the schools also rejected the charges Mr Smith is the former director of the Denver University center In Washington Secretary of Education William J Bennett said that the report did not represent the departments policy and that the Denver office had been told not to distribute the report any longer According to a report in The Chronicle of Higher Education copies are still provided on request The second politically explosive issue resulted from what Secretary Bennett and Under Secretary Gary L Bauer asserted was their right to expose information in textbooks that they regarded as false In part the controversy was touched off by a study underwritten by the department and carried out by Paul C Vitz a professor of psychology at New York University which charged that textbooks ignore the importance of religion and of conservative thought in American history Secretary Bennett defended the departments concern when there is a problem of bias or an omission in textbooks Senator Weicker argued that the Congressional definition of the departments functions prohibits any supervision and control of textbooks Mr Bauer replied that while the department should not write textbooks or dictate what books schools should use he considered it his duty to sound an alert on any flawed books Professor Vitzs views are reported in the current issue of Education Update a publication of the Heritage Foundation a conservative research organization that has repeatedly been reported as having close connections with the Department of Education Professor Vitz charges that those who believe in religion and its importance in American life and who believe in the traditional family and in the free enterprise system are for all practical purposes disenfranchised by these textbooks He said that in 60 books he reviewed he found that American Protestantism was almost totally unrepresented and that the few occasional images of religion that were shown were Jewish or Roman Catholic He also charged that almost all postWorld War II role models in the books were politically and ideologicallly liberal with Republicans given short shrift The Denver and Washington controversies illustrate fundamental disagreements concerning the Federal Governments role in education As in other areas the Reagan Administration contends that it wants to curb the Governments powers In education as elsewhere this has generally focused on reduced Federal subsidies and regulations At the same time many school people feel that the Administration wants to use the Department of Education to impose its ideologies in the schools The Administration which had initially vowed to abolish the Department of Education in order to get the Government out of education now seems to welcome it as an instrument to promote the Administrations views In a recent report former Education Secretary T H Bell recalled that as Mr Bennetts predecessor he fought a constant battle against intrusions by ultraconservatives He expressed satisfaction that he had kept ideological bias at bay The latest controversies over textbooks and the teaching of global issues suggest that such incursions are no longer unwelcome Some methods used to judge ideological purity are reminiscent of the 1950s For example counting the number of times liberals or conservatives are mentioned in textbooks as in Professor Vitzs critique recalls earlier rightist attacks on books How todays ultraconservatives would like to reshape certain areas of teaching is indicated by their invention of biasladen words and the selection of villains For instance Mr Cunningham uses pacifistic and capitulationist in his critique of discussions of the threat of nuclear war and Professor Vitz takes a dim view of among others Thomas Jefferson Thomas Paine and John Dewey
SUPREME COURT DISMISSES AN ABORTION CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/01/us/supreme-court-dismisses-an-abortion-case.html,A major abortion case ended anticlimactically today when the Supreme Court on procedural grounds unanimously dismissed an appeal of a lower Federal court decision that struck down an Illinois law regulating and restricting abortions The Court noting that the state itself had not appealed ruled that a pediatrician who had intervened in the case in defense of the law and had appealed on his own to the Supreme Court had no legal standing to do so The decision came in one of two cases in which the Reagan Administration had filed a brief as a friend of the court in July urging the Court to overrule its 1973 decision legalizing abortion Rights Groups Hail Decision While the procedural grounds on which Justice Harry A Blackmun based his opinion for the Court shed no new light on the extent to which states may constitutionally regulate abortions groups favoring abortion rights hailed the decision as a major prochoice victory in the words of the National Abortion Rights Action League Justice Blackmun said Because a private party whose own conduct is neither implicated nor threatened by a criminal statute has no judicially cognizable interest in the statutes defense we dismiss the appeal for want of jurisdiction The pediatricians appeal filed by the American United for Life Legal Defense Fund which was the basis on which the Court agreed last year to review the case had stated incorrectly that the state was also appealing Another Case Is Pending The Court still has pending before it the other abortion case discussed in the Governments brief in which Pennsylvania appealed a Federal court decision striking down its law regulating abortion as unconstitutional Among the provisions of the Illinois law that were struck down by the lower Federal courts were requirements that physicians who prescribe birth control devices defined as abortifacients that cause fetal death explain to their patients how they work and that physicians performing lateterm abortions use special procedures to save viable fetuses The Illinois case began as a suit by Illinois physicians who provide abortion and related services alleging that the statute violated their rights by threatening them with criminal prosecution for what they said were constitutionally protected abortion procedures Dr Eugene F Diamond the pediatrician who intervened in defense of the law along with others who later died or dropped out said he favored the law because it would reduce the number of abortions and would protect the lives of viable fetuses In a concurring opinion Justice Sandra Day OConnor along with Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Justice William H Rehnquist gave somewhat different reasons for concluding Dr Diamond lacked standing The case was Diamond v Charles No 841379
SUPREME COURT; THE DAY THEY DISCARDED ALL THE LABELS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/02/us/supreme-court-the-day-they-discarded-all-the-labels.html,At least on the surface the Supreme Court seemed to have things backward Wednesday when it overruled a 1965 precedent and handed a major victory to black criminal defendants at the expense of prosecutors and the Reagan Justice Department This is supposed to be the era of the conservative majority under Chief Justice Warren E Burger a group whose approach is often contrasted almost reflexively with the Courts pioneering liberal activism and expansive view of criminal defendants rights two decades ago when Earl Warren was Chief Justice President Nixon wanted his four appointees to be tough on crime and generally they have been Yet two of them Justices Lewis F Powell Jr and Harry A Blackmun were in the 7to2 liberal majority that on Wednesday curbed the powers of prosecutors to exclude prospective black jurors from the trials of black defendants In fact Justice Powell wrote the opinion Also in the majority was Justice Sandra Day OConnor President Reagans lone appointee to the Court The decision was one of those that confound the labels  liberal and conservative judicial activism and judicial restraint  for which journalists lawyers politicians and judges often grasp when seeking to fit the Courts shifting coalitions into a logical framework Tides of Public Opinion The Courts sharp reversal on exclusion of black jurors may also have something to do with the subtle effect on the Courts thinking that Justice William H Rehnquist the Courts most consistent conservative ascribed last month to the currents and tides of public opinion which lap at the courthouse door The national consensus that racial discrimination is unacceptable may be one current lapping at the door even more powerfully now than in the heyday of the Warren Court The Warren Court did much to create that consensus But it was that Court in the 1965 case of Swain v Alabama that allowed prosecutors to exclude all black prospective jurors from a black defendants jury Condemning racial discrimination in theory the Court refused to find proof of it in practice even in a county where no black had ever been seated on a jury It did not want to fetter the ancient rights of prosecutors and defense lawyers alike to use their allotted peremptory challenges to exclude some jurors without giving a reason And it was the Burger Court with the Chief Justice and Justice Rehnquist dissenting that overruled the major holding of Swain in Wednesdays decision in Batson v Kentucky barring prosecutors from excluding a black from a black defendants jury on account of race Justice Byron R White who wrote the Swain decision voted Wednesday to overrule it saying the time has come to move against racial discrimination in jury selections Others joining in the Batson decision were Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens The Batson decision surprised and delighted many liberals some of whom had viewed Swain as one of the Warren Courts darkest hours Terry Eastland chief spokesman for Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d was not a bit delighted if not altogether surprised by the Justices willingness to depart from centuries of tradition in pursuit of their vision of racial fairness Many conservatives expected the Burger Court to overturn Warren Court decisions he said with the wry laugh of a man whose team just lost a big one but certainly Swain was not one of them The Administraion had urged the Court to reaffirm Swain In fact as Mr Eastland and other students of the Court have written for some time far from overturning many liberal Warren Court decisions the Burger Court has in some ways been both more liberal and more activist sometimes in opinions written by Chief Justice Burger himself sometimes over his objection It was the Burger Court not the Warren Court that first ordered busing of students when necessary to desegregate public schools in 1971 legalized abortion in 1973 upheld use of affirmative action preferences for blacks by private employers in 1979 and struck down in 1980 a state law that required posting of the Ten Commandments in public schools The Burger Court has also gone well beyond the Warren Court in holding unconstitutional certain forms of discrimination against women Does this mean that it is the labels that are backward that the Burger Court is really more liberal than the Warren Court Certainly not say Professors Vincent Blasi of Columbia Law School and Laurence Tribe of Harvdard Law School the labels are a very rough sometimes misleading approximation of a far more complicated reality Mr Blasi editor of a 1983 book The Burger Court The CounterRevolution That Wasnt says the pragmatists who occupy the shifting center of the Burger Court are activist in using their power of judicial review to serve justice as they see it but are not driven by the larger principles that moved liberals like Chief Justice Warren Justice Hugo Black and others They are he said hardworking and above all openminded and they take an issuebyissue factspecific view of the world He contrasted the Batson decision which he said might be explained in part by the Courts concern that innocent black defendants might sometimes be convicted by unsympathetic allwhite juries with the Courts decisions cutting back defendants Fourth Amendment rights not to be subjected to unreasonable searches and seizures In the Fourth Amendment context Mr Blasi said the Court is often asked to reverse the conviction of a clearly guilty criminal because of errors or abuses by the police He contrasted the Burger Courts careful analysis of costs vs benefits in such cases driven by reluctance to let the guilty defendants escape punishment with the Warren Courts determination to vindicate an idealistic vision of Fourth Amendment freedom cost what it may Wonderful and Long Overdue Mr Tribe who is generally considered a liberal but who disdains such labels said it would be a mistake to paint too rosy a picture of the Burger Courts record on civil rights and civil liberties But he said the Batson decision was a wonderful and long overdue example of the Burger Courts willingness to push forward the frontiers of the law to combat racial and gender discrimination He said the decision was more easily understood as not so much a case about criminal pocedure as about race relations Although the Burger Court has been far slower to vindicate and expand civil liberties under the Fourth and Fifth Amendments than the Warren Court was Mr Tribe explained it has been willing to recognize the relevance of both sexual and racial discrimination in contexts that the Warren Court had left largely untouched such as family law and the peremptory challenges involved in this very case

'A Lesser Life',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/04/books/l-a-lesser-life-706286.html,To the Editor I have read A Lesser Life The Myth of Womens Liberation in America by Sylvia Ann Hewlett and reached conclusions very different from those in Sylvia A Laws review March 30 I do not agree with everything in the book but I think that many of its observations are on target As a feminist who worked hard for the equal rights amendment and who was an early supporter of prochoice policies I believe that there has been significant progress The womens movement deserves credit but I am convinced that the movements goals have been too narrow During the 1970s many women felt that if they were to succeeed in business they could not bring their childcare problems to the workplace I know of many women who felt that it was extremely important to be as much like men as possible What the womens movement must now do is broaden its horizons We must recognize womens roles as the breeders and nurturers of children and we must insure that the business world which is dominated by men also recognizes the importance of this role I cannot understand how Sylvia Law reached the conclusion that Sylvia Hewlett was proposing no change She does in fact propose some dramatic changes that are essential to the welfare of our society Women must have the additional support services that are now lacking and among them is affordable quality child care Leaders of the womens movement must be willing at least to listen to voices that may not be singing precisely their song And there are realities that need to be brought to the attention of our country They include the increase in divorce rates the continuing low relative salary levels and the lack of child support This is not to say that we dont still need the strong voice of the womens advocacy organizations to open up the marketplace to increase the numbers of women in government positions to equalize the salaries to insure abortion rights and to supply the necessary child care so that women can function in the workplace The womens movement has given short shrift to child care To date I know of no conference held by a womens advocacy group where a major address on child care has been given nor of any feminist publication whose major focus has been on child care Sylvia Hewlett may well have stirred up a controversy out of which some of the major reforms that are needed by families can be instigated ELINOR GUGGENHEIMER New York
MASSACHUSETTS SETS VOTE ON ABORTION LIMITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/04/us/massachusetts-sets-vote-on-abortion-limits.html,After a long and emotional debate the Massachusetts Legislature has approved a constitutional amendment that would allow the state to place some restrictions on abortion The amendment is to be on the November ballot for a final decision by the voters The legislators sitting as a constitutional convention voted 123 to 69 Wednesday in favor of the amendment after several legislators said the state should do everything it could within the bounds of Federal law to restrict abortions The proposed amendment would remove anything in the states Constitution that limits legislative power to regulate abortion The 1973 decision of the United States Supreme Court that legalized abortion would still take precedence over state law but the Legislature could move to ban the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions for poor women State Spending 14 Million Representative Charles Doyle the most outspoken abortion foe in the Legislature said the state was spending 14 million a year to help pay for 8000 operations in which he said fetuses were scorched by chemicals and dismembered by the surgical tools of the abortionists Mr Doyle a Boston Democrat ridiculed groups that favor abortion for calling themselves prochoice while trying to deny the people of Massachusetts the right to make a choice about whether their tax dollars should be used for the killing of children Representative Marjorie Clapprood a Democrat from Sharon one of many female legislators to oppose the amendment said it could go much further than limiting Medicaidfinanced abortions What this amendment seeks to do clearly unequivocally and unconditionally is to ban and prohibit abortion in the Commonwealth of Massachusetts for all women Representative Calpprood said It is very clearly discrimination against 51 percent of the population by restricting the right of all women to freedom of choice She said it was clearly beyond the scope of our role as public policy makers to pit our women against criminal charges for exercising their right to choose whether their bodies will house an unwanted pregnancy Representative John McDonough a Boston Democrat also urged the legislators to move slowly noting that the November ballot was already long Abortion Foes Rally at Statehouse But Senator Francis Doris Democrat of Revere said that by allowing abortions the state was moving in a direction that could lead to the killing of children with birth defects allowing parents to say  Lets do away with a person and start again  Several hundred abortion foes each holding a red rose rallied outside the Statehouse at noon and then packed the visitors gallery in the House chamber for the threeandahalfhour debate They were repeatedly cautioned by the Senate president William Bulger to remain silent after they applauded those who spoke against abortion The Coalition for Choice a group representing several organizations opposing the amendment made public Tuesday a statewide poll taken in February in which the organization said some 82 percent of the 400 people questioned by telephone said the government should stay out of the question If in fact the question was put on the ballot we have a great deal of confidence in the voting public in Massachusetts to understand the issue as it affects their lives and we know we will be successful in November said Carol Doherty a coalition leader The Legislature approved another constitutional amendment in March that would allow direct state aid to private schools That amendment is also to be on the November ballot After approving the abortion question the lawmakers recessed the constitutional convention until May 28 when they may consider other changes in the Constitution

Throwing the Book at the Church,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/10/opinion/throwing-the-book-at-the-church.html,Like any charitable organization a church must render unto the Federal tax collector the records that support its eligibility for tax exemption Whether the Roman Catholic Church must also yield such documents to citizens challenging its tax status is the question to which Federal Judge Robert Carter has just given a dramatic answer He has ordered the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference to produce those records or pay 50000 each daily until they do Though he has now stayed the penalty such heavy fines and the judicial wrath that accompanied them seem needlessly inflammatory especially given the substantial likelihood that the underlying lawsuit will ultimately be thrown out of court The suit was filed in New York against the Internal Revenue Service by abortionrights supporters demanding an end to the churchs tax exemption They claim that the bishops promote prolife political candidates and have therefore forfeited their tax privileges They cite such episodes as statements by priests and bishops that Catholics should ponder candidates stands on abortion Internal Revenue citing statutes that protect taxpayer privacy refuses to produce enforcement records More fundamentally the Service with church support challenges the plaintiffs legal standing to sue at all Judge Carter has refused to dismiss the suit but its doubtful that higher courts will sustain him Only two years ago the Supreme Court denied standing to black families challenging exemptions for segregated private schools it is unlikely to uphold these litigants Unfortunately the arguments over documents have proceeded this far without clear appellate guidance When the bishops enter the political arena they have to expect the roughandtumble But they have a legal right to disobey the court order for the purpose of testing it Judge Carters temper notwithstanding the bishops may be in technical contempt without being contemptuous

matter what the weather what my workload how Im feeling I usually go for a jog at least three times a week Seasons change my life changes and I continually perform the comforting ritual of going for a run I don the appropriate garb for the weather I stretch I do some leg lifts and situps I bound out the front door and take off for the winding paths of Rock Creek Park about a mile from where I live in Washington I jogged when I was unemployed for a spell I jogged when I lived and worked in Baltimore I jog now in the nations capital I have run through personal triumphs and crises I jogged the night before I was married and I jogged the day before my wife had to have a therapeutic abortion because the baby she was carrying was diagnosed as having a fatal genetic disease At those times running helped me cope with the tensions of planning a wedding and the pain of losing a child Running reassures me though my life may change I am who I am Then not long ago I went on my first run after my wife gave birth to our first child My pace was the same as always the running path looked the same the fellow runners I saw wore the familiar expression of agonyecstasy This run however was completely different than any other I have taken Before the baby was born friends and family told me that having a child gives you a new perspective on life That includes a new perspective on running A routine that Ive had since the mid70s for better or for worse in my life through colds and the flu during cold and blistering heat had suddenly almost magically been transformed My run showed me that I was not who I was that my life had changed and I had changed Things that I took for granted took on special significance In the hospital a nurse had told my wife and me Your baby may sneeze and hiccup because the air is new for her and she is getting used to it As I breathed in and breathed out during that first postpartum jog I thought of how this air Ive inhaled for 34 years is as new to the baby as a walk in outer space would be for me I saw colors that she has never seen before  the soft delicate pink of cherry blossoms the bright yellow of dandelions the muddy brown of the creek I run beside I heard sounds that she has yet to hear  the pant pant of a runners breathing the slap of my shoes against the asphalt running path I felt runners aches and pains and the trickle of sweat down my brow feeling that she has never known When I passed a fellow jogger instead of raising my hand in greeting I had to fight the urge to call out Im a father As I ran I tried to figure out how to take my daughter on a run with me With her long slender legs she is a born runner thats for sure At home in bed I give her nightly running workouts with Jane Fondalike exhortations to finish that mile round that bend make it burn I pump those ruddy legs up and down as if she were racing in the Olympics Will this imprint running on her brain Or has daddy gone off the deep end Would she like to be jostled in a Snugli or perched in a back pack while I run I suppose neither is a practical means of bringing a baby on a run Sometimes when I hold my arms halfbent theyre in the position in which I hold my baby Why not just cradle her as I lope along Then it occurred to me that I could substitute her for the Heavyhands that I once used to pump while I ran Im not sure what Dr George Sheehan would say about pumping a baby although shed certainly be softer and cuter than Heavyhands Then I remembered that a set of two onepound Heavyhands slowed me down a bit imagine what would happen with a 6pound 7ounce baby The only option left seemed to be the Baby Jogger an outlandish carriagelike contraption that runners can push ahead of them with a baby securely buckled in place I used to laugh at advertisements in running magazines for the Baby Jogger who in their right mind would spend 175 for a racing stroller Now I find myself seriously thinking about sending away for the promotion brochure Id certainly be the first on my Yuppiefrequented running path to have a Baby Jogger What a hoot it would be to push her along and as I pass a slow runner to call out in the civilized Washington manner Father and daughter passing on the left When I told my wife my various ideas she wondered whether I wasnt suffering the effects of new father sleep deprivation Oh well maybe it is too soon to take Maya on the running path although theres always the possibility of starting a day care center alongside the jogging path for the children of runners And even if I cant take her with me in body I certainly do in smell her sweet scent seems to cling to my clothes and in spirit Just a couple of months ago in my preMaya days I hit the jogging path and hadnt a care in the world Now theres one overwhelming thought that weighs on my mind as I begin a fourmile run Thirtytwo minutes to go before I can hold my newborn daughter in my arms again
THE NATION; 2 Catholic Groups Held in Contempt,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/11/weekinreview/the-nation-2-catholic-groups-held-in-contempt.html,A Federal judge in New York City gave the debate over the separation of church and state a new dimension last week holding two major organizations of the Roman Catholic Church in contempt of court The reason he said was their refusal to turn over documents subpoenaed in a sixyearold lawsuit over the churchs taxexempt status The central question of the case brought by Abortion Rights Mobilization a Manhattanbased organization and 20 other prochoice groups and individuals is whether the churchs campaign against abortion including its opposition and support of candidates for public office means that it cannot be given favored tax treatment Those who support abortion rights are denied similar advantage The documents sought by the plaintiffs according to their lawyer Marshall Beil concerned the churchs partisan political activity its taxexempt status and enforcement of the tax code by the Internal Revenue Service The judge Robert L Carter of District Court held in an eightpage opinion that the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference had willfully misled him and the plaintiffs in a series of procedural maneuvers He ordered each group to begin paying daily fines of 50000 tomorrow but stayed the order pending appeal In 1982 Judge Carter removed the two organizations as defendants in the suit on the ground that it is against the Government not the church that plaintiffs have stated a claim But the conferences remained subject to subpoena for documents In the past they have held that the subpoenas raised grave constitutional issues
SPY TRIAL CLASH TURNS ON MOTIVES OF EMIGRE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/12/us/spy-trial-clash-turns-on-motives-of-emigre.html,The espionage trial of Richard W Miller reached a peak last week when the prosecutors and defense clashed over the motives of a Russian emigre who testified that Mr Miller was innocent Mr Miller the first agent of the Federal Bureau of Investigation ever charged with espionage is accused of conspiring with the emigre Svetlana Ogorodnikov and her husband Nikolay to pass classified documents to the KGB the Soviet intelligence agency for a promised 65000 in cash and gold Mr Millers first trial last year ended when a jury that was heavily for conviction declared itself deadlocked At times in the two and a half months of the second trial spectators have remarked that the proceedings were like a soap opera with testimony about an affair between Mr Miller and Mrs Ogorodnikov and about Mr Millers foibles as an overweight and eccentric FBI agent Adding to that was testimony by Mrs Ogorodnikov that another bureau agent John Hunt now retired was also her lover and had taken her to have an abortion But by the end of Mrs Ogorodnikovs testimony in which she recanted an earlier confession the trial was linked to the realities of United StatesSoviet relations as the prosecution and defense debated what the future might hold for Mrs Ogorodnikov as a result of her testimony favorable to Mr Miller The debate was confined to the courtroom a court order bars lawyers and other parties in the trial from making public statements about the case Exchange With Soviet Union Russell Hayman an assistant United States attorney prosecuting the case suggested in his crossexamination that Mrs Ogorodnikov denied that she and Mr Miller had worked for the KGB in the hope that she might return to her homeland in a future spy swap Mr Millers lawyers Stanley Greenberg and Joel Levine said she was not tailoring her testimony Mrs Ogorodnikov had interrupted her own trial last June to plead guilty to espionage in a plea bargain But near the end of her testimony last week in the Miller trial in one of several disavowals of that guilty plea she said the Soviet intelligence knew she had really been trying to help the FBI and therefore she could not return to the Soviet Union I would be shot she said What do you think the Russians are fools They know the truth A prosecution disclosure during Mrs Ogorodnikovs testimony appears to have ended in a setback for the defense In crossexamining her the prosecution disclosed that last year while seeking her pleabargain agreement Mrs Ogorodnikov had said in a statement to the judge that Mr Miller had passed a classified document The prosecution disclosed that she had been permitted to make the admission privately to Federal District Judge David V Kenyon because of her expressed fears for her family in Russia Mrs Ogorodnikov testified that her statement to the judge was not true and ended her testimony asserting that she and Mr Miller were helping the FBI infiltrate Soviet intelligence and had passed no secret information No Direct Evidence The Government has presented no direct evidence that Mr Miller a former agent of a counterintelligence unit passed classified documents The Government has relied on what it called Mr Millers confession made during five days of questioning by FBI agents after his arrest Oct 2 1984 Although he said then that he had passed classified documents he later disavowed that saying he had made the statement under the duress of FBI interrogation While Mr Miller has freely admitted having an affair with Mrs Ogorodnikov he has asserted that he was trying to use her as a double agent to infiltrate the KGB Mr Millers lawyers have tried to show the jury that Mr Miller was attempting only to continue a plan that had earlier been tried and scuttled by Mr Hunt of the FBI of turning Mrs Ogorodnikov into a double agent Mr Hunt in his testimony at Mr Millers trial denied trying to make her a double agent or being her lover
CHURCH AND POLITICAL ISSUES: HOW FAR IS TOO FAR?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/12/us/church-and-political-issues-how-far-is-too-far.html,A Federal judges decision to hold the countrys two foremost Roman Catholic Church groups in contempt of court dramatizes a continuing controversy over the rights of religious groups to get involved in politics At its narrowest the contempt citation Thursday grew out of the refusal of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and the United States Catholic Conference to turn over some subpoenaed documents to a Federal judge in New York In that court case a group called Abortion Rights Mobilization is demanding that the Internal Revenue Service revoke the taxexempt status of the conferences saying they have organized a political campaign to support and defeat individual political candidates on the basis of their positions on abortion The Internal Revenue Code while allowing some political activity by organizations that are exempted from taxation prohibits campaigning for candidates But the case touches on larger questions What rights do religious groups have to speak out on political issues Have religious spokesmen gone too far in supporting and attacking views that are closely associated with particular candidates And if the churchs statements on abortion favor certain conservative candidates over liberal ones what rights do taxexempt groups have to speak out in favor of politically liberal causes such as a nuclear freeze the sanctuary movement and an end to American aid to rebels fighting the Government of Nicaragua Part of the First Amendment The United States has had a long history of religious organizations becoming deeply involved in the politics of war and peace racism and racial tolerance the rights of private property and the rights of the poor In recent years some Protestant fundamentalists have been notably outspoken in defending some of the same political views that conservative Catholics support while liberal Protestant denominations have supported political causes that are also being supported by liberal Catholics Both sides in the current court case however tend to view their fight as unique Every religion has a right to come in on an issue  thats part of the First Amendment said Lawrence Lader the president of Abortion Rights Mobilization The one sole issue is attacking or supporting a political candidate But Robert Wonderly a spokesman for the two Catholic conferences said that while the church has condemned abortion it has carefully confined its statements to the issues We studiously avoid personalities he said The church has taken the same tack Mr Wonderly added in a series of widely noted pastoral letters dealing with such issues as nuclear war the arms race and the economy Another pastoral letter on the economy is due to be released soon Mr Wonderly said It addresses the role of government in economic matters but there are no personalities he said No individual or political party is mentioned or considered Critics Say Its the Same Thing But some critics of the churchs involvement in politics have suggested that such distinctions can be more apparent than real They say that attacking political positions amounts in some cases to attacking individual candidates Among the documents subpoenaed by the plaintiffs in the IRS lawsuit who are seeking to demonstrate this is the bishops Pastoral Plan for ProLife Activities Those who have questioned the churchs stance have included on occasion Catholics like Governor Cuomo who have said they personally oppose abortion but tolerate the views of others and uphold the law which protects a womans right to abortion No one who has spoken out lately on these matters has denied a religious organizations right to a certain amount of free expression on political issues The question rather concerns taxexempt status Section 501c3 of the Internal Revenue Code permits a church school or charitable organization to remain exempt from taxes so long as it does not participate in or intervene in including the publishing or distributing of statements any political campaign on behalf of any candidate for public office At the same time the law allows a taxexempt religious organization to attempt to influence legislation so long as such work is not a substantial part of its work Precise Limits Are Undefined The precise limits of these distinctions have rarely been investigated and have never been fully established in law So the point at which church and state draw the line  or where a religious organization that is not required to pay taxes should decline to get involved in politics  remains open to dispute in the tax laws as it does in other areas of public life Mr Wonderly speaking for the two key Catholic groups embroiled in the current court case said that although individual priests nuns and bishops had spoken out in favor of providing sanctuary for illegal aliens entering the United States from diplomatically friendly but sometimes politically oppressive Latin American countries the Churchs national organizations had not taken a position on the practice Mr Lader of the abortion rights group said he assumed that the reason there had been no prominent court cases over other political activities by the church was simply that the church had not supported or opposed individual political candidates over these other issues He added that in his view the political activities of conservative Protestant fundamentalists black Protestants and other religious groups had been very careful to avoid supporting and opposing particular candidates

Linking Adoption And Abortion In One Crusade,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/16/us/linking-adoption-and-abortion-in-one-crusade.html,Most of what Congress does centers on large ideas like Federal budgets or on the specific concerns of constituents but personal experiences have a way of affecting the legislative process too For example since adopting a son last year Senator Gordon J Humphrey Republican of New Hampshire has emerged as a leading Congressional spokesman on adoption He wants to make adoption easier both for couples who want children and as an alternative for women considering abortions My wife and I had no children and we had long wanted one Mr Humphrey said Like others they struggled with the regulations the problems of supply and demand and the waiting lists before actually adopting a child who is 9 months old And now Mr Humphrey says he takes every chance I get to speak about adoption and how to make it easier The Senator also created the Congressional Coalition on Adoption which includes 19 Senators and 36 Representatives and which held its first hearing last month Focus on the Advantages The purpose of the coalition Mr Humphrey said is to focus on the advantages of adoption for all concerned  the child the biological parents and the adoptive parents The coalition hopes to provide Federal aid to remove some of the obstacles to adoption most notably by increasing counseling services for pregnant women and training the counselors to emphasize the benefits of adoption for those who do not want to keep the child According to Mr Humphrey some women are inadequately counseled and choose to have an abortion because they do not understand that adoption might be available to them For every child which is adopted there are at least 60 homes he said Tragically at the same time approximately 15 million abortions are performed every year Thus says Wendy Stone a spokesman for Mr Humphrey although promoting adoption is clearly the coalitions broad purpose it also carries a connection to the abortion debate If theres an adoption instead of an abortion then theres obviously a connection between the two she said But those coalition members whose views on abortion do not always conform with Mr Humphreys carefully separate the coalitions work on adoption from any abortion message Aides to the House majority leader Jim Wright who supports a womans right to choose an abortion if a pregnancy results from rape or incest say Mr Wright joined the coalition to help break down the barriers to adopting children especially handicapped children A spokesman said Mr Wright sees no connection between the abortion issue and better adoption procedures Groups that advocate abortion rights are also choosing to ignore Mr Humphreys link between adoption and abortion although some are wary of the Senators leadership in several efforts to restrict abortion rights Alice Gee a spokesman for the National Abortion Rights Action League said We support a womans right to choose whether it be abortion or adoption or any other option so of course we would favor adoption efforts

FROM BIDEN TO BABBITT TO NUNN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/magazine/from-biden-to-babbitt-to-nunn.html,AGAINST A BACKDROP OF A UNITED States flag that overwhelmed their hotel meeting room in Atlanta members of the Democratic Policy Commission two weeks ago began drafting recommendations on such issues as the rural economy international trade family life and military policy The larger interests and broader agenda of the Democratic Party and the nation have superseded the singular agenda of elite groups declared Paul G Kirk Jr the Democratic national chairman who had limited the panels membership to elected officials At the same time in Washington more than 1000 liberal Democrats mostly feminists members of minority groups labor leaders peace activists and advocates of homosexual rights rallied to bitterly denounce what they perceive as the partys swerve to the right since 1984 One of the key speakers the Rev Jesse Jackson charged that the party was producing schizophrenic leaders who want to look like John Kennedy with hair flowing to the left and act like Ronald Reagan with behavior flowing to the right A reconfigured Democratic establishment has emerged out of the trauma and confusion of the 1984 Presidential election in which President Reagan overwhelmed Walter F Mondale in 49 states Its new politics and electoral strategies are tilted heavily toward the South and the West politically muscular regions that cast 272 of the 538 Electoral College votes for President And its leadership is dominated by a new generation of politicians most of whom were little more than bystanders at the partys 1984 convention and whose names even now are unfamiliar to many Americans When the country chooses its next President the three Democrats most prominently identified with the policies and traditions of the New Deal will be on the sidelines Last December 13 months after Mondale announced his retirement from elective politics Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts removed himself from the 1988 Presidential field And at the end of this year Speaker of the House Thomas P Tip ONeill will lay down his gavel and retire from political life The partys ascendant leaders are mostly Southerners and Westerners in their mid to late40s whose politics are rooted more in pragmatism than ideology They have met little resistance from the remnants of the Democratic old guard as they have taken command of the debate over how to recast the partys image and message to connect Democrats with lost constituencies including the baby boom generation which in 1988 will constitute one of the largest voting blocs in American history Although there is little question that the partys center of gravity is shifting it would be premature to write off the traditional wing which is prominently represented in the Congress and still controls foreign policy within the party In the months ahead the political debate will be increasingly dominated by the partys Presidential hopefuls and two of the leading ones Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Gov Mario M Cuomo of New York have been sharp critics of the Reagan agenda and staunch defenders of many traditional Democratic positions In the field of possible 1988 Presidential primary candidates Hart and Cuomo would find themselves running to the left of such Democrats as Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri and Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona Hart says he will make his record of opposition to nearly all of Reagans major legislative proposals an important part of his campaign People want a program and a policy and a vision that is different from Ronald Reagans but is put positively he says In 1988 everybody is going to be called to account on how they voted on all these Reagan policies How did he vote on the tax cuts How did he vote on GrammRudman How did he vote on aid to the contras How did you vote on a whole list of things Its going to be uncomfortable for some of the Democratic leaders because theyre going to have to justify having voted right down the line with Reagan I dont have to do that because I havent done it and Im one of the few who hasnt In the 1984 campaign there were few fundamental policy differences between Hart and Mondale The real difference was in the public perception of the two contenders Mondale was viewed by many as a captive of the partys specialinterest groups especially organized labor and as a symbol of the past Hart came across as fresh independent and forwardlooking His campaign eventually stalled on questions of character for example why he changed his last name and the confusion over his age Other Democrats moving to the forefront are generally known more for their stands on particular issues than for a broad political philosophy Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia without question the most influential lawmaker in either party on military issues is the commanding general of the partys effort to shed its softondefense image Babbitt is a leading advocate of shifting more responsibilities from Washington to the states and of advancing the argument that Social Security and other Federal entitlement programs should be related to need Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey along with Gephardt was the architect of an early taxrevision bill that helped frame the debate on that issue Former Gov Charles S Robb of Virginia has emerged as a spokesman for fiscal conservatism a tougher foreign policy and new social priorities And in Massachusetts the only state that preferred George McGovern to Richard Nixon in 1972 Gov Michael S Dukakis has redefined the liberal approach to welfare and unemployment with programs that have attracted national attention These are problemsolving governors and legislators who have built their reputations on innovative programs and policy initiatives and who have little allegiance to the party establishment or its interest groups S OME ANALYSTS BElieve that the next President will be a Democrat or Republican who is able to catch the spirit of the times  as did Franklin D Roosevelt in 1932 John F Kennedy in 1960 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 One man with that potential is Cuomo the 53yearold son of Italian immigrants whom some party strategists regard as the most promising of their Presidential prospects perhaps the one Democrat able to bridge the chasm between the partys traditional values and its new political imperatives including how to appeal to young voters and other constituencies that have drifted into the Republican ranks Another is Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware a 43yearold IrishCatholic who rivals Cuomo as a passionate speaker and whose approach to politics is more thematic than programmatic Biden who is so committed to his family that he commutes daily by train between Washington and his home in Wilmington is a harsh critic of his party Democrats he says have put the narrow agendas of special interests ahead of the national interest and have been guilty of intellectual snobbism Bidens critics say he is more style than substance contending that even after 13 years of grappling with national and international issues in the Senate he does not have a clear political identity He has been a strong supporter of civil rights bills but has long opposed busing as a means of achieving school desegregation He has taken positions on both sides of the abortion issue although womens groups say he generally has voted against a womans right to choose As a member of the Foreign Relations Committee he established himself as its leading authority on nuclear arms control but he now admits he has temporarily dropped the issue because its not going anywhere in the Reagan Administration Biden says that if he runs in 1988 he will look forward to matching his knowledge of domestic and foreign affairs with his opponents But to counter the impression that he does not always do his political homework he has begun consulting with academic political and Government experts on a range of policy questions I dont think anyone really questions my substance especially my Senate colleagues he says I think some people just assume that anybody who is being talked about in terms of style must be lacking in substance Most of the partys Presidential prospects agree on the need for arms control policies to spur economic growth and competitiveness in foreign trade reindustrialization military reorganization and closer cooperation among Government business and labor They speak of a more activist Government in some areas but they also emphasize the limitations of Government Unlike their partys Congressional leadership some of them call for higher taxes if necessary to balance the Federal budget and for removing Social Security and other entitlement programs from the list of political untouchables On national defense Nunn and Hart as well as the others are saying the same thing Its time to shift the debate from the size of the Pentagon budget to the need for military reorganization and a coherent military strategy The Democratic Party however remains deeply divided on foreign policy which Hart says none of us have thought through completely Robb and Nunn for example support the President on providing military assistance to the contras But Hart Cuomo Babbitt Gephardt and Biden oppose the Presidents policy Most of the partys Presidential aspirants supported the bombing raid on Libya The exceptions were Hart who contended that nonmilitary responses to terrorism would be more effective and Jesse Jackson I dont think there have been Democrats in the last 10 or 15 years who have spelled out in any detail their framework for a foreign policy of the future says Hart who is planning a series of speeches this year outlining his own views Weve been operating in a vacuum since Vietnam We have voted against things Weve been against Marines in Lebanon Weve been against contra aid Some of us have been against the Grenada invasion We havent said what we are for The most difficult foreign policy question facing Democrats he added is when and where do we use military force H ART WILL BE 51 IN 1988 and the old man of the new generation unless Cuomo runs One of his problems is to preserve the sense of generational change that surrounded his 1984 candidacy Many of his new ideas have lost their freshness or have been nibbled away by some of his potential rivals and he is still saddled with a 3 million campaign debt Hart has spent the last year sharpening his own message gorging himself on policy papers and writing a book on military reform called America Can Win The 1988 contest he says will be decided on the strength of ideas All the candidates for President will be new people new in the sense that none of them have ever held national office and except in my case have never run for national office says Hart And virtually all of them are in their 40s Now thats phenomenal when you think about it But there is another Democrat who ran for President in 1984 and is expected to do so again in 1988  Jesse Jackson who until recently had been dismissed by party leaders as a onecampaign phenomenon The former aide to the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr won almost 21 percent of the nationwide primary and caucus vote last time  80 percent of it black Some party strategists believe Jackson has the potential to be an even stronger force this time around Jackson has not been visible at party meetings since 1984 and his estrangement from the Democratic hierarchy makes it more likely that his candidacy will reopen divisions within the party He has spent much of the last year trying to fashion a political organization by reaching out to desperate farmers and to a variety of dissidents who have grown disenchanted with the centrist drift of their party If some Democrats are nervous about the prospect of another Jackson candidacy there are good reasons For one thing some strategists say Jackson will benefit from the Southern regional primary scheduled for early March in 1988 It will be one of the first delegateselection contests after the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary Some also fear that Jacksons leftist agenda and rhetoric could become a polarizing force  in the aftermath of the attack on Libya he charged that President Reagan practices terrorism by supporting antiCommunist rebels in Nicaragua and Angola This would increase the pressure on other candidates to attack him directly which neither Mondale nor any of the other 1984 Presidential candidates could bring themselves to do So far Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta is one of the few black Democrats to declare that he has no intention of supporting Jesse Jackson in another bid for the Presidency Only in America says Young can someone who could not be elected mayor governor or congressman run for President Some believe that Mario Cuomo is the one Presidential prospect who could fill the vacuum created by Kennedys withdrawal and prevent many of the partys liberal constituencies including blacks from feeling that Jackson offers the only political shelter But Cuomo who is agonizing over whether to run does not appear eager to claim the Kennedy mantle and is struggling to create his own political identity Cuomo gained national prominence on the strength of his stirring keynote address to the 1984 Democratic National Convention That speech many political experts believe offered the Democrats a chance to redefine liberalism in a period of conservative dominance We believe in only the Government we need but we insist on all the Government we need Cuomo told the convention going on in homiletic tones to speak of the sharing of benefits and burdens for the good of all But Cuomo has offered few specific alternatives to Reagan policies On foreign policy  the debate he seems most reluctant to join  he has moved from saying he has no expertise in the field to making general observations to consulting foreignpolicy experts Unlike other prominent Democrats Cuomo has not tried to distance himself from Mondale He continues to say that the former Vice President was right on all the issues in 1984 and he let it be known recently that Mondale was among the Democrats with whom he was consulting Some experts question whether Cuomo has the personality and temperament to survive the pressures of a Presidential campaign He has a reputation for being a thinskinned and unpredictable politician with an appetite for controversy Every time I mention his name on television or in newspaper interviews I get two or three calls from his staff wanting to know what I meant by my remarks says Charles Robb If he wasnt thinking about running I dont think he and his staff would be that sensitive R OBB SAYS HIS CANDIDATE for President is Sam Nunn Nunn says he thinks Robb should run Both are viewed as potential Vice Presidential choices who seem more in sync with Gephardt and Babbitt than with Hart and Cuomo Gephardt the chairman of the House Democratic Caucus favors tuition tax credits when the budget permits favors taxing some healthcare fringe benefits and opposes abortion busing and additional gun controls Babbitt a geologist and Harvardeducated lawyer advocates a means test to relate Social Security and other Federal entitlement progams to need His crockerybreaking talk about domestic policy assumptions wrote the conservative commentator George Will makes him the miners canary of the Democratic Party The ideological centrism of some of these Democrats may appeal to many Americans but not to the party activists who play a key role in the Presidential nomination process Babbitt admits to being baffled about one aspect of Democratic politics Why interest groups seem to hold Presidential candidates to a higher standard on litmus test issues than they hold candidates for state and local office where Democrats have overwhelming strength and numbers Those of us elected at the state and local levels have never had to pass these litmus tests he says The interest groups seem to be much more pragmatic and accommodating at these levels and I dont know why For example Chuck Robb has been highly acceptable to constituency groups in Virginia  labor feminists and minorities  and Im sure if he were a candidate for President these same groups would try to hold him to a different standard If he runs for President in 1988 Gephardt is likely to find himself mired in one of the most emotional debates in todays politics According to the National Womens Political Caucus Gephardt has almost always voted against a womans right to choose an abortion Caucus officials point out that he has cosponsored constitutional amendments to outlaw abortions and in 1985 supported a bill to prohibit the District of Columbia from using its own funds to pay for abortions even when the mothers life was at stake I feel that abortion is an issue on which a clear consensus has not been formed Gephardt says My conviction is that abortion should not be used as birth control but as President I would not make abortion a litmus test for my judicial appointments In an effort to reposition himself on the issue Gephardt recently dropped his support for a constitutional amendment banning abortion His move provoked an angry response from the National Right to Life Committee which accused him of political capitulation to proabortion activists No Democrat is working the Presidential campaign trail harder than Gephardt whose strategy is to make a breakthrough in the Iowa caucuses the first contest of the 1988 primary season So far his reviews have been favorable partly because his earnest Eagle Scout image has made him one of the most likable Presidential hopefuls on the circuit His stuff is still vague and at some point he has to get sharp says one Capitol Hill Democrat What is lacking in Gephardts image is any sense of his willingness to take risks or go for the jugular He and Bill Bradley started out owning tax reform but Gephardt backed off when it became a hot issue S OME DEMOCRATS saw the 1984 election as a triumph of the Republican message of opportunity over the Democratic assertion that the Reagan policies are unfair to the poor and middleincome people But publicopinion surveys suggest that the fairness question still has political value and that the President his popularity notwithstanding has failed to move the country significantly closer to his ideology In January a nationwide New York TimesCBS News Poll asked 1581 persons a number of political questions that were first asked in early 1981 The responses showed no definitive evidence of change in a conservative direction There was for example no significant change in the percentage of those who believe that the Government should see to it that everyone has a good job and a decent standard of living And despite the realignment talk prevalent throughout much of 1985 there is also ample evidence that the Reagan Presidency has failed to move Republicans closer to their goal of becoming the majority party in this century For most of 1985 polling data showed that the Democratic and Republican parties were at rough parity in the percentage of voters who identified with them But by early 1986 the gap in party identification was back to about where it had been when Mr Reagan first took office 49 percent Democratic and 41 percent Republican figures that include independents with identifiable leanings As the postMondale chairman of the Democratic National Committee Paul Kirk a Boston lawyer and former aide to Edward Kennedy surprised many Democrats by his deference to Sun Belt Democrats and their agenda Despite the reservations of many Democrats Kirk did nothing to discourage Southerners from organizing a regional Presidential primary and has encouraged the notion that the party will need a Southern candidate on its 1988 ticket And under his leadership the party reduced its number of specialinterest caucuses and increased the role of elected officials in party affairs including the number who will be automatic delegates to the 1988 national convention At the same time Kirk has tried to shift the spotlight from the Democratic establishment in Washington to success stories in the states As an alternate approach to welfare policy he cites what Michael Dukakis has accomplished in Massachusetts where the employment training program encourages welfare recipients to obtain job counseling and training education and unsubsidized employment Despite Kirks gestures Sun Belt Democrats organized the Democratic Leadership Council in February 1985 to act as an independent force in steering the party away from its old politics With more than 100 elected officials on board the council has held forums throughout the South and the West to promote its views and showcase its founders Nunn Robb Gephardt Babbitt and Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida Once derided as the whitemale caucus the council started out as a halfway house for disaffected Democrats in the South and the West But recently it has turned its attention to attracting blacks and women and to influencing the intellectual and policy debate within the party Shortly after taking over as chairman of the council from Gephardt Robb challenged Democrats to end their conspiracy of silence and start a frank discussion of the new obstacles to black progress  high rates of teenage pregnancy illiteracy drug addiction and violent crime Speaking at Hofstra University in April Robb said Its time to shift the primary focus from racism the traditional enemy from without to selfdefeating patterns of behavior the new enemy within Kirk originally opposed the DLC but now says it is playing a constructive role especially in bringing more elected officials into party affairs A good example is Sam Nunn The 47yearold Georgian had remained aloof from the party for most of his political career But in recent months Nunns role in the DLC  insiders say he is its most influential leader  has transformed him into a party activist who has used his credibility on military affairs to shield his party from Republican attacks on the national defense issue John White a former chairman of the Democratic National Committee who is helping the council with fund raising says The DLC is a counterbalance to the Americans for Democratic Action faction that has had influence way beyond its numbers Its filling a vacuum in the Scoop Jackson wing of the party that has a broad constituency but has not had a leader since his death Gary Hart has used the DLC to promote his views on trade policy but he has declined to become part of its larger political effort Youve got this DLC group that wants to move the party to the center he says The only question is what does the center mean Apparently for some of them it means financing contra aid in Central America and voting for Reagan economic policies Well if thats what they define the center as being we shouldnt have a Democratic Party You know its Reagan in Franklin Roosevelts clothing
EDUCATION WATCH; MANY CAUSES MOVE A TEXAS CAMPUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/weekinreview/education-watch-many-causes-move-a-texas-campus.html,DR Les Kurtz a sociology professor at the University of Texas here is an outspoken liberal who admits his views would have found more supporters in the 1960s than they do now But when asked when he would rather be teaching he paused and said the broad range of political viewpoints and activities on campus make the present a more stimulating time to be in academia In a way its what the university should be he said My classes are extremely lively and when you go out to the West Mall where many of the political groups on campus have set up tables you can find almost everything It helps me sharpen my ideas in a way I wouldnt have had to earlier In Washington last week Education Secretary William J Bennett criticized the tenor of much of Americas campus politics contending that a significant body of opinion has developed that rejects a democratic dialogue in favor of radical politics However other recent reports including a study by the highly regarded Public Opinion Laboratory of Northern Illinois University have concluded that students are becoming increasingly conservative and apolitical A review of the past year at this sprawling 48000student campus suggests a political environment that mirrors neither the quiet of the 50s nor the ferment of the 60s Instead there seems to be a raucous chorus of ideologicallymixed voices The activists remain an extremely small percentage of the student body but even those who are uninvolved politically are shaping their own political views in a more politically diverse atmosphere on campus than has existed for years some professors say Theres less pressure on conservative students to keep quiet Theres certainly less prejudice against conservative faculty members said Dr Thomas Schwartz a politically conservative government professor It has to have an effect on what students see and hear Theres more activity on the part of the left and the right said Dr Douglas Kellner a philosophy professor since 1973 This year was as politically active as any Ive seen In recent months the activity has included antiapartheid rallies and a debate over a suitable role for an acerbic conservative newspaper modeled after the controversial Dartmouth Review Precinct records showed that many students voted for Ronald Reagan in 1984 But when a conservative challenger tried to run for the elected post of editor of the student newspaper The Daily Texan he received only 30 percent of the vote against his liberal opponent Similarly an attempt by a conservative group Accuracy in Academia to deny tenure to Dr Kurtz fizzled and the group was widely condemned The most heated campus controversy involved the arrests of hundreds of students including 182 on one day for demonstrations against the schools investments in South Africa The rallies were carried out in areas other than those that had been designated by the university and quickly evolved as the focus of a debate over free speech But perhaps just as much controversy was generated by conservatives through organizations such as Accuracy in Academia and The Texas Review a conservative newspaper which has sued the university because of restrictions on its distribution The West Mall area where many student groups tend to congregate usually includes clusters of undergradutes attacking the Administrations policies in Latin America others recruiting members for an organization of young Republicans and representatives of United Campuses to Prevent Nuclear War The Gay and Lesbian Student Association and The Young Conservatives of Texas Many students professors and administrators here attribute much of the activity to the policies of the Reagan Administration Another source of political activism is the campuss varied ethnic and racial mix There are scattered complaints that the school has failed to adequately recruit minorities but the university has a somewhat more varied student body than it had a decade ago The school is now 77 percent white as against 86 percent in 1976 Blacks still represent only 35 percent of the student body but their numbers have almost doubled since 1976 There have been comparable increases in the number of Hispanic students who now make up almost 9 percent of the student body Dr Ira Iscoe a psychology professor and director of the universitys honors program says that for all the sound and fury the campus political scene reflects many of the weaknesses of the national one There are groups talking about abortion nuclear arms Iran Nicaragua But its almost the same kind of specialinterest politics we see nationally he said There are a lot of things students can do about their own life but you never see much in the way of results
ART; OFFICE COMPLEX WITH AN EYE TO EXHIBITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/18/nyregion/art-office-complex-with-an-eye-to-exhibits.html,CORPORATIONS everywhere are turning their houses into homes with art collections as well as sponsoring exhibitions Landlords however have yet to join the cultural race in significant numbers which makes Blue Hill Plaza an office complex near Pearl River in Rockland County an unusual although not unique enterprise On 140 very pretty acres on Orangeburg Road Exit 6W on the Palisades Parkway it might have remained just an office complex had the Broadway Management Company not taken it over and turned part of the main floor into the Blue Hill Cultural Center The space begins in one lobby runs the length of a passage lined on one side with a brick wall and on the other with shops through an atrium that is a greenhouse complete with a waterfall and a sloping glass roof and ends in another lobby the size of a SoHo loft gallery Inaugurated two years ago with the showing of Douglas Ablahs Henry Moore Collection the center is now the host to A Matter of Scale an exhibit of about 60 photographs chosen by Ned Harris Jointly sponsored by the Rockland Center for the Arts in West Nyack and Blue Hill Plaza Associates the show will remain through June 10 Monday through Friday 9 AM to 5 PM Saturdays 8 AM to 2 PM The show should really be titled A Matter of Size because scale is as easily conveyed by small as large objects  Ruth ThorneThomsens tiny image of a large stone head dwarfing the ladders leaned against it is a perfect example Besides the selections chief purpose is to comment on the trend toward bigness in a medium that like printmaking in general was once an intimate alternative to painting Mr Harris notes in a statement that there is a veritable stampede of photographers competing for those large public spaces formerly reserved for paintings wall hangings and sculptures Russell Munsons blackandwhite photograph of melting ice measures 42 by 60 inches and his aerial shot of geese flying over a field patterned with snowdrifts is even larger James Caseberes Stonehouse a dramatically lighted facade which including the vine climbing over it was modeled by the photographer himself is a 60by40inch image also in black and white But most of the large works are so because they are printed over several panels as in Gilbert and Georges luridly colored selfportrait with four youths which measures overall about 8 by 6 12 feet or else because they are a series of small images such as Bernhard and Hilla Bechers views of nine allbutidentical gasometers the huge cylindrical tanks that Europeans use for storing gas Still there is bigness enough to make Mr Harriss thesis worth considering Eliot Porters exquisitely colored shots of trees and horsetail grasses are all the better for measuring 30 by 40 inches Sandy Skoglunds tableaux need their 30by40inch formats especially that of a man standing at a window seemingly oblivious to the babies suspended in the black void outside Titled Maybe Babies this could be read as a statement against abortion Even so most of these images would have been just as effective half the size which suggests that bigness in photography is merely part of the overall trend toward the grandiose and unworkable The small prints in any case hold their own particularly Imogen Cunninghams wellknown Triangles a study of a highlighted womans breast framed by fragments of her torso and limbs in shadow and Margaret BourkeWhites astonishing picture of innumerable spiders Other memorable contributions come from Jan Groover Dean Brown and Ann Sager There are signs that Mr Harris had trouble illustrating his point for he includes a 13 12by16 12 Ansel Adams of Mono Lake as an example of bigness but omits Duane Hanson whose prints are eloquent examples of smallness But a show that gets Lewis Carroll Robert Mapplethorpe and Robert Rauschenberg under the same roof along with several lesser knowns including the curator himself is not to be missed Apartheid is the subject of an exhibition at the Mount Vernon storefront that is headquarters for the Association of CommunityBased Artists of Westchester 124 South Fourth Avenue And the image that sums up the subject best is Adger Cowans blurred painting of a black mask with Soweto stenciled below Mr Cowan however has spaced out the word so that it can be pronounced so we too He is the author also of the sculpture that made out of a thick black gasket looks as much an instrument of torture as any of the welded pieces in Mel Edwardss Lynch series Even more pointed is Camille Akejus serigraph of a mans profile in which the black ink defining the forms of the head acts also as the blood dripping from it Nevertheless it soon becomes clear that apartheid is too vast an issue to get a grip on much less illuminate Like nuclear oblivion it is in any case a realm where art has been preempted by eyewitness photography proving this point is Harold Esannasons painting of a poorly dressed black woman pausing beside a brick wall with her two children Except for the slogans scrawled on the wall this is a copy of a photograph taken in the South more than 30 years ago by Consuelo Kanaga Inevitably therefore too many of the images  especially the collages done by Michael and Michelle Singletary and the quilted hangings of Dindga McCannon  make their impact first as art but only later if at all as protest But simply as an attempt by black artists to deal with an evil that directly affects them the first that this reviewer has seen the show is important And while most of the contributors work in disconcertingly different styles several are well worth checking out as artists in at least one  among them Linda Hywot with her landscapelike abstractions Ann Tanksley with her woman lying among flowers and Ademola Olugebefola with his black and white woodcut of two profiles confronting each other Through June

GRANTS INCREASE FOR WORK IN POPULATION AREA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/19/us/grants-increase-for-work-in-population-area.html,Wealthy foundations regarded as trendsetters are beginning to spend more money in a controversial area birth control contraceptive research and teenage sexuality The Robert Wood Johnson Foundation of New Jersey for one announced in April that it would provide 168 million over six years for clinics at schools to provide adolescents with comprehensive health care including pregnancy prevention services Public high schools in at least 20 cities are to be selected for the program to be operated by local medical facilities and guided by community committees Each community is to decide if contraceptives or abortion will be provided The Johnson Foundation is the countrys largest private philanthropy devoted to health but scores of smaller foundations around the country have also begun helping programs seeking to prevent teenage pregnancy Clinics based in schools are operating in 18 states as against a handful of clinics nationally in the 1970s They are springing up faster than I can count them said Sharon Lovick a program director of the Center for Population Options in Washington an advocacy group that has created a support center to train staff for these clinics New Momentum Is Seen The surge in foundation support for the clinics as well as for research in contraceptives and other family planning activities has created a new momentum said Dr Sheldon J Segal director of population sciences at the Rockefeller Foundation which along with the Ford Mellon and Hewlett foundations is a major provider of international financing for population activities Foundations are getting more involved because they see mechanisms around them that can be successful in population control and they are willing to back them he said No one likes to back something that is going to fail not politicians and not philanthropies One leading newcomer in the field is the Carnegie Corporation which is providing 4 million over two years for efforts to prevent first pregnancies in adolescents Carnegie is focusing on a younger population not yet sexually active than other foundations are If any foundation tackles it were the likely one to do it said Dr David A Hamburg a physician who is Carnegies president The foundation is widely regarded as one of the most influential in the United States for its work in early education Moves on TeenAge Pregnancy Carnegie is supporting a program still being developed by the Childrens Defense Fund of Washington to enlist black church groups in a campaign called Prevent Children Having Children Carnegie is also focusing on two junior high schools in a largely Hispanic neighborhood in Manhattans Washington Heights and is helping finance a program of the Center for Population Options to influence television and Hollywood producers on adolescent sexuality and pregnancy The Kaiser Family Foundation based in California is also entering this field inviting communities in 13 Western states to submit proposals on teenage pregnancy as part of a new 15 million national health program The MacArthur Foundation in Chicago one of the wealthiest American philanthropies is preparing for its first commitment in family planning in the range of 10 million to 15 million A number of other foundations prompted by the Reagan Administrations policy against giving money to foreign programs permitting abortion recently began or expanded financing of family planning efforts in third world countries The Noyes Foundation of New York for instance decided six months ago that it would support family planning in developing countries even though one of its directors acknowledged that 1 million annually from a small philanthropy was tiny amount in such efforts Few Grants in Early 1980s The expanding foundation support of family planning and population control appears to be a recent phenomenon An unpublished study by Margaret C Ayers executive director of the Robert Sterling Clark Foundation in New York found that 17 percent of all grants by 500 major foundations from 1980 to 1984 were devoted to population issues for a total of 112 million Comparable figures after 1984 are unavailable Less than 1 percent of the 112 million went to address teenage pregnancy promote sex education or family planning to conduct policy analysis or support advocacy to protect womens reproductive rights Miss Ayers said Of the 112 million 71 million came from the Ford Hewlett Mellon and Rockefeller foundations Relatively few of the 500 foundations studied gave substantial sums to advocacy groups such as those lobbying against efforts to eliminate Medicaid financing for abortion One exception was the Gund Foundation of Ohio whose director James S Libscomb said it regarded womens reproductive rights as both a civil right and a right that has a major impact on the role and progress of women in our society By contrast the DeRance Foundation of Wisconsin devoted its population grants to efforts against abortion Afraid of Controversy Jeannie Rosoff president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute said foundations support of family planning and prevention of teenage pregnancy was still limited Calling this irresponsible and shameful she said They like to see themselves as trailblazers when in fact they are afraid of controversy Very few are willing to take the heat or even come close to the stove Foundation spokesmen said their increased attention to this field particularly adolescent pregnancy stemmed in part from a Guttmacher study last year concluding that the United States had higher rates of teenage pregnancy abortion and childbearing than most other industrialized nations Now new ideas about adolescent pregnancy such as schoolbased clinics and broader sexeducation curriculum have captured the foundations attention said Joy Dryfoos a consultant to both the Rockefeller and Carnegie foundations It became respectable to fund prevention programs The Planned Parenthood Federation of America received 25 million from foundations last year double what it got in 1984 said its president Faye Wattleton In addition foundations gave 5 million to its 187 affiliates Bronx Center as a Model One undertaking attracting national attention is the Hub a bustling youth center in the South Bronx that was developed jointly by Planned Parenthood of New York City and the BronxLebanon Hospital with a grant from the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and minor support from a dozen smaller philanthropies The Hub which is being copied in other cities provides medical services weekly for 350 teenagers as well as job counseling computer training art and karate classes The aim is to keep teenagers in school build selfesteem and persuade them that an unwanted pregnancy limits choices A medical staff runs group discussions of contraceptives and a pregnant adolescent has the choice of prenatal care or an abortion Research on reproduction is also getting more foundation support stimulated said Dr Segal of Rockefeller by technological progress in improving contraceptives As an example he cited Norplant a hormone implant under the skin that protects against pregnancy for five years Norplant was developed by the Population Council a research group and is used in Scandinavia and Latin America The Ford Rockefeller and Mellon foundations are discussing creating a multinational consortium for contraceptive research that would also involve United Nations agencies According to participants in these talks progress is slow because European governments will not join unless the United States decides to contribute and because United Nations agencies disagree on how the consortium would be directed
LIABILITY CRISIS COMPLICATES CONTRACEPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/19/style/liability-crisis-complicates-contraception.html,Dr Louise Tryer sighed and hung up the telephone in her Seventh Avenue office at the Planned Parenthood Federation of America the other day The caller was a 38yearold woman who had been wearing a coppercovered intrauterine contraceptive device for the last three years Now it was due to be replaced but neither her gynecologist nor the family planning agencies she had visited would insert a new device What did Dr Tryer recommend I gave her the name of a doctor in Montreal but what can I say to the women who cant afford to go there said Dr Tryer who is Planned Parenthoods vice president for medical affairs She added that Canadian doctors are overwhelmed with professional American women coming up for IUDs The socalled Canadian connection is one solution to the contraception gap created by the recent decisions of drug companies to discontinue sales in the United States of the three most frequently prescribed intrauterine devices According to the National Center for Health Statistics about 22 million American women use IUDs They are the fifth most common form of contraception after voluntary sterilization birth control pills and condoms and diaphragms Removed From the Market In January 1986 GD Searle removed its widely used Copper 7 as well as another copper device Tatum7 from the market The company cited unwarranted product litigation and the difficulty of obtaining insurance Four months earlier the Ortho Pharmaceutical Corporation stopped selling a plastic device called the Lippes Loop terming production no longer economically feasible As a result the only IUD still being sold in this country is a littleused device that releases hormones in much the same way as a birth control pill Although the action affects only one contraceptive method family planning advocates say that its ramifications extend far beyond the IUD market in this country and that research on new methods has slowed down or stopped because of the unavailability of insurance Ortho and Searle decided to stop marketing their IUDs not because of new research findings indicating increased medical risk nor because of pressure from physicians or consumers to do so said Dr Jacqueline Darroch Forrest research director of the Alan Guttmacher Institute a research and education organization Indeed the national medical committee of Planned Parenthood and the Population Council were actively encouraging Searle to exercise its licensing rights and market an additional copperbearing IUD which the Food and Drug Administration had approved for US use in 1984 Product Liability Suits The problems for Searle and other manfacturers began more than a decade ago when product liability suits started flooding the courts The main target was AH Robins Company which filed for bankruptcy last year after 14000 users of its Dalkon Shield sought damages for pelvic infections sterility and other problems they attributed to the device Searle contended there was no comparison between its IUDs and the Dalkon Shield and many medical authorities agreed In April 1985 however The New England Journal of Medicine published two studies that suggested a link between IUDs and infertility Both studies agreed that plastic IUDs were associated with a higher incidence of infertility than the more widely used copper devices We never recommended that the IUD should not be used at all merely that it should not be used by a woman who had not had a child said Dr Daniel W Cramer author of one of the studies We probably speeded up the demise of the IUDs by the articles but they were headed that way because of the lawsuits Dr Cramer associate professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston which is affiliated with Harvard Medical School was among many doctors who expressed concern that the IUD had become a casualty of the product liability crisis He and others fear that loss of what was a safe and effective birth control method for most of its users  older mothers who are not candidates for the pill  will result in unwanted pregnancies and sterilizations under pressure Resort to Sterilization Many women are taking that route now Dr Cramer said Ive seen a fair number coming in here when the IUDs expire for sterilization The FDA which still approves the use of the Searle IUDs the Lippes Loop and others has stressed that women need not have them removed Nevertheless gynecologists say some patients have lost confidence in the devices and want them removed before the threeyear expiration date when they begin to lose their effectiveness Other patients however are asking doctors to sell them copper devices for future insertion But many doctors say they are unwilling to take the legal risk and most say they have returned their supply of unused devices at the manufacturers request The request has been widely interpreted by doctors to mean we no longer have any legal backup as Dr Enayat Elahi medical director of Planned Parenthoods New York City affiliate put it Its like the recall of a car he said If Ford sells you a car and then says send the car back you send it back Affiliates Have Choice Speaking for the Planned Parenthood Federation Dr Tryer said that it was up to each of its 187 affiliates to decide whether or not to continue inserting IUDs The federation has encouraged them to do so she said but some clinics particularly those in the northeast have stopped providing copper IUDs although others such as the New York clinics still offer the less effective Lippes Loop which can be worn without replacement until menopause I think some affiliates had more concern about medicallegal risks than about the needs of the patients theyre serving Dr Tryer said These patients are really in a bind Either theyre going to have to be sterilized or take the pill which puts them at considerably increased risk after age 40 or theyre going to have to use one of the barrier methods which have a failure rate among average users in the first year of from 10 to 19 percent For a lot of women thats absolutely unacceptable particularly those who wouldnt consider abortion Private gynecologists are no less concerned although some like Dr Benny Pascario of Manhattan have the sort of patients who can afford to go out of the country for an IUD I had a patient here today who said Whats the big deal Ill go up to Canada and have one inserted  he said adding that other patients were upset and even outraged when he explained that he could not replace their IUDs Its one more example of how the consumer is being hurt by the malpractice crisis Dr Pascario added No sane physician would dare give an

GRANDMOTHER GETS THE BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/us/grandmother-gets-the-bill.html,The first person ordered to pay child support under a state law holding grandparents liable for their teenage childrens offspring says it is hard to teach children right from wrong these days The grandparent Jean Mayberry 42 years old of Beaver Dam was ordered last month to pay 30 a month to support her 1yearold grandson until her daughter turns 18 in six months Her exhusband was ordered to pay 280 a month Nowadays Mrs Mayberry said this week kids can tell you what to do because they have the law behind them When Mrs Mayberrys daughter applied for public assistance officials found she was unwed and the family was asked to appear in court under the new measure The order was the first to test a new law aimed at reducing the number of teenage pregnancies Under the measure believed to be the only one of its kind in the nation grandparents of an infant born to unmarried minors can be forced to support the baby until the parents turn 18 get married or join the armed services I dont think its right Mrs Mayberry said Her daughter could not be reached for comment despite repeated calls but Mrs Mayberry said her daughter was also unhappy with the new law because she probably would have received more money under public assistance The father of the infant is not a minor so his parents do not have to pay support Mrs Mayberry said a court hearing is scheduled next week to determine if the father should pay support Im going to try to teach my other children right from wrong but theyll do whatever they want to do anyway she said adding she has three other teenage children The grandparent liability law was included in a 10part measure drawn up last year by various groups some of which favor and others of which oppose the right to abortion The law which went into effect Jan 1 also provides increased money for a state adoption center and pregnancy counseling and it prohibits trespassing at abortion clinics John Hartman Dodge County District Attorney handled the case in Beaver Dam about 50 miles northwest of Milwaukee He said he had expected court challenges to the grandparent liability measure but none had been filed That portion of the new law expires in 1989 so its effects can be studied
DEMOCRATS ATTACK REJECTION OF WOMEN'S BOARD NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/nyregion/democrats-attack-rejection-of-women-s-board-nominee.html,LAST weeks vote by the County Board of Legislators in which the Republican majority rejected a nominee for the Womens Advisory Board has angered womens rights groups and led some Democratic legislators to accuse their colleagues of McCarthyism The furor has also drawn attention to the advisory board a twoyearold diverse coalition of 37 members representing a broad spectrum of womens interests The Republican legislators rejected the nominee Cheryl TateLambert on the advice of the County Boards Committee on County Officers and Departments headed by Stephen P Tenore a RepublicanConservative from New Rochelle When Mrs TateLambert was originally considered by Mr Tenores committee she described herself as an active member of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion That organization Mr Tenore said regularly works against the election of most members of the County Legislature and had misrepresented those legislators views on abortion According to Mr Tenore the rejection of the nominee had nothing to do with her position on the abortion issue The appointee chose he said to make an issue of her political activism against the elected officials she would be advising The womens board role is to advise the Board of Legislators and the County Executive on womens issues Denying that she had ever worked against the election of Mr Tenore or any county legislator Mrs TateLambert an accountant with Merrill Lynch relocation management in Harrison and a Yonkers resident said she had lobbied for legal abortion at the state and Federal levels Her efforts had intensified in recent years Mrs TateLabert said after her younger sister died in what she called a backalley abortion mill Declining to describe his own position on abortion Mr Tenore said in an interview last week Abortion is not a county issue and it is irresponsible for any politician to grandstand on one side of the issue or another to grab votes Mr Tenore said that he had never received the endorsement of the Right to Life Party and added that he would refuse to accept its endorsement One hour after the vote of the full County Board Mr Tenores committee considered and unanimously approved a second nominee for the advisory board Dr Zelle W Andrews executive director of the Federated Conservationists of Westchester County who is a member of the boards of several womens rights organizations and the former head of the New York State chapter of the National Organization for Women Dr Andrews a historian said she was also a sponsor of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion The approval of Dr Andrews led the Democratic minority leader Sandra R Galef who was observing the proceedings to ask Hows that for consistency The Womens Advisory Board Chairman Sharon A Frayne who also observed the proceedings said she was mystified by the committees action I do not understand but the committees action is truly impeding the progress of our board and will make our future not impossible but more difficult Following the County Boards rejection of her nomination last week Mrs TateLambert said she would fight to gain a seat on the Womens Advisory Board I did not work against Mr Tenore last fall she added as I didnt have the time but I certainly would have if Id had the time Mrs TateLambert said the Republican legislators had made her a scapegoat because of their resentment toward the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion Audrey G Hochberg a Democratic legislator from Scarsdale and member of Mr Tenores committee said to accuse Mrs TateLambert of misrepresenting members of the Board of Legislators because of her membership in the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion is to charge guilt by association and thats tantamount to McCarthyism In a news release Legislator John W DeMarco a Democrat of White Plains also characterized the action as McCarthyism Mrs Hochberg said Theres no difference between Sheryl TateLambert and Zelle Andrews except Mrs TateLabert became a scapegoat in the Republican attempt to get even with the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion Any time you have elected officials creating a scapegoat because a reputable organization wont allow them to sit on the fence on an important issue it is a defect in the caliber of government and the public should be concerned The controversy may hurt the advisory board itself Mrs Hochberg said Although the advisory board she said has provided nothing helpful to the legislators so far the potential is always there County Executive Andrew P ORourke in January 1984 established the Womens Advisory Board to advise the legislators after he disbanded an earlier womens group the Womens Council saying that it did not represent a true crosssection of womens opinion in the county The major achievement of the new board according to its Mrs Frayne has been to create a Womens Hall of Fame Change doesnt happen overnight Mrs Frayne said adding that the Womens Advisory Board is preparing a series of recommendations for Mr ORourke to consider submitting to the county legislators Chief among them she said are seeking changes in conditions for women at the County Jail a wellness curriculum for junior high schools countywide an effort to increase awareness about problems associated with teenage suicides and proposals for reducing homelessness At last weeks meeting of the Womens Advisory Board the group also agreed on a series of recommendations urging the County Executive to consider appointing qualified women to commissionerlevel posts in the county and to establish search committees for those positions that would include members of the advisory board Sally Ziegler executive director of the Child Care Council of Westchester is also chairman of the advisory boards subcommittee on children and families Mrs Ziegler said her committee has helped start three latchkey programs or afterschool childcare programs in Peekskill Bedford and Irvington Members of the committee she said had served as leaders in their communities to develop the programs There hasnt been a lot accomplished on the advisory board as a whole Mrs Ziegler said The board is too big and cumbersome and at nearly every discussion we tend to break into camps When she first proposed the latchkey program Mrs Ziegler said she was surprised to find that it too was controversial There are members with strong feelings about women working she added Mrs Ziegler was also critical of the Board of Legislators which she said hasnt used us at all She said the County Board had recently sent a daycare proposal to Albany without checking with anybody Terry Kornbluh coordinator for the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion responded to Mr Tenores charges by saying Mr Tenore says prochoice is not a county issue Well prochoice is a county issue and county legislators have voted on this issue four times While the county legislators have no power to regulate abortion Mrs Kornbluh said they have recommended that the New York State Legislature pass a constitutional amendment overturning Roe v Wade the legalabortion decision and theyve also passed a resolution supporting an antichoice minors bill restricting minors access to abortion Mr Tenore does not have the luxury not to state his position Mrs Kornbluh said adding The role of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion is to find out candidates positions and tell the public so the public can use this information to judge who to vote for The Westchester Coalition has an impeccable reputation for doing this job thoroughly Mr Tenore spoke to the coalitions executive director Polly Rothstein before last Novembers election and Mrs Kornbluh said He told her his views and her assessment is that Mr Tenore is antichoice In an interview last week Mrs Rothstein confirmed that Mr Tenore had told her that he was antiabortion Mr Tenore used Cheryl TateLambert as a scapegoat to get at the coalition Mrs Kornbluh said adding He is angry because we campaigned for his opponent Mr Tenore does not want the public to know hes antichoice and hes afraid because he must know the county is prochoice Mr Tenore accuses us of misrepresenting his position Well then Mr Tenore should tell us if his position is different

FROM CRUSADE TO CAMPAIGN IN MICHIGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/25/weekinreview/from-crusade-to-campaign-in-michigan.html,WHAT began in Michigan as the first test of strength between Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F Kemp of New York is now being closely watched for another at least as significant result the ability of the Rev Pat Robertson to mobilize thousands of evangelical Christians as a statewide political force If his drive here is successful it could have major implications not only for the 1988 Presidential race but for the future of the Republican Party The religious right increasingly at odds with local Republican establishments has made political breakthroughs in Minnesota and other states with far less of an effort than is being made here by followers of Mr Robertson a television evangelist from Virginia Beach Va who says the Michigan outcome will be weighed heavily in his decision on whether to seek the Presidency Unlike Mr Bush and Mr Kemp who have delivered mostly pep talks to groups of party regulars Mr Robertson is trying to pull conservatives in both parties as well as independents into his tent His preachings against abortion and pornography coupled with his call for school prayer have been bringing large audiences throughout the state to their feet The first indication of how the Robertson effort is going will be known next Tuesday the deadline for qualifying candidates for thousands of Republican precinct delegate slots at stake in Michigans primary on Aug 5 The election of the delegates officially uncommitted to any candidate is the first and most important step in the states process for choosing its 77 delegates to the Republican National Convention year after next The Freedom Council a taxexempt group founded by Mr Robertson in 1981 is conducting its campaign for precinct candidates on the same scale as the Bush and Kemp organizations To get around Federal campaign finance laws Mr Bush and Mr Kemp are cloaking their activities as partybuilding exercises And Mr Robertson contends that both parties will benefit from his efforts to get more bornagain Christians involved in politics A Possible Spillover A strong showing by the Robertson forces in Michigan could spill over into other states including Iowa where the evangelist has been organizing his followers and making contributions to farm groups Such a development some party strategists say almost certainly would increase the influence of evangelicals in the early phase of the 1988 Republican Presidential primary campaign The first three states to choose Presidential nominating delegates in 1988 will be Iowa Michigan and New Hampshire In Iowa last month evangelical activists won voting control of the Republican Party convention in Polk County which includes Des Moines and is the most populous and politically dominant county in the state While the infusion of the newstyle activists has brought new vitality to the Republican Party it also has created rising tensions as the partys old guard resist the efforts of evangelicals to take control of local and state parties Evangelical forces now control the Independent Republican organizations in several Congressional districts in Minnesota and are asserting their influence in party affairs in a number of other states The challenge to party regulars also extends to the election front In the May 6 primary election in Indiana evangelical forces scored two striking victories against Congressional candidates backed by the local party leadership In the Fifth Congressional District primary James Butcher a State Senator and evangelical Christian defeated state Treasurer Julian Ridlen for the Republican nomination Mr Ridlen a veteran party loyalist had been endorsed by 13 of the districts 14 Republican county chairmen Even more surprising was the victory of the Rev Donald Lynch a Nazarene minister over Jay Wickliff a longtime Republican fundraiser in Indianas Second Congressional District Both Mr Butcher and the Rev Lynch bypassed the party structure by mobilizing hundreds of church laymen and ministers to help them spread their conservative message In Oregons Republican Senate primary on Tuesday a similiar strategy enabled the Rev Joe Lutz a poorlyfinanced Baptist minister making his first political race to win 43 percent of the vote against Senator Bob Packwood Some analysts say the increasing activism of evangelicals who represent a constituency that includes many lowincome people with populist instincts could pose a major threat to the political character of the Republican Party They also fear that the religious rights preoccupation with social issues could alienate young voters and other new constitutencies who have become tenuous members of the Republican coalition that have produced the Reagan landslides I sense that the party establishments are getting a little nervous about evangelicals saying we want to get involved in party politics said Curtis Maynard an official of the American Coalition for Traditional Values an umbrella organization of Christian right organizations Weve begun to realize that if we are going to have an impact we have take our involvement in politics beyond voting
Congressional Research Service; How Your Tax Dollars Help Do Term Papers,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/28/us/congressional-research-service-how-your-tax-dollars-help-do-term-papers.html,When Terri Bower a high school junior from Finksburg Md needed help with a paper on the Soviet Union she asked her history teacher where to look He told her to write to Congress She sent a letter to several Capitol Hill offices including those of Senators Richard G Lugar the Indian Republican who is chairman of the Foreign Relations Committee and Charles McC Mathias Jr Republican of Maryland The letter said she was a high school student writing a term paper and asked seven broad questions such as Do the Soviets expect specific goods and acts in return for giving foreign aid or is it given more to promote their economic and political system Each office referred the letter to the Congressional Research Service an arm of the Library of Congress which compiled a stack of pamphlets newspaper and magazine articles addressing Miss Bowers questions These were then forwarded to her The responses were great said Miss Bower adding that the new information helped her write a much better term paper Lots of teachers say that if you cant find information you should write to your Congressman because thats what theyre there for With a 1986 budget of 373 million and a staff of more than 500 research and information specialists the research service serves a main function of helping Congressional and committee staffs get quick and thorough information on matters pertaining to legislation A secondary function is to help Congress with one of its main priorities answering constituent mail But sometimes say some Congressional staff members the secondary function gets a little out of hand especially when research requests come in from students A Whole Class Heard From A whole elementary school class wrote in asking for information on all 50 states said Bill Aseltyne a legislative assistant to Representative Sander M Levin Democrat of Michigan Their letters said I am doing a paper on Nebraska and cannot get to the school library please send me all the information you can We figure the teacher wrote the letter on the board and told the students to copy it We referred the requests to CRS a few at a time Research service officials say they are aware of some abuse of the system but cannot say how extensive it is because they often do not know for sure whether the request originated with a legislator or a constituent There are some constituent requests that just arent appropriate for us to do said Nancy Davenport coordinator of the Member and Committee Relations Office at the research service But the service does not consider it within its jurisdiction to inquire why requests are made The question is not whether or not we think the requests are appropriate Miss Davenport said but whether or not the Congress thinks so Requests Hard to Refuse Congressional offices are not supposed to ask the service to provide students with information already available in their school or public library The problem Congressional staff members say is that students nevertheless often ask for data that are available elsewhere or require a special effort to dig up And legislators being legislators hesitate to turn down requests from the children of the people who put them in office For the most popular topics like abortion and arms control the research service has prepared Infopaks to send to legislators and constituents We dont provide term papers said Miss Davenport although she added the service does offer pamphlets on how to use a library and how to get bibliographical information In response to new cuts that have pared its budget by 3 million from 1985 the research service is trying to streamline its operations and will no longer accept rush priorities on constituent requests But this too is difficult to enforce If we need something really quickly sometimes well say its for office use when its really for a constituent Mr Aseltyne said It is a very common practice The research service has also barred Congressional interns many of whom are college students working temporarily on Capitol Hill from asking for information over the telephone They are now required to make requests in person In the past some interns say they often asked the service to do research for friends or for their own school projects
EVANGELIST MAY LEAD IN PRELUDE TO MICHIGAN RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/28/us/evangelist-may-lead-in-prelude-to-michigan-race.html,The Rev Pat Robertson a television evangelist who is considering a Presidential bid in 1988 appeared to score a major breakthrough yesterday in Michigans delegateselection process Marlene Elwell the state coordinator for Freedom Council a taxexempt foundation founded by Mr Robertson said last night that preliminary figures indicated that 3000 to 4000 supporters of the council had qualified to run for precinct delegate slots in the states primary Aug 5 Supporters of Vice President Bush estimated that his Michigan effort could account for 4000 to 4500 candidates Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York appeared to be headed for a thirdplace finish with his supporters saying they expected to have 2000 to 3000 candidates on the ballot when the numbers are known Candidates Officially Uncommitted The exact number of candidates probably will not be known until later in the week and even then the picture will still be confusing because the candidates will officially be running uncommitted to any Presidential hopeful At this early stage of the process some political strategists say the psychological momentum of the Michigan exercise could be its most significant result What weve done is phenomenal said Mrs Elwell a veteran political worker and antiabortion activist Not all of our districts are in yet but what weve gotten so far are good solid figures from our people It looks like were going to wind up with between three to four thousand candidates Mr Robertson has said the outcome in Michigan would weigh heavily in his decision on whether to seek the Presidency in 1988 Although he said that his Freedom Council activities were aimed at getting evangelical Christians involved in politics the apparent success of his effort here could have major implications for the Presidential contest The message here is that grassroots people were told they have a place in politics and they accepted the challenge said Mrs Elwell Many Claim Victory Although only preliminary and unofficial figures were available last night on the number of candidates for precinct delegates everyone seemed to be claiming a victory of some kind Officials of the organization backing Mr Bush said its candidate recruitment effort appeared to match their expectations Bill Phillips executive director of the Fund for Americas Future the political action committee set up by Mr Bush said We dont have any totals but Id say it was an overwhelming success from our standpoint Mr Phillips said it appeared from field reports that as many as 9000 candidates a record qualified for the precinct delegate posts by the filing deadline of 4 PM yesterday From talking to our field people I think we were responsible for about half of them he said W Clark Durant 3d a Detroit lawyer who is Mr Kemps principal political agent in the state said candidate numbers aside the Kemp forces had accomplished their major goal The important thing is the energy that is generated here to challenge the assumption that Bush has it locked up he said The August election of precinct delegates will be the first and most important step in the process of choosing the states 77 delegates to the Republican National Convention in 1988 Because Michigan plans to be among the first states to choose its national convention delegates Mr Bush Mr Kemp and Mr Robertson made a major effort to recruit precinct delegate candidates to show support for their prospective candidacies

"JOHN PAUL, ISSUING FIFTH ENCYCLICAL, ATTACKS MARXISM",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/05/31/world/john-paul-issuing-fifth-encyclical-attacks-marxism.html,Pope John Paul II issued the fifth encyclical of his papacy today denouncing Marxism and other forms of philosophical materialism as ideologies that portray God as an enemy of his own creature In the 141page document brimming with references to Satan and to the coming of the third millennium John Paul sought to focus the attention of Roman Catholics on the Holy Spirit the mysterious third person of the Trinity whom Christians revere along with the Father and the Son as the one God The encyclical Dominum et Vivificantem The Lord and Giver of Life is a highly personal revery by John Paul on one of the richest but most elusive concepts of the Christian faith  in the Popes words the hidden God who is the Holy Spirit Harsh Critique of Modern World But John Paul as is his habit used these reflections to undergird a harsh critique of the modern world with its signs and symptoms of death and of ideologies he sees as destroying a spiritual vision of humanity He underscored the importance he ascribed to his message by issuing it as an encyclical which is the most formal teaching instrument of the papacy In principle and in fact materialism radically excludes the presense and action of God who is spirit in the world and above all in man he wrote Fundamentally this is because it does not accept Gods existence Marxism Is Attacked Resistance to the Holy Spirit the Pope said reaches its clearest expression in materialism and is carried to its most extreme practical consequences in dialectical and historical materialism which is still recognized as the essential core of Marxism A materialist worldview the Pope said dismissed religion as a kind of idealistic illusion to be fought with the most suitable means and methods according to circumstances of time and place in order to eliminate it from society and from mans very heart The encyclical reflected both the Popes intense study of Marxism and his experience as an Archbishop in Poland There he confronted both a Communist Government intent on limiting the power of the church and an intellectually vibrant Catholic community that sought to counter the materialist theories of Marxism The Popes reaction to Marxism elsewhere in the world including Latin America has been heavily influenced by his belief that Communist regimes necessarily limit religious freedom and often seek to divide Christians His choice of an encyclical to make his point is in a long tradition of such documents In his 1981 encyclical Laborem Exercens On Human Work he emphasized the churchs commitment to the rights of labor at a time when the Solidarity union movement in Poland was near its height Echoes 1891 Encyclical This encyclical in turn echoed one from Pope Leo XIII  Rerum Novarum Of New Things in 1891 which represented the Roman Catholic Churchs first clear statement of its support for the rights of working people At a news conference called to explain the new encyclical the Rev Umberto Betti a Vatican theological expert said it should be seen alongside two of the Popes earlier encyclicals as a trilogy on the Trinity In Redemptor Hominis in 1979 the Pope treated the theme of Christ as Redeemer of Man and in Dives in Misericordia in 1980 John Paul spoke on the mercy of God the Father The Popes other two encyclicals were Laborem Exercens and Slavorum Apostoli The Apostles of the Slavs last year on Christianity in Eastern Europe Composed in Polish Father Betti said the Pope had composed the new encyclical in his native Polish then translated it into Italian from which all the other official translations came He said the Pope had first conceived of an encyclical on the Holy Spirit in 1982 and began writing it last year The Holy Spirit is in many ways the most abstract ethereal expression of Gods existence in Christian theology The coming of the Holy Spirit was promised by Jesus and his descent on the Pentecost 50 days after Easter renewed the Apostles faith according to the Scriptures and empowered them to heal the sick speak in tongues and prophesy The Holy Spirit is believed by Catholics to guide the church and to deliver it from error In his encyclical the Pope often refers to the Counselor who is continually at work in the church The Popes decision to highlight the importance of the Holy Spirit was also significant because of his longterm goal of reuniting Catholicism and Eastern Orthodoxy Holy Spirit Was an Issue The main theological issue  there were also political questions  that led to the break between Orthodoxy and Roman Catholicism in 1054 was the nature of the Holy Spirit The dispute was over the inclusion of the word filioque in the Creed to assert that the Holy Spirit proceeded not only from God the Father but also from the Son To the Orthodox this downgraded the role of the Spirit to a position below that of Christ The Pope underlined his desire for reunion with Eastern Orthodoxy by noting that the current millenium at the beginning of which the split took place was about to come to an end John Pauls encyclical underlined what has emerged as perhaps the single most important theme of his pontificate his insistent assertion of the primacy of the spiritual over the material and his consequent fears for a world he sees as turning its back on God Related to this is his belief as expressed in the encyclical that modern men and women do not understand the difference between good and evil reflected in the loss of the sense of sin Cites Death of God Theologies The Pope saw signs of the turning away from God in the death of God theologies which were briefly popular in the 1960s The rejection of God has reached the point of declaring his death An absurdity both in concept and expression the Pope wrote But the ideology of the death of God is more a threat to man Citing the teachings of the Second Vatican Council 196265 the Pope declared that without the Creator the creature would disappear and that when God is forgotten the creature itself grows unintelligible The loss of God and of any sense of sinfulness the Pope said resulted in the signs and symptoms of death visible on the horizon of contemporary civilization These included the inherent danger of nuclear selfdestruction as well as the grave situation of vast areas of our planet marked by deathdealing poverty and famine It is a question of problems that are not only economic but also and above all ethical he said Pressure to Reject God Referring repeatedly to Satan as the father of lies John Paul argued that throughout the history of humanity there will be a constant pressure on man to reject God even to the point of hating him Man he continued will be inclined to see in God primarily a limitation on himself and not the source of his own freedom and the fullness of good The Pope also used the encyclical for one of his sharpest attacks on abortion and euthanasia On the horizon of our era there are gathering even darker signs of death he said A custom has become widely established  in some places it threatens to become almost an institution of taking the lives of human beings even before they are born or before they reach the natural point of death

RELIGIOUS RIGHT CHALLENGING G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/02/us/religious-right-challenging-gop.html,The sudden emergence of the Rev Pat Robertson and the religious right in Presidential politics means Republicans must reassess their strategies for 1988 their advisers and political experts say Although the 55yearold television evangelists appeal to voters has yet to be tested political experts say that in some key states his candidacy could hurt Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York the partys leading contenders They were upstaged last week when about 4500 supporters of the Freedom Council a group founded by Mr Robertson qualified to run for precinct delegate slots in Michigans Aug 5 primary The primary is the first phase of the process for selecting the states delegates to the 1988 Republican National Convention and the groups success deprived either Mr Bush or Mr Kemp of a clear victory Ammunition for Conservatives Political experts said further successes for the religious right would give the partys hardline conservatives new ammunition for persuading a candidate more to their liking to seek the nomination One who might heed their call is Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada who has said he would consider a Presidential bid if a strong contender did not emerge by early next year Robert Teeter a Detroitbased polltaker who is one of Mr Bushs closest advisers said any strategy for the nomination would have to consider the potential of a Robertson candidacy He said such a candidacy could mobilize the religious right as an unpredictable element in the primary campaign He said the religious right was likely to have less influence in primary elections than in party caucuses and conventions which are more easily dominated by activist groups They also have greater significance in multicandidate races he said adding that in a crowded field if Robertson only got 5 or 6 percent of the vote that could be important Setting Partys Agenda Mr Robertson has said he would decide late this year or early next year whether to enter the race A Kemp adviser said Mr Robertson obviously had to be figured into the equation at this point although Im not sure what changes if any we need to make in our game plan One thing we are not ready to do is concede the evangelical vote to Pat Robertson The first delegates to the 1988 Republican National Convention will be chosen in the Iowa caucuses and at Michigans state Republican convention In Michigan last week the Bush organization said it filed as many candidates as the Robertson group The Kemp forces said they had 3400 candidates although they admit that they are counting some of the same candidates the Robertson camp is counting One Republican strategist who supports Mr Bush said that if Mr Robertson was a candidate his rivals would have to try to keep him from setting the agenda for the political debate It would be a mistake for the others to try to outdo Robertson on abortion and the kind of social issues that energize his followers the strategist said Network of Activists The potential of the religious right to influence Presidential politics rests in part on its network of activists a communications operation that includes cable television networks and directmail computers and a political gospel that stresses conservative values patriotism and social issues No other interest group has the kind of unchallenged access to the audience they want to reach said Jeffrey Hadden a sociologist at the University of Virginia and author of the book Prime Time Preachers In Mr Robertson the movement has the promise of a national political leader one who presides over an organization built around a cable television network supported by millions of viewers and contributors Some analysts say however that the religious right is not likely to be a monolithic political force even if Mr Robertson should enter the Presidential scramble The Rev Jerry Falwell another politically active evangelist already has endorsed Mr Bush for President and aides to Mr Kemp say that he has strong support from the religious right The first problem is defining the evangelical group said Mr Teeter If you take the people who fit the general definition of evangelicals that could be 30 percent of the country and that includes a very large chunk of blacks who vote overwhelmingly Democratic Even so Mr Teeter said evangelical and fundamentalist Christians are a major political constituency that had to be considered by strategists in the 1988 Presidential campaign Theyre there the numbers are impressive and they have the technology to communicate with each other he said Tensions in Republican Party In the 1980 campaign Ronald Reagan met in Dallas and gave his blessing to the political action movement of a group of evangelical Christians who advocated bloc voting for candidates who shared their views That movement a major element of the Reagan coalition now has begun to create tensions within the Republican Party as the religious right runs candidates in Congressional races and challenges party regulars for control of local and state Republican organizations The religious right could be an important source of support and political energy one Republican polltaker said but it also could turn on the party in a costly way This polltaker who asked not to be identified said Its an asset in that it is a new identifiable homogeneous and active political constituency that can be easily mobilized It has its own communications network fundraising operations and cadre of leaders The risk he added was that the religious right was likely to dwell on the wrong issues including abortion and school prayer and could alienate younger voters and independents Network Reaches Millions Mr Robertson a polished performer who was educated at the London School of Economics and Yale University is a member of a prominent Virginia family and is the best known and most successful of the television preachers His Christian Broadcasting Network reaches about 16 million households each month and brings in more than 200 million annually in donations He is the host of The 700 Club a religious talk show that appears four times a day and is the centerpiece of his networks programming His primary political organization is the Freedom Council a taxexempt educational foundation with a staff of 50 an annual budget of 55 million and 60000 duespaying members Influence Said to Vary Richard Minard the councils national director said it was nonpartisan but acknowledged in an interview that Mr Robertson stood to benefit from its work in Michigan Kevin Phillips a Republican analyst said the influence of the religious right would vary greatly from state to state Its going to easiest for them to be an influence in primary elections in states in the North and Midwest that have strong Republican traditions states like Michigan Iowa and Minnesota he said In the South he added their greatest impact would be in general elections Thats because in the South youre dealing with a lot of lowincome bluecollar people who have to vote in Democratic primaries if they want to have a role in electing sheriffs mayors and local officeholders he said It remains to be seen how many of the candidates recruited by the Freedom Council will be elected to delegate posts in Michigan and how many of them are committed to Mr Robertson But the momentum he gained there is certain to aid his political fundraising and organizing efforts in states like Iowa Florida and North Carolina all early Presidential battlegrounds Said one Bush supporter Robertson showed he can be effective in a small universe situation where a few thousand people can make a difference There is no event in the near future to counter what happened in Michigan Until there is Robertson is going to loom as a bigger force than any of us ever thought he would be
COLLEGES USE HONORARY DEGREES TO RAISE ISSUES RATHER THAN ENDOWMENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/02/nyregion/colleges-use-honorary-degrees-to-raise-issues-rather-than-endowments.html,Honorary degrees traditionally bestowed by American colleges and universities during commencement season as a way to note academic or civic accomplishments are increasingly being used to take positions on political social and moral issues At the commencement exercises of the John Jay College of Criminal Justice yesterday an honorary degree was awarded in absentia to Winnie Mandela a leading antiapartheid activist in South Africa and the wife of Nelson Mandela imprisoned leader of the outlawed African National Congress In doing so the school acknowledged her role in resisting what the official citation called the cruelty and injustice of South Africas racist regime At its commencement ceremonies last month Russell Sage College in Troy NY gave an honorary degree to the disarmament advocate Dr Helen Caldicott citing her opposition to the worlds nuclear madness and thanking her for awakening us to the impending suicide of our planet and its people Such citations signal a marked departure from the customary role of honorary degrees as a way to thank philanthropists for contributions alumni and public officials for efforts in behalf of the school or even as a way to gather publicity through the presence of a celebrity South Africa Draws Attention The issue attracting most attention this year appears to be South Africa and its system of apartheid or racial separation Colleges have been under pressure from students and faculty members to divest themselves of stock in companies active in South Africa and to take other steps to distance themselves from the whiteminority government there There have been increasing numbers of South Africans honored with honorary degrees in recent years said Jennifer Davis executive director of the American Committee on Africa an antiapartheid group that has been active on many campuses It is an important recognition of the new stage of struggle in South Africa and an important step for American consciousness In addition to Mrs Mandela institutions in the New York area have awarded honorary degrees to Bishop Desmond M Tutu who was the main commencement speaker at Hunter College last Thursday and Helen Suzman a white opposition member of the South African Parliament Other honorees this spring include the Rev Beyers Naude an Afrikaner cleric who was put under house arrest by the South African Government in 1977 after reversing his position and denouncing apartheid The playwright Athol Fugard received honorary degrees from the University of Pennsylvania and the City University of New York last month and Roman Catholic Archbishop Denis E Hurley of Durban a particularly outspoken critic of his Governments resettlement policy will be honored later this month by De Paul University in Chicago and the University of Santa Clara in California A Moral Context What we are trying to do is put the political statement in a moral context and make it an educational experience for our students and community said the president of Santa Clara the Rev William Rewak This is a seething public issue right now about which there has been a great deal of discussion on our campus and we want to be on record A professor of anthropology at Hunter College and member of the committee that picks recipients of honorary degrees there Daniel Bates said that even if political events had not taken such a serious turn we would have been delighted to honor Bishop Tutu But he said that a highminded statement on South Africa has more impact when it is made by a college like Hunter One thing a college tries to do is draw attention to the things it stands for Dr Bates said This college is a public institution that is more than 50 percent black and Hispanic so this is a meaningful question to our students who have been discriminated against themselves Other Issues South Africa is not the only issue being addressed Universities have also used honorary degrees this spring to comment on matters such as nuclear disarmament Central America the Philippines and abortion There are even instances of colleges rescinding offers of honorary degrees on what they see as an issue of conscience Quincy College in Quincy Ill last month withdrew an honorary Doctor of Laws degree and commencement speech invitation to Senator Alan J Dixon an Illinois Democrat after what it called careful scrutiny of his views on abortion It was felt that the voting record of the Senator reflects positions incompatible with the philosophy of Quincy College according to a statement issued in the name of the school which is a Roman Catholic institution Mr Dixon has said he does not favor abortion but does not favor a Constitutional amendment barring abortions Of the several thousand honorary degrees being awarded this commencement season most are still of the traditional variety according to educators and administrators At some schools in fact students and faculty have been unable to overcome barriers to awarding honorary degrees to controversial political figures At the University of Michigan for example a campaign by some students and faculty members to honor Mr Mandela failed this year In protest a small alternative commencement was held at which student leaders noted that the university had earlier awarded honorary degrees to Ferdinand E Marcos then the President of the Philippines and the Shah of Iran University officials said it was not possible to award Mr Mandela an honorary degree because of requirements that any recipient be present when the award is made But Mr Mandelas supporters argued that a change in the bylaws could have been made if regents and the degrees committee had been willing A spokesman for the university Robert A Potter said an honorary degree for Mr Mandela had not been rejected outright His name remains on the active list and the university will consider proposals to waive the bylaw that worked against him Mr Potter said
ABOUT EDUCATION; PANEL OF EXPERTS SEES TREND TOWARD 'SMARTER' TEXTBOOKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/science/about-education-panel-of-experts-sees-trend-toward-smarter-textbooks.html,THE dumbing down of textbooks  a phrase coined by former Secretary of Education Terrel H Bell  may at last have bottomed out and a smartening up trend may be on its way A panel of experts who reviewed the 31 most frequently used junior and senior high school American history textbooks reported last week that recent improvements in the texts have been dramatic We happily note a reversal in an apparent trend to water down school history said the chairman of the panel O L Davis Jr professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Texas The panel rated 13 of the books good to excellent and 12 others satisfactory The other six were rated poor Most of these new 1986 US history books are very good some are excellent Professor Davis said He added The United States is presented in a postive light by all of the textbooks we studied At the same time these books do not attempt to obscure recognizable blemishes in the story of our nations continuing progress Most of the books he said stress intellectual understanding of major principles and concepts and common loyalties in our nations heritage but they do not indoctrinate The reviews most serious criticism is that even the best books fail to give adequate coverage to the role of religion in American life The panel also criticized the excessive attention given to readability formulas that dictate the use of short words and sentences which ironically make the books less readable The reviewers said they found the earlier tendency to avoid issues largely remedied The role of black Americans is no longer neglected they said but the treatment of women people of Hispanic origin Asians and American Indians is still inadequate Hispanic Americans whose ancestors were the first European explorers and settlers within the nations current boundaries the panel says are still being ignored or only casually mentioned even though they will constitute this countrys largest ethnic group by the end of this century The role of women in Americas history and how women feel about their part in it and about their lives the review adds deserves greater attention Some books were also criticized as bloodless in their effort to ignore that warfare that employs spears of atomic bombs is brutal ugly and violent To depict it in any other form is only bad history the panel said Despite its attention to such shortcomings the panel was encouraged by the general improvement of American history texts While no individual ratings were given to the books the reviewers cited several as outstanding among them A History of the United States Since 1861 Ginn and Company The American Nation Beginnings Through Reconstruction and Reconstruction to the Present Harcourt Brace Jovanovich Triumph of the American Nation Harcourt Brace Jovanovich History of the American People Holt Rinehart and Winston and America The Glorious Republic in two volumes Houghton Mifflin The review was commissioned by People for the American Way a nonprofit organization that describes its goals as to protect constitutional liberties In an earlier study the organization reviewed biology texts and found that most publishers had succumbed to pressures to minimize or even eliminate the topic of evolution in order to pacify adherents of the creationist view of human origins Half of the texts were found to cover evolution inadequately and one in six did not even mention it Calling the improvement of American history texts dramatic Anthony T Podesta president of People for the American Way said he welcomed the finding that many publishers have apparently decided to resist pressures from ultrafundamentalists who want textbooks to teach children what to think not how to think Publishers who used to submit to such pressures he said are now encouraging students to think critically and creatively But turning to an aspect of this and other studies that has attracted considerable interest Mr Podesta underscored the panels concern over the generally poor coverage of religion in American history He made it clear that neither he nor his organization in any way advocated the teaching of religion but criticized the books failure to teach about religion and its significance in American life The two themes which have been in tension since the earliest colonial times  religious intolerance and religious idealism  are not recognized as essential to an understanding of the American character he said When religion is mentioned it is just that  mentioned While history textbooks talk about the existence of religious diversity in America he continued they do not show it Jews exist only as the objects of discrimination Catholics exist to be discriminated against and to ask for Government money for their own schools There is no reflection of the diversity within American Protestantism Mr Podesta asserts that the books omit the role of religion in fueling social movements such as Prohibition the labor movement antiwar protests and the abortion debate He found much of the coverage of the Holocaust superficial The poor coverage of religion is not the result of any ideological bias  left and right in the world of religion are ignored equally Mr Podesta said When there is no Billy Graham there is no National Council of Churches In fact more often than not when Moral Majority is mentioned it is treated as virtually the only religious development since World War II Publishers he concluded fear pressure from both militant atheists and militant fundamentalists Such criticism differs basically from that voiced in a textbook review underwritten by the Department of Education and published last month which called for greater conservatism in the presentation of American life and religion and complained that texts shortchanged Protestants by giving too much space to Catholics and Jews By contrast Professor Daviss panel stressed that our history must not be held hostage to any ideology It warned against allowing indoctrination to replace education Copies of the report with listings of all the books reviewed by the panel are available for 5 from People for the American Way 1424 16th Street NW Washington DC 20036
EDUCATION; RELIGION LACK IN TEXTS CITED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/03/science/education-religion-lack-in-texts-cited.html,In one history textbook Joan of Arc is discussed without any mention of God or of her becoming a saint In another the Pilgrims first Thanksgiving Day is described without any reference to their thanking God for their survival in the new land These examples from a study financed by the Federal Department of Education are cited as indicative of the way school textbooks treat the role of religion in history This studys findings resemble those of two other recent surveys in concluding that religions role has been largely excised from the textbooks But the studies offer widely different reasons for this The Education Departments study holds that a liberal bias in many textbooks is responsible Textbooks it says characterize American history in terms of minority rights feminism and environmental issues and fail to give any serious positive treatment to conservative views But the other studies one by People for the American Way a nonprofit organization that monitors the religious right and the other by Americans United for Separation of Church and State a 39yearold religiousliberty organization see the omission as reflecting the desire of textbook publishers to avoid controversy at all costs The studies finding religion omitted from textbooks are applauded by Education Secretary William J Bennett who has denounced the assault of secularism on religion In a recent speech that cited the Americans United findings Mr Bennett said If students grow up ignorant of the role of religion of religious freedom and religious faith in American life then surely we will have badly failed them His chief of staff William Kristol said Mr Bennett attributed the lack of religion in textbooks to publishers desires to skirt controversy and to an often unconscious liberal or secular bias However according to Donald Eklund vice president of the school division of the Association of American Publishers textbooks simply reflect the demands made by school boards This is one of the most competitive of all businesses Mr Eklund said State and local school boards set the rules If publishers dont abide by them they dont stay in business If boards wanted more religion they could do something about it Lois Eskin a top editor at Holt Rinehart and Winston said the company takes pains to remain neutral where religion is concerned She disputed the contention that religion has been removed from contexts in which it is historically relevant as did Jeremiah Kaplan chairman and president of Macmillan Publishing Company Religion is treated adequately in our textbooks he said Henry F Graff a professor of history at Columbia University who is the author of textbooks for junior and senior high schools on American history conceded that there are probably more things we can say about religion in American life than have been included in recent textbooks But when the right in this country talks about religion in the books Professor Graff added theyre interested in antiabortion and fostering their own agenda Theyre interested in more than the spirit of God According to Mr Kristol of the Education Department the view that one must be a right wing crazy to say that religion has been shortchanged in our childrens textbooks was disproved by the appearance of the studies by the two citizens groups Of the three studies only the one financed by the department reflects conservative views That study was directed by Paul C Vitz a psychology professor at New York University who received a 74000 grant to conduct it In an interview last month in Education Update a publication of the Heritage Foundation a conservative research organization Professor Vitz contended that secular humanists have been able to dominate and control education Those who write and publish the textbooks are of a relatively homogeneous secular and antireligious mentality he said Individual principals or superintendents who select textbooks are of the same attitude His study bears the warning that it does not necessarily reflect the views of the department But Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut an outspoken critic of the Vitz study recently attacked Mr Bennett for rewarding Professor Vitz with another grant 24000 from the Secretarys discretionary fund in spite of the fact Mr Weicker said that the professors application did not rank well in a peer review of grant proposals In his study of textbooks Professor Vitz deals both with the historical inaccuracies that result from omitting references to religion and with what he regards as biases against committed Protestantism and traditional family values He says a sample of 40 books included not a single reference to television evangelists bornagain Christians or the Moral Majority organization And while textbooks neglect Christianity he says they overly emphasize feminism He also says they display a lack of support for business a lack of patriotism and a liberal bias in selecting role models The Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr Eleanor Roosevelt Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles and the environmentalist Rachel Carson are depicted as role models he says but Phyllis Schlafly Dr Jeane Kirkpatrick Jerry Falwell and Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina are not mentioned The movement against the proposed Federal equal rights amendment the prolife movement and the tax revolt are also neglected he says Phyllis Schlaflys group the Eagle Forum represents tens of millions of people Professor Vitz said in an interview They have as much right to determine the content of textbooks as the political and social opposition Politics aside Professor Vitzs observations regarding the treatment  or nontreatment  of history are bolstered by the other two studies The one financed by Americans United for Separation of Church and State conducted by Professor Charles C Haynes a former religion professor who now works as a consultant with Americans United also says that topics involving religion are largely ignored in American history and civics books in high schools This is an urgent danger signal for religious freedom he says The study by People for the American Way similarly points out that school histories with only rare exceptions treat religion by exclusion or by brief and simplistic reference That study of which O L Davis professor of curriculum and instruction at the University of Texas at Austin was chairman examined 31 American history texts for junior and senior high schools It concluded Honest treatment of religion in American history seems to be equated with advocacy of particular religious ideas and practices People for the American Way has been providing legal help for school boards in court cases in Tennessee and Alabama in which some parents have charged that their childrens school reading materials are colored by antiChristian secular humanist themes But the groups president Anthony Podesta finds nothing contradictory in its call for religion to receive better treatment in textbooks The same fear of controversy that leads publishers to remove evolution from biology texts he said is responsible for their removing religion from history books both at the expense of academic integrity
TIGHT G.O.P. CONTEST IN CALIFORNIA FOR CHANCE TO CHALLENGE CRANSTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/04/us/tight-gop-contest-in-california-for-chance-to-challenge-cranston.html,Two California Republicans from opposite sides of their partys political spectrum were in a tight battle tonight for the right to challenge Senator Alan Cranston this November With 16 percent of the votes counted Representative Ed Zschau a moderate who represents Northern Californias hightechnology industrial belt held a 33 percent to 29 percent lead over Bruce Herschensohn a conservative television commentator from Los Angeles The two candidates were outdistancing 11 other Republicans who were seeking to block Mr Cranston the Senate Democratic whip from a fourth term Replay of Governors Race Against little opposition Gov George Deukmejian a Republican and Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles a Democrat won their parties nominations for the November election Mr Deukmejian narrowly defeated Mr Bradley for the governorship four years ago The early returns also indicated that a referendum that supporters contended would limit the spiraling cost of liability damage suits was winning by a small margin In San Diego early returns indicated that voters were going to elect the first woman to serve as the citys mayor With more than 40 percent of the votes counted Maureen F OConnor a former member of the City Council was leading Councilman Bill Cleator 54 percent to 46 percent Although the 13way battle for the Republican Senate nomination has dominated partisan politics in the state this year it apparently failed to ignite much interest among voters Election officials said that they expected the voter turnout today to be the lowest in the states history for a primary election with only 38 percent of registered voters going to the polls in Los Angeles County Officials attibuted the low turnout to the states general prosperity recently and to an absence of other more contentious issues on the ballot Cranstons Three Victories All of Mr Cranstons three previous Senate victories have been against members of the conservative wing of the Republican Party in California that Mr Herschensohn represents Mr Zschau who was first elected to Congress in 1982 had been a successful entrepreneur in the electronics industry Virtually unknown in most of the state a year ago he vaulted to prominence in the race through television commercials financed by more than 3 million in contributions from business interests led by David Packard cofounder of the HewlettPackard Company The commercials among other things were intended to explain how to pronounce his name  like the first syllable of shower Mr Zschau who is 46 years old describes himself as a moderate on social issues and a conservative on economic and most military issues He maintains for example that women should have the right to decide whether to have abortions but opposes public financing of abortions He opposes production of the MX missile contends the Pentagon wastes too much money but after first opposing it supports President Reagans efforts to give aid to Nicaraguan rebels Former Nixon Speechwriter Mr Herschensohn 53 was seeking his first elective office after rising to prominence in southern California as a political commentator for a Los Angeles television station Once a speechwriter for President Nixon he is an articulate speaker who has drawn high marks in the campaign for his command of foreign affairs Throughout the campaign in which he had trouble establishing credibility in parts of the state that were not familiar with his television commentary he called for a constitutional amendment to bar abortions opposed the proposed Equal Rights Amendment favored ordering the United Nations out of this country supported the MX missile took a dim view of any arms control agreements and called for the United States to take a tougher stance in its dealings with the Soviet Union Besides Mr Zschau and Mr Herschensohn the other principal candidates in the race were Los Angeles County Supervisor Mike Antonovich Ed Davis a former Los Angeles Police Chief Representative Bobbi Fiedler the economist Arthur Laffer and State Assemblyman Robert Naylor Cranston Urges Debates Mr Cranston faced only token opposition in his bid for the Democratic Senate nomination He said today that he had sent a telegram to the Republican Party urging the winner of its primary to join him in a series of campaign debates The preelection campaign over the ballot measure known as Proposition 51 which would limit the size of certain jury awards in liability cases was one of the most expensive in the nations history costing both sides a total of about 10 million Under existing law in California as in a number of other states a wealthy defendant like a city or corporation can be required to pay all damages in a liability case even though their negligence was only marginally responsible for an accident The proposition would limit awards proportionately to the defendants responsibility Trial lawyers in the state spent more than 5 million to defeat the measure while insurance companies local governments and organized medicine spent almost as much in seeking to have it passed

PRIMARIES POINT TO BATTLES FOR STATE CONTROL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/05/us/primaries-point-to-battles-for-state-control.html,The results of Tuesdays primary voting point toward pitched battles this fall in California Alabama and South Dakota that figure heavily in party strategies in the fight for control of the Senate political experts said today While both Democrats and Republicans contended that the results in the three states brightened their Senate prospects political experts said the most significant outcome was the emergence of a serious Republican challenger to Senator Alan Cranston Democrat of California California Republicans choosing from 13 candidates in their Senate primary nominated Representative Ed Zschau of Los Altos a moderate Republican and hightechnology millionaire who had heavy financial backing from business in the state One of the Republican incumbents considered to be in the greatest political jeopardy Senator James Abdnor of South Dakota survived a primary challenge from Gov William Janklow by a surprising 10point margin Party strategists say that his strong showing against Mr Janklow a popular politician who contended that Mr Abdnor could not win in November should improve the Senators chances of holding his seat against his Democratic rival Representative Thomas A Daschle In Alabama Republicans had hoped that Representative Richard C Shelby a conservative Democrat would be forced into a runoff in the contest for his partys Senate nomination But Mr Shelby won more than 50 percent of the primary vote against four opponents strengthening his position against the states firstterm Republican incumbent Senator Jeremiah Denton In one recent statewide poll Mr Shelby was running even with Mr Denton Democrats Need 4 Seats Democrats who are a 47to53 minority need to pick up four seats to regain control of the Senate One thing in their favor is the arithmetic 22 seats held by Republicans are up this year as against 12 held by Democrats There is no question in my mind were going to win the Senate said Senator George J Mitchell of Maine chairman of the Democratic Senatorial Committee Of the 22 Republicanheld seats Democrats are ahead in the polls in six  Florida North Carolina Maryland Nevada South Dakota and Idaho Of the 12 Democratic seats at stake he added we are leading in 10 roughly even in Missouri and behind in only one Louisiana Republicans however differ with that assessment particularly Mr Mitchells description of California as a safe Democratic seat We think Tuesdays vote was good news for Republicans said David Narsavage a spokesman for the Republican Senatorial Campaign Committee California is now our No 1 race and were closing in Today as Republicans held a unity luncheon in Los Angeles to close ranks behind Mr Zschau who is viewed as a liberal by the partys conservative wing Cranston strategists were preparing their first television assault against his Republican challenger One benefit Mr Cranston expects to reap from Mr Zschaus nomination is the strong support and financial backing of the states Jewish voters The 71yearold Senator has been one of Israels strongest allies on Capitol Hill and on Thursday Mr Cranston is set to lead the fight on the Senate floor against the Reagan Administrations proposed arms sale to Saudi Arabia Zschau Votes at Issue Mr Zschau has frequently voted against Israels positions He supported Saudi arms sales and last year backed a supplemental appropriations amendment that among other things would have slashed foreign aid by 5 percent across the board with no exception for Israel Jim LeMunyon a spokesman for Mr Zschau confirmed those votes but added that the Congressman has been a strong supporter of President Reagans Middle East policies Cranston strategists said they would soon begin running television commercials attacking the record of the 46yearold Congressman from the states Silicon Valley on a key environmental issue the cleanup of toxic waste Mr LeMunyon said Mr Zschau had voted for legislation to establish a Federal superfund that requires chemical companies to pay part of the cost of cleaning up toxic waste But he said the lawmaker had opposed an amendment that would have set aside money in the fund to pay damage claims to individuals Mr Zschau the aide added also voted against a measure that would have required companies to make public a list of the chemicals they discharged into the environment Some Democratic strategists say they were concerned that Mr Zschaus political appeal could transcend any set of issues California is a state of weak party identification they say and its voters in the past have often favored new faces and candidates who defy easy ideological labeling Starting his campaign with little name recognition outside his northern California district Mr Zschau spent 3 million most of it on television to familiarize voters with his name and his business background as a successful manufacturer of computer disk storage systems In past elections Republicans had nominated farright conservatives who were easily defeated by Mr Cranston but Mr Zschaus political independence and his appeal to voters in the center of the political spectrum confronts Mr Cranston with a new kind of Republican challenger Mr Zschau is a freemarket conservative with libertarian instincts He opposes government intervention in both the economy and personal lives and has drawn criticism from party conservatives for his support for legalized abortion and the equal rights amendent for women Like Mr Cranston he opposes the MX missile and supports arms control Until this year when he changed his position Mr Zschau had voted consistently against Mr Reagans requests for aid to the Nicaraguan rebels Hes flipflopped on contra aid and other issues said one Cranston aide and were going to be use it to raise questions about his political character
CURTAIN UP FOR SENATE TAX DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/05/business/curtain-up-for-senate-tax-debate.html,With one senator after another calling it a historic occasion the Senate began debate today on legislation that would overhaul the income tax system Congress has assembled piecemeal over decades The moment has now arrived said Senator Bob Packwood the bills floor manager at the outset of the debate We are on the tax bill and it is the most radical tax bill the Congress has seen in half a century No votes were taken today and most of the session was devoted to opening statements by supporters of the measure which would dramatically lower tax rates and abolish or restrict many deductions and other tax preferences The Senate will put the tax bill aside Thursday to deal with President Reagans plan to sell weapons to Saudi Arabia and then will take up an appropriation bill A fullscale debate on the tax bill and votes on amendments will resume next week Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the Republican leader said the Senate might be able to complete action on the measure by the end of next week but most other senators expect the debate to last at least two weeks before a vote is taken on passage The House of Representatives approved a companion bill last December It follows the same principles as the Senate measure but differs in many important respects If the Senate approves a bill it will go to a HouseSenate conference for reconciliation of the differences In his opening statement Senator Packwood an Oregon Republican and chairman of the Finance Committee urged the Senate to approve the legislation without amendment Its not very often the brass ring is going to come this close he said This opportunity will not come again not in this Congress not in this decade probably not in this century Its the most extraordinary opportunity for the American people we are likely to see in our careers President Reagan who has invited all 100 senators to the White House for breakfast Thursday to lobby them on the tax bill agrees that the bill should be approved without significant change But many senators who said they supported the bill also said they wanted changes in it Comment From DAmato For example Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York said this morning before the debate that it was absolutely ludicrous to ask senators to withhold amendments I didnt get elected and I dont think senators are elected to be rubber stamps said Mr DAmato whose main interest is in preserving deductions for contributions to Individual Retirement Accounts Senator Packwood and other sponsors said the IRA amendments were the ones that seemed to have generated the most support The bill would disallow deductions for contributions to retirement accounts by taxpayers who are covered by company pension plans It would let the interest and dividends earned by such accounts accumulate taxfree Before the tax measure was officially called up today several senators expressed opposition to other provisions For example John Melcher a Montana Democrat said the legislation would be devastating to agriculture mining and timber interests in his state As of this morning 25 or 30 amendments had been filed but many of those will not be called up for votes The prevailing view was that the bill would be passed handily by the Senate with an amendment on IRAs the only consequential one standing a chance of passage Long Predicts Passage Senator Russell B Long of Louisiana said to Mr Packwood Your bills going to pass I predict that in confidence Senator Long was chairman of the Finance Committee for more than a decade when Democrats controlled the Senate and presided over enactment of many of the tax rules that would be changed by this legislation But today he called the tax measure before the Senate a long stride toward fair and equal justice for all taxpayers Other senators made similar statements Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey who was credited by many colleagues today with being the point man in the march toward tax revision said the bill was the best thing middleincome Americans have seen in a generation How can we expect only some Americans to pay for our national security our schools our health care for the elderly our programs for the poor and our roads subways and our ports Mr Bradley asked Then he answered his own question The answer is clear We cant Its time for us to look at the special interests and say get on board be part of the community be a part of America pay some tax Its time to remove the web of suspicion and inequity that covers our tax system Some Questions Raised Some of the supporters also raised questions in their opening statements about parts of the measure Lloyd Bentsen of Texas a senior Democrat on the Finance Committee said he was preparing an amendment that would put the reductions in tax rates into effect at the first of next year Although restrictions in deductions under the bill would be effective Jan 1 rates would not be reduced until July 1 That means that many taxpayers would owe higher taxes in 1987 than they would if the present system were in place Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts one of a handful of senators who actively supported tax revision in years past said today that he would vote for the measure enthusiastically but that he hoped ways could be found to have the wealthy pay more in taxes and the poor even less One potential snag developed today Senator Gordon J Humphrey a New Hampshire Republican said he would offer an amendment that would disallow taxexempt status for organizations that finance or provide facilities for abortions Senator Packwood a proponent of legalized abortion called the tax bill an inappropriate place to debate the issue and said he hoped Mr Humphrey would reconsider his intentions
EX-OFFICER IS G.O.P. HOPE IN 5-WAY HOUSE CONTEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/06/nyregion/ex-officer-is-gop-hope-in-5-way-house-contest.html,Richard Bo Dietl is running for Congress with a 38caliber handgun strapped to his left ankle a vestige of his 15year career in the New York City Police Department Constituents in the Sixth Congressional District in Queens rarely notice Mr Dietls gun but it symbolizes the lawandorder posture that Republican Party officials hope will inspire an upset in next Tuesdays special election when Mr Dietl will be facing four feuding Democrats The death in April of Joseph P Addabbo a Democrat who represented the district since 1961 spurred bitterness and disorder among his wouldbe successors within the party Assemblyman Alton R Waldon was nominated by Queens Democratic district leaders while State Senator Andrew Jenkins also a Democrat was designated by the Liberal Party as its candidate Two other Democrats secured enough petition signatures to run independently the Rev Floyd Flake of the Allen A M E Church in St Albans and Kevin McCabe an assistant city health commissioner Tax Plan a Concern In a district where Democrats outnumber Republicans 7 to 1 and nonwhites represent a majority of the voters Mr Dietls cause might be considered hopeless were it not for the crowded field Political observers say such a situation probably would not have been permitted if Donald R Manes were alive and running the county organization with his characteristically tight grip Mr Manes committed suicide in March as a continuing corruption investigation was unfolding All of the candidates have looked for opportunities to praise Mr Addabbo All of them have also expressed concern that middleclass citizens are not sufficiently helped by the Senate Finance Committeepassed tax plan Of the five candidates two  Mr Dietl and Mr McCabe  are white The three black candidates say that the time has come for a black representative in a district across southeast Queens where blacks predominate Mr Waldon and Mr Jenkins stress their legislative experience Mr Waldon also points to his welcome in both the black and white communities and Senator Jenkins harks back to his days as a civil rights activist Mr Flake talks of his record as a community leader Mr McCabe focuses on his experience running government programs Mr Dietl who has run a security business since his retirement last year is alone in supporting the death penalty and opposing legal abortion Dietl Downplays Party Ties It was Mr Dietls police background that most intrigued John F Haggerty the chairman of the Queens Republican Party I think a RepublicanConservative who identifies with the lawandorder issue has an excellent shot Mr Haggerty said But Mr Dietl has tried to downplay his connection with the Republican Party and to that end his posters and campaign literature make no mention of party affiliation If I can get people to look at the candidate and like the candidate then they wont care he said I expect tremendous underground backing from Democrats like the Italians from Ozone Park and Howard Beach Mr Haggerty defended the posters Were trying to pull out all the voters who will identify with him he said According to Mr Haggerty and George L Clark the former state Republican chairman who is working for Mr Dietl national party organizations have made generous contributions to the Dietl campaign chest which is expected to reach 75000 I stressed with every bit of my energy to the National Congressional Campaign Committee that this was a doable slot said Mr Clark Bos a bit of a bull in a china shop but Ive had it with lawyers elected to public office Reagans Kind of Guy Last week Mr Dietl visited President Reagan in the Oval Office and the President Mr Dietl said knew all about his highprofile arrests including the rapists of a nun in East Harlem several years ago and the murderer of eight children in the East New York section of Brooklyn last spring He told me Youre my kind of guy  said the 35yearold Mr Dietl who retired recently because he said he was assigned to a desk job after being injured in a skydiving accident Mr Dietls streettough posture including his frequent boasting that he averaged 100 felony arrests a year is prompting both support and consternation in the district On a recent tour of nursing homes Mr Dietl talked of mandatory life sentences for cocaine dealers  Lets put the animals away for life  and the wheelchairbound elderly applauded vigorously He promised middleincome housing for the Rockaways  a return of people who care about their houses  and the patients voiced approval But the next night at a candidates symposium in Richmond Hill a black man John K McMiller jumped to his feet waving one of Mr Dietls advertisements which includes a photograph of the former detective leading a handcuffed black prisoner This is insulting and degrading to people who constitute 48 percent of your population said Mr McMiller who identified himself as a Republican Mr Dietl apologized Foes Critical of Tenor When confronted with criticism that he is running a racist campaign Mr Dietl responds by citing his police work in precincts in minority neighborhoods I served those people he said I know their problems I can relate to them better than anybody else But Mr Waldon and Mr Jenkins the other two wellfinanced candidates are outspoken about what they consider the unacceptable tenor of Mr Dietls campaign In Congress you do things like pass bills and attend committee meetings and you need the collegial skills to interface said Asseblyman Waldon a former Housing Authority police officer This young man is running amok thinking he can throw somebody up against a wall pat him down and get a bill passed Hes like Wyatt Earp Bat Masterson and the James Gang rolled into one He knows absolutely nothing about politics and is playing on latent racism said Senator Jenkins but this is not  thank God  a racist district
POLITICAL MEMO; Bush and Kemp in the Early Hall of Mirrors,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/06/us/political-memo-bush-and-kemp-in-the-early-hall-of-mirrors.html,At this early stage of jockeying the contest for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination would be far less interesting if the realities matched appearances Two cases in point are the unannounced campaigns of Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York Mr Bush is the overwhelming choice of Republicans in nearly every public opinion poll taken so far But the sometimes stumbling manner in which his Presidential drive has unfolded to date suggests he is far from having a lock on the nomination A Kemp candidacy on the other hand may have more potential than his low standing in the polls indicates His early efforts have been hindered by among other things the reluctance of conservative activists to commit themselves Questions About Bush First consider Mr Bushs situation Some of his early political maneuvers including what many considered his clumsy attack on Governor Cuomo of New York on ethnic prejudice have reinforced questions about his political character and his ability to survive the pressures of a Presidential marathon And Mr Bush seems to be in no hurry to tackle what some political experts consider his greatest challenge breaking out of his political servitude to President Reagan and fashioning his own identity and vision of the future His strategists contend that the harsh assessments Washington insiders have made about Mr Bushs performance are not shared by grassroots Republicans and have not significantly affected his standing in Presidential preference polls But some political professionals suggest that this kind of reasoning underscores a potential danger for the Bush campaign the tendency to confuse approval of his VicePresidential role with support for his Presidential candidacy Kemp and the Opinion Polls Mr Kemp faces a different set of problems He is a man of ideas and he has a clearly defined message The proper economic policies he says will spur growth and provide a ladder of opportunity for even the most disadvantaged elements of society But in most public opinion polls Mr Kemp is still languishing in the singledigit bracket One of the early political assumptions about the Republican contest was that Mr Kemp would quickly emerge as Mr Bushs main challenger from the right something that has not happened so far As the scrappy underdog Mr Kemp has done just about everything expected of a Presidential hopeful to lay a foundation for a campaign The former Buffalo Bills quarterback whose office gets 300 speaking invitations a week has placed himself in bondage to his party making speeches at local and state party events and candidate fundraisers from Maine to Idaho He is closely identified with Reaganomics and is an architect of the taxcutting measure Mr Reagan embraced as the centerpiece of his firstterm economic program And he has been out front on two of the conservative movements litmus tests issues opposition to abortion and support for United States military aid for antiCommunist rebels in Nicaragua and Angola At the same time Mr Kemp appears to be trying to redefine Republican conservatism in the postReagan period by appealing to blacks union members and other Democratic constituencies When it comes to addressing the concerns of minorities no other Presidential hopeful matches Mr Kemps intensity He attacks racism in South Africa and speaks with passion about the economic and social distress in this countrys black ghettoes Economic growth he says doesnt mean anything if it leaves people out But many blacks may find his oratory more refreshing than convincing To them his message of jobs and growth sounds similiar to Mr Reagans economic prescription a rising tide that lifts the smallest boats Mr Kemp has said he was not concerned about early polls contending that they reflect little more than the name recognition of the Presidential hopefuls His strategy has been to organize grassroots activists behind his candidacy and ambush the Vice President in one of the early contests But that strategy has run into a complication The early emergence of the Rev Pat Robertson and the religious right as potential factors in Iowa and Michigan the first states to choose Republican nominating delegates in 1988 raises questions about Mr Kemps ability to build a solid conservative base from which to challenge Mr Bush Patience seems to be one of Mr Kemps strong suits In time his strategists say conservatives will realize that Mr Robertson whatever his appeal is not going to win the nomination When they are hit by the blinding light of pragmatism on the road to 1988 Mr Kemp expects to be the prime beneficiary For much of this year Mr Bush has been courting conservative groups hoping that if he cannot gain their early support he can at least prevent them from rallying behind Mr Kemp or some other contender That strategy seems to have worked so far but at some point conservatives are going to begin choosing sides Some remain suspicious of Mr Bush saying he has never been out front on any issue on their agenda If Bush Should Falter    If Mr Bushs campaign should falter in one of the early states Mr Kemps candidacy could take off Or one of the partys dark horses or even a new face could emerge Either Bob Dole of Kansas the Senate Republican leader or Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee his predecessor in that job could break out of the pack Or someone like Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada Mr Reagans old friend and confidant might enter the race For the first time since 1960 no one owns the conservative movement said David Keene a consultant who advises Mr Dole In the end theyre all likely to get a piece of the conservative movement
CHILDREN OF POVERTY: CRISIS IN NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/magazine/children-of-poverty-crisis-in-new-york.html,IMAGINE THE MAYOR OF NEW YORK CALLING AN URGENT NEWS CONFERENCE to announce that the crisis of the citys poor children had reached such proportions that he was mobilizing the citys talents for a massive rescue effort not unlike the one that saved us from bankruptcy 10 years ago I believe some such drastic action is warranted even essential because our city is threatened by the spreading blight of a poverty even crueler in some ways than that of the Great Depression half a century ago Almost 40 percent of our children  700000 boys and girls  now live in families with incomes below the poverty line Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has estimated that half of the babies born in the city in 1980 can be expected to be on our welfare rolls before they reach the age of 18 Social critics including Mr Moynihan have been telling a tale of two cities to describe the kind of community New York has become while the city enjoys prosperity the new poverty goes unchecked The richest Congressional district in the nation shares a boundary with one of the poorest And it was precisely during the last two banner years of economic growth and enhanced city budgets that the child poverty rate accelerated dramatically Todays children of poverty are suffering in ways that would have dumbfounded those who knew the Great Depression an estimated 3000 babies born addicted to drugs every year 10000 children living in shelters and hotels for the homeless 12000 children who were abused or neglected so severely last year that they had to be removed from their homes and placed in foster care All too many poor children in New York are denied dignity even in death according to a recent report by the Coalition for the Homeless The report revealed that almost half of the infants under the age of 1 who died in the city between 1981 and 1984 were buried in potters field in unmarked graves that their families thus could not visit All this poses a practical as well as a moral issue for the city for the way we deal with the problem will determine the quality of life for all of us in the future There is no question that the problem is enormously difficult but it is not yet hopeless Many sensible steps can be taken to attack the situation including the appointment of one person  a czar if you will  to oversee all agencies that serve children efforts to engage the private sector revamping of the workloads of caseworkers and the increasing involvement of the school system There are others as well This is not to say that the solutions will be easy The problem is exacerbated by the rate of family breakdown and the cruel choices this presents for the city can be illustrated with the story of 3yearold Giovanny Maria of the Bronx recorded in the Surrogates Court this spring His fate came to be decided by a judge because shortly after his third birthday his mother decided that being a parent had become too much of a burden Giovannys mother was planning a trip to the Dominican Republic and did not know when if ever she might return The boys father was unknown so she left Giovanny with a friend The friend was a 20yearold single woman with a ninthgrade education unemployed and living on public assistance and food stamps Last November she and Giovanny began living in a single room in a threestory rooming house where they shared a kitchen and two bathrooms with 20 other people Under the circumstances these living arrangements were felt to be the best possible by a caseworker for the New York City Office of Special Services for Children whose function is to intervene to protect the welfare of children like Giovanny The caseworker was sent to Surrogates Court to support a petition to have the mothers friend declared his legal guardian Giovannys prospective new mother failed to appear for the guardianship hearing leading the lawyer for the city to wonder whether she was fit to care for the child Still the caseworker told the court that under the circumstances the boy should remain where he was She recounted her investigation of Giovannys life in the rooming house He didnt have any marks on him and he looks well cared for she testified although she conceded that because the child spoke little English and she spoke no Spanish she had reached her conclusion without ever communicating directly with the boy As for his living conditions she said they seemed adequate the communal bathrooms were moderately clean and the room the child was sharing with his prospective guardian was spacious well heated and clean But it seems clear that the only valid argument for continuing the arrangement was that the alternatives were far worse  either a homeless shelter for the woman and child or a foster home for the child Judge Bertram R Gelfand Bronx County Surrogate ordered the city to remove Giovanny from the deplorable conditions of the rooming house and to place this child in a more appropriate environment which will more likely protect his health safety welfare    [ and ] give him the opportunities in life to which he and every child in our society is entitled The judge in a rebuke to the city for the inadequate resources it devotes to its child protective services urged the city to staff the agency with more professionally qualified social workers at higher salaries Giovannys worker had a degree in communications and was earning 19000 a year The judge also reflected on the citys budget priorities This court is sensitive to the constrictions of budget limitations However in a budgetmaking process that is necessarily based upon fixing priorities the cost of assuring the development of children into useful citizens is minuscule against the costs of endlessly continuing to expand the criminal justice system    create new expanded drug and alcohol abuse programs and swell the ranks of those who cannot provide for themselves all because in early childhood people were denied the fundamental education and upbringing necessary to meet the challenges of life Citing the confidentiality provisions of the states socialservice law a spokesman for the Special Services agency said it could not reveal what happened to Giovanny after the judges decision Nevertheless we can reasonably speculate that foster care would not have been a desirable solution Unlike adoption foster care is not a permanent arrangement and many foster parents participate simply because they get extra income They may take a child in for a day a week a month or longer then send the child back Too many fostercare children ultimately end up in shelters for the homeless Despite the problems with the system it is being strained beyond its limits by the magnitude and pervasiveness of poverty and family breakdown Children are being abused and mistreated at record levels abandoned like excess luggage and we are simply running out of places to put them The Special Services agency projects that it will have to cope with reports of abuse and neglect involving 69000 children in the coming fiscal year The number of cases has been increasing at a rate of about 10 percent a year David Tobis a senior associate at Welfare Research Inc a respected policy studies group has concluded that in some neighborhoods as many as 20 percent of the children have been reported to be abused or neglected during the past five years The total fostercare population in the city is now about 17000 one of the largest in the country But while the demand for foster care has risen the availability of beds has contracted This spring hundreds of children from infants to adolescents were piling up in agency offices and sleeping on benches while overburdened and harassed caseworkers labored through the night trying to arrange temporary fostercare placements for them On any given day this spring up to 30 healthy infants were lingering in hospitals at a cost of several hundred dollars a day for each infant because there were no foster beds Reports of child abuse are coming in so fast that workers in some agency regional offices are assigned 10 or 11 new cases a month despite the fact that New York States Department of Social Services has established a guideline of 4 to 5 new cases a month as the number that a trained caseworker can manage with any degree of professional competence According to Mr Tobis this was a crisis waiting to erupt In fact in a 1985 speech to the Conference on Setting Municipal Priorities he warned that the fostercare system was being overwhelmed by the rising number of abused children needing placement Recent events show again that the citys priorities are all wrong Mr Tobis said We spend half a billion dollars on child welfare services but most of it is used to remove and confine children after they have been damaged by poverty and neglect We have no early warning system to identify childrens problems before they overwhelm families and the citys budgets The courts now seem to agree In a recent ruling Civil Court Judge Edward H Lehner in Manhattan ordered the city to come up with a service plan for intervention in families that face removal of children for placement in foster homes The city has now taken heed of some of the criticism of the Special Services agency In an otherwise lean budget dictated by Federal cutbacks and decreased revenues Mayor Koch this spring singled out the crisis in Special Services for Children and requested funds to hire 323 new caseworkers and support staff Surely that is good news for the overburdened and unappreciated caseworkers Yet even if the city retains the new personnel it intends to hire we are still speaking about emergency treatment not cures The gridlock in the citys principal agency serving abused children is merely a symptom of a more fundamental and complex social disease To understand what is happening in the city we must return to poverty and its related disorders  family disintegration and teenage pregnancy The likelihood of a childs growing up poor is four times as great if he is born into a household headed by a woman rather than a traditional twoparent home And it is even more likely if the mother is a teenager New York City has been massively afflicted by this feminization of poverty Though the citys population declined 11 percent between 1970 and 1980 the number of people living in femaleheaded families rose by almost 30 percent The citys welfare rolls now consist mainly of minoritygroup women and children Demographic projections suggest that this most vulnerable group will continue to grow as a percentage of the population at least through the next decade The most potentially destructive of these trends is the epidemic of teenage pregnancy Although the total number of teen pregnancies in the city has decreased in the last decade as a result of a decline in the teenage population pregnancies among 15 to 19yearold females went up from 123 percent to 131 percent between 1975 and 1984 The citys Adolescent Pregnancy Interagency Council has projected that if the present rates remain constant 1 out of 4 girls 14 years old today will be pregnant at least once before her 18th birthday 1 out of 8 will have had at least 1 abortion before reaching 18 and nearly 1 out of 11 will be a mother before she is 18 The 13000 babies born to teenagers in 1984 represent a staggering social and economic cost Seventy percent of those new babies and their mothers can be expected to end up on public assistance within 18 months according to the Interagency Council Pregnant teenagers are far less likely than other expectant mothers to receive prenatal care thus increasing their risk of bearing lowbirthweight babies requiring extensive medical care at public expense Teenage pregnancy is the single most important factor causing girls to drop out of school and contributes substantially to the citys huge highschool dropout rates 40 percent overall 70 percent among minority groups Earlier this year the Washingtonbased Center for Population Options released a study estimating that the cost of teenage pregnancy taking into account only direct Federal and state expenditures for Aid to Families With Dependent Children Medicaid and food stamps was 165 billion in 1985 What we are experiencing throughout the country but most particularly in major urban areas such as New York is the result of an unprecedented reversal of fortunes among our age groups Historically poverty had always struck hardest at the elderly because they were most likely to be infirm without work or without income That held true until the mid1970s Then a disproportionate number of children began to be poor a phenomenon exclusive to the United States among the industrialized nations In the last two decades the povertyrate curves for children and the elderly crossed each other For children the rate rose steadily from 12 percent in 1965 to close to 25 percent in 1985 For the elderly poverty declined just as steadily from a high of 352 percent in 1959 to 12 percent in 1985 The Federal Government last year defined the poverty line as 10990 for a family of four The White House task force on families concluded in 1984 that most of the poverty among children would disappear with economic growth were it not that the rates of divorce and formation of singleparent households remain high Almost everyone agrees that the American family is in trouble but there is wide disagreement as to the causes Why is it that of all the industrialized democracies the United States has the highest rates of divorce and teenage pregnancy along with resulting child abuse teenage suicide drug addiction and alcoholism Neoconservative writers on poverty who have the ear of the Reagan Administration have argued forcefully that the federally sponsored social programs and the explosion of welfare payments of the 1960s and 70s created a culture of dependency in the urban black ghettos Starting with the War on Poverty Washington began sending the wrong message to the poor these commentators argue  that they werent responsible for anything that their condition was the product of racism and other defects in society and that it was all right for young men to stay out of the labor force and for teenagers to have children because the government would take care of them New York Citys government has been depicted by such critics as particularly profligate in its social spending They believe that the city consequently gets and deserves its exceptionally high rates of social pathology such as teenage pregnancy and family disintegration Yet the empirical evidence doesnt always fit the theory New York City certainly has a very serious problem of births to teenage girls for example but in 1980 it was only 26th among the 30 largest American cities The Washingtonbased Childrens Defense Fund a private advocacy group published a survey recently comparing states rates of teenage births with 1983 payment levels of Aid for Dependent Children The results are startling practically every state whose payments were more than 50 percent of the Federal poverty level also had teenage birth rates below the national average On the other hand almost every state with low payments had teenage birth rates higher than the national average Thus a substantial correlation was found to exist between lower welfare payment levels and higher indexes of social pathology This is exactly the opposite of the outcome predicted by neoconservative theory The Reagan Administration is not likely to be convinced by any evidence that higher payments might be socially beneficial but neither is it about to end all welfare benefits to workingage adults as some conservative writers urge Instead we can expect more of the same  payment levels that continue to lag behind inflation and further cuts in Federal programs that provide essential social services to the poor At the present time for example the entire Federal budget for preventive services for children in the form of grants to the states and demonstration projects is 207 million That is about 130 million less than the Federal Governments public relations budget and about half the amount the city of New York allots to Special Services for Children Liberals and conservatives will no doubt continue debating the causes of family disintegration and poverty But while the debate rages millions of Amerian children become poorer In New York City alone over half a million remain on the welfare rolls The tale of two cities is no mere metaphor It describes a process of decay that is already unraveling our social fabric and damaging our most precious democratic institutions particularly our public schools Onethird of the pupils now in New York City public schools are on public assistance At the same time the middle class continues to desert the schools Clearly New York must do better if it is to survive as a community into the 2lst century The middle class can remove its children from the public schools but it cannot escape the consequences of child poverty on this scale Ultimately the children of the middle class and the children of the underclass will be sharing the same streets I believe that the situation is not altogether hopeless Despite Federal cutbacks the citys 215 billion budget when added to the immense resources of our private sector could support a massive rescue effort What is needed is not necessarily more public spending but inspired leadership Imagine if the Mayor in announcing a massive rescue operation as I suggested earlier appointed a czar to lead the citys effort  a person of national stature a leader and advocate for children and someone with proven administrative skills Imagine that this czar would have the Mayors full backing to coordinate and oversee the performance of all city agencies that serve children Suppose the czar began a concerted effort to enlist the private sector the universities and the foundations to work together with the city to develop innovative programs for children in distress We might also imagine some commonsense proposals that the czar would immediately put into action For example the head of the citys Human Resources Administration could begin a television crusade appealing to the public to open its hearts and homes to the increasing numbers of fostercare children The agency would create an earlywarning system to identify families at risk and provide them with necessary social services before a crisis arose and the children had to be removed The city as noted has already started an effort to improve the situation of the Special Services for Children agency but much remains to be done to reduce paperwork to give workers more time for personal contact with the children and families they are supposed to serve and to improve morale which is at an alltime low Staff attrition at the agency is more than 50 percent a year up to 70 percent in some of the more swamped offices Caseworkers resign so fast that administrators have a hard time filling the agencys allocated positions Under our imagined czar paperwork for caseworkers doing protective services for children would be drastically reduced so that the workers could devote more attention to the children Other actions could be undertaken as well The city now houses 3400 families with children in decrepit privately owned hotels at rates of up to 3000 a month To end this scandal the city could immediately lease these hotels and contract with private nonprofit agencies to provide better services and management As for schools the Board of Education in conjunction with community school boards could be pressed to implement immediately its family life sexeducation curriculum for all schoolchildren and to expand the teenpregnancyprevention networks in coordination with outside socialservice agencies Alternative high schools small and caring institutions are among the most effective means for saving atrisk students from dropping out The citys 80 private and public colleges could be asked to volunteer to be host to at least one alternative school on their campuses and provide other educational resources to enrich the high school programs Summer programs in the citys schools could be increased Major corporations would be asked to provide instruction and training in computers and other technical subjects The Board of Education and the Human Resources Administration the two mammoth agencies that together have contact with almost all the citys poor children and whose combined budgets surpass 10 billion would be mandated to coordinate their efforts on behalf of atrisk children The list could go on There is no shortage of ideas that deserve to be tried and excellent programs just waiting to be set in motion None of this is utopian I have seen the programs work At Middle College High School on the campus of La Guardia Community College in Queens I talked to youngsters who had already dropped out of the system and were saved because of the special intimate nature of that school and because of its dedicated teachers and principal I heard Robert Scott a student at High School Redirection in Brooklyn say that at the age of 18 he had won a Golden Gloves championship but couldnt read or write until that alternative school changed his life And I saw him put his arm around two of his teachers and say Thank God for these two The city could double the number of alternative high schools within two years there are now 14 Given the political will all the proposals on the above list can be accomplished  and more Alone the city cant eliminate poverty among children it cant put back together families that fall apart or are never formed because of that poverty But if we move the problems of poor children to the top of our agenda we can find the means to intervene and save many from utterly shattered lives In saving them we would be saving ourselves
THE REGION; HAVE BALANCED TICKETS GONE THE WAY OF PRESSING THE FLESH?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/weekinreview/the-region-have-balanced-tickets-gone-the-way-of-pressing-the-flesh.html,QUICK Whats the religion of Stan Lundine the upstate Congressman chosen by Governor Cuomo as his running mate Do most voters know Do they care There is a body of thought in state politics that says they do Every four years when members of the Republican and Democratic committees gather to pick their statewide tickets as they did over the last two weeks conventional wisdom has it that to draw the most votes those tickets should be balanced  by ethnicity by geography by religion Those factors were said to have influenced the Governors selection of Mr Lundine for the ticket which wound up including at least one Roman Catholic one Jew and one Protestant But on the Republican side the party chose a ticket made up entirely of Catholics from downstate It was generally agreed even among Republicans that they would fare better if they had an upstater on the ticket They simply could not find one But as for religion the Republicans said not to worry that politically it just did not matter anymore They thereby set off a heated debate in political circles In 1986 does anyone really care about a candidates religion I dont think that concern exists much anymore except maybe with older people said Maureen Connelly the political media adviser who helped run some of Mayor Kochs campaigns Miss Connelly contended that voters did not even know the religion of most politicians Miss Connelly and other professional political advisers cited the general decline of religion as a force in society the influence of suburban homogeneity and the rise of television which has made it possible to go beyond the labels of religion and ethnicity  even party  and to emphasize issues personality and incumbency Ethnicity certainly did not appear to predominate last week in New Jersey where Representative Peter W Rodino Jr handily beat back a Democratic primary challenge from Councilman Donald M Payne of Newark The Rev Jesse Jackson and other supporters of Mr Payne who is black had argued that it was time for the 10th Congressional District with a black majority to elect the states first black Congressman But Mr Rodino the chairman of the House Judiciary Committee won with almost 60 percent of the vote It was not always thus Im 45 years old and I remember the Wagner days George L Clark the former New York State Republican Chairman said of former Mayor Robert F Wagner Back then you had to have balance You had to run Abe Beame for Comptroller because you needed someone Jewish on the ticket It was very very important No more Said Lee M Miringoff the director of the Marist College Institute for Public Opinion The traditional categories of voting are not what they used to be Jews dont draw the curtain on the voting booth and vote just for Jews Catholics dont vote just for Catholics That view is borne out by a New York TimesCBS News survey of voters as they left the polls in 1982 According to the survey Mr Cuomo a Catholic carried the Jewish vote by 2 to 1 over his opponent Lewis E Lehrman a Jew who has since converted to Catholicism Mr Lehrman and Mr Cuomo split the Catholic vote Still the sentiment for balanced tickets remains strong in political circles In part according to analysts that is because the party committees tend to be dominated by older men brought up in the days when religion held a stronger influence But it is also because there is an underlying belief that while religion itself may not be a deciding factor it is an element of an overall ethnic and cultural portrait of a candidate that can be significant Religion may not matter by itself but names like Cuomo or OBrien matter and religion is part of whats tied to those names said the Rev Andrew M Greeley a sociologist and a research associate at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago Its subtle It doesnt have to do with issues like abortion Its the sense of theyre not our kind of people or they are our kind of people  Father Greeley argued that the power of religion in politics was illustrated by negative votes cast for candidates by the fact that there is an antiJewish vote or an antiItalian vote Dont underestimate what can be a very subtle very subconscious sort of thing he said For the record heres the breakdown of this years New York tickets Republicans five Catholics Democrats three Protestants one Jew one Catholic And Mr Lundine He is Episcopalian
NEW TYCOONS RESHAPE POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/magazine/new-tycoons-reshape-politics.html,RICHARD DENNIS A BEEFY RUMPLED 37YEAROLD IN A shortsleeved shirt with no tie sits in a noisy grill in Chicago talking politics between glances at a Quotron machine A commodities trader he is a major Democratic contributor I am trying to get a Democrat nominated for President whos not in the specialinterest generation Dennis says For him the oldfashioned trading of votes for favors means bargaining away the heart and soul of the political process Barton M Biggs the chairman of Morgan Stanley Asset Management looks like central castings idea of a Wall Street pro as he sits in his office on a rainy Manhattan afternoon Like Dennis he is a political activist a supporter of the unannounced Presidential candidacy of Republican Representative Jack Kemp of Buffalo NY There was a time he says when we all sort of were traditionalists I believed the old guards story I was a eunuch before I was a supplysider Dennis and Biggs are at opposite ends of the political spectrum but they share an impatience with the old political and economic order and a determination to do something about it In many ways they are typical of a new breed of businessman who is having a substantial impact on both the Republican and Democratic parties The standard work on how business in this country sees the world is The American Business Creed published in 1956 It divides the business creed into two strands the classical devoted to pure capitalism and most popular in the ranks of small business and the managerial which stresses social responsibility as well as profits and finds its following in large corporations The authors saw the tides of history running strongly against the classical strand As prophecy The American Business Creed held up for a full 20 years Big corporations  primarily interested in a stable economy and harmonious relations with government and labor  gravitated toward the moderate wing of the Republican Party and that was the political home of American business through most of the 60s and 70s As recently as the Carter Administration the widely accepted spokesmen for business in Washington were three chairmen of corporate boards Irving S Shapiro of Du Pont a Democrat Reginald H Jones of General Electric and John D DeButts of ATT Things are different in the 80s In dozens of interviews with businessmen and politicians across the country  in Wall Street and Washington in Silicon Valley and the Texas oil patch  a clear pattern emerges The managerial strand is more muted now than at any time since the end of World War II and the classical or to use the current buzzword entrepreneurial strand has come seemingly out of nowhere to dominate the politics of business Entrepreneurs played a much more important role than big corporations in making Ronald Reagan President  as they probably will in determining the makeup of the 100th Congress this fall and in picking Mr Reagans successor two years from now We never had a place at the table before Reagan came in says James McKevitt Washington counsel of the National Federation of Independent Business and a Reagan fundraiser in 1984 In 81 we started sharing strength with the corporate types Today when we go head to head we beat em GOOD STARTING DATE FOR the political rise of entrepreneurs and the eclipse of corporations would be 1974 That was the year when the impact of the oil embargo which caused major rearrangements in the economy hit home And it was the year when Congress passed amendments to the Federal campaign finance laws putting a 25000 limit on the political contributions an individual could make to national candidates each calendar year Because the law was a reaction against large gifts to Richard Nixons 1972 Presidential campaign and restricted the kind of jumbo donations the Democrats had seldom received anyway it was seen primarily as a blow to Republican bigbusiness fund raising that would have little effect on the Democrats As a result the Republicans immediately began to change their techniques and the Democrats didnt We sat down and thought about whether we should have a major donor program says Wyatt A Stewart 3d the longtime director of finance at the National Republican Congressional Committee and we decided not to Instead the Republicans raised their money in two ways They began an active directmail effort which during the last twoyear Congressional cycle brought in 275 million  nearly 90 percent of the partys total funds  from more than three million small donors And in the late 70s the Republicans began to create organizations for contributors of 10000 and up aimed at corralling hundreds of people who would have been considered small fry a few years earlier The first of these organizations was a subsidiary of the Republican National Committee called the Eagles which has an annual membership fee of 10000 Its leading recruiter was Joe M Rodgers then a Nashville motel magnate now Ambassador to France and his most productive hunting ground was Texas and Oklahoma where the oil boom was near its peak and independent producers were angry at President Carter for sticking with government price controls on oil Today with oil busted Eagles membership is down more than 20 percent The Republicans now have three such organizations for donors of 10000 or more together they put on a big annual event called the Presidents Dinner that raises between 5 million and 10 million The goal is to wring an amount near the legal limit from a lot of people who in return can attend a glittering gala and rub elbows with the leading Republican politicians Vice President Bush his sometime image as a moderate Republican notwithstanding has been assiduously working the new Republican dinner circuit in anticipation of the 1988 Presidential campaign Independent businessmen are the main organizers of and guests at these events Putting them together requires people with full Rolodexes high profiles and control over their own time entrepreneurs fill that bill better than corporate chief executives whose attention is devoted to maintaining quarterly earnings and stock prices The campaign finance law also led to a boom in business political action committees There are now more than 2000 of them But almost all are involved purely in matters of narrow selfinterest not party direction or ideology THE COMMUNITY OF hightech entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley did not become seriously involved in national politics until almost a decade ago The crucial event was the lobbying campaign for the Steiger Amendment a measure to cut the top tax rate on capital gains that was a late addition to President Carters taxreform law Though fairly obscure the amendment was big news in Silicon Valley where most of the new wealth was tied up in closely held company stock that couldnt be sold without a painful tax bite The 78 capitalgains change was really what got these people into politics says Regis McKenna a public relations man and the leading Democratic fundraiser in Silicon Valley Prior to that they felt Leave us alone and well be successful To lobby or even to donate money in hope of getting favors was not in their realm of thinking In 1977 Silicon Valleys trade association the American Electronics Association formed a task force on capital formation which lobbied hard for the Steiger Amendment We had a folklegend experience with changing tax policy says Ed Zschau The founder of System Industries a manufacturer of diskstorage systems Zschau was the head of the task force he went on to become Silicon Valleys Republican congressman and is now a candidate for the United States Senate Silicon Valley has remained very active in politics especially on tax and trade issues The American Electronics Association has a new and more aggressive spinoff the Semiconductor Industry Association Regis McKenna says he has had 30 members of Congress in his office in the last year Though mostly Republican Silicon Valley is politically catholic it gave strong majorities to President Reagan to Senator Gary Hart in the 1984 Democratic Presidential primary and to former Gov Edmund G Brown Jr a Democrat in his unsuccessful Senate race in 1982 The Valleys leading political voices are engineers and scientists who come from modest and usually smalltown backgrounds Robert Noyce a founder of Intel is the son of an Iowa minister Charles Sporck the president of National Semiconductor grew up over his familys grocery store in upstate New York David Packard and William Hewlett the founders of HewlettPackard and longtime active Republicans were born in Pueblo Colo and Ann Arbor Mich respectively The closest the computer world comes to a liberal organization is probably the Massachusetts Computer Software Council founded last fall as an offshoot of the Massachusetts High Technology Council a trade group dominated by large manufacturers The Software Councils members are younger and run smaller companies and some see themselves as children of the 60s But one person close to the organization says Id imagine theyd be closet conservatives if anything Theyd be secretly if not overtly cheering Reagan Daniel S Bricklin a member of the councils board and as the coinventor of the Visicalc spreadsheet program a founder of the personalcomputer software industry says he is more on the liberal side but he is a registered Independent and votes for both Democrats and Republicans That is about as far left a position as can be found among hightech entrepreneurs THE 1980 ELECTION WAS crucial to the rise of the entrepreneurs as the dominant political voice of American business In the Republican primaries big corporations bet mainly on John Connally and George Bush Ronald Reagans emergence as the nominee gave new importance to the Southwesterners who formed the core of his business support He articulated conservatism in an exuberant way that sat better temperamentally with entrepreneurs than had the rhetoric of Presidents Nixon and Eisenhower More specifically Reagan strongly associated himself with the entrepreneurs emerging great cause tax cuts and with its intellectual underpinning supplyside economics After the election the Democratic Party began to court business more aggressively than it had in years The main agent of change was Representative Tony Coelho a California Congressman who is chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee and the most important link between the party and its new business constituents Following in the Republicans footsteps the Democrats have developed a beefedup directmail operation that now raises half of their funds and three special committees for big donors The largest of these the Democratic Business Council has 200 members who give about 25 million every two years The new civilian players in Democratic politics tend to be entrepreneurs too  Coelho says he barely knows anyone in big business  and if there is one industry in which they are clustered it is real estate development Because there are so many fewer businessmen in the Democratic Party than in the Republican Party Democratic businessmen probably exert more individual influence on their party Elizabeth Drew in her 1983 book Politics and Money makes the point that the Democrats lastminute insertion of several provisions to make the 1981 tax cuts more generous was directly tied to their new recruiting campaign in business Coelho solicits business contributions by appealing to his listeners selfinterest I tell business groups he says  Whether you like it or not Im going to be involved in your business The sales pitch basically is Government is a part of their business and they should treat it as they would any other part of their business I dont advocate that they become rabid Democrats but that they get to know Democrats Because were going to be in control of the House for the rest of the century It seems likely that the 1988 Democratic Presidential nominee will be someone for whom entrepreneurs are a key constituency Four possible candidates in particular have been energetically making the rounds of business groups all over the country and portraying themselves as advocates of entrepreneurial growth Gary Hart of Colorado Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri Gov Bruce Babbitt of Arizona and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey Just a step behind them and playing in the same key are Representative Tim Wirth of Colorado and Charles Robb the former governor of Virginia Any of them would be the most businessoriented Democratic nominee rhetorically at least since John W Davis in 1924 Gov Mario Cuomo of New York the de facto leader of the liberal wing of the party has some business support but little of it outside New York NOTHER CENTRAL factor in the rise of the new entrepreneurs was the Wall Street boom that started in 1982 The 1970s had been relatively bad years for the market Stock prices failed to keep pace with inflation and fixed commissions were eliminated making Wall Street brokerage houses increasingly competitive and driving the more genteel ones out of existence Today the biggest money is being made in the market by upstarts who by background and by temperament are not drawn to moderate Republicanism The center of the action on Wall Street mergers and acquisitions is a war waged against big corporations by entrepreneurs T Boone Pickens Jr the chairman of Mesa Petroleum of Amarillo Tex and the bestknown of the new Wall Street raiders is a very active Reagan Republican who was cochairman of this years Presidents Dinner He is scornful of the economicpolitical nexus of corporate chief executives and moderate Republicans Two issues on which they fought were Pickenss attempt to take over Gulf Oil in 1984 and the Federal Reserve Boards decision early this year to raise the margin requirements on junk bonds which are used to finance many takeovers Mergers are a good example of the kind of economic issue that pits entrepreneurs against corporations and also translates into a political split between conservative populists and moderates About 10 years ago says Pickens the Business Roundtable didnt want any controls on mergers and acquisitions because the big companies were doing the acquiring The Roundtable is a predominantly corporate group whose political crusades are usually in behalf of the economic status quo Now that large companies are vulnerable Pickens adds they dont want any mergers In addition to the merger specialists another Wall Street subculture that does not like corporate statesmen or moderate Republicanism is made up of money managers whose world view tends to reflect their obsession with the price of stock Barton Biggs the Morgan Stanley executive who supports Jack Kemp sees himself as just one of hundreds of supplysiders in the ranks of money managers The Business Roundtable types tend to support Bush Biggs says They believe the conventional wisdom Austerity High interest rates Tight money The way to solve the deficit is to raise taxes Henry Kaufman [ the bearish chief economist of Salomon Brothers ] is their god President Reagan must at times be confused when the socalled great industrialists come down and say things to him that are at odds with what he believes instinctively austerity rather than growth Even the most prominent newgeneration Democrat on Wall Street Robert E Rubin a highranking partner at Goldman Sachs agrees that conservative Republicans are becoming stronger in the financial world I have the impression that 20 years ago a larger percentage of successful business people identified themselves as Democrats and a larger percentage were active he says I see it among people I know Theres been a shift The Republican line didnt sell while people still remembered the Depression But now youve had years of a good economy I think the Democrats will have a hard time appealing to people here if they dont have a position on the economy that appeals to people who are doing well THOUGH THE NEW GENERAtion of politically active business people can be found in both parties there are some common themes that run through their conversations themes that suggest where government policy might go in the next Presidential administration if a businessbacked candidate of either party wins These newcomers tend to be libertarian on social issues like drugs and abortion and to disdain the old organizationman ethos under which business saw itself as a force for shaping personal behavior They are populist in the sense of mistrusting the idea of rule by a businessgovernment elite that probably wouldnt include them They want the government to find a way to let American companies trade on an equal footing with foreign competitors but they arent very much interested in noneconomic foreignpolicy causes such as aid to the contras in Nicaragua They are in many cases almost religious in their devotion to tax cuts especially in the rates for business income and capital gains There are still corporate executives who are active and important in politics Lee Iacocca the chairman of Chrysler among the Democrats and James D Robinson 3d the chairman of American Express among the Republicans are two with high visibility right now But the important new players around the country are overwhelmingly selfemployed Some representative Republican names besides those already mentioned are Richard DeVos president of the Amway Corporation a privately held directsales company headquartered in Ada Mich Donald Bren the owner of the Irvine Company a giant real estate developer in Orange County Calif Ivan Boesky the most prominent of the Wall Street arbitrageurs who was recently appointed special adviser on Jewish affairs to the chairman of the Republican National Committee David H Murdock the California financier best known for his aggressive takeovers of Cannon Mills and Castle  Cooke Sam Walton of Bentonville Ark the billionaire chairman of the WalMart discount retail chain Among the new Democratic names is that of Nathan Landow a real estate developer in the Maryland suburbs of Washington a major fundraiser for Walter Mondales Presidential campaign in 1984 and the founder of IMPAC 88 a business group designed to play a kingmaking role in the next Democratic Presidential nomination campaign David Stein the developer of a large resort in southern California and an adviser and supporter in the 1984 Gary Hart campaign has founded a substantial Democratic political action committee and a research institute in Orange County Richard Dennis the Chicago commodities trader and political contributor has established a think tank called the Roosevelt Center with branches in Chicago and Washington and plans to publish a new liberal biweekly magazine early next year The corporate managers arent forever doomed to second place though Their hole card is that no boom lasts forever when times turn harder even entrepreneurs find themselves worrying about survival more than growth and their unbridled enthusiasm for the market becomes muted As the young regions and young industries that have incubated the newbreed business leaders mature these men may start to put more stress on the importance of economic stability and to see government less as an adversary In the oil patch today the rallying cry of the independents is not price decontrol but import taxes  in effect government price supports In Silicon Valley the burning issue is not tax cuts but keeping Japanese readonly memory chips out of the American market The time were in now may well be remembered as the highwater mark of a certain political mood in business rather than as the dawn of a new age
STATE TICKETS EYE L.I. VOTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/08/nyregion/state-tickets-eye-li-voters.html,REPUBLICAN and Democratic officials on Long Island strongly disagree on the effect that the Republican state ticket which is heavily tilted to the suburbs and the Democratic ticket which has no suburban representation will have on the Long Island vote The Democrats however expect Governor Cuomos outspoken opposition to the Shoreham nuclear power plant a key issue on Long Island to draw local voters to the ticket Despite their differences the party officials agreed that Nassau and Suffolk Counties with 17 percent of the states registered voters and up to 20 percent of the states turnout will play a critical role in the upcoming state elections State elections are won and lost out our way Assemblyman Patrick G Halpin of Lindenhurst said last week at the Democratic State Committee nominating meeting in Albany just a few days after the Republican State Committee designated its state ticket at a

Seaford who is running for State Attorney General  along with Westchester County Executive Andrew P ORourke the candidate for Governor Ulster County District Attorney E Michael Kavanagh the candidate for Lieutenant Governor and State Comptroller Edward V Regan of Westchester who is seeking reelection That makes four out of five suburbanites on the Republican ticket and the fifth Mr Kavanagh is

times generally with the support of all parties will be the Right to Life candidate for Governor Mr Dillon said he agreed to run after Mr ORourke rejected the nomination of the Right to Life Party whose leaders Ellen McCormack and Mary Jane Tobin are Nassau residents Long Islands political strenth is shown in recent electoral arithmetic In the last few statewide elections Nassau has had the highest vote of any county in the state while Suffolk ranks fifth behind Nassau Queens Brooklyn and Manhattan Beyond those figures both counties are no longer considered the Republican strongholds they once were in state elections In 1982 Lewis H Lehrman the Republican candidate for Governor won Nassau by 19000 votes and Suffolk by 23000 votes  far less than the 100000vote margins in each county that were once common for Republicans Politicians generally agree that Mr Lehrman would have defeated Governor Cuomo if he had run on Long Island as well as Republicans used to In the preceding election for Governor in 1978 a Suffolk resident Perry B Duryea of Montauk the Republican candidate his home county over thenGovernor Hugh L Carey by about 53000 votes  still not a landslide  and Nassau by only 15000 votes In 1974 with an incumbent Republican Governor Malcolm Wilson and Nassau County Executive Ralph G Caso as the Republican candidate for Lieutenant Governor Mr Carey won both Nassau and Suffolk At the same time Long Islands share of the total state vote has been creeping up toward 20 percent in recent years But Republicans and Democrats differed on the impact of the two majorparty tickets on Long Island Joseph N Mondello the Nassau Republican chairman echoed many Long Island Republicans when he said that the candidacies of Mr DAmato and Mr King would spur the Republican voter turnout on the Island and help not only the Republican state ticket but also local Republican candidates for the Legislature and the House of Representatives I think it will help  it will stimulate the local vote said Mr Mondello who nevertheless acknowledged that Mario Cuomo is an extremely strong candidate even in the suburbs Mr Mondello said that the election for Governor could affect close contests for the legislative seats of State Senators Dean G Skelos of Rockville Centre and Michael J Tully Jr of Roslyn Heights and Assemblyman Daniel Frisa of Westbury all Nassau Republicans and the contest for the seat of retiring Assemblywoman Mae W Newburger a Democrat of Great Neck But Nassau Republican officials said privately that polls by the Nassau Republican organization show Mr Cuomo to be a formidable candidate and even more popular than Mr DAmato the native son William M Blake the Suffolk Republican chairman said his polls show both the Governor and Senator DAmato to be as popular as President Reagan who won Suffolk by 164000 votes in 1984 Mr Blake said that one of our frustrations has been that such huge Republican pluralities in Presidential elections have not been reflected in state elections Long Island Democratic leaders trying to make the best of the contrast between the two tickets in suburban representation said that Republicans were in effect trying to hold their own in the suburbs by the composition of their ticket Theyre not coming from strength said Martin Mellman the Nassau Democratic chairman He said that the strong suburban cast of the Republican ticket was designed to compensate for a weak state ticket The Republicans need some cover to protect their incumbents in the Legislature Mr Halpin said They cant have Mario Cuomo running through the suburbs like gangbusters he added Democrats also look to the Shoreham issue which has been politically potent to help Governor Cuomo counter the strong suburban representation on the Republican ticket He has joined Suffolk politicians of both parties in flatly opposing the plants opening He referred to Shoreham in his acceptance speech last Tuesday at the Democratic State Committee nominating meeting saying Shoreham must not open Mr ORourke started out the campaign for Governor supporting the opening of Shoreham if it were found to be safe He has since retreated voicing doubts that Long Island could be safely evacuated in the case of a nuclear accident at Shoreham after Suffolk Republicans warned him that they might have to disassociate themselves from his position on the Shoreham issue Mr Dillon as the Right to Life candidate could also have an impact on the Republican and Democratic vote for Governor on Long Island Too many people are afraid of the abortion issue Mr Dillon said in explaining why he took the unorthodox route of running on another partys line If you really believe that these are human lives you have to give more than lip service Mr Mellman the Nassau Democratic chairman criticized Mr Dillon contending that he was in effect abandoning his own party The Dillon candidacy could be very important to the Right to Life Party which is threatened with losing its official status if it drops below 50000 votes for its candidate for Governor The party came close four years ago polling only 53256 votes A strong run by Mr Dillon particularly in Nassau where he has been elected three times would be critical for the partys statewide vote
"REAGAN'S LEGACY HINGES, IN PART, ON NOVEMBER FIGHT FOR THE SENATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/09/us/reagan-s-legacy-hinges-in-part-on-november-fight-for-the-senate.html,The struggle for control of the Senate involves not only the 34 seats at stake political leaders and analysts say but whether the Democrats can turn President Reagan into a truly lame duck by thwarting him in such areas as judicial appointments and his increasingly aggressive and conservative foreign policy Since they are certain to retain control of the House of Representatives the Democrats would also be able to advance legislative initiatives in such fields as military spending the environment health care and trade that differ sharply from Mr Reagans priorities Senator Alan K Simpson of Wyoming the Republican whip summed up the common view on Capitol Hill when he said that a Democratic victory would cause Mr Reagan to have a very irritating and frustrating two years  that I can assure you In all likelihood the lawmaker added the President would become Captain Veto with his cloak flying down Pennsylvania Avenue Theme for Fall Campaigns But political leaders disagree over whether the voting public wants to see a frustrated President Both parties are planning to use control of the Senate as a theme in their fall campaigns From the Democrats viewpoint Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the minority leader said that a change would pull the Senate back to the center and away from the agenda of the New Right Senator Simpson however said that some Republican candidates will argue Do you want the Reagan Revolution to continue through 1988 Or do you want to let the last two years fall into the basement In addition to the legislative issues at stake political analysts in the capital say that the November elections will also have a major impact on the Presidential election of 1988 The party controlling the Senate they say will have an enormous psychological boost and secure an important forum for propounding its ideas If the Republicans maintain control of the Senate under this assault and defeat the historic trend toward the opposition party in an offyear election Id say they begin the 1988 Presidential campaign with a very strong positive outlook said Joe Rothstein a political consultant who works for Democrats But if the Republicans lose the Senate you will stop seeing stories about the realignment of the parties There will be a feeling that the Democratic Party is on the way back The stakes for individual aspirants for the Presidency are less clear but most agree that a Republican victory would probably help Senator Bob Dole of Kansas the majority leader Conversely a Democratic triumph could boost the visibility of some younger Senators who are possible contenders for that partys nomination Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware for instance would probably become chairman of the Judiciary Committee when that panel could be handling contentious judicial appointments Sam Nunn of Georgia would assume the chairmanship of the Armed Services Committee and Bill Bradley of New Jersey would have a larger role in the deliberations of the Finance Committee Greater Ideological Zeal To many political leaders and analysts the fight for the Senate has become increasingly important in light of the Administrations greater determination to pursue Mr Reagans ideological precepts in his last years in office In foreign policy for instance these analysts point to the recent statement by Mr Reagan that he will abrogate the strategic arms limitation treaty unless the Soviet Union changes its behavior They also cite his persistent attempts to aid antiCommunist insurgents in Nicaragua and elsewhere In domestic policy goes this argument Mr Reagans ideological bent is probably most visible in judicial appointments which have already sparked a backlash on Capitol Hill The Senate Judiciary Committee last week rejected the nomination of Jefferson B Sessions 3d of Alabama to a Federal District Court post I think the Administration overinterpreted the 1984 elections said Kevin Phillips a Republican political analyst They went into an ideological mode and are still in it The Republicans now hold a 53to47 margin in Senate seats so the Democrats must make a net gain of four If the results end in a tie the Republicans would organize the chamber because Vice President Bush would cast the deciding vote This would be a dismaying prospect for Mr Bush who would be obliged to remain in Washington and cast votes on controversial issues rather than campaign throughout the country for the Presidency Result of 1980 Landslide Of the 34 seats up in November 22 are now held by Republicans and ever since the Reaganled landslide of 1980 Democrats have been pointing to 1986 as their best chance for regaining control of the Senate But many of the Republican newcomers spent a lot of energy shoring up their political bases And the economic recovery continues to produce stable inflation declining interest rates and a booming stock market In recent weeks however the political news has raised Democrats hopes a bit In Oregon where the sputtering timber industry is a major problem Senator Bob Packwood received a scare in the Republican primary Democrats hope this foreshadows a growing impatience with Republican incumbents in states that rely on agriculture oil and gas textiles steel and other industries that have not benefited from the recovery In Pennsylvania the Democrats nominated Representative Bob Edgar a highly regarded candidate to oppose Senator Arlen Specter In Alabama Representative Richard C Shelby won the Democratic nomination without a runoff and will face Senator Jeremiah Denton one of the most vulnerable Republicans in the fall The only gloomy news for Democrats came from California where Representative Ed Zschau survived a huge primary field to win the Republican nomination The incumbent Alan Cranston would have preferred a more conservative opponent Outcome Very Much in Doubt Senator George J Mitchell of Maine who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee predicts flatly that his party will have 53 seats in the next Senate Senator John Heinz of Pennsylvania his opposite number for the Republicans says that absent a major economic downturn there is virtually no chance that the Democrats can regain control Most independent analysts say that while the odds still favor the Republicans the outcome is very much in doubt Even if the Democrats hold only a onevote margin they would take over the majority leaders office and the chairmanship of all Senate committees chairmanships that control the flow of Senate business That means for instance that such issues as abortion or school prayer which have long been pushed by Reagan Administration and Republican leaders would have a much harder time reaching the Senate floor In Senator Cranstons view a key battleground will be foreign policy Administration initiatives like aid to the Nicaraguan rebels would be more easily blocked by the Democrats Financing for major weapons projects like the spacebased shield against nuclear attack could be significantly reduced by a Democratic Senate Domestically said Senator Orrin G Hatch a Republican from Utah it would be virtually impossible for President Reagan to leave a lasting legacy in the form of conservative Federal judges Passing Alternative Program Senator Heinz argues that a Democratic Senate would hinder White House initiatives in the economic area but would not have the power to pass an alternative program I think it would result in gridlock between Congress and the President he said The President would lose his ability to get his programs that are driving the economy forward Representative Edgar the Democratic candidate in Pennsylvania argues that a Congress dominated by his party would pass a whole string of bills from a stronger program to clean up toxic waste to a more aggresive policy on international trade If the President vetoed such measures Mr Edgar added the result would be to flush out some of the Presidents real policies and create some political issues for 1988 But Senator Simpson warns that Democrats who haul out their old laundry list of social programs would give the Republicans a good opportunity to score political points of their own and make Captain Veto a hero as he ends his political career
"OBSCENTIY DEBATE FOCUSES ATTENTION ON MAINE, WHERE VOTERS WEIGH ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/us/obscentiy-debate-focuses-attention-on-maine-where-voters-weigh-issue.html,A statewide referendum on obscenity Tuesday is drawing the attention of civil libertarians around the country They describe the vote as an unusual test of public attitudes at a time of increasing debate about a link between obscene materials and rape and child abuse According to experts the Maine vote will be the first statewide referendum ever held on obscenity The proposed statute borrows language from a 1973 Supreme Court decision on the method to be used to define obscenity If the measure passes it would mandate prison terms for those who sell promote or give for value materials that are found to be obscene But specifically what its effects would be has become the major issue of the debate here Besides the referendum voters in Maine will also nominate candidates in a race to succeed to Gov Joseph E Brennan a Democrat There are also primary elections in Virginia South Carolina and North Dakota while voters in the New York City Borough of Queens will choose a replacement for the late Representative Joseph P Addabbo Federal Reports Repercussions The Maine referendum is being held as a Federal commission appointed by Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d is preparing to release the final form of a report that says pornography plays a role in sexual violence sexual coercion or unwanted sexual agression While some researchers have complained that their findings have been misused as the basis for the report thousands of convenience stores have reacted to the study by removing sexually oriented materials from their shelves In April the Southland Corporation parent company of the 7Eleven convenience stores announced that it would stop selling Penthouse Forum and Playboy magazines The Lawson Milk Company which has 700 convenience stores in Ohio has temporarily removed Playboy and Penthouse from its shelves and is asking customers to vote on whether it should stock those periodicals Last year Gray Drug Inc of Cleveland removed adult magazines from its 443 stores and Revco DS of Twinsburg Ohio did the same at its 2101 stores How Playboy Is Selling A spokesman for Playboy David D Salyers said the magazines newsstand sales had held steady at 16 million although he said it was not possible to know if sales might have increased if the stores had not acted Total circulation is 41 million a month he said Playboy magazine and the American Booksellers Association which represents most of the nations largest book chains filed suit last month against Mr Meese and the pornography commission They charged that the panel was illegally attempting to suppress sexually explicit books and magazines accusing it of harassing major retailers by creating a blacklist of stores that sell Playboy and other publications The link between pornography and violence is debated Many social scientists say there is no concrete relationship although many agree that pornography can desensitize some people who view it Lines Drawn in Maine In Maine the obscenity referendum has pitted Yankee propriety against Yankee independence Opponents of the measure including librarians feminists and civil libertarians say it would lead to purges in libraries the banning of sex education texts and perhaps other limitations on what citizens can read and see Supporters who brought the issue to the ballot by gathering 50000 signatures say it is aimed only at hardcore material They say that Playboy and Penthouse would have never been judged obscene under the definition they propose Rape and child abuse and pornography are a statewide problem said George A Smith campaign manager for the proposal The Power of Prayer Its not to say what people can and cannot do its to protect the innocent said Cliffa Shackelford who has been working for months for the proposal which she described as a way of fighting Satan Mrs Shackelford whose husband Billy is the pastor of the Kennebec Valley Baptist Church in Waterville said the church had assigned scores of volunteers to pray for 15minute intervals Tuesday because prayer affects the outcome of everything in life Proponents have sponsored television advertisements in which an expert on child abuse blames pornography for cases of abuse and another in which a priests hand is seen lighting candles while the text of an endorsement of the referendum by the Roman Catholic Bishop of Maine appears on the screen In a television spot by the opponents a pile of books including the Alice Walker novel The Color Purple Steinbecks The Grapes of Wrath and the American Heritage Dictionary is seen burning viewed over the shoulder of a leatherjacketed policeman The setting seems improbable Mr Smith acknowledged that there are so few stores around the state selling hardcore pornography that you could virtually name them But Edith Smith his sister and the treasurer of the campaign said Were not Times Square were not the Combat Zone but we have a problem in the state of Maine A leaflet distributed by Concerned Citizens for Decency says Today in Maine a child is sexually assaulted every 9 hours and 33 minutes Conservative evangelical Christians are powerful in Maine The referendums proponents are credited with the resounding defeat of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution here two years ago after a campaign in which they raised questions about whether it would mean free abortion and sanction homosexual marriage The obscenity measure far overshadows the gubernatorial primary in which five Democrats all opposed to it and two Republicans both in favor are seeking their parties nominations Portland Has Taken Action Its really a question of whether you view the disease as worse than the cure said David A Lourie the Portland city attorney who is responsible for the enforcement of a local ordinance on which the proposed state law is based I have no doubt that the cure will occasionally be abused said Mr Lourie But he added when you look at the stuff it really is so bad that it defies description Portlands ordinance passed in November 1982 by a margin of 384 votes out of 26380 ballots cast provides fines of 50 to 500 It has not closed any of the citys handful of adult bookstores according to Mr Lourie who said Its become a a cost of doing business for them basically Portland is the only city in the state with such a rule The state measure if passed would specify penalties of up to five years in jail Like the Portland ordinance it is based on a United States Supreme Court definition from a 1973 case Miller v California that imposes a threepart test including that the material taken as a whole lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value Under another test the material would be deemed obscene if the average person applying contemporary community standards would find that taken as a whole the magazine book film or performance appeals to the prurient interest in sex Effect on Libraries Debated The proposed law covers depiction of normal or abnormal sex and does not exempt libraries Opponents say magazine subscribers could be prosecuted under a clause of the measure that says A person who possesses six or more obscene articles or six or more obscene devices whether such articles or devices are similar or identical is presumed to possess them with intent to promote them Determining exactly what would be covered by the law is one of the major focuses of debate Does this mean that you could read a book in Bangor you cant read in Brewer asked Betsy Sweet executive director of the Maine Commission for Women which opposes the referendum But Mr Smith pointing to the differing vigor with which a law against driving while intoxicated is enforced around Maine argued Thats our criminal justice system Thats not a reason not to pass this The outcome is being closely watched elsewhere For the citizens of this state to vote and to reject this referendum would be an extraordinary statement of support for the First Amendment said Barry W Lynn legislative counsel in Washington for the American Civil Liberties Union A small group of very zealous people are promoting the censorship causes he said adding that outside the privacy of the voting booth a lot of people are embarrassed to say they are wrong

Business and the Law; Contraceptive Suits a Concern,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/10/business/business-and-the-law-contraceptive-suits-a-concern.html,FOR many years a womans right to choose has been an issue in the legal morass surrounding abortion Now the question of choice in contraceptives is becoming a legal issue as well  but for very different reasons having to do with economics rather than religion or ethics Because of litigation and insurance costs American women have already lost their access to the most popular intrauterine devices on the market In February GD Searle whose IUDs were used by more than two million women announced it would stop selling the devices Searle said the IUDs had spawned nearly 800 lawsuits claiming that the devices caused pelvic infections sterility and birth defects Recently litigation has also become a threat to the continued viability of the most popular spermicide on the market Johnson  Johnsons OrthoGynol used by more than 25 million American women Although OrthoGynol has been on the market for about 40 years the spermicide only began to pose legal problems in 1982 when a Nashville woman filed suit saying that her daughters birth defects including a missing arm a misshaped hand and a blind eye had been caused by the mothers use of OrthoGynol She won a 51 million award in Federal district court and last month the United States Court of Appeals for the 11th Circuit upheld the decision reducing the damages to 47 million But spermicides produce profits of only about 3 million a year for Johnson  Johnson  and some analysts wonder how long the company will keep the product on the market if it has to pay more in damages than it earns in profits Johnson  Johnson which faces several other birthdefect suits arising out of OrthoGynol has asked for a rehearing of the case by the full circuit court Although the company denies reports that it plans to stop selling spermicides a spokesman concedes that the OrthoGynol judgment is a serious worry And it is not only the companys worry Doctors lawyers and womens rights advocates say that ultimately what is at stake in these individual damage suits is every womans access to the birth control method of her choice The contraceptive choices do seem to be dwindling and I dont have a solution to offer said Eve Paul legal counsel to the Planned Parenthood Federation of America We believe that the Searle IUDs are safe and we are still using our existing supplies but they are rapidly being used up From our review of the scientific studies we also believe that OrthoGynol is a safe product It would be a tragedy for women if OrthoGynol were to be taken away Some plaintiffs lawyers have suggested that Johnson  Johnson should put a warning on its spermicide but the company says that is not a solution The clear scientific consensus is that OrthoGynol does not cause birth defects James Murray a company spokesman said Given that we know of no link to birth defects we could not in good conscience write a warning It would have to be so vague as to be useless and it would create unnecessary anxiety and maybe unnecessary abortions Warnings can be a twoedged sword On one hand a company that knows of a hazard has a duty to warn  and a proper warning can provide some legal protection against lawsuits But warnings can hurt legally too The presence of a warning could generate more lawsuits if plaintiffs lawyers took it as evidence that we knew about a problem and sold the product anyway Mr Murray said Indeed warnings have not provided much protection for the manufacturers of oral contraceptives who in the early 1970s began inserting into their packages elaborate warnings listing many possible health hazards Despite the warnings there are still lots of lawsuits being filed against the oral contraceptive manufacturers said Sheila Birnbaum a New York product liability lawyer The problem with warnings is that you never know in advance whether they are going to protect you or not The perfect example is an oral contraceptive case where a jury found that a woman who had a stroke should get damages even though the insert warned that there was a risk of blood clots and death The jury said that because the warning didnt say the word stroke and this woman considered the complications of her stroke even worse than death the warning was inadequate In addition she said some courts let claimants use the fact that a company added a warning as evidence that it previously did not give adequate warning The legal standard on when a company must provide warnings varies from state to state Miss Birnbaum said but courts generally rule that a manufacturer should warn of possible hazards when a reasonable person would want to know about the risk You cant wait until theres a proven cause and effect relationship she said If theres some evidence of a risk you can go ahead with a warning that says something like It has been reported that this product can cause birth defects but other experts believe it is safe  What would be needed to insure that women will retain a range of contraceptive choices Miss Birnbaum added would be some sort of agency that could rule on the adequacy of warnings and guarantee that adherence to that warning would protect the company against liability The Food and Drug Administration rules on when warnings are required but the courts say that doesnt mean youre off the hook because its just minimal regulation she said
TAX DEBATE PACE SLOW IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/11/business/tax-debate-pace-slow-in-senate.html,No senators were willing to be the first to step forward to offer amendments to the taxrevision bill today The Senate continued with slowpaced discussion without votes My hunch said Senator Bob Packwood the bills floor manager is that no one wants to go first if their amendment is to be beaten 55 to 45 or 60 to 40 Tonight Senator William V Roth Jr a Delaware Republican proposed a sense of the Senate amendment It states that Senate conferees when they meet with House conferees to resolve differences in the two chambers tax bills should agree to fuller deductions for Individual Retirement Accounts than would be allowed by the Senate bill Conferees are not bound by such an amendment Comparison of the 2 Bills The House bill which was passed last December would maintain deductions for all IRAs the Senate bill as it stands now would allow such deductions only to taxpayers not covered by company pension plans Senator Packwood and the Senate Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas supported the Roth plan apparently to try to head off amendments meant to actually put the full IRA deductions in the Senate bill Senator Packwood said he hoped the Roth amendment would be voted on Wednesday and would break the logjam so that we can move with some speed through the legislation President Reagan urged senators at the White House this morning to approve the bill this week and Senator Dole chided his colleagues for their lack of activity in the Senates second week on cable television Its discouraging to watch CSpan and all you see is a quorum call Senator Dole said We told the people this would be exciting Tune us in I think we have to redeem ourselves if were going to be TV stars Packwood Shows Confidence Senator Packwood an Oregon Republican said he was confident he had enough votes to defeat amendments suggested so far including those that would maintain all IRA deductions and place curbs on organizations involved with abortions At the White House meeting President Reagan said he opposed an amendment advocated by three Republican senators  Gordon J Humphrey of New Hampshire William L Armstrong of Colorado and Jesse Helms of North Carolina  that would deny taxexempt status for hospitals where abortions are performed and charities that finance abortions The White House spokesman Larry Speakes said the President felt that the antiabortion proposal should be considered on its own and not as part of the tax bill The President favors antiabortion legislation Mr Speakes said He also favors a tax bill that doesnt have any amendments on it One issue that is expected to be debated in the days ahead is the effect of the tax bill on taxpayers in various income categories The staff of the Congressional Joint Committee on Taxation released data today showing that about onethird of all middleincome taxpayers would have their taxes increased by the Senate bill The staff provided the data reluctantly at the request of Senator Carl Levin a Michigan Democrat It said too little information was available to be confident of its reliability Senator Howard M Metzenbaum assailed the bills transition rules giving special exceptions from general tax rules to particular companies individuals and communities Mr Metzenbaum an Ohio Democrat said he would offer amendments to strike many of these provisions Some of them must be just he said But Joe Average Taxpayer does not have the opportunity to have a special exemption carved out for himself or for his wife In an interview Senator Packwood said he had used several criteria in deciding which transition rules to include in the bill approved by the Finance Committee which he heads For one thing he said he did not allow exceptions from the principle intended to curb tax shelters  that would keep investment losses from being used to offset other income Later in a Senate floor response to Mr Metzenbaum Mr Packwood said the senators who sponsored transition rules would be called on to defend them against his amendments Republican and Democratic senators hold regular party luncheon meetings on Tuesdays and much of the discussion today according to senators dealt with IRAs Senator Lloyd Bentsen of Texas said most of the Democrats seemed to agree that full deductions should be preserved but that they disagreed on how to raise the more than 20 billion of revenue over five years that such a proposal would cost Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York and Christopher J Dodd Democrat of Connecticut proposed that the money be raised by increasing the minimum tax applied to corporations and individuals to 226 percent from the 20 percent rate in the Senate bill Today President Reagan addressed about 100 supporters of tax revision many of them business executives in the Old Executive Office Building He told them Of course this bill will not solve all the problems but it will be progress with a capital P
NOW SEEKS TO CURB ANTI-ABORTIONISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/11/us/now-seeks-to-curb-anti-abortionists.html,The National Organization for Women announced today that it had filed a lawsuit seeking to put people who try to drive abortion clinics out of business under the same legal restraints that have curtailed the activities of the Ku Klux Klan The lawsuit filed Monday in Federal District Court in Wilmington Del was prepared by the Southern Poverty Law Center of Montgomery Ala which brought a similar type of suit against the Klan in 1982 In that case the center was granted an injunction under the Sherman Antitrust Act prohibiting the Klan from harassing members of the Vietnamese Fishermens Association of Galveston Bay Tex The Wilmington suit seeks no monetary damages but it asks for a nationwide injunction under the antitrust laws against antiabortion leaders contending that they have been traveling throughout the country organizing efforts to harass and intimidate people who operate legal abortion clinics and force them out of business This is clearly a nationwide criminal conspiracy which the Federal Government has refused to treat as such Eleanor Smeal president of NOW said at a news conference here announcing the suit ProLife Leader Named One of the principal defendants named in the suit is Joseph M Scheidler who heads the ProLife Action League based in Chicago and is the author of a manual entitled Closed 99 Ways to Stop Abortion J Richard Cohen chief attorney for the Southern Poverty Law Center said the suit was filed in Delaware because Mr Scheidler had targeted it to become the first state in the Union to be free of abortion facilities Mr Scheidler issued a statement in Chicago terming the action a harrassment lawsuit and asserting that it would only cause him to redouble his efforts against abortion clinics In a telephone interview before the suit was filed Mr Scheidler agreed that the aim of his organization was to close the clinics adding I have closed at least 40 clinics But he said he operated within the law creating through demonstrations and other actions a community climate that made it difficult for the clinics to operate Arrested in Delaware Protest Mr Scheidler who was arrested last April 12 on charges of trespassing in a demonstration against the Delaware Womans Health Center in Wilmington also said he had picked Delaware as the first state to be free of abortion clinics because it is a small state with only about eight abortion facilities and closing them would be a reasonable goal for his group to achieve The suit charges that Mr Scheidler other members of his organization and a related group the ProLife Direct Action League headed by John Patrick Ryan of St Louis go from community to community organizing campaigns that that through a series of harrssing actions create a community climate that makes it impossible for the clinics to continue in operation Morris S Dees director of the Southern Poverty Law Center said the centers interest in the lawsuit was that continued illegal harrassment of womens clinics and their medical personnel will result in fewer lowcost clinics available to deal with unplanned pregnancies and to assist in family planning in small towns Mrs Smeal said that although the police had been deligent in enforcing the law they had not been able to stop the defendants from engaging in what she said were illegal acts US Declines to Intervene She said the defendants were usually charged with misdemeanors and if convicted paid the fine and went on to the next community adding Some of them have been arrested hundreds of times but that has not stopped them Mrs Smeal said her organization turned to civil legal action because the Justice Department had declined to intervene on the ground that violence against abortion clinics was under the jursidiction of the local authorities not the Federal Government The National Abortion Federation an organization allied with NOW that advocates allowing women the freedom to choose an abortion said there were 224 reported acts of violence last year against abortion clinics throughout the country Antiabortion activists have disavowed any connection to the nationwide violence While noting that a number of abortion clinics had been bombed or damaged over the last several years Mr Dees said that action had been less effective in closing the clinics than the tactics now being used by Mr Scheidler and his followers Doctors are often so intimidated by demonstrations and charges that abortion is murder he said that they frequently withdraw from the clinics Mr Dees also said many women did not want to go through the ordeal of having the clinic invaded by antiabortion demonstrators while preparing for or undergoing an abortion Kansas Abortion Clinic Bombed WICHITA Kan June 10 AP  A bomb damaged an abortion clinic that had been the scene of protest marches and picketing causing 60000

The Court Pushes Back; Landslides Do Not Legitimize Extremists,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/opinion/the-court-pushes-back-landslides-do-not-legitimize-extremists.html,These have not been good days for the crusaders of the Reagan Justice Department  but they have been good for justice and a credit to the Supreme Court In case after case the Court has been striking down cold sometimes cruel Administration actions that shatter the bipartisan social consensus developed over three decades The zealots have behaved as though the Presidents landslides gave them license to swing every pendulum hard to the right Yesterdays abortion ruling is the latest example of Court decisions that push back resolutely to a decent center President Reagans lawyers have argued for the narrowest imaginable interpretation of laws intended to insure equal employment Last month the Court made clear that it rejects the Justice Departments cramped view of affirmative action and still thinks that the law is meant to foster positive steps toward an integrated workplace The Administration cut disability benefits truly ruthlessly using criteria never approved by Congress When courts ordered them to stop the Governments lawyers ignored the orders Finally last week a unanimous Supreme Court told them to stop laying bureaucratic traps for claimants Mr Reagan said he would get Government off peoples backs yet his lawyers wrote regulations injecting a Federal presence even into the family anguish felt over the proper treatment for babies with severe birth defects Judges the President says should interpret law not make it but as the Supreme Court ruled earlier this week his lawyers Baby Doe regulations wildly exceeded anything ever authorized by Congress Just as admirably the Court now rejects the Justice Departments pitch for overruling Roe v Wade the 1973 decision that vindicated a womans freedom to choose whether to bear a child The Court has recognized once again that state laws regulating medical practice although neutrallooking must be struck down if they erase a womans liberty in the name of health and safety Taken together these recent rulings should concern the President and his lawyers The Solicitor Generals office formerly enjoyed the Courts confidence regardless of which party was in power Now a social and political agenda clouds its legal arguments and erodes its reputation When this Supreme Court no hotbed of social or legal activism again and again pushes back to the center its pretty good evidence that conservatism was being carried to lawoffending extremes
NETWORKS VS. FREE SPEECH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/opinion/networks-vs-free-speech.html,One would think that organizations that espouse the value and necessity of free speech would be reluctant to adopt rules that inhibit robust and wideopen debate But that is exactly what the three commercial television networks have done in rejecting an advertisement about the Federal deficit produced by W R Grace and Company The advertisement depicts a trial in the year 2017 in which an old man supposedly responsible through inaction for our current deficits is called to account by a younger generation in a setting of decay and deprivation The purpose of the ad was not to recommend solutions to the problem but to call attention to the possible consequences of unchecked deficit financing In rejecting this message all three networks said in essence that the advertisement deals with a controversial issue of public importance that should be dealt with only through the process of journalism by news professionals We find that position indefensible in a free and democratic society One of this countrys guiding principles has been the view that it is essential to have more debate on public issues not less By closing down this kind of commercial advertising the networks arbitrarily limit an important and vital avenue for debate Other media particularly newspapers and magazines have long accepted socalled issue advertising that appears alongside news columns Over that long history no one has raised questions about journalistic independence and Graces requests for commercial time on network TV would in no way inhibit the networks journalistic integrity The networks sell commercial time to advertise soap deodorants cars hamburgers beer and wine Can it really be argued that allowing the same time to be used at the same rates to convey facts or ideas on important public issues will be detrimental to the interests of the country or the three networks The outofhand rejection of important policy messages would be bad enough were it not for the fact that in enforcing their policies the networks have been inconsistent and capricious In the past they have accepted ads from the Committee for Energy Awareness promoting increased uses of coal and nuclear power ads urging Americans to buy goods Made in the USA and even ads by Grace about the budget deficit All involve issues about which there is some or considerable public controversy and dispute How can they accept one and reject another What are the rules How are they enforced Finally the networks cant be serious when they argue that only news divisions and their people should deal with matters of public controversy They should spend some time glancing at the programs broadcast by their entertainment divisions There is hardly a public issue affecting American life that is not in some way touched upon by these programs abortion the right to life nuclear holocaust homosexuality drug addiction racial discrimination crime the activities of intelligence agencies Is there really any doubt that controversial issues are an integral part of the totality of television  and that their coverage goes way beyond their news programs Moreover who can tell where news divisions end and entertainment divisions begin Good Morning America a program awash in controversial issues is produced by ABCs entertainment division and we further venture a guess that neither the talk show host Phil Donahue nor evangelist Pat Robertson report to the presidents of anybodys news division When we discuss First Amendment rights it is important to remember that in 1969 the Supreme Court stated It is the rights of the viewers and listeners not the rights of the broadcaster which are paramount We recognize and respect the First Amendment rights of the networks We hope that they in turn will respect not only Graces First Amendment rights but those of the public as well The only thing were asking for is a set of rules that allow many voices to be heard  rules applied in a way that is fair equitable and more importantly in a way that makes sense in a pluralistic society
EXCERPTS FROM COURT OPINIONS ON ABORTION REGULATION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/excerpts-from-court-opinions-on-abortion-regulation-law.html,Following are excerpts from the Supreme Courts 5to4 decision today striking down a Pennsylvania law that regulated abortion Justice Harry A Blackmun wrote the majority opinion joined by Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall Lewis F Powell Jr and John Paul Stevens Chief Justice Warren E Burger dissented Justice Byron R White dissented separately joined by Justice William H Rehnquist Justice Sandra Day OConnor also dissented separately joined by Justice Rehnquist From the Opinion By Justice Blackmun This is an appeal from a judgment of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit reviewing the District Courts rulings upon a motion for a preliminary injunction The Court of Appeals held unconstitutional several provisions of Pennsylvanias current Abortion Control Act Among the provisions ruled invalid by the Court of Appeals were portions of Sec 3205 relating to informed consent Sec 3208 concerning printed information Secs 3210b and c having to do with postviability abortions and Sec 3211a and Secs 3214a and h regarding reporting requirements The Abortion Control Act was approved by the Governor of the Commonwealth on June 11 1982 By its own terms however it was to become effective only 180 days thereafter that is on the following Dec 8 After the passage of the act but before its effective date the present litigation was instituted in the United States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania The District Court concluded that with one exception the plaintiffs had failed to establish a likelihood of success on the merits and thus were not entitled to preliminary injunctive relief The Court of Appeals with one judge concurring in part and dissenting in part ruled that various provisions of the Act were unconstitutional Review of Challenges Less than three years ago this Court reviewed challenges to state and municipal legislation regulating the performance of abortions In Akron the Court specifically reaffirmed Roe v Wade 1973 Again today we reaffirm the general principles laid down in Roe and in Akron In the years since this Courts decision in Roe states and municipalities have adopted a number of measures seemingly designed to prevent a woman with the advice of her physician from exercising her freedom of choice But the constitutional principles that led this Court to its decisions in 1973 still provide the compelling reason for recognizing the constitutional dimensions of a womans right to decide whether to end her pregnancy The states are not free under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies Appellants claim that the statutory provisions before us today further legitimate compelling interests of the Commonwealth Close analysis of those provisions however shows that they wholly subordinate constitutional privacy interests and concerns with maternal health in an effort to deter a woman from making a decision that with her physician is hers to make We turn to the challenged statutes 1 Section 3205 informed consent and Sec 3208 printed information Section 3205a requires that the woman give her voluntary and informed consent to an abortion Failure to observe the provisions of Sec 3205 subjects the physician to suspension or revocation of his license and subjects any other person obligated to provide information relating to informed consent to criminal penalties Sec 3205c A requirement that the woman give what is truly a voluntary and informed consent as a general proposition is of course proper and is surely not unconstitutional But the state may not require the delivery of information designed to influence the womens informed choice between abortion or childbirth Information for Woman Seven explicit kinds of information must be delivered to the woman at least 24 hours before her consent is given and five of these must be presented by the womans physician The five are a the name of the physician who will perform the abortion b the fact that there may be detrimental physical and psychological effects which are not accurately foreseeable c the particular medical risks associated with the particular abortion procedure to the employed d the probable gestational age and e the medical risks associated with carrying her child to term The remaining two categories are f the fact that medical assistance benefits may be available for prenatal care childbirth and neonatal care and g the fact that the father is liable to assist in the childs support even in instances where the father has offered to pay for the abortion Secs 3205a 1 and 2 The woman also must be informed that materials printed and supplied by the Commonwealth that describe the fetus and that list agencies offering alternatives to abortion are available for her review If she chooses to review the materials but is unable to read the materials shall be read to her and any answer she seeks must be provided her in her own language She must certify in writing prior to the abortion that all this has been done The materials must describe the probable anatomical and physiological characteristics of the unborn child at twoweek gestational increments from fertilization to full term including any relevant information on the possibility of the unborn childs survival The printed materials required by Secs 3205 and 3208 seem to us to be nothing less than an outright attempt to wedge the Commonwealths message discouraging abortion into the privacy of the informedconsent dialogue between the woman and her physician The mandated description of fetal characteristics at twoweek intervals no matter how objective is plainly overinclusive This is not medical information that is always relevant to the womans decision and it may serve only to confuse and punish her and to heighten her anxiety contrary to accepted medical practice Forcing the physician or counselor to present the materials and the list to the woman makes him or her in effect an agent of the state in treating the woman and places his or her imprimatur upon both the materials and the list All this is or comes close to being state medicine imposed upon the woman not the professional medical guidance she seeks and it officially structures  as it obviously was intended to do  the dialogue between the woman and her physician The requirements of Secs 3205a2i and ii that the woman be advised that medical assistance benefits may be available and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in the support of the child similarly are poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision The requirements of Secs 3205a1ii and iii that the woman be informed by the physician of detrimental physical and psychological effects and of all particular medical risks compound the problem of medical attendance increase the patients anxiety and intrude upon the physicians exercise of proper professional judgment This type of compelled information is the antithesis of informed consent Report by Physician Section 3211a requires the physician to report the basis for his determination that a child is not viable It applies only after the first trimester The report required by Secs 3214a and h is detailed and must include among other things identification of the performing and referring physicians and of the facility or agency information as to the womans political subdivision and state of residence age race marital status and number of prior pregnancies the date of her last menstrual period and the probable gestational age the basis for any judgment that a medical emergency existed the basis for any determination of nonviability and the method of payment for the abortion The report is to be signed by the attending physician Despite the fact that Sec 3214e2 provides that such reports shall not be deemed public records within the meaning of the Commonwealths RighttoKnow Law The scope of the information required and its availability to the public belie any assertions by the Commonwealth that it is advancing any legitimate interest Section 3210c requires that a second physician be present during an abortion performed when viability is possible The second physician is to take control of the child and    provide immediate medical care for the child taking all reasonable steps necessary in his judgment to preserve the childs life and health Violation of this requirement is a felony of the third degree In Planned Parenthood Assn v Ashcroft 1983 the Court by a 54 vote but not by a controlling single opinion ruled that a Missouri statute requiring the presence of a second physician during an abortion performed after viability was constitutional No Express Exception Like the Missouri statute Sec 3210c of the Pennsylvanian statute contains no express exception for an emergency situation While the Missouri statute in the view of Justice Powell was worded sufficiently to imply an emergency exception Pennsylvanias statute contains no such comforting or helpful language and evinces no intent to protect a woman whose life may be at risk Section 3210a provides only a defense to criminal liability for a physician who concluded in good faith that a fetus was nonviable or that the abortion was necessary to preserve maternal life or health It does not relate to the secondphysician requirement and its words are not words of emergency All the factors are here for chilling the performance of a late abortion which more than one performed at an earlier date perhaps tends to be under emergency conditions Constitutional rights do not always have easily ascertainable boundaries and controversy over the meaning of our nations most majestic guarantees frequently has been turbulent As judges however we are sworn to uphold the law even when its content gives rise to bitter dispute See Cooper v Aaron 1958 We recognized at the very beginning of our opinion in Roe that abortion raises moral and spiritual questions over which honorable persons can disagree sincerely and profoundly But those disagreements did not then and do not now relieve us of our duty to apply the Constitution faithfully Our cases long have recognized that the Constitution embodies a promise that a certain private sphere of individual liberty will be kept largely beyond the reach of government That promise extends to women as well as to men Few decisions are more personal and intimate more properly private or more basic to individual dignity and autonomy that a womans decision with the guidance of her physician and within the limits specified in Roe  whether to end her pregnancy A womans right to make that choice freely is fundamental Any other result in our view would protect inadequately a central part of the sphere of liberty that our law guarantees equally to all The Court of Appeals correctly invalidated the specified provisions of Pennsylvanias 1982 Abortion Control Act Its judgment is affirmed From Dissenting Opinions By Chief Justice Burger In my concurrence in the companion case to Roe v Wade in 1973 I noted that Plainly the Court today rejects any claim that the Constitution requires abortions on demand Later In Maher v Roe 1977 I stated my view that the Courts holdings in Roe    and Doe v Bolton    simply require that a State not create an absolute barrier to a womans decision to have an abortion I based my concurring statements in Roe and Maher on the principle expressed in the Courts opinion in Roe that the right to an abortion is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in regulation In short every member of the Roe Court rejected the idea of abortion on demand The Courts opinion today however plainly undermines that important principle and I regretfully conclude that some of the concerns of the dissenting Justices in Roe as well as the concerns I expressed in my separate opinion have now been realized The extent to which the Court has departed from the limitations expressed in Roe is readily apparent In Roe the Court emphasized that the State does have an important and legitimate interest in preserving and protectng the health of the pregnant woman     Yet today the Court astonishingly goes so far as to say that the state may not even require that a woman contemplating an abortion be provided with accurate medical information concerning the risks inherent in the medical procedure which she is about to undergo and the availability of alternatives if she elects not to run those risks Can anyone doubt that the state could impose a similar requirement with respect to other medical procedures The Courts astounding rationale is that such information might have the effect of discouraging abortion as though abortion is something to be advocated and encouraged Another Legitimate Interest The Court in Roe further recognized that the State has still another important and legitimate interest which is separate and distinct from the interest in protecting maternal health ie an interest in protecting the potentiality of human life The point at which these interests become compelling under Roe is at viability of the fetus Today however the Court abandons that standard and renders the solemnly stated concerns of the 1973 Roe opinion for the interests of the states mere shallow rhetoric Undoubtedly the Pennsylvania Legislature added the second physician requirement on the mistaken assumption that this Court meant what it said in Roe concerning the compelling interest of the states in potential life after viability The Courts opinion today is but the most recent indication of the distance traveled since Roe Perhaps the first important road marker was the Courts holding in Planned Parenthood of Missouri v Danforth 1976 in which the Court held over the dissent of Justice White joined by Justice Rehnquist and myself that the State may not require that minors seeking an abortion first obtain parental consent In discovering constitutional infirmities in state regulations of abortion that are in accord with our history and tradition we may have lured judges into roaming at large in the constitutional field Griswold v Connecticut 1965 Harlan J concurring The soundness of our holdings must be tested by the decisions that purport to follow them If Danforth and todays holding really mean what they seem to say I agree we should reexamine Roe By Justice White With Whom Justice Rehnquist Joins Today the Court carries forward the difficult and continuing venture in substantive due process that began with the decision in Roe v Wade 1973 and has led the Court further and further afield in the 13 years since that decision was handed down I was in dissent in Roe v Wade and am in dissent today In Part I below I state why I continue to believe that this venture has been fundamentally misguided since its inception In Part II I submit that even accepting Roe v Wade the concerns underlying that decision by no means command or justify the results reached today Indeed in my view our precedents in this area applied in a manner consistent with sound principles of constitutional adjudication require reversal of the Court of Appeals on the ground that the provisions before us are facially constitutional Cases like this one involve our assumed power to set aside on grounds of unconstitutionality a state or Federal statute representing the democratically expressed will of the people Because the Constitution itself is ordained and established by the people of the United States constitutional adjudication by this Court does not in theory at any rate frustrate the authority of the people to govern themselves through institutions of their own devising and in accordance with principles of their own choosing But decisions that find in the Constitution principles or values that cannot fairly be read into that document usurp the peoples authority for such decisions represent choices that the people have never made and that they cannot disavow through corrective legislation For this reason it is essential that this Court maintain the power to restore authority to its proper possessors by correcting constitutional decisions that on reconsideration are found to be mistaken Overruling Decisions The Court has therefore adhered to the rule that stare decisis is not rigidly applied in cases involving constitutional issues and has not hesitated to overrule decisions or even whole lines of cases where experience scholarship and reflection demonstrated that their fundamental premises were not to be found in the Constitution In my view the time has come to recognize that Roe v Wade no less than the cases overruled by the Court in the decisions I have just cited departs from a proper understanding of the Constitution and to overrule it Roe v Wade posits that a woman has a fundamental right to terminate her pregnancy and that this right may be restricted only in the service of two compelling state interests the interest in maternal health which becomes compelling only at the stage in pregnancy at which an abortion becomes more hazardous than carrying the pregnancy to term and the interest in protecting the life of the fetus which becomes compelling only at the point of viability A reader of the Constitution might be surprised to find that it encompassed these detailed rules for the text obviously contains no references to abortion nor indeed to pregnancy or reproduction generally and of course it is highly doubtful that the authors of any of the provisions of the Constitution believed that they were giving protection to abortion As its prior cases clearly show however this Court does not subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possible be limited to the plain meaning of the Constitutions text or to the subjective intention of the Framers Constitution Is Not a Deed The Constitution is not a deed setting forth the precise metes and bounds of its subject matter rather it is a document announcing fundamental principles in valueladen terms that leave ample scope for the exercise of normative judgment by those charged with interpreting and applying it In particular the Due Process Clause of the 14th Amendment which forbids the deprivation of life liberty or property without due process of law has been read by the majority of the Court to be broad enough to provide substantive protection against state infringement of a broad range of individual interests I can certainly agree with the proposition  which I deem indisputable  that a womans ability to choose an abortion is a species of liberty that is subject to the general protections of the Due Process Clause I cannot agree however that this liberty is so fundamental that restrictions upon it call into play anything more than the most minimal judicial scrutiny Fundamental liberties and interests are most clearly present when the Constitution provides specific textual recognition of their existence and importance Thus the Court is on relatively firm ground when it deems certain of the liberties set forth in the Bill of Rights to be fundamental and therefore finds them incorporated in the 14th Amendments guarantee that no state may deprive any person of liberty without due process of law When the Court ventures further and defines as fundamental liberties that are nowhere mentioned in the Constitution or that are present only in the socalled penumbras or specifically enumerated rights it must of necessity act with more caution lest it open itself to the accusation that in the name of identifying constitutional principles to which the people have consented in framing their Constitution the Court has done nothing more than impose its own controversial choices of value upon the people Constraints Upon Court Attempts to articulate the constraints that must operate upon the Court when it employs the Due Process Clause to protect liberties not specifically enumerated in the text of the Constitution have produced varying definitions of fundamental liberties One approach has been to limit the class of fundamental liberties to those interests that are implicit in the concept of ordered liberty such that neither liberty nor justice would exist if [ they ] were sacrificed Another broader approach is to define fundamental liberties as those that are deeply rooted in this nations history and tradition Their utility lies in their effort to identify some source of constitutional value that reflects not the philosophical predilections of individual judges but basic choices made by the people themselves in constituting their system of government and they seek to achieve this end through locating fundamental rights either in the traditions and consensus of our society as a whole or in the logical implications of a system that recognizes both individual liberty and democratic order Whether either of these approaches can as Justice Harlan hoped prevent judges from roaming at large in the constitutional field is debatable What for me is not subject to debate however is that either of the basic definitions of fundamental liberties taken seriously indicates the illegitimacy of the Courts decision in Roe v Wade The Court has justified the recognition of a womans fundamental right to terminate her pregnancy by invoking decisions upholding claims of personal autonomy in connection with the conduct of family life the rearing of children marital privacy and the use of contraceptives and the preservation of the individuals capacity to procreate Issues in Cases Differ The issues in the cases cited differ from those at stake where abortion is concerned As the Court appropriately recognized in Roe v Wade  [ t ] he pregnant woman cannot be isolated in her privacy the termination of a pregnancy typically involves the destruction of another entity the fetus However one answers the metaphysical or theological question whether the fetus is a human being or the legal question whether it is a person as that term is used in the Constitution one must at least recognize first that the fetus is an entity that bears in its cells all the genetic information that characterizes a member of the species homo sapiens and distinguishes an individual member of that species from all others and second that there is no nonarbitrary line separating a fetus from a child or indeed an adult human being Given that the continued existence and development  that is to say the life  of such an entity are so directly at stake in the womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy that decision must be recognized as sui generis different in kind from the others that the Court has protected under the rubric of personal or family privacy and autonomy Accordingly the decisions cited by the Court both in Roe and in its opinion today as precedent for the fundamental nature of the liberty to choose abortion do not even if all are accepted as valid dictate the Courts classification The Courts opinion in Roe itself convincingly refutes the notion that the abortion liberty is deeply rooted in the history or tradition of our people as does the continuing and deep division of the people themselves over the question of abortion As for the notion that choice in the matter of abortion is implicit in the concept of ordered liberty it seems apparent to me that a free egalitarian and democratic society does not presuppose any particular rule or set of rules with respect to abortion Differences on the Issue And again the fact that many men and women of good will and high commitment to constitutional government place themselves on both sides of the abortion controversy strengthens my own conviction that the values animating the Constitution do not compel recognition of the abortion liberty as fundamental In so denominating that liberty the Court engages not in constitutional interpretation but in the unrestrained imposition of its own extraconstitutional value preferences A second equally basic error infects the Courts decision in Roe v Wade The detailed set of rules governing state restrictions on abortion that the Court first articulated in Roe and has since refined and elaborated presupposes not only that the womans liberty to choose an abortion is fundamental but also that the states countervailing interest in protecting fetal life or as the Court would have it potential human life becomes compelling only at the point at which the fetus is viable As Justice OConnor pointed out three years ao the Courts choice of viability as the point at which the states interest becomes compelling is entirely arbitrary The governmental interest at issue is in protecting those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb The substantiality of this interest is in no way dependent on the probability that the fetus may be capable of surviving outside the womb at any given point in its development Both the characterization of the abortion liberty as fundamental and the denigration of the states interest in preserving the lives of nonviable fetuses are essential to the detailed set of constitutional rules devised by the Court to limit the states power to regulate abortion If either or both of these facets of Roe v Wade were rejected a broad range of limitations on abortion including outright prohibition that are now unavailable to the states would again become constitutional possibilities Hotly Contested Issue In my view such a state of affairs would be highly desirable from the standpoint of the Constitution Abortion is a hotly contested moral and political issue Such issues in our society are to be resolved by the will of the people either as expressed through legislation or through the general principles they have already incorporated into the Constitution they have adopted Roe v Wade implies that the people have already resolved the debate by weaving into the Constitution the values and principles that answer the issue I believe it is clear that the people have never not in 1787 1791 1868 or at any time since  done any such thing I would return the issue to the people by overruling Roe v Wade The Court begins by striking down statutory provisions designed to ensure that the womans choice of an abortion is fully informed  that is that she is aware not only of the reasons for having an abortion but also of the risks associated with an abortion and the availability of assistance that might make the alternative of normal childbirth more attractive than it might otherwise appear One searches the majoritys opinion in vain for a convincing reason why the apparently laudable policy of promoting informed consent becomes unconstitutional when the subject is abortion The majority appears to reason that the informed consent provisions are invalid because the information they require may increase the womans anxiety about the procedure and even influence her in her choice Both observations are undoubtedly true but they by no means cast the constitutionality of the provisions into question It is in the very nature of informed consent provisions that they may produce some anxiety in the patient and influence her in her choice This is in fact their reason for existence Reporting Requirements The majoritys decision to strike down the reporting requirements of the statute is equally extraordinary The requirements obviously serve legitimate purposes Given that the subject of abortion is a matter of considerable public interest and debate constrained to some extent of course by the preemptive effect of this Courts illconceived constitutional decisions the collection and dissemination of demographic information concerning abortions is clearly a legitimate goal of public policy I can accept the proposition that a statute whose purpose and effect are to allow harassment and intimidation of citizens for their constitutionally protected conduct is unconstitutional but the majoritys action in striking down the Pennsylvania statute on this basis is procedurally and substantively indefensible Finally in addition to being procedurally flawed the majoritys holding is substantively suspect It is implausible that a particular patient could be identified on the basis of the combination of the general identifying information and the specific medical information in these reports by anyone who did not already know at a minimum that the woman had been pregnant and obtained an abortion Accordingly the provisions pose little or no threat to the womans privacy The majority resorts to linguistic nitpicking in striking down the provision requiring physicians aborting viable fetuses to use the method of abortion most likely to result in fetal survival unless that method would post a significantly greater medical risk to the life or health of the pregnant woman than would other available methods The majority concludes that the statutes use of the word significantly indicates that the statute represents an unlawful tradeoff between the womans health and the chance of fetal survival Not only is this conclusion based on a wholly unreasonable interpretation of the statute but the statute would also be constitutional even if it meant what the majority says it means Ruling Seen and Inconsistent The Courts ruling in this respect is not even consistent with its decision in Roe v Wade In Roe the Court conceded that the states interest in preserving the life of a viable fetus is a compelling one and the Court has never disavowed that concession The Court now holds that this compelling interest cannot justify any regulation that imposes a quantifiable medical risk upon the pregnant woman who seeks to abort a viable fetus if attempting to save the fetus imposes any additional risk of injury to the woman she must be permitted to kill it The Courts ruling today that any tradeoff between the womans health and fetal survival is impermissible is not only inconsistent with Roes recognition of a compelling state interest in viable fetal life it directly contradicts one of the essential holdings of Roe  that is that the state may forbid all postviability abortions except when necessary to protect the life or health of the pregnant woman The Court strikes down the statutes secondphysician requirement because in its view the existence of a medical emergency requiring an immediate abortion to save the life of the pregnant woman would not be a defense to a prosecution under the statute I cannot accept the majoritys conclusion that the statute does not provide for the equivalent of a defense of emergency The decision today appears symptomatic of the Courts own insecurity over its handiwork in Roe v Wade and the cases following that decison Aware that in Roe it essentially created something out of nothing and that there are many in this country who hold that decision to be basically illegitimate the Court responds defensively Perceiving in a state implementing the States legitimate policy of prefering childbirth to abortion a threat to or criticism of the decision in Roe v Wade the majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that in no way contravene the right recognized in Roe I do not share the warped point of view of the majority nor can I follow the tortuous path the majority treads in procedding to strike down the statute before us I dissent By Justice OConnor With Whom Justice Rehnquist Joins This Courts abortion decisions have already worked a major distortion in the Courts constitutional jurisprudence Todays decision goes further and makes it painfully clear that no legal rule or doctrine is safe from ad hoc nullification by this Court when an occasion for its application arises in a case involving state regulation of abortion The permissible scope of abortion requlation is not the only constitutional issue on which this Court is divided but  except when it comes to abortion  the Court
has generally refused to let such disagreements however longstanding or deeply felt prevent it from evenhandedly applying uncontroversial legal doctrines to cases that come before it That the Courts unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing the regulation of abortion has had this institutionally debilitating effect should not be surprising however since the Court is not suited to the expansive role it has claimed for itself in the series of cases that began with Roe v Wade The Court today holds that the Court of Appeals correctly invalidated the specific provisions of Pennsylvanias 1982 Abortion Control Act In so doing the Court prematurely decides serious constitutional questions on an inadequate record in contravention of settled principles of constitutional adjudication and procedural fairness The constitutionality of the challenged provisions was not properly before the Court of Appeals and is not properly before this Court There has been no trial on the merits and appellants have had no opportunity to develop facts that might have a bearing on the constitutionality of the statute The only question properly before the Court is whether or not a preliminary injunction should have been issued to restrain enforcement of the challenged provisions pending trial on the merits This Courts decisions do not establish a likelihood that appellees would succeed on the merits of their constitutional claims sufficient to warrant overturning the District Courts denial of a preliminary injunction Under the approach to abortion regulation outlined in my dissenting opinion in Akron to which I adhere it is even clearer that no preliminary injunction should have issued I therefore dissent Because Pennsylvania has not asked the Court to reconsider or overrul Roe v Wade I do not address that question I do however remain of the views expressed in my dissent in Akron The State has compelling interests in ensuring maternal health and in protecting potential human life and these interests exist throughout pregnancy Under this Courts fundamentalrights jurisprudence judicial scrutiny of state regulation of abortion should be limited to whether the state law bears a rational relationship to legitimate purposes such as the advancement of these compelling interests with heightened scrutiny reserved for instances in which the State has imposed an undue burden on the abortion decision By holding that each of the challenged provisions is facially unconstitutional as a matter of law and that no conceivable facts appellants might offer could alter this result the Court appears to adopt as its new test a per se rule under which any regulation touching on abortion must be invalidated if it poses an unacceptable danger of deterring the exercise of that right Under this prophylactic test it seems that the mere possibility that some women will be less likely to choose to have an abortion by virtue of the presence of a particular state regulation suffices to invalidate it I dispute not only the wisdom but the legitimacy of the Courts attempt to discredit and preempt state abortion regulation regardless of the interests it serves and the impact it has In my view todays decision makes bad constitutional law and bad procedural law The  undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket  in this case is not the one the Court purports to discover in Pennsylvanias statute it is the one the Court has tailored for the 50 States I respectfuly dissent,,

PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON FOREIGN AND DOMESTIC ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/president-s-news-conference-on-foreign-and-domestic-issues.html,Following is a transcript of President Reagans news conference last night in Washington as recorded by The New York Times OPENING STATEMENT Good evening please be seated I have an opening statement I want to say a few words tonight about three important issues that are now before the Congress Weve reined in government spending and with GrammRudman we can look forward to a disappearing deficit by 1991 But there are still a few obstacles in the way on our road to a balanced budget Rather than make the sensible adjustments weve suggested some in Congress apparently intend to take large and dangerous cuts out of our national defense And again we hear that constant refrain coming out of Washington Raise taxes It is time for Congress to take a responsible approach to spending decisions and when it comes to taxes lets get into the spirit of the times Ive said it before and Ill say it as often as it takes Ill veto any tax hike that comes across my desk Not only will we not raise taxes before I leave office I plan to make sure we have a balanced budget amendment that puts a permanent lid on taxes and doesnt let the government grow any faster than the economy So weve made progress but we have a ways to go on the budget Progress on Taxes Im glad to say though that were moving on tax reform that will achieve fairness and promote growth Were looking at a tax reform bill in the Senate thats quite simply one of the best antipoverty programs one of the best jobcreation programs and one of the best profamily bills this country has ever seen all rolled into one I hope the House and the Senate will move quickly to bring this bill into law so America can make a fresh start in 1987 and even lower tax rates even more jobs and even stronger growth Finally there is the upcoming vote on aid to the Nicaraguan freedom fighters Congress must understand the urgency of the situation in Central America Delay is deadly and plays right along with the Communist game plan because while we may have tied our own hands the Soviets Cubans and Libyans havent tied theirs With over a billion dollars of support and some of the most fearsome weapons in the Soviet arsenal the Communist strategy is simple Hold off American aid as long as possible in the hope they can destroy all opposition before help arrives Its time for an upanddown vote on freedom in Nicaragua an upanddown vote on whether the United States is going to stop Soviet expansionism on the American mainland while the price is still not too high and the risks are still not too great We must act now in a bipartisan way to do the right thing to rescue freedom in Nicaragua and protect the national security of the United States Now Helen its your turn QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS Arms Treaty Q Mr President your decision to tear up the SALT treaty by the end of the year has caused great consternation among the allies among members of Congress on both sides of the aisle among others who fear that you are creating a more dangerous world My question is is this decision irreversible And Id like to follow up A I Helen I have to say that I can understand why they would be distressed with the way the news has been carried but let me go back to what the situation really is First of all this treaty was signed seven years ago was never ratified no it was more than seven years ago I guess  but for seven years there was supposed to have been this restraint and this observation of the this observance of the treatys terms And for seven years this country has been doing that The Soviet regime for seven years has been violating the restraints of the treaty We found it necessary to  or advisable to do away with two Poseidon submarines as we launched the last Trident but that I had to make plain was not  rather did keep us within the constraints of the SALT agreement That wasnt the reason Had there been no SALT agreement we would have done away with those two submarines because  or dismantled them  because of the cost and the military value of them  or lack of it But then what I said was that before we reached another point where this might be an issue at all several months away which has to do with the arming of the 131st B52 with a new airlaunch cruise missile And in the interim period I said that we could not go on unilaterally observing the constraints while the Soviet Union violated them and gained ever greater superiority over us and that we were going to be bound from now on by the necessity of maintaining a deterrent Were not seeking to achieve superiority over them but were certainly not going to let them go on increasing their superiority over us I said because we have these several months before that moment comes up that we were going to do our utmost since they themselves have talked of arms reduction But we were going to do our utmost to see if we couldnt involve them in replacing the SALT Treaty which first of all was never ratified as I said but second of all would no longer be in power if it had been ratified because it was stated for a limited period of time that if we could replace that with a realistic program of arms reduction which has been my goal ever since Ive been here Now we have the first Soviet leader to my knowledge that has ever voluntarily spoken of reducing nuclear weapons and we want to follow up on that Congressional Critics Q It sounds like you are going to tear it up Mr President Do you agree with Richard Perle who branded as Soviet supporters members of Congress who want to keep you within the limits of this treaty A Im not going to make any comment on anyone who wants to keep us  but I did find it rather strange that some of the senators who spoke very critically of me without really understanding what it is that Ive tried to explain about this some of them were members of the Senate when they refused to ratify the treaty to begin with The treaty was really nothing but the legitimizing of an arms race It didnt do anything to reduce nuclear weapons or the nuclear threat All it did was regulate how fast and how much we could continue increasing the number of weapons So I was always hostile to that particular treaty because it did not reduce weapons and thats what were going to do But again as I say the Soviets have an opportunity to meet us now with regard to solve the very things theyve been proposing  arms reduction And we will observe the constraints to the same extent that the Soviet Union does but we cant go on unilaterally observing this while they take off on their own with the violations that theyve already made and probably more to come Future of Shuttle Q Mr President NASA is awaiting your decision on how to replace the Challenger spacecraft Could you tell us tonight how you would finance the fourth orbiter And if you cant tell us that could you explain whats holding up your decision A Well for one thing were studying the report that weve received and there are many things that have to be decided There is a backlog now of space cargo that is supposed to be up there and we have the problem of determining whether we shouldnt increase the number of unmanned launchers for many of those things that could put them in space And then see where we can come with the  I believe me I want to go forward and I think we all do  with the shuttle program but how soon we can get to that is a question and in the meantime should we emphasize more of the unlaunched to get to move on that backlog that we have of cargo that needs to get into space So I dont have an answer for you on this except that yes I think we should go forward with another shuttle The Rogers Report Q A followup sir Would that for the shuttle would you insist that fourth orbiter incorporate all the recommendations of the Rogers commission when it is built A Well again were still in the midst of studying that now that weve just received it so I cant answer something as specific as that about that Jerry Nicaragua Policy Q I have a twopart question sir Youve left no doubt through your public statements of your determination not to permit Nicaragua to become another Communist Cuba or a Libya What means are left to the United States if the contras are defeated by any means whatever Is a naval quarantine a possibility A I couldnt and Jerry I wouldnt comment on anything that might be further actions for us because I dont think you could do that without informing them of anything were thinking And right now we have not we have not planned for any contingency beyond aiding the contras because we think that  Ive got to stop using that word that was the Sandinistas title for them and I dont like to do anything theyre doing  so the freedom fighters we believe with all the information that we have that they are capable of at the very least applying sufficient leverage that they could bring the Sandinista Government to a negotiating table for a settlement We would prefer that over a military settlement if that can be done We know that there are thousands of recruits that are waiting to join the freedom fighters and they need the weapons and ammunition and so forth for them Effect on Summit Q Another part of the question is this week in a speech you likened Mr Gorbachev to Castro Arafat and Qaddafi and Id like to ask what effect you think this statement would have on future relations with the Soviet Union in a possible summit Im talking about the Georgetown speech A Yes but I didnt think I lumped him in with them Q In the speech A I certainly think it was a bad choice of words because I didnt mean to do that because as I said he is the first Russian leader to my knowledge that has ever voiced the idea of reducing and even eliminating nuclear weapons So I must have goofed someplace because believe me I dont put him in the same category Ruling on Abortion Gary Q Mr President with the Supreme Courts decision today allowing a woman to have an abortion yet again another Supreme Court decision will your Administration let this be the law of the land or are you going to look for another case to press your position on this matter A Now wait a minute Hit me again here I think I was still answering Jerrys question Abortion Case Q The Supreme Court decided today to not interfere with a womans right to have an abortion Is your Administration going to pick another case to fight this position or are you going to let it stand as the law of the land A Were going to see  if we interpret the decision right of the Court their objection was not to what we were trying to accomplish but the fact that evidently the regulations in HHS that we asked for were based on that previous bill that had to do with discrimination against the handicapped and they the Court said they thought that this was putting the Federal Government  they were getting into something that properly was the province of the state and all So what we have to do is look for what are the proper way we can do this Because I feel very strongly that were talking about a human life And the case that prompted this entire act was one in which the determination is made that this life is to be taken away and yet it isnt done as you would with an animal it isnt done with a merciful putting to sleep or  they cant do that so instead they just let it starve to death And I just dont think that  if our Constitution means anything it means that we the Federal Government are entrusted with preserving life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Well where do we draw the line Can we say to someone Its all right for you to in whatever way you choose and dispose of this human life and for whatever reason And I think  I just dont think were finished with this problem at all Soviet Superiority Q Mr President if I could pursue the questions on your decision on the SALT treaty On the one hand youre saying that the Soviets have continued to increase their superiority over us On the other hand you said that the treaty did not constrain either side in terms of the arms race as one of the reasons you were not for it It really cant be both ways at the same time when weve had a massive buildup the Reagan defense buildup Which way is it Have the Soviets been able to increase superiority over this period of time Or has the treaty not been able to stop them A No it hasnt been able to The treaty actually set limits as for example what one new type of weapon now that you could develop that didnt exist and they have developed two instead of one and this was a violation It also set numbers and figures so that it was a restraint to the extent of just not an allout arms race with no limit on the way you could progress But when you say about achieving remember were still playing catchup They were building when we were dismantling and we feel as Ive said before that theres no way that we can allow them to reach for and get a superiority And we dont want a superiority over them but also we simply want to maintain enough of a deterrent that even with whatever superiority they have it wont be enough for them to take the chance on the followup action that could happen Arms Violations Q If I could just follow that up though At the same time your own arms control director Mr Adelman had said that the Soviet violations have not had any great military significance What is the possibility now since the violations themselves which have been disputed by some people as to their significance what is the possibility that by abandoning the treaty now which is as you just admitted has some limited significance in providing some degree of predictability that we wont go into a complete arms race now Whats to replace SALT at this point And why make this decision now A I didnt make it now I said weve got several months here in which were going to try to involve them in the things they themselves have been talking about and that is a definite arms reduction program This is the only thing that makes sense in the world and Ive been talking about this since 1980 and I said I was sick and tired of agreements that just said well well only go at this pace in our increasing the number of weapons Lets get around to getting rid of them as much as we can [ Garbled comment ] Hunger in America Q Sir thats true thank you sir for remembering A couple of weeks ago you said that the problem of the hungry people in America is not due to the fact that they dont have food and the ability to get food its that they dont know where to get it And some poor people we talked to at the time said youre blaming the hungry people for being hungry Youre putting the blame on them A Well I dont know who those people were and I do have to say that I think there are people who lack the information people out in the country that maybe dont know and weve had plenty of evidence of that But the simple truth of the matter is we are spending on nutrition more than has ever been spent before more than 3 billion over and above what was spent in 1981 186 billion I think it is this year that is being spent on this program But in the interim during this same time that weve been increasing the private sector has gone all out in programs all over the country of meals for the hungry Today the Federal Government is providing I think its 93 million meals a day and that does not count all those private agencies too So I think there is considerable merit for saying that its difficult to believe that people are starving in this country because food isnt available I just as I say I think that in many instances the people just dont know where or how to go about it and at the same time I find it difficult also to find any cases of starvation and undernourishment Food Aid Program Q But sir if that is the problem public education why then did you cut out the one Federal program that did just that  educate hungry people educate the rural poor educate elderly shutins about how to get food assistance It was there and your Administration cut it out A Because it was a case of  that was a case of simply food stamps and thats a program in which I think most people are aware of food stamps and the neighbors are doing it in many cases and if they havent done it yet  and this was one in which they had us literally going door to door knocking on the door to tell people how to become eligible or Have you gotten your food stamps today And we thought it was a waste that wed rather buy more food stamps and pay for more food stamps than pay for the bureaucracy to do a thing of this kind Leslie Weapons Decision Q Mr President youve just said that you really havent made the SALT decision yet And I think theres a lot of confusion as to exactly where we stand on the SALT decision Are you going to go over the limit of the SALT decision or are you going to dismantle another submarine and stay within the limits Exactly what are you going to do on SALT A Well Leslie youre asking something  yes we will have a plane coming up to be armed with a cruise missile that would put us to that extent beyond the constraints or the limitation Now weve got several months before we reach that point Weve got several months in which to see if the Soviet Union  we have taxed them over and over again with regard to their violating the constraints Now on that basis were going to see if we cannot persuade them to join in the things theyre talking about  arms control  or arms reduction And if nothing is done then well make the decision with regard to that plane Missile Proposal Q There are reports that today in Geneva the Soviets made a new proposal on reducing longrange strategic missiles Is this the kind of proposal youve been looking for and has it changed your opinion of what youre going to do on SALT A I cant comment on it because of the confidentiality of the situation there in Geneva But yes as of today we have received this proposal and now were going to study that and see what they have in it Sam Challenger Liability Q Mr President the Rogers commission detailed a series of actions and inactions leading up to that shuttle disaster of individuals who knew that the O rings had a problem but did nothing about it and in the last 24 hours before the launch have engineers from Thiokol saying its unsafe to launch dont launch but of pressure being put on Thiokol to reverse it And yet William Rogers seems to think that the individuals involved should not be punished further their culpability should not be established Do you agree A Yes I do We are still studying that report of theirs But I dont believe that there was any deliberate or criminal intent in any way on the part of anyone I think that with the great record of success that NASA has had all the way back to when men circled the Earth in those capsules and then to men on the Moon and now 24 successful shuttle flights I think there was a complacency there And yes its something that has to be corrected before ever one of those takes off again but I think it was just a carelessness that grew out of success And I think that its time for us also to remind ourselves of the tremendous record that NASA had and help now in the restoration of the program and their going forward and to see that this cannot happen again Maybe part of it was also due Ive often wondered this  if part of it wasnt due to the balmy climate of Florida and there was difficulty for anybody to believe that they had a cold snap that could render that O ring dangerous Negligence Issue Q Sir if I may in our society if an engineer of a train falls asleep at the switch and we pursue him for negligence if bus drivers  all through our society when people do things even though they dont mean to kill anyone as youve said in this case theyre brought into court if theres evidence that theyve been negligent in some sort of criminal fashion Why should these people be exempt from that kind of just review A Well let me  Sam let me plead waiting until we see the entire report until we get a chance to read all of the testimony and everything else before making a decision We put a man in there that we believe is going to do much Ive got to call on at least one red dress European Tourism Q Thank you Mr President and I will have a follow Immediately after the US attack on Libya you were particularly grateful to Prime Minister Thatcher for her help in allowing the United States to let airplanes take off from the UK Since then American tourists have been staying away from England and Europe in droves and Mrs Thatcher has made a personal plea for Americans and their dollars to come back to the continent Do you think that its safe in Europe for Americans to return and will you tell Americans whether they ought to go overseas this summer A Youve asked me a very tough one in my position with what we know about the dangers throughout the world I certainly dont want to be quoted as advocating a tourist rush in the face of the world the way it is but Im going to be rather bold and just tell you that our Ambassador recently had a little talk or something that was carried in The Los Angeles Times and it was to the effect that he believed that London was probably one of the safest cities in the world and that he saw no reason for anyone to be fearful of that Well I have not argued with him on his making that point Security Precautions Q My follow then is that we also read about the extraordinary security precautions that are going to be taken for the Statue of Liberty festivities July 4 Are you concerned that perhaps thats a pretty delectable message target A Yes but I also have a great deal of confidence in our security people And I can see where they would think that that would be a very inviting target for those who hate us in the terrorist ranks and think that they might be able to embarrass us that way Discrimination Q Mr President the Agriculture Department has been severely criticized for its treatment of minorities in employment and service delivery  this despite your saying that you would not tolerate discrimination in the Federal Government What are you going to do about the Agriculture Department A Well its already being done by the Secretary of Agriculture Hes heard these allegations also and as I understand it there were allegations with regard to not being as fair as they should be with regard to women employment and on a racial basis to black employment And the Secretary has ordered all the farflung and various agencies of the Agriculture Department  an investigation is under way right now to see if thats true because he absolutely has sworn that if it is hes going to correct it because he doesnt want any discrimination either Q What will you do to insure that these things are carried out A That they are what Q That they are carried out A Well because I feel as strongly as he does about that Im going to be watching this very carefully I dont want any hint or sign in our Administration that there is any kind of discrimination of that kind And I think Ive got a record that should make you willing to believe that because as a Governor in California I eliminated a kind of quiet discrimination that had seen an unfair balance in employment and ended up appointing more members of the minority communities to executive and policymaking positions than all the previous Governors of California put together So yes Im going to ride herd on this but I have great confidence in the Secretary of Agriculture because he was doing this in California at the same time that I was Governor Offer in Geneva Q Mr President the Warsaw Pact are said to be offering to withdraw a million of their troops that face us in the West For those of us with families in Europe that sounds like a lot I know that you always like to deal with these offers in the confidentiality of Geneva but isnt it perhaps time bearing in mind that nothing seems to have come out of Geneva for over a year to go with an offer like this run with it and see what happens A You mean the offer that has just been given in Geneva Q Yes A Well as I say we  there have been offers and we have made counteroffers much in the same thing and with pretty much the same end result as to numbers of weapons And where we  where the difficulties seem to come in is the Soviet Union and the United States have somewhat different mixes of weapons that we believe are essential to well for theirs we believe theirs is based more on an offensive nature and we believe ours is based more on a deterrent idea And so sometimes we run into difficulties then in reconciling some of the means of getting to the same number of warheads being eliminated This has kept us from having an agreement so far Now this last agreement has come in and we dont know yet until we see it carefully is it a response to one of our counteroffers does it in some way change their  some of their proposals and bring us closer to a negotiated position And this is what we want more than anything So you can depend on it that were going to were going to make every effort But it must be fair and balanced it must not be an agreement in which one side is trying to maintain or increase an advantage over the other Meeting Gorbachev Q Sir doesnt this make it all the more important to see Mr Gorbachev as soon as possible this year A Thats what Id like In fact were waiting to hear when this can take place We suggested a date and evidently it was too early for them They didnt suggest but they spoke publicly about a possible date and that was wrong for us because of the coming political campaign But we still  and I still  believe that he wants a summit and I want a summit and I believe its going to take place Id better spread around here someplace Q Mr President A With the red flower Q With the red flower or the red coat A Red flower Espionage Case Q Mr President the Pollard spy case has precipitated some confusion within your Administration over the matter of how much Israeli spying there is in this country and if it goes beyond the Pollards The Justice Department officials are telling us that it goes beyond the Pollards and theyre continuing their investigation The State Department officials have told us that theres no more Israeli spying here and they are satisfied and they seem to want to put an end to it I wonder if you could clear up this confusion A The only thing I know is that the Israeli Government has assured us as much as they can that they have never had any program of trying to get intelligence information from our country or doing spying on us and so far as I say the Justice Department has said they will look to see if there is anything they can find out but so far theres been no evidence presented to us from anyone Evidence on Israel Q Well what if they do come up with some evidence What would you do A Well I think well have to deal with that then and find out whether its a surprise to the Israeli Government whether someone was off playing their own game or not Mexican Debt Q Our Federal Reserve Chairman Volcker made an unannounced trip to Mexico this week to discuss that countrys financial problems Are you worried that Mexico might unilaterally default or  default on payments or totally default on foreign debts A Well I think this is a possibility with not only Mexico but a number of other countries that are having these debt problems that are much based on the high interest rates of the past before we reduced inflation and obviously wed like to be of help to them within the framework of the agreements that were reached in Korea by Secretary Baker And we want to be of help as much as we can Mexico is a next door neighbor Our fortunes are linked on many fronts and so we want to be of as much help as we can and that was the reason for his trip Its over already Why dont you ask questions that can be answered yes or no
JUSTICES UPHOLD ABORTION RIGHTS BY NARROW VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/justices-uphold-abortion-rights-by-narrow-vote.html,A deeply divided Supreme Court today reaffirmed its landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion which the Reagan Administration had urged it to abandon The 5to4 ruling struck down a Pennsylvania law as unconstitutional on the ground that some provisions were intended to deter women from having abortions and others would require doctors to risk the health of pregnant women to save lateterm fetuses And it appeared to curb state power to regulate abortion further than ever before Also Associate Justice Harry A Blackmuns majority opinion strongly rebuffed without explicitly mentioning it the Administrations arguments for overruling the 1973 decision Roe v Wade The vote on that decision was 7 to 2 Possible Shift in Future But the narrowing margin of support for Roe the unusually harsh dissenting opinions and in particular a shift in Chief Justice Warren E Burgers position suggested that the Court might consider reversing itself and restricting or even abandoning constitutional abortion rights if any member of the majority were replaced by a new Justice who shared the dissenters views While the decision today did not dramatically change the law the five opinions by various Justices constituted the most profound and detailed debate the Court has produced on one of the nations most divisive constitutional and moral issues The outcome was hailed by advocates of abortion rights and denounced by antiabortion groups The Justice Department said the outcome was not surprising and praised the dissenters Rights of Pregnant Women Justice Blackmun asserted The states are not free under the guise of protecting maternal health or potential life to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies He said that even though abortion raises moral and spiritual questions over which honorable persons can disagree sincerely and profoundly the Court was bound to apply the Constitution faithfully and that the Constitution embodies a promise that a certain private sphere of individual liberty will be kept largely beyond the reach of government That promise extends to women as well as to men Justice Blackmun said stressing the personal and intimate nature of a womans decision on whether to end her pregnancy The provisions of the 1982 Pennsylvania Abortion Control Act that the majority struck down required that doctors provide women seeking abortion with detailed information about the risks and alternatives and file detailed reports with the state for public inspection They also required that two doctors be present at lateterm abortions and that they use the method most likely to produce a live birth unless it would pose significantly greater risk to the woman Justice Blackmun said these provisions were all based on an unconstitutional design to deter women from having abortions and that the latter two unjustifiably required physicians to take chances with the health of the woman for the sake of the fetus The dissenters said these provisions were consistent with the Courts holding in Roe v Wade that states may regulate abortion in the second three months of pregnancy to protect a womans health and in the final three months to protect the states compelling interest in keeping alive fetuses capable of living outside the womb Chief Justice Burger in a significant shift said in dissent I agree we should reexamine Roe even though he was one of the seven signers of Justice Blackmuns decision in that case and one of the six signers of a 1983 decision that strongly reaffirmed it Chief Justices New View Asserting that we may have lured judges into roaming at large in the constitutional field he said that contrary to his original expectation the Court had extended Roe to require abortion on demand and had virtually abandoned its original holding that states could regulate lateterm abortions to protect the fetus Associate Justices Byron R White and William H Rehnquist who were the two dissenters in Roe said today that the 1973 decision was fundamentally misguided and illegitimate had no basis in the language or history of the Constitution had led the Court into warped interpretations and should be overruled Justice White suggested that in the name of identifying constitutional principles to which the people have consented in framing their Constitution the Court has done nothing more than impose its own controversial choices of value upon the people He said such a hotly contested moral and political issue should be resolved by the will of the people and that I would return the issue to the people by overruling Roe v Wade Even if Roe was correct he added the Pennsylvania law was consistent with its reasoning and should be upheld as a reasonable effort to regulate abortion without unduly restricting it Aware that in Roe it essentially created something out of nothing and that there are many in this country who hold that decision to be basically illegitimate the Court responds defensively he said The majority indiscriminately strikes down statutory provisions that in no way contravene the right recognized in Roe Justice OConnors Dissent Justice Sandra Day OConnor dissented separately denouncing the Courts unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing the regulation of abortion but explicitly declining to say whether she agreed with Justice White that Roe should be overruled Associate Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall Lewis F Powell Jr and John Paul Stevens joined Justice Blackmuns opinion Justice Stevens said in a separate concurrence that although he had the highest respect for Justice Whites views on the issue a womans right to choose whether to continue her pregnancy was more important than the will of a transient majority He said the Roe decision was correct because it is far better to permit some individuals to make incorrect decisions than to deny all individuals the right to make decisions that have a profound effect upon their destiny Solicitor General Charles Fried said at a news briefing today that the majoritys implicit rejection of the arguments in his brief was no surprise but that Chief Justice Burgers dissent was very significant even though he has not stated emphatically that Roe was wrongly decided Asserting that Justice Whites dissent was one of the most remarkable and powerful statements of constitutional principle Ive read in a long time Mr Fried added that the more deeply the Justices think about the matter the more likely they are eventually to come to our conclusion Filing by Administration His brief for the Reagan Administration filed last July as a friend of the Court urged the Court to overrule Roe and leave state legislatures free to allow to regulate or to prohibit abortion as they pleased The case Thornburgh v American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists No 84495 began as a suit by medical groups and others seeking to strike down the Pennsylvania law Prof Laurence Tribe of Harvard Law School a leading constitutional expert who filed a brief in the case supporting abortion rights said today that Chief Justice Burgers apparent retreat from support for Roe was extremely troubling and raised the possibility that Roe might be undermined if any member of the majority were to leave the Court
REAGAN SEES NO WIDE ISRAELI SPYING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/reagan-sees-no-wide-israeli-spying.html,President Reagan said tonight that the Administration had no evidence that the Israeli Government had conducted widespread spying in the United States In a nationally broadcast news conference Mr Reagan appeared to present a public posture similar to one voiced by the State Department in an internal Administration dispute on the extent of Israeli espionage efforts in the United States Justice Department and senior White House officials have suggested that Israeli spying efforts were broader than what emerged in the case of Jonathan Jay Pollard a former Navy analyst who pleaded guilty last week to spying for Israel The Israeli Government has said it had no knowledge of the spying and attributed it to a renegade operation Mr Reagans comment on the spy case followed a statement by the State Department Monday insisting that there was no evidence of any Israeli espionage ring other than the four Israelis named as unindicted coconspirators in the Pollard case No Evidence Presented to Us The Justice Department and some White House officials had said that Mr Pollard as part of a pleabargaining agreement was supplying information that could lead to the arrest of other Israelis involved in spying So far Mr Reagan said tonight there is no evidence presented to us by anyone that Israelis were spying in this country other than those originally implicated by Mr Pollard The only thing I know is that the Israeli Government has assured us as much as they can that they have never had any program of trying to get intelligence information from our country or doing spying on us and so far as I say the Justice Department has said they will look to see if there is anything they can find out Mr Reagan said Asked what he would do if such evidence emerged Mr Reagan said Well I think well have to deal with that then and find out whether its a surprise to the Israeli Government whether someone was off playing their own game or not Remarks on Hunger On another matter Mr Reagan said it was difficult to believe that people in the United States were starving because there was not enough food available to them The remarks reinforced but in stronger terms Mr Reagans statement on May 22 that people who were going hungry lacked information about where or how to get help Mr Reagan also vowed to continue an Administration effort to find a proper way to assure medical treatment for handicapped infants The Supreme Court on Monday struck down Administration regulations designed to force such treatment even when parents were opposed In response to a question about cutbacks in financing for informational programs on nutrition Mr Reagan said The simple truth of the matter is we are spending on nutrition more than has ever been spent before He said that more than 3 billion was being provided by the Government than in 1981 and 186 billion overall Mr Reagan said that in addition to the Federal effort which he said totaled about 93 million meals daily the private sector was also providing assistance So I think there is considerable merit for saying that its difficult to believe that people are starving in this country because food isnt availble Mr Reagan said I just as I say I think that in many instances the people just dont know where or how to go about it and at the same time I find it difficult also to find any cases of starvation and undernourishment Appeals for Budget Support Mr Reagan began with a brief opening statement in which he appealed to Congress to support his policy of increasing military spending and avoiding tax increases The President who again vowed to veto any tax increase has proposed that Congress make more domestic spending cuts in its 1987 budget than either the House or Senate budget committees have proposed Rather than make the sensible adjustments weve suggested some in Congress apparently intend to take large and dangerous cuts out of our national defense Mr Reagan said It is time for Congress to take a responsible approach to spending decisions and when it comes to taxes lets get into the spirit of the times The President said his plan to revise the Federal tax code was quite simply one of the best antipoverty programs one of the best jobcreation programs and one of the best profamily bills this country has ever seen all rolled into one White House officials said that Mr Reagan had hoped to use his opening statement in a continued effort to garner support for his key remaining legislative priorities  an overhaul of the Federal income tax system the 100 million aid package for Nicaraguan rebels and the 320 billion request for military spending in the fiscal year that begins Oct 1st On Tuesday while meeting with the Republican Congressional leadership Mr Reagan indicated that he opposed any Senate attempt to amend the tax legislation including the effort led by three conservative senators to link the bill to an effort to restrict abortions The Senators Gordon J Humphrey of New Hampshire William L Armstrong of Colorado and Jesse Helms of North Carolina would deny taxexempt status for hospitals where abortions are performed and charities that finance abortions
Reagan Seems to Mix Supreme Court Cases,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/reagan-seems-to-mix-supreme-court-cases.html,At his news conference tonight President Reagan seemed to mix up two decisions by the Supreme Court In both cases the Court refused to accept the Administrations arguments But the cases involved substantially different legal issues Mr Reagan was asked about a decision today in which the Court by a margin of 5 to 4 strongly reaffirmed its landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right of access to abortion The decision struck down a Pennsylvania law as unconstitutional partly on the ground that it was designed to deter women from having abortions However in his answer the President discussed a case in which the Supreme Court on Monday invalidated Federal regulations that were designed to require lifeprolonging treatment for newborn infants with severe physical or mental handicaps Many opponents of abortion supported the Administrations Baby Doe rules because they said the rules would have guaranteed that doctors and hospitals show respect for the value of the lives of handicapped infants Mr Reagan said the Courts objection to the rules on handicapped infants was not based on what we were trying to accomplish Rather he said the Court appeared to conclude that the Federal Government by invoking the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 to protect such infants was getting into something that properly was the province of the states If our Constitution means anything Mr Reagan said it means that we the Federal Government are entrusted with preserving life liberty and the pursuit of happiness Well where do we draw the line
MARGIN OF VOTE IS CALLED KEY TO ABORTION DECISION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/12/us/margin-of-vote-is-called-key-to-abortion-decision.html,Advocates of a womans right to choose an abortion fervently applauded what they saw as todays reaffirmation of that right by the Supreme Court But there was nervousness in their satisfaction because the Courts majority upholding that position has shrunk from seven of the nine Justices who favored it 13 years ago to the barest minimum in todays ruling That considerably eased the disappointment of antiabortion groups who said that although they may have lost a battle today they made a strategic gain The thing that jumps out at you is that its a 5to4 decision Douglas Johnson the legislative director of the National Righttolife Committee said by telephone from the antiabortion groups national convention in Denver Thats very significant he said Were very encouraged by that Were just one vote away from a Court which may be prepared to abandon Roe vs Wade In that 1973 ruling the Court basically upheld the principle that women are free to chose whether to have an abortion Todays decision struck down a 1982 Pennsylvania law never in effect because of legal challenges that placed controls on abortions Both sides said the decision focused renewed attention on the future composition of the Court The decision demonstrates once again how much is riding on the next appointment to the Supreme Court by whomever made said Senator Gordon J Humphrey Republican of New Hampshire who along with 82 other members of Congress had filed antiabortion briefs in the case Focus on Appointments It will take new people on the Court to make a difference said Dr John Willke president of the National RighttoLife Committee Some of Dr Willkes opponents attached special import to the fact that Chief Justice Warren E Burger who had voted for a womans right to choose an abortion in 1973 and again in a followup 1983 case this time dissented Antiabortion forces will now count the Chief Justice as an ally and will redouble their efforts said Laurence Tribe a professor of constitutional law at Harvard University He filed briefs in the Pennsylvania case favoring abortion rights Nevertheless abortion rights groups savored what they saw as a triumph This is a tremendous prochoice victory and an absolute rejection of the Reagan Administrations request to the Court to overturn that landmark decision of 1973 said Janet Benshoof director of the American Civil Liberties Unions Reproductive Freedom Project Intimidation at Issue The Court has told state legislatures that they cannot use their power to harass and intimidate women who seek abortions said Kathryn Kolbert a Philadelphia lawyer who argued for abortion rights before the Court She is associated with the Womens Law Project and represented a group of plaintiffs led by the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists In his majority opinion Justice Harry A Blackmun also stressed that the basic liberty at stake in private decisions extends to women as well as men Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League said This decision goes beyond Roe in that the Court has recognized the inseparable link between the right to choose abortion and the ability of women to enjoy the personal liberties guaranteed all Americans under the Consititution The antiabortion forces seemed undaunted State Representative Stephen Freind a sponsor of the law struck down today said he was confident that this state will be the first to outlaw abortion You can bet the house on that he said There are no such things as defeat when youre prolife Mr Freind said There are only temporary setbacks

NOW MARKS 20TH YEAR AMID A STRATEGY DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/13/us/now-marks-20th-year-amid-a-strategy-debate.html,The National Organization for Women will celebrate its 20th anniversary here this weekend at an annual convention expected to draw about a thousand delegates But the celebration comes at a difficult time of transition for NOW The organization is trying to reverse a decline in membership build support among younger women and develop a new political strategy that will give it both independence and influence At the same time the group is faced with persistent questions about its strategy and its relevance to the average American woman Its recent tone has been set by Eleanor Smeal elected president last year with a pledge to take the organization back to the streets While some analysts argue that NOW needs to broaden its agenda which has focused on abortion rights Mrs Smeal contends that the right to abortion is under serious assault and has brought a new militance to its defense She led mass marches for abortion rights this year in Washington and Los Angeles and began a new litigation strategy this week directed at halting what she described as a reign of terror by protesters at abortion clinics The convention begins at the Radisson Hotel here Friday The National Right to Life Committee is holding its annual convention six blocks away Were not hiding in the hotel said Mrs Smeal who is to lead a march and rally Satuday for abortion rights Arrest Is Applauded The two groups so far have kept a wary distance But NOWs national board erupted in applause this morning when it was announced that a prominent abortion protester Joseph Scheidler had been arrested here Sgt George Masciotro of the Denver police said Mr Scheidler was arrested at 1230 AM today as he was checking into the downtown hotel where the antiabortion group is holding its convention The sergeant said the police had acted on a warrant issued in March by the authorities in Pensacola Fla where Mr Scheidler was charged with burglary in connection with a disturbance at an abortion clinic Dr John C Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee said Mr Scheidler was not part of our convention But he added that the timing of the arrest was interesting to say the least Workplace Concerns In recent years NOW has probably been most prominent for its defense of the right to abortion and its unsuccessful efforts to win ratification of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution It has a proud place in history and no one can take that away said Betty Friedan one of the founders of the group But Miss Friedan and others have argued that NOW needs to place greater emphasis on issues central to American women today particularly child care programs and job leaves for parents to care for newborn or ill children The question to me is whether NOW will move to these questions or stick to an agenda that was necessary for the last 10 years but doesnt necessarily go far enough for the next 10 years Miss Friedan said This argument has been spurred by the recent publication of the book A Lesser Life in which Dr Sylvia Ann Hewlett an economist contends that American women lag behind their counterparts in Western Europe in terms of benefits for pregnancy and child care In an interview Dr Hewlett said that such issues are not at the top of the agenda of NOW Mrs Smeal said criticism of her organization is normal but rejected the notion that it has neglected child care and pregnancy concerns We are people who have been on the front line with these issues she said Call for Action Mrs Smeal was elected to a twoyear term at last years convention after a bitterly contested race with the incumbent Judy Goldsmith Mrs Smeal said a mass mailing campaign had stabilized membership at 150000 down from a peak of 220000 in 1982 She predicted the number would begin to climb this summer Since Mrs Smeal took over the organization has kept a determined distance from the Democratic Party a sharp change from its policy in the 1984 elections Under Mrs Goldsmith the group gave an early endorsement to Walter F Mondale in his bid for the Democratic Presidential nomination and later demanded that he name a woman as his running mate He subsequently chose Geraldine A Ferraro who became the first women nominated by a major political party to run for Vice President In the view of many Democratic leaders the partys close identification with such interest groups as NOW was a factor in its landslide defeat Mrs Smeal said the organization went along with the establishment of the Democratic Party in an attempt to defeat President Reagan and it didnt work Both Parties Criticized No Democratic Presidential hopefuls have been invited to speak at this weekends convention and Mrs Smeal was critical of both parties Neither really is vigorously defending our rights she said Both are willing to scapegoat us both are willing to cave in on these issues While feminists have more supporters among Democrats she added There is too little vigor from the Democrats and too many Democrats who are willing to tell us that we have to go to the right that they have to get the Southern white male that it was the blacks and the women and the progressives that caused their defeat in 1984 Mrs Smeal said she viewed it as imperative that the womens movement stay politically independent arguing Were going to have to depend on ourselves

TAX BILL KEPT INTACT IN SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/13/business/tax-bill-kept-intact-in-senate.html,With a sizable majority of senators opposing all amendments to the taxrevision bill whatever the merits the Senate today warded off proposals dealing with sales tax deductions abortions and consumer interest Everybody has religion now said Senator Max Baucus a Montana Democrat The bill which would sharply reduce tax rates and eliminate many tax deductions and other tax preferences now seems certain to pass without significant change before the end of next week One of the most disputed elements of the bill its denial of deductions for state and local sales tax payments was set aside without a recorded vote when senators who wanted to allow those deductions saw they would be defeated handily Issue of Abortion Omitted The chief sponsor of a proposal to deny taxexempt status to hospitals and other charitable organizations involved with abortions was persuaded by President Reagan not to offer the amendment And after several hours of spirited debate a proposal to prevent homeowners from using taxdeductible mortgage loans to finance other purchases was withdrawn before it came to a vote At one point the bills floor manager Senator Bob Packwood spoke forcefully against removing a tax shelter for oil and gas investors from the bill even though he said he did not think the shelter was justified Mr Packwood an Oregon Republican said he had made an ironclad commitment to stand firm against any amendments that would undercut the greater good of the amendment Development of Majority The solid majority against all consequential amendments developed after the Senates narrow rejection Wednesday night of an amendment that would have retained tax deductions for all Individual Retirement Accounts The first proposal to retain deductions for state and local sales taxes was rejected this afternoon by a voice vote Its sponsor Senator Alan J Dixon an Illinois Democrat said afterward that he did not ask for a recorded vote when he realized the amendment would fail badly The bill as it stands now would permit full deductions for state and local income and real estate taxes but would allow no deductions for sales taxes The companion bill passed by the House of Representatives last December would retain deductions for income property and sales taxes Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan Democrat of New York who supports sales tax deductions opposed efforts to retain them in this bill because he said he did not want to jeopardize the overall legislation Last month Governor Cuomo challenged Mr Moynihan on that point but the Governor subsequently relented and agreed to leave Congressional strategy to the Senator Tonight Senator Daniel J Evans a Washington Republican proposed a twopart amendment The first part would have allowed taxpayers to choose between deducting state and local sales tax or income tax payments That would have primarily benefited taxpayers in Connecticut and seven other states that have sales taxes and little or no income taxes The second part of the Evans amendment would have disallowed deductions for the interest payments on second mortgages that were taken out to finance purchases other than homes The Senate bill would permit deductions of mortgage interest but not of interest on other loans Some senators see this as a loophole After a long debate Mr Evans withdrew his amendment conceding that it could not pass The Senate went on to approve 76 to 21 a sense of the Senate resolution urging its delegates to the SenateHouse conference on the bill to put sales tax deductions in the final bill Such resolutions often have little effect For example the Senate voted Wednesday 96 to 4 to instruct the Senate conferees to support the maximum possible tax benefits for IRAs Afterward Senator Packwood who will head the Senate conferees said he felt no obligation to back full deductions for retirement accounts The House bill would retain deductions for all IRAs but the Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr said today that he was not sure that was such a good idea Its a mighty loophole for the wealthy of America said the Speaker a Massachusetts Democrat whose views could be influential when the conference committee meets The Senate also defeated tonight by a vote of 77 to 20 an effort by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut to remove from the bill a particular tax break for investors in oil and gas exploration It would be one of the few tax shelters allowed by the bill Senators from oilproducing states argued that without the exception investment in petroleum exploration would dry up and that the result would be devastating to the countrys already suffering oil region Senator Weicker disagreed I wasnt for an exception for New England when oil prices were high he declared and Im not for an exception for the oil industry when oil prices are low The tax rule in question would allow certain investors in unsuccessful drilling operations to continue to use their losses to offset their other income for tax purposes Senator Packwood said several members of the Finance Committee had insisted on the rule as a condition for voting the bill out of the committee

Must Mr. Reagan Tolerate Abortion Clinic Violence?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/14/opinion/must-mr-reagan-tolerate-abortion-clinic-violence.html,President Reagans affable tolerance of antiabortion violence threatens more than the women who need abortions and the doctors who perform them It threatens the fabric of civilized society The Administrations failure to condemn in any but the mildest words those who have bombed and set fire to abortion clinics has given these tactics respectability  even as some antiabortion leaders have begun to shrink from the results of their own harsh words In a National Right to Life newsletter in February the organizations president John C Wilke issued a fervent appeal to the abortion clinic bombers Dont do it he said arguing that bombing clinics will hurt our cause Mr Wilke has also been quarreling editorially with radical antiabortion leaders Paul Brown and Joseph Scheidler who have been trying to get Mr Reagan to pardon the abortion clinic bombers But Mr Wilkes concerns seem largely tactical Further he ignores the fact that his own inflammatory rhetoric contributes heavily to the atmosphere of violence Mr Wilke presides over an organization and a publication that regularly portrays doctors and other professionals involved with abortion services as murderers The newsletters review of my textbook Abortion Practice called it Nazistyle medicine Mr Wilke and other antiabortion leaders regularly use words like violence and butchery to describe what goes on in abortion clinics Meanwhile Mr Reagan honors men like Mr Wilke and Mr Scheidler with invitations to the White House Mr Scheidler confident that he has the most popular man in America on his side goes forth to harass women doctors and others connected with abortion with the most abusive language imaginable Mr Scheidler stood on the sidewalk in front of my office last Oct 21 and 22 calling me a murderer    hit man    paid executioner During the next two weeks I received a half dozen threats on my life We had several bomb threats and the harassment continues every day In a recent brief survey of abortion clinics and physicians belonging to the National Abortion Federation I found that 30 percent of the 150 respondents had experienced serious violence including total destruction of facilities sometimes more than once 26 percent have been visited by Mr Scheidler 45 percent have experienced increasingly aggressive harassment frequently associated with his visits 35 percent have lost insurance coverage and 26 percent have received death threats or bomb threats or both A live bomb was delivered to a Portland Ore clinic in December and three more were found in the citys postal system the same day More than 40 abortion clinics and doctors offices have been firebombed since Mr Reagan took office in 1981 A Toledo Ohio clinic was burned down on May 20 A Wichita Kan clinic was bombed June 9 At a national conference of antiabortion activists in Appleton Wis held in 1985 participants wore buttons saying Have a Blast Members of Mr Reagans Administration have said that there is no national conspiracy to terrorize abortion service providers Those of us who are providing abortion services think otherwise Having a brick hurled through the window of a doctors waiting room where patients sit may seem like small potatoes but its terrorism Listening to the police tell you that you must now drive home a different way each night and check the mail and your automobile for bombs is frightening An obscene death threat at 3 AM is terrorism It is even more frightening to know that this kind of activity receives the tacit support of a powerful Government The scheduled speakers at this weeks National Right to Life meeting in Denver included Senate majority leader Bob Dole Representative Jack Kemp and and the Rev Marion G Pat Robertson the television evangelist All are contenders for the 1988 Republican Presidential nomination Mr Wilkes sanctimonious appeal to the bombers is selfserving and hypocritical Antiabortion activists are plainly using terrorism subversion and repression to interfere with the provision of abortion services We are being terrorized by Mr Reagans followers and we are terrified Death threats in the night and bombs are real and dangerous
STATE TO HALT MEDICAID FOR SOME PREGNANT YOUTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/nyregion/state-to-halt-medicaid-for-some-pregnant-youths.html,The Cuomo administration is planning to halt Medicaid assistance for abortions and prenatal care for young women with family incomes above the poverty line The decision will drop as many as 4000 pregnant women a year from the Medicaid rolls The plan requires no legislative approval and is expected to take effect late next month It is expected to save the Federal state and county governments 61 million annually Under current state regulations pregnancy is the only exception by which someone financially dependent and under 21 years of age can qualify for Medicaid without family income being taken into account Pregnant women under 21 and living with their parents now qualify for Medicaid as long as the womans own income is below the poverty line The exception intended to give needy teenagers immediate access to prenatal care has allowed as many as 4000 young women to get Medicaid cards to finance abortions and prenatal care even if their parents income surpassed the poverty level of 7400 for a family of four Most of those women use Medicaid for prenatal care rather than abortions according to the State Department of Social Services Praise and Criticism The revision has drawn praise from groups that oppose abortions and criticism from groups that favor a womans right to have an abortion The plan eliminates controversial language in the agencys regulations that allowed young women to apply for benefits by citing the unborn child without reference to the ability of the womans parents to pay the medical costs The applicant was the fetus the girl was the parent said Cesar A Perales Commissioner of the Social Services Department That language was unacceptable to groups that favor abortion rights because it presumed that the unborn child was a person And it was nettlesome to opponents because it allowed benefits won in behalf of the unborn child to be used to abort it The executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City Alfred Moran said his organization would lobby vigorously against the revision He said to advance the idea that the state is paying for abortions for daughters of millionaires is an attempt to distort reality He said the revision would force some teenagers who might be unable to consult their parents into delayed and unsafe abortions or into giving birth to children they were unprepared to care for But Mr Perales said that Medicaid benefits were intended to help only the most impoverished families and that women ineligible under the new statute could get assistance through programs with less stringent requirements run by the State Health Department My primary concern is the integrity of the Medicaid program Mr Perales said to make sure we dont invite fraud and abuse There were also these developments in Albany this week Power of Attorney Banks would be required to honor a short form concerning power of attorney under the terms of a bill given final legislative approval by the Senate The forms are often used by people who represent an elderly relative or client The bill is intended to help elderly New Yorkers conduct their financial dealings more easily according to State Attorney General Robert Abrams who requested the legislation in response to complaints by consumers about banks refusal to recognize the forms The legislation now goes to Governor Cuomo Banks often require that their own forms be used and some banks require a written statement from a physician attesting to the competency of the individual who executed the power of attorney Mr Abrams said Chemical Spills Legislation intended to prevent a chemical accident like the one in Bhopal India two years ago was introduced by Mr Abrams and key legislators The bill would require businesses to identify potential hazards at their sites start programs to reduce the hazards and start emergency preparedness plans to respond to accidents Under the bill violators could face a maximum fine of 25000 for a civil offense and 50000 for a criminal offense A criminal violation would be a Class E felony carrying a maximum prison sentence of four years for failure to notify officials of a chemical accident Potassium Iodide In response to the Chernobyl nuclear accident in the Soviet Union two proposals were offered to alter the dispensing of potassium iodide a chemical used to block radiation in a nuclear spill One plan proposed by Richard M Kessel executive director of the State Consumer Protection Board would ban overthecounter sales of the drug except in nuclear emergencies to prevent unnecessary use and to protect people allergic or sensitive to the drug The other introduced by Assemblyman Eliot L Engel a Bronx Democrat would require the State Commission of Disaster Preparedness to stockpile potassium iodide pills for distribution in an emergency The Federal Food and Drug Administration currently permits the overthecounter sale of the drug to allow consumers immediate access in an emergency The drug is intended to be used before or four hours after exposure to radiation Student Aid College tuition aid and eligibility requirements would increase under a bipartisan agreement announced by key legislators this week Under the bill the top annual grant in the Tuition Assistance Program would rise to 2850 from 2700 for dependent undergraduate students and to 2000 from 1800 for those who are independent For graduate students the maximum grant would double from the current 600 a year to 1200 Dependent undergraduates could qualify for aid with a family income of up to 32000 a year compared with the current 29000 maximum Undergraduates who claim financial independence could earn up to 10000 a year and still qualify for tuition aid up from 5666 under current law TeenAgers in Taverns A bill that gained final approval by the Senate would allow children under age 16 into bars and taverns unaccompaniesd by their parents if no alcoholic beverages were served The measure is designed to allow establishments with liquor licenses to sponsor dances and other events for young people without violating the law The bill was sent to Governor Cuomo who has advocated methods to steer teenagers away from alcohol abuse

LOS ANGELES ARCHBISHOP LEADS DRIVE TO AID HISPANIC CATHOLICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/us/los-angeles-archbishop-leads-drive-to-aid-hispanic-catholics.html,At a time when the National Conference of Catholic Bishops is moving to ask for changes in the nations economy to aid the poor the Archbishop of the countrys largest archdiocese has issued a sweeping call to social activism in behalf of the Hispanic majority of his pastorate In recent days the Archbishop Roger M Mahony of Los Angeles has personally set the activist tone in a variety of ways calling for opposition to the Governments plan to evict illegal aliens from public housing asking Roman Catholics to picket stores that sell pornography and moving to help pregnant unmarried teenagers Fifty thousand Hispanic Catholics in what was billed as the largest such assembly in American history turned out June 1 at Dodger Stadium at the invitation of Archbishop Mahony in recognition of the large Hispanic presence in the archdiocese The gathering officially initiated a fiveyear plan aimed at focusing the power of the church in a concerted advocacy for Hispanic Catholics The plan includes proposals for tuition and daycare assistance to families aid to the homeless and immigrants and help for the jobless and youths in gangs Reputation as Activist Archbishop Mahony was elevated to his post last September after gaining a reputation as an activist for Hispanic rights as Bishop of Stockton in Californias farming region In recent weeks he has embraced controversy as he has put his activist philosophy into play in the sprawling threecounty Los Angeles Archdiocese Membership of the archdiocese consisting of Los Angeles Ventura and Santa Barbara counties is officially put at 26 million but the Rev Joseph Battaglia a spokesman said that because estimates of the number of illegal aliens in the region were believed to be unreliable the figure might be as high as 3 million More than half the membership and perhaps as high as twothirds is Hispanic according to the archdiocese but in recent years large numbers have become inactive in the church or have been won over to evangelical Protestant denominations Late last month the National Conference of Catholic Bishops released the third draft of a key pastoral letter terming employment a basic right The pastoral letter is set for final consideration by the full 300 members of the conference in November Admiration and Criticism Archbishop Mahony at the age of 49 the youngest archbishop in the United States is generally known as a liberal on social issues and a conservative on church doctrine He has drawn criticism from some lay Catholics for his emphasis on the needs of the poor but admiration for what others call his innovative and energetic leadership There are no illegal aliens in the Catholic Church the Archbishop declared recently in announcing that the archdiocese would sponsor a group to help Hispanic Catholics fight a Reagan Administration housing policy requiring all residents of federally subsidized public housing over the age of 18 to have proof of citizenship or legal immigrant status The policy calls upon the Department of Housing and Urban Development to begin eviction procedures July 30 for those who do not qualify under the policy but this week the House passed a bill that would permit aliens already residing in public housing to remain The Archbishop has thrown his support behind efforts by the United Neighborhood Organization an influential Hispanic community group in Los Angeles to amend the policy to apply only to future residents and to win a reprieve for current residents who are in this country illegally The church has a mission to respond to the immediate needs of the people who are already there Father Battaglia said The Archbishop is saying Dont throw them out where are they going to go  Support for Pregnant TeenAger The Archbishop is firm in his support of the Popes opposition to abortion But two weeks ago he evoked consternation among some Catholics by intervening in the decision of a Catholic school in Los Angeles to bar a pregnant unmarried teenagers participation in the schools commencement ceremony Some Catholics said the move gave the appearance of condoning unwed pregnancy Because the Archbishop overruled a policy of the parochial schools of the archdiocese the teenager Lisa Martinez a 17yearold honor student at Mary Star of the Sea High School in San Pedro who is six months pregnant was graduated with her class at the ceremonies June 6 The Archbishop held that the church should support pregnant girls who resist the pressure to conform to the unacceptable abortion option and ordered the policy revised Last month in a departure from tradition the Archbishop publicly blessed 14 pregnant unmarried teenagers at St Annes Maternity Home in Los Angeles
SOUTHERN BAPTISTS ARE FACING A SCHISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/weekinreview/southern-baptists-are-facing-a-schism.html,SOUTHERN BAPTISTS have long been the victims of Northern misconceptions Lumped in with the fundamentalist tide that swept the nation during the 1970s the Southern Baptists were often seen as resisting modern culture science social programs In fact the opposite was often true But over the last eight years the fundamentalist tide has swept over the Southern Baptists too Last week the election of Adrian Rogers a riveting Memphis preacher as president at the Southern Baptist Conventions annual meeting put the fundamentalists in arms reach of finally taking over the 14 agencies and 6 seminaries that do the denominations work of winning converts training pastors and publishing tracts The Southern Baptist seminaries turn out pastors who conduct widely recognized scholarly research Southern Baptists run soup kitchens shelter the homeless and send food to Africa Until a few years ago the denomination opposed prayer in public schools and its moderate officials asserted that abortion should be allowed in some cases But after watching power slip from their hands during the threeday meeting last week the moderates wonder how long they can protect their activities and ideological positions The fundamentalists who hold that the Bible is without error and must be interpreted literally first captured the 144 millionmember denominations presidency in 1979 They have won it each year since though they have only gradually gained influence in the seminaries and agencies Their latest victory however may be a cresting of power rather than a step in an inexorable ascent given underlying currents that could provide some comfort to moderates Nancy T Ammerman a professor of the sociology of religion at Emory University here has surveyed 1000 Southern Baptist pastors and lay people and predicts that the fundamentalists ranks will thin The fundamentalist surge Professor Ammerman says was largely due to the turmoil many people experienced in venturing to the Souths booming cities She said some found refuge in the fundamentalist certainties of repentance salvation and an unerring Bible But many she suggests will grow more comfortable with urban life and with the diversity that is a strong Baptist heritage In the meantime though the fundamentalists with a wellorganized political apparatus a growing oldboy network and several magnetic leaders will begin wielding true power This year they could capture a majority on the Home Mission Board whose activities contributed to the 351071 baptisms and the establishment of 675 new churches last year A touchy issue has been the boards support for women as military and hospital chaplains In the Southern Baptist system individual churches can ordain anyone they believe has a calling and 250 women are now pastors But fundamentalists like Mr Rogers oppose the ordination of women Those with the most to lose are the moderates in the seminaries whose boards the fundamentalists could control within a year or two Those who teach the New Testament take their lives in their hands because of the rigid position these people have taken said Kenneth Chafin a professor at Southern Seminary in Louisville Ky Fundamentalists reply that their control of the seminaries would not mean wholesale firings Professor Ammerman said however that fundamentalistrun seminaries might require a professor to sign a stricter statement of faith than is now sought or to submit book lists for approval and that many professors might choose to leave And while Baptist principles have long encouraged separation of church and state the denomination might now promote the political goals of the religious right Youd have to be some kind of blind man not to see that said James M Dunn executive director of the Baptist Joint Committee on Public Affairs a Washington lobbying group of nine Baptist denominations Like many he was struck by a letter from President Reagan asking for help in ending abortion and restoring prayer in the schools that was read after Mr Rogerss victory Mr Dunn in particular may pay for his views Fundamentalists angered by his resistance to prayer in schools came close to ending Southern Baptist participation in his lobbying group They will probably try again next year
"ABORTION IS AFFIRMED, BUT IN A LOWER VOICE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/weekinreview/abortion-is-affirmed-but-in-a-lower-voice.html,THE Reagan Administration which has been more aggressive than any recent predecessor in pushing its political agenda in the Supreme Court met with two sharp setbacks there last week in cases that raised profoundly divisive moral and ideological issues A narrow majority of the Court spurning a highly unusual Administration request that it reverse itself and allow states to ban abortion strongly reaffirmed its 1973 decision in Roe v Wade that the Constitution guarantees a right to abortion The Court also struck down the Administrations Baby Doe rules which were designed to prevent parents and doctors from allowing severely handicapped newborn infants to die The vote to strike down a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion was 5 to 4 Because only two of the dissenters explicitly rejected the view that the Constitution protects abortion the vote did not necessarily mean that four Justices would now allow states to prohibit abortions But it the margin of support for abortion rights was narrower than at any time since the Roe case was decided by a vote of 7 to 2 At the same time the majority curbed more severely than ever before a states power to regulate abortion striking down some provisions resembling laws that the Court had previously upheld Justices Byron R White and William H Rehnquist the two dissenters in the Roe case said last week that it should be overruled The two other dissenters Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Justice Sandra Day OConnor did not go as far But Chief Justice Burger did shift his position significantly A somewhat hesitant member of the original Roe majority who has dissented from what he considered unwarranted extensions of that decision he said for the first time that I agree we should reexamine Roe Justice OConnor denounced the reasoning of Roe as she had in a 1983 opinion along with the Courts unworkable scheme for constitutionalizing the regulation of abortion But she declined to say whether she would overrule Roe fully Her opinions seem ambiguous on whether states should be free to ban most abortions It is thus clear that the Court would allow states to restrict abortion  but unclear whether it would allow them to ban abortion  if President Reagan replaced any of the five majority Justices with someone who shared his views Even if Roe were overruled some states would presumably allow abortion as New York and a few others did before 1973 In striking down Pennsylvanias informed consent requirement and other provisions last week Justice Harry A Blackmun wrote in the majority opinion that some of them were designed to intimidate women into continuing pregnancies The dissenters said the law would pose no real obstacle to women seeking abortions Justice White accused the majority of responding defensively by indiscriminately striking down regulations that were consistent with Roe In the Baby Doe case the Court ruled that a 1973 law barring discrimination against the handicapped did not give the Federal Government the authority to intervene in sensitive decisions by parents under doctors advice or to conscript unwilling state agencies as foot soldiers in a Federal crusade Justice John Paul Stevenss plurality opinion was hostile to what medical groups described as Federal Baby Doe squads descending on hospitals to investigate alleged discrimination against handicapped newborns But the Court left open the possibility of some Federal role And a 1984 Act of Congress which was not before the Court directs state child protective agencies that receive Federal money to take steps to prevent withholding of medically indicated treatment from handicapped newborns Another Social Policy Defeat Last weeks decisions followed the Courts unanimous and somewhat reproachful rejection of the Administrations effort to block thousands of mentally ill New Yorkers from suing the Government for cutting off disability benefits This has not been a winning month for Solicitor General Charles Fried whose argument that the Court should overrule Roe was not supported by the State of Pennsylvania but he hopes to fare better in some important cases to be decided before the term ends in late June or early July He said in an interview that the Administrations role in the abortion case was useful and proper and may have contributed to the Courts consideration of fundamental issues Noting that the Court had agreed with the Administrations reasoning in some significant cases this term Mr Fried said If they agreed with us every time then I think that would be a fair sign that I was really only telling them what they thought already and that wouldnt be much of a conversation
2 G.O.P. ASPIRANTS GIVE HINT OF '88 STRATEGIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/15/us/2-gop-aspirants-give-hint-of-88-strategies.html,When his turn came Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York did not try to match the passion of the Rev Pat Robertsons earlier speech attacking the latest Supreme Court decision reaffirming the right to abortion Instead Mr Kemp addressing a gathering of the nations largest antiabortion organization called for both political action and tolerance saying the battle against abortion had to be won in the court of public opinion and not just in the court of law The performances of these two Republican Presidential hopefuls revealed much about their political strategies as they compete for the support of conservative activists Both received rousing receptions Friday at the annual convention of the National Right to Life Committee The threeday meeting ended today after hearing from a third potential Republican Presidential candidate Bob Dole of Kansas the Senate majority leader Mr Robertsons message laden with scorn for the Justices he denounced as despots brought the convention to its emotional high pitch and demonstrated his ability to move an audience But despite the television evangelists challenge Mr Kemps claim to strong support among antiabortion activists appeared unshaken He received four standing ovations and many in the audience held up signs saying Kemp 88 Keep Our Cause Alive At a news conference Mr Kemp said one of his major concerns was that he not become branded as candidate of narrow interests as he tries to mobilize groups such as antiabortion activists around his prospective campaign I plan if I become a candidate in 1988 to try to appeal to as broad a segment of my party and of the country as possible he said Im not going to limit myself to the potential of just being a narrowbased candidate Mr Kemps strength with antiabortion activists comes from what one leader of the movement called his unassailable voting record and his sponsorship of major pieces of legislation to curb legal abortion Carolyn Campbell founder of Iowans for Life said Mr Kemp seems to have a fire about him and hes spent a lot of time with our people Mr Dole told the gathering he was not concerned by his critics suggestions that he was pandering to opponents of abortion Its a little late for that he said Ive been voting with them for 13 years The Senate leader like Mr Kemp was restrained in criticism of the Supreme Court and urged the group to help Republicans keep control of the Senate confirmation process for judicial nominees Since 1981 he said Weve confirmed judge after judge who meets your standards Antiabortion activists are a significant part of the religious right that Mr Robertson hopes to mobilize behind his candidacy should he decide to run But Mr Kemps strategists contend that the Congressman will wind up with substantial support among evangelical and fundamentalist Christians when they focus on the question of whether Mr Robertson can win an election Dr John C Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee said in an interview that Mr Robertson was a very credible national figure But he added The big question is would he be electable and thats not something Im asking publicly at this time Dr Willke a Cincinnati physician said most of the probable Republican contenders for 1988 held positions on abortion that would make them acceptable to his group He said Vice President Bush still went beyond the committees position which sanctions abortion only when the life of the mother is in danger Mr Bush also tolerates abortion of pregnancies resulting from rape and incest Hes very supportive of our goals Dr Willke said If his position were adopted the number of annual abortions in this country would go from 1550000 to less than a thousand Mr Bush was forced to cancel his scheduled appearance at the convention to travel to Canada But before leaving on that trip he met privately with Dr Willke and other antiabortion leaders in Washington

any particular social outcome the state should not try to make men and women indistinguishable in their public and private lives any more than it should try to preserve natural differences in mens and womens roles Rather the aim of public policy should be to insure a maximum of free choice for each man and woman In a modern state virtually every area of public policy has implications for the position of men as men and women as women in society This book considers a wide variety of policy issues taxes and social security bank credit and abortion family policy and labor law What gives it an admirable clarity and unity is its insistence on free choice as a yardstick of justice Formerly choices for women were few Women were sharply limited in the ways they could earn a living they were excluded altogether from many aspects of public life But American attitudes and American laws have changed dramatically in recent decades Todays work force is more sexually integrated and todays home life less bound by convention than ever before What is the cause of the inequalities that remain Naturalists claim it is biology sex is destiny Hence naturalists of the New Right demand a return to traditional roles for women and men while idiosyncratic naturalists like Ivan Illich and Germaine Greer celebrate the authenticity of feudal or preindustrial life Feminists meanwhile blame inequality on male oppression Gender Justice rejects both the naturalist and the feminist explanations as oversimplified and misleading Some discrimination against women persists but the authors suggest that choices by women also contribute to the inequality of the sexes Women for example are less likely than men to finish college and more likely to seek jobs that are compatible with being a traditional wife and mother at home While the state has a clear responsibility to prevent discrimination this book insists that public policy should respect the choices of traditional as well as nonconventional women Equality should mean individual autonomy in other words but not necessarily that men and women must become alike as groups Applying this principle to the question of affirmative action the authors support wide recruitment for jobs and scrutiny of neutral hiring standards to make sure they really are neutral But Gender Justice opposes quotas Quotas stigmatize their beneficiaries and detract from the principle of individual choice by presuming in advance to know how many women and men will want one sort of job Numerical goals too easily become ends in themselves and there is no apparent reason to make proportional representation the aim OF course people can disagree about how to apply the principle of individual choice especially to morally complex problems like affirmative action But it is not just the application of the principle in this book that will trouble some feminists Liberty itself the authors argue requires the preservation of a private sphere of life in which people can make intimate choices without public interference It is an idea that goes back to John Stuart Mill and to Isaiah Berlins negative liberty  the basic freedom from being pushed around This principle is at odds with an article of faith among many feminists that there should be no distinction between private and public the personal is the political The most radical feminists are surprisingly suspicious of free choice No woman should be authorized to stay home to raise her children said the late Simone de Beauvoir Society should be totally different Women should not have that choice precisely because if there is such a choice too many women will make that one This outlook is deeply foreign to Gender Justice Gender Justice has the rarity value of being a book about public policy that is literate jargonfree and even entertaining The authors make a fascinating case for a gender policy centered on personal liberty Freedom of choice rightly appeals to most Americans whatever the reservations of some naturalists and some radical feminists Gender Justice does have very little to say about the problems of illegitimacy and family breakdown that increasingly plague the underclass in this country But perhaps these are problems of public justice or of cultural leadership that transcend the specific question of gender justice
BRIEFING; The Moving Pen Writes,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/16/us/briefing-the-moving-pen-writes.html,Justice John Paul Stevens of the Supreme Court seems to enjoy ferreting out and noting in his opinions what he considers inconsistencies in the positions of both his colleagues and the Justice Department In Wednesdays abortion decision he was the only member of the Court who made any mention at all of Solicitor General Charles Fried author of the Administrations brief urging the Court to reverse itself and rule that states may prohibit abortion Mr Fried is the Governments top lawyer before the Supreme Court Justice Harry A Blackmuns majority opinion ignored Mr Frieds brief while implicitly rejecting its arguments and reaffirming that a womans right to choose abortion is part of the liberty protected by the Constitution Justice Stevens in a concurring opinion also ignored Mr Frieds brief But he did quote from Mr Frieds scholarly writings as a Harvard Law professor before he joined the Administration In a 1978 book Mr Fried wrote What a person is what he wants the determination of his life plan of his concept of the good are the most intimate expressions of selfdetermination and by asserting a persons responsibility for the results of this selfdetermination we give substance to the concept of liberty And in a 1977 article he cited the moral fact that a person belongs to himself and not others nor to society as a whole Justice Stevens in quoting these statements indicated that they supported the Courts view that the Constitution bars society from telling women they cannot terminate their pregnancies Mr Fried has made it clear that he does not see it that way

REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK; ABORTION CLASH IN DENVER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/16/us/reporter-s-notebook-abortion-clash-in-denver.html,Their paths crossed little if at all and when they spoke to each other it was generally through reporters But the National Right to Life Committee and the National Organization for Women separated by about six blocks and a world view transformed this city into a vast debating hall over the weekend The topic was abortion Each group was here for its annual convention and each asserted that political momentum was on its side Dr John C Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee said there was a tidal movement in the country against legal abortion despite wishful thinking down the street Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women countered The more attention they call to this issue the more our numbers will just multiply The debate was sharpened by outside events  the Supreme Courts 5to4 decision last week striking down a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion and attacks on clinics offering abortion services in Wichita Kan and in a suburb of St Louis Both Sides Are Encouraged Mrs Smeal hailed the Courts decision as one that expanded womens rights to abortion but she acknowledged the narrowness of the vote Antiabortion activists were elated by the onevote margin and particularly by Chief Justice Warren E Burgers statement that the Courts 1973 abortion decision should be reexamined Dr Willke said NOW leaders responded angrily to the attacks on abortion clinics and called for greater Federal efforts to protect such clinics Mrs Smeal also assailed what she described as widespread harassment of clinic patients by protesters This could be your daughter being chased out of an examining room your wife or your loved one she said Dr Willke said he would like to see peaceful picketing at every abortion center to inform patients of the consequences of abortion and the alternatives But he said his group had repeatedly denounced violence which he described as terribly damaging to our movement NOW had a varied agenda dealing with matters ranging from child care to pornography but the abortion issue was never very far away A small group of antiabortion demonstrators who said they were not affiliated with the National Right to Life Committee were on hand when the feminist group began its convention Friday As many women arrived at their hotel that afternoon they were met by a sidewalk preacher shouting Repent NOW repent and be the women God intended you to be Nearby were a handful of pickets one of them a man shouting over and over again Twenty million dead babies Most of the NOW members ignored the picketing but many expressed anger Im a mother of six Dorothea Sewter of Blackwood NJ told a reporter Do I look like a babykiller to you Dr Willke said that to avoid confrontations everyone who registered at his groups convention had been advised not to picket during the session He also said exhibitors had been asked to sign an agreement not to use their booths to promote outside events The agreement also said Exhibitors may not advocate any illegal acts or violence This is the most peaceful middleclass group of people youll ever find in your life Dr Willke said He said the extent of the police presence for his convention was comical There were children at both conventions At the NOW childcare center 9yearold Xochi said she had come with her mother from Austin Tex She said she knew all about the National Organization for Women Its a good organization to help women get their rights she said Women are stuck up in the kitchen Men can be in the kitchen too The National Right to Life Committee convention included workshops solely for teenagers on topics such as public relations and lobbying and political activities Both groups had exhibits At the NOW convention there were booths ranging from one on Financial Planning for Women to one offering a cookie cutter in the shape of the circleovercross symbol for women yielding cookies great for consciousnessraising at work PTA meetings church suppers fundraisers or holiday gatherings At the Right to Life Committees meeting there were booths on Childrens ProLife Art and Science Activities and several tables offering literature such as Abortion Clinics An Inside Look Three aspirants for the Republican Presidential nomination addressed the Right to Life Committee the Rev Pat Robertson who is a television evangelist Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York and the Senate majority leader Bob Dole of Kansas The groups program included a message of support from President Reagan Across town Mrs Smeal said her group had decided not to invite any of those seeking the Democratic nomination because NOW wanted to be politically independent Weve been there she said referring to the groups involvement in behalf of Walter F Mondale in the 1984 campaign
BATTLES PAST AND FUTURE BLEND AT NOW'S PARLEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/us/battles-past-and-future-blend-at-now-s-parley.html,The National Organization for Women held a historical Tshirt contest at its annual convention here last weekend as part of the celebration of its 20th anniversary Members showed up in faded shirts that were resonant of past battles won and lost Many of the shirts hearkened back to the unsuccessful effort to win passage of an Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution including one that read ERA  The Dream Will Never Die Other women wore the shirts of 1984 including one bearing the smiling face of Geraldine A Ferraro the Democratic VicePresidential candidate with the simple slogan Finally Throughout the convention which adjourned Sunday night it was clear that memories of those past battles hang heavily over the organization What they have produced in a chord struck repeatedly by NOWs president Eleanor Smeal is a sharp independence We know something we maybe didnt know a few years ago said Mrs Smeal Were going to have to depend on ourselves In a strongly worded keynote address Mrs Smeal recited a litany of problems internal and external confronting the feminist group She denounced as revisionist history the charge that NOW has failed to aggressively push for childcare and pregnancy benefits a criticism that particularly rankles the group And she ridiculed the notion that the country was in a postfeminist era adding Some powers that be want us to go out of business They wish they were in a postfeminist era Need to Erase Debt She acknowledged that the organization was in debt and declared We must become obnoxious in our fund raising And she asserted that NOW would not be an auxiliary or arm of any other movement In some ways this push toward political independence is born of necessity After the Democrats overwhelming defeat in 1984 many party leaders attributed much of the blame to the partys close identification with interest groups including NOW which gave an early endorsement to Walter F Mondale the Democratic Presidential nominee and later pressed him publicly to name a woman as a running mate Many feminists on the other hand felt the Democratic Party had not done enough to advance their causes and reacted angrily to what they viewed as postelection fingerpointing Bridgebuilding to the Republican Party is unlikely with Mrs Smeal regularly denouncing the Reagan Administration on a host of issues Coalitionbuilding with the Rev Jesse Jackson who has courted a variety of disaffected Democrats is a possibility that was discussed here But Mrs Smeal while praising Mr Jackson said We dont want to be an arm of anybody At the convention a resolution was introduced to investigate the possibility of from a new political party but the session adjourned before delegates could vote on it Mrs Smeal said she neither pushed nor opposed the resolution We know what some of the realities are she said But I still think there is a lot of desire for something different While the organization considered its political strategy it reaffirmed its committment to activism on several issues The convention approved a strong resolution on abortion rights calling for litigation against terrorist activities at clinics the creation of a strike force to systematically track activities of antiabortion extremists and the continuation of demonstrations and conferences on the issue Stance on Abortions The group also vowed to fight any abortionrelated referendums on the ballot this year that would restrict a womans right to choose While NOW has long been on record in support of child care it passed another resolution calling for full public funding of such programs It also called for continued commitment to ending wage discrimination based on sex and race and improvement of the rights of women in marital property laws Mrs Smeal who has one year to go in her term said she viewed the convention as an affirmation of her policies including her active defense of legalized abortion through lawsuits and demonstrations We know we have to do it she said
The Editorial Notebook; The Abortion Dialogue at Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/opinion/the-editorial-notebook-the-abortion-dialogue-at-court.html,I have always had the highest respect for his views on this subject wrote Justice John Paul Stevens of his colleague Byron White The subject was abortion the occasion was the Supreme Courts reaffirmation of 1973s Roe v Wade and that opening remark was a sure sign that Justice Stevens was about to blast Justice White Their exchange drowned out in the days news was the Courts liveliest in print in years They are normally the coolest of judges Justice Stevens may vote liberal much more often than Justice White but their toughminded intellectualism often makes their votes hard to predict This time they pulled no punches At times Justice Whites rhetoric conflicts with his own analysis said Justice Stevens in complaining of his colleagues dissent Here he said was Justice White conceding that a womans decision about an abortion is a species of liberty  yet voting against that liberty Justice White replied that treating this liberty as fundamental was to indulge personal not constitutional values and refusing to protect those who will be citizens if their lives are not ended in the womb Quite wrong Justice Stevens shot back The Court he said has consistently held that reproductive decisions are for the individual not the state If Federal judges must allow the state to make the abortion decision presumably the state is free to decide that a woman may never abort may sometimes abort or as in the Peoples Republic of China must always abort if her family is already too large Justice White scorned the majoritys view that state and individual interests can change over time that a womans liberty is due more deference early while the states interest in preserving potential life gains force later in pregnancy Justice Stevens said Justice White had a powerful theological argument but insisted that the Court should deal only in secular interests To which Justice White replied that a state cannot avoid positions that may correspond to some religious beliefs and contradict others That he said is just why courts should defer to legislatures What can the nation learn from such heated but obviously sincere debate Perhaps only that there wont be any knockout punches if these two heavyweights cant deliver them The only clear loser of their debate was Attorney General Edwin Meese who keeps asking for a jurisprudence of original intent that hews to the Founding Fathers precepts As Justice White wrote This Court does not subscribe to the simplistic view that constitutional interpretation can possibly be limited to the plain meaning of the Constitutions text or to the subjective intention of the Framers Justice Stevens concurred Another lesson is that principled and vigorous discussion of this issue is still possible Since American society is unlikely to vote a respite from the abortion battle let the passions be sublimated in this kind of sharp but civilizing debate
Feminism's Next Challenge: Support for Motherhood,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/17/opinion/feminism-s-next-challenge-support-for-motherhood.html,The most urgent problem facing modern American women is reconciling the demands of childbirth and child rearing with those of earning a living For them conditions are onerous and getting worse We live in a society where 60 percent of working women have no right to jobprotected maternity leave Most women do not work for pin money they need to hang on to their jobs to buy groceries and pay the rent We live in a society where 75 percent of working women are either single mothers or are married to men earning less than 15000 a year And we live in a society where half the babies under one year of age have mothers in the workplace but where perversely Federal funds for day care assistance have been cut by 25 percent since 1980 Women take a nose dive when they become mothers Pregnant workers are routinely fired others are defined as new hires when they come back to work after childbirth and lose seniority rights and large numbers of new mothers fail to find affordable child care and are forced to take a thirdrate job with short hours close to home Overall women lose 20 percent of their earning power in the immediate aftermath of childbirth American feminism has given short shrift to issues of motherhood and children For many early leaders of the womens movement family was part of the problem not part of the solution In the late 60s and early 70s feminists were trying to escape the boundaries of traditional domestic roles The focus of the struggle was to win formal equality of rights between the sexes  to get out there and clone the competitive male model Many of the battles that were fought by feminists in the 70s were important We did manage to break down barriers and open up the marketplace and women gained new access to jobs education and credit But as we dressed for success in our business suits and little string ties we tended to forget that 90 percent of women choose to have children at some point in their lives and that women would remain seriously handicapped in the workplace unless we established a new system of family supports Most other Western democracies provide elaborate family supports so that working women are not derailed by childbirth In Europe the average maternity leave is five months at full pay In France 90 percent of 3yearolds spend their days in Governmentsponsored preschools In Sweden parents can opt for a six hour workday until a child is 8 years old In Italy working women receive two years credit toward seniority every time they give birth to a child Partly because of these family supports European women have done better in the labor market In Sweden and Italy women earn approximately 80 percent of the male wage in France West Germany and Britain 70 percent All over Europe women have steadily increased their earning power in recent years Not so in the United States here women still earn 64 percent of a mans wage as they did in 1939 European feminists got it right when they decided to push not only for equal rights in the sphere of work but also for benefits and services to ease the family responsibilities of working women Women need more than equal treatment Swimming in the mainstream and taking your chances doesnt produce equal results if you are bearing and rearing children in your spare time Equal access to jobs and education has to be supplemented by family support systems if women are to improve their economic position Eleanor Smeal who was reelected to the presidency of the National Organization for Women 10 months ago has passionately reaffirmed the movements commitment to two central goals  the Equal Rights Amendment and abortion She is putting a large part of the organizations scarce resources into a campaign to move the issue of the ERA back onto the front burner of our national agenda and has just begun a largescale offensive to collect one million petitions to win passage of the amendment in Vermont In my view this demonstrates poor judgment Even Judy Goldsmith president of NOW between 1982 and 1985 has described the organizations further pursuit of the amendment as an exercise in futility As for abortion we simply have to widen the prochoice agenda Let us demonstrate on the streets and fight for the benefits needed to do a better job for the children we choose to have Let us march in Washington for prenatal care maternity benefits jobprotected parental leave and highquality child care The fastest growing segment of the labor force consists of mothers with preschool children Easing the lives of working mothers insuring a better start in life for children  these are among the central problems of our age Put them at the top of the feminist agenda and the movement will have a new lease on life
THE SUPREME COURT: DECISIONS IN THE OVAL OFFICE; SELECTION PRAISED BY G.O.P. SENATORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/the-supreme-court-decisions-in-the-oval-office-selection-praised-by-gop-senators.html,Republican leaders of the Senate today praised President Reagans selection of Justice William H Rehnquist to become Chief Justice of the United States and predicted that he would be easily confirmed But some Democrats said they had grave doubts about what they described as Mr Rehnquists extreme rightwing views and they vowed to scrutinize his record very carefully before deciding whether to support his nomination Mr Reagans intention to nominate Judge Antonin Scalia to replace Mr Rehnquist as an Associate Justice stirred less controversy in part because his views on many issues are not well known In addition lawmakers from both parties said that Judge Scalias reputation for intellectual brilliance would mute criticism from senators who disagreed with his conservative rulings Lawmakers differed on what impact the two nominees would have on the Supreme Court should both be confirmed Senator Strom Thurmond the South Carolina Republican who heads the Judiciary Committee said that both men share the conservative views of Chief Justice Warren Burger and added I dont think the balance of the court will be changed But Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican who serves on the Judiciary panel said both nominees are more conservative than Justice Burger and predicted that they would pull the court to the right The Senator described the retiring Chief Justice as a moderate with conservative leanings and he mentioned Mr Burgers support for the decision that legalized abortion in 1973 Representative Don Edwards Democrat of California the chairman of the subcommittee on civil and constitutional rights agreed with Senator Hatch and explained On balance this change will likely result in a more conservative court Mr Edwards expressed doubts that the shift would alter the Supreme Courts view toward abortion But due process affirmative action and the rights of individuals against the government may suffer he said The Californian also predicted that a Rehnquist court would produce more decisions that were hostile to civil rights advocates and that would hurt the rights of women minorities and the handicapped From a political standpoint the choice of Judge Scalia drew praise from ItalianAmericans in both parties Senator Pete V Domenici a New Mexico Republican called the nomination a magnificent tribute to Americans of Italian origin and Representative Mario Biaggi a Bronx Democrat added Of course there is a special pride I feel as an Italian American Our community has always asked for consideration based on merit The Republican reaction to Mr Reagans surprising announcement was led by Bob Dole the majority leader who said I can think of no finer choice than Justice Rehnquist to replace Chief Justice Burger Senator Cranston called the timing of Justice Burgers retirement very interesting As a result he added it would be more difficult to delay action on the nominations until the end of the Congress should a surge of opposition develop in the weeks ahead Many lawmakers have noted that if the Democrats regain control of the Senate in Novembers election one of the primary results could be greater trouble for judicial nominations in Mr Reagans final two years in office Many lawmakers were cautious today about passing judgment on the two selections but Senator Cranston said he was particularly concerned about how Justice Rehnquist might perform as the chief administrator of the Supreme Court The question is can a man who has an extreme rightwing ideology manage the court in a fair and balanced way the California Democrat said The developments regarding the Court were greeted with dismay by some feminist and liberal groups Eleanor Smeal president of the National Organization for Women said that Mr Rehnquist has consistently been against the womens rights and feminist position in a whole host of cases Conservative groups on the other hand were generally elated In my view Mr Burger was a transition figure from the radical activism of the Warren court to the principled restraint of the Rehnquist era said Patrick B McGuigan director of the judicial reform project for the Free Congress Foundation
LIFE IN THE 30'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,DOMINUS vobiscum Et cum spiritu tuo These are my bona fides a word a phrase a sentence in a language no one speaks anymore Kyrie eleison Confiteor dei I am a Catholic Once at a nursing home for retired clergy I ate lunch with a priest 90 years old a man who still muttered the Latin throughout the English mass and ate fish on Fridays When he learned how old I was he said with some satisfaction You were a Catholic when being a Catholic still meant something What does it mean now For myself I cannot truly say Since the issue became material to me I have not followed the churchs teaching on birth control I disagree with its stand on abortion I believe its resistance to the ordination of women as priests is a manifestation of a misogyny that has been with us much longer than the church has Yet it would never have occurred to my husband and me not to be married in a Catholic church not to have our children baptized On hospital forms and in political polls while others leave the space blank or say none of your business I have no hesitation about giving my religion We are cultural Catholics I once sneered at that expression used by Jewish friends at college only because I was not introspective enough to understand how well it applied to me Catholicism is to us now not so much a system of beliefs or a set of laws but a shared history It is not so much our faith as our past The tenets of the church which I learned as a child have ever since been at war with the facts of my adult life The Virgin Birth The Trinity The Resurrection Why did God make me God made me to know Him to love Him and to serve Him in this world and to be happy with Him forever in the next I could recite parts of the Baltimore Catechism in my sleep Do I believe those words I dont know What I do believe are those guidelines that do not vary from faith to faith that are as true of Judaism or Methodism as they are of Catholicism that people should be kind to one another that they should help those in need that they should respect others as they wish to be respected And I believe in my own past I was educated by nuns given absolution by priests My parents were married in a Catholic church my grandfather and mother buried from one Saturday afternoons kneeling on Leatherette pads in the dim light of the confessional listening for the sound of the priest sliding back the grille on his side Sunday mornings kneeling with my face in my hands the Communion wafer stuck to the roof of my dry mouth These are my history I could no more say I am not Catholic than say I am not Irish not Italian Yet I have never been to Ireland or Italy Some of our Jewish friends have returned to the ways of their past to Shabbat without automobiles and elevators to dietary laws and the study of Hebrew We cannot do the same There is no longer a Latin mass no communion fast from midnight on Even the inn is gone from the Bible now Mary and Joseph are turned away from the place where travelers lodged The first time my husband and I went to midnight mass on Christmas Eve in our parish church we arrived a halfhour early so we would get a seat When the bells sounded 12 and the priest came down the center aisle his small acolytes in their childsize cassocks walking before him the pews were still half empty We were thinking of a different time when the churches were packed when missing mass was a sin when we still believed that that sort of sin existed  sins against rules victimless sins There are more families coming to that church now families like us with very small children who often have to leave before the Gospel because of tears fatigue temper tantrums I remember when I was growing up my familys parish church was shaped like a cross and one of the short arms was for the women with babies It had a sheet of glass walling it off and was soundproof And through the glass you could see the babies as though in a movie with no audio their little mouths round their faces red Inside that room the noise was dreadful But missing mass was a sin I think perhaps those families are people like us people who believe in something although they are not sure what people who feel that in a world of precious little history or tradition this is theirs We will pass down the story to our children There was a woman named Mary who was visited by an angel And the angel said Do not be afraid and told her that though she was a virgin she would have a child And He was named Jesus and was the Son of God and He rose from the dead Everything else our children learn in America in the late 20th century will make this sound like a fairy tale like tales of the potato famines in Ireland and the little ramshackle houses with grape arbors on hillsides in Italy But these are my fairy tales and so whether or not they are fact they are true I was born a Catholic and I think I will die one I will ask for a priest

Toward a Rehnquist Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/opinion/toward-a-rehnquist-court.html,With two unambiguous Supreme Court nominations President Reagan has done what he said hed do what his warmest supporters hoped and strongest foes feared hed do Permitted to name a new Chief Justice he chose William Rehnquist once a lonely dissenter on the Courts extreme right wing And to fill the vacancy he picked Antonin Scalia of the Federal Court of Appeals in Washington who most closely promises the judicial philosophy of the President The nominees are not only of like ideology both are skilled and energetic These able lawyers would not be our choices for the Court but it was Ronald Reagans landslide The Senate must carefully weigh their appointments but given the nominees qualifications we assume confirmation Given that assumption the Court will have a noticeably different look with a sharper and younger profile for its conservative wing Whether the Court immediately speaks with a different voice is another question Over the 17 years of his leadership Chief Justice Burger had already nudged the Court away from its decidedly liberal bent under his predecessor Earl Warren So on the major issues that currently divide the justices and ignite politicians the Court is unlikely to rush to abandon some recent hardfought settlements The 20yearold Miranda v Arizona ruling against illegally obtained confessions has been toned down in some of its restrictions on the police and prosecutors but it has been affirmed as law by the Burger Court notably also by another Reagan appointee Justice Sandra Day OConnor Just the other day the Court refused with Chief Justice Burger among the dissenters to reconsider basic holdings on a womans right to choose abortion The Court has so far refused to retreat on core principles of civil rights Judge Scalia may be more hostile to abortion and affirmative action than the retiring Chief Justice but his ascendancy would not alter the balance in these areas Of legal as well as anecdotal significance now will be how a Chief Justice Rehnquist applies his genial nature and collegial spirit He has dissented from rulings that extend the rights of minorities women the disadvantaged and the poor Yet he seems not to have angered his more liberal colleagues in doing so His service may yet test the assurances he gave in an offthebench speech during the 1984 campaign that Presidents trying to reshape the high court in their own image usually fail Chief Justice Burgers desire to give fuller attention to next years bicentennial of the Constitution may fully explain the timing of his retirement But surely he and the President were aware that Republican control of the Senate is assured only until November and that other Presidents have found it difficult to win confirmation for Court appointees in their last years Warren Burger ever the whitehaired central casting ideal of a Chief Justice would now yield to a leader 17 years younger the very model of an aggressive advocate bent on change At 61 Justice Rehnquist would look to the support of a 50yearold Justice Scalia and often to Justice OConnor Justice Rehnquists 56yearold law school classmate Chronologically the future is theirs Of the preReagan liberals and moderates William Brennan is 80 Thurgood Marshall 77 Lewis Powell 78 Harry Blackmun 77 Byron White 69 and John Paul Stevens 66 Still the ultimate glory of this unique institution is that each member is master only of himself for life
THE SUPREME COURT: A 17-YEAR ERA COMES TO AN END; PRESIDENT'S NEWS CONFERENCE ON RESIGNATION OF CHIEF JUSTICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/supreme-court-17-year-era-comes-end-president-s-conference-resignation-chief.html,Following is a transcript of a statement in Washington yesterday by President Reagan announcing the resignation of Chief Justice Warren E Burger and key questions and answers that followed as recorded by The New York Times OPENING STATEMENT On May 27 1986 Chief Justice Burger advised me that he wanted to devote his full energies in the coming year to the important work of the commission on the bicentennial of the Constitution and for that reason would be retiring as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court as of the end of the current term Today I received with regret Chief Justice Burgers letter formally notifying me of his retirement And immediately after my conversation with the Chief Justice I directed my chief of staff together with the Attorney General and the counsel to the President to develop recommendations for a successor And Im pleased to announce my intention to nominate William H Rehnquist currently an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court as the new Chief Justice of the United States Upon Justice Rehnquists confirmation I intend to nominate Antonin Scalia currently a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit as Justice Rehnquists successor In taking this action I am mindful of the importance of these nominations The Supreme Court of the United States is the final arbiter of our Constitution and the meaning of our laws Qualifications of Justices The Chief Justice and the eight Associate Justices of the Court must not only be just jurists of the highest competence they must also be attentive to the rights specifically guaranteed in our Constitution and the proper role of the courts in our democratic system In choosing Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia I have not only selected judges who are sensitive to these matters but through their distinguished backgrounds and achievements reflect my desire to appoint the most qualified individuals to serve in our courts Justice Rehnquist has been an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court since 1971 a role in which he has served with great distinction and skill He is noted for his intellectual powers the lucidity of his opinions and the respect he enjoys among his colleagues Judge Scalia has been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1982 His great personal energy the force of his intellect and the depth of his understanding of our constitutional jurisprudence uniquely qualify him for elevation to our highest court I hope the Senate will promptly consider and confirm these gifted interpreters of our laws A Period of Change and Stability And in closing I want to say a word about Chief Justice Burger He has led the Court the Supreme Court for 17 years a time of great change and yet a period also of consolidation and stability in the decisions of the Court Under Chief Jutice Burgers guidance the Court has remained faithful to precedent while it sought out the principles that underlay the Framers words He is retiring now in order to devote his full attentions to a momentous occasion in our countrys history the observance in 1987 of the 200th anniversary of the Constitution This is an endeavor for which all Americans will be grateful and to which I and members of the Administration will lend our total support I am proud and honored to stand here today with Chief Justice Burger with Justice Rehnquist and with Judge Scalia and to discharge my constitutional responsibilities as President of the United States Thank you all God bless you QUESTIONS AND AN SWERS Impact on Abortion Q Mr President what impact do you think this will have on the abortion issue perhaps the most emotional issue facing the Court A It probably wont surprise you when I tell you that Im not going to take any questions now Chief Justice Burger here is available for any questions you might have of him And I think the others  Q Are you satisfied that the judge agrees with you on the abortion issue A Im not going to answer any questions If I start answering one Process of Selection Q Mr President what was the process which led you to Judge Scalia Did you know him before Or did your people come to you and recommend him What was the process A Unintelligible Q Well surely you must think sir that he agrees with you on such issues as abortion affirmative action prayer in the schools A Thats a question And as you said  Q Why didnt you appoint Mr Meese A I cant say no questions I can say no answers Q Yes youre right The New Justice Q Could you tell us a little bit about the new Justice whatever you can Do you know him personally A Unintelligible Q Do you want to take questions on another subject Have you heard from Gorbachev on the summit yet sir A No I think the subject today is justices Q Did Justice Burger recommend his successor A No The Justice said that he would not presume to do that to discuss with me individuals and give him opinion of them Summary of Tenure Q Mr Chief Justice maybe its appropriate now to ask you to give us your thoughts what since 1969 17 years on the Court BURGER Seventeen years yes Q Sum up your tenure What do you think youve done for  A That would take me about 17 years and you dont want to spend that much time Reason for Leaving Q Could you explain a little bit why youre leaving the Court A For one primary reason that the 200th anniversary of the Constitution got a late start the celebration got a late start It is vastly underfinanced and were going to have the Devils own time in trying to do the kind of a job that ought to be done for this great event John Warner the chairman of the 76 event you remember was drafted from his job as Secretary of the Navy which he did not want to leave And he told me he being an old friend he told me when this subject came up last year that the job of chairman was a fulltime job I already have two fulltime jobs as you know A job as Justice of the Court and the other job with all the vast administration problems And it just isnt feasible to have three fulltime jobs Health Not a Factor Q Is it a matter of health sir I mean people dont leave the Court except for matters of health normally A Well you make the diagnosis Do I look as though Im falling apart Q Well its not how you look its how you feel I mean was it a matter of health sir A Never felt better in my life Direction of Court Q Are you pleased with the direction the Court has taken How would you assess your tenure on the Court A I wouldnt try to assess it Ill leave that to other people to do Q Do you leave it with the satifaction sir that you have accomplished what you set out to A Not everything I set out to no Intermediate Panel Q Would you tell us a little bit about what youve said not to have finished A What I did not finish was an absolute imperative and thats to experiment with this intermediate panel that is now pending before the Congress Its a fiveyear experiment It wont cost any money and thats perhaps why it doesnt attract much attention in Washington It literally will cost nothing except to bring the judges from wherever they are into Washington Q Did you participate in a judgment on the GrammRudman ruling A Im going to answer this other question first That bill is pending It would take about 50 cases a year off the Supreme Court And at the present time if youre doing your homework those of you who are regulars on the Court you will find that there are 50 to 100 cases denying cert where one two or three Justices file a dissent and say this case ought to be taken There are important cases that ought to be taken that arent taken You know weve gone from Chief Justice Warrens first year with 65 signed opinions and weve been running over 150 for the last four or five years Weve gone from 1400 and some filings back in Earl Warrens day to nearly 5000 nearly 100 a week The Courts got to have some relief somewhere Im astonished that we havent had some judges fall over with coronary thrombosis or some other illness of exhaustion and overwork But going back specifically the only health problem that I know I have is the one I have had since I was 10 years old and thats a polio back from having polio Apart from the ordinary mental deterioration that occurs after age 40  Approval of Scalia Q Do you approve of the appointment of Judge Scalia A Well the Constitution doesnt give the Chief Justice any authority on the subject I have known each of these men  Ive known Justice Rehnquist as a colleague for now what 15 years REHNQUIST Fifteen years Chief BURGER And Ive known Judge Scalia since the time he was an Assistant Attorney General Hes participated in extrajudicial activities like being a member of the American team visiting England to study some of their methods We are not close friends I have a high regard for each of them a high regard Q Sir have you grown weary of being Chief Justice sir A No Im not weary of it no I would like to have stayed until  I would like to have stayed until we got some of these  this remedy that I told you about but I think the constitutional celebration is more important and after all there are some other people that can carry on this work Its just up to the Senate Comments by Rehnquist Q Justice Rehnquist could we ask you your thoughts about being nominated for the highest judicial post in this country REHNQUIST Well Im deeply gratified by the confidence that the President has shown in me by making the nomination Ill do my best to deserve that confidence Q Mr Rehnquist how is your health Youve had some problems in the past A I think I wont answer any further questions of the kind that might come up before the Senate confirmation committee Comments by Scalia Q Mr Scalia could you share your thoughts with us as a new nominee as much as you can say SCALIA Yes on the substance of it I think Im with Justice Rehnquist I know a good idea when I hear one Q What about your personal thoughts though A My personal thoughts are for somebody who spent his whole professional life in the law getting nominated to the Supreme Court is the culmination of a dream of course and Im greatly honored that the President would have such confidence in me and hope that the Senate will do so as well And Ill certainly do whatever I can to live up to it Questions on Abortion Q Did Administration officials sir question you on your views on Roe v Wade A I think Ill respond the way Justice Rehnquist did Q I didnt ask you your personal view of that subject sir Im wondering whether you were questioned before your selection was made on that subject A If the Senate wants to ask that they may but I dont want to get into it Q Do you expect controversy in the Senate confirmation A I have no idea Im not a politician Civility on the Court Q Mr Chief Justice some people suggest that the Supreme Court has become more sharply divided under your tenure First of all do you agree with that And how would you characterize the general level of comity among the Justices today BURGER It has not become more sharply divided If you go back and read the opinions over 35 40 years youd find there just isnt any substance to that The reason there are nine people up there  and there are days when Id like there to be just one  the reason you have nine is to have this interchange and interplay It goes on all the time In the 17 years I have been there presiding over the conferences never once never once has a voice been raised in any discussions Theyre vigorous discussions as they should be  always will be I hope We have cordial and good relations We can disagree in a civilized way and we do Judicial Philosophy Q Since you are not going before the Senate perhaps you can give us your views on whether these new appointments will change the philosophy or direction of the Court in the next few years A Well I could if I thought about it a great deal but I havent thought about it so I would not undertake it Timing of Resignation Q When did you first hear that it was going to be announced A I dont know a day or two ago Q Sir what will you miss most about being Chief Justice A Really nothingQ Justice Burger was your decision to retire at this time related at all to a desire to have President Reagan appoint your successor A Well if that had been my desire Id have quite a bit of time to wait here Q Chief Justice can you tell us a little bit about your tendering of the resignation with the President Did you personally  A I just gave it to him 10 minutes ago Q And what happened Can you talk a little of the conversation A He said Thank you as I remember I think maybe he and his staff were a little relieved All they had was word of mouth from me before and if I hadnt shown up with that letter today theyd have really had a problem Q Mr Chief Justice what was the reason for the timing of the announcement today of the change in the Court The President said you decided on your resignation last month why was it all announced today A Youll have to ask the President that I dont know the timing Q Mr Chief Justice if it were not for the bicentennial would you have retired when Do you have any views  A My letter as you will see fixes the effective date as July 10 We hope to conclude the term before that but theres always a certain amount of debris administrative debris to be cleared up Q Were it not for the bicentennial would you have retired At what A No if it were not for the bicentennial I would not have retired The Toughest Cases Q What was your toughest case Some people have suggested it was the Nixon tape case After all he appointed you to the Court and you joined in a unanimous judgment which forced him to turn over those tapes which were his undoing A That was not the toughest Q What was it A I really dont know Id have to give you a list of about 25 or 30 In fact a couple that are coming down very soon and that one last week that you fellows all missed Q When will we get that GrammRudman opinion A Sometime before the 10th of July I hope Screening Process Q Judge Scalia would you call yourself a tough judge SCALIA I think thats in the category of questions I think Q Can you tell us when you were first approached by the Administration Just give us a sense of the timing when you first heard and your feelings A I think if the President wants that to be known Im sure hell tell us Q Judge Scalia many of the judges appointed by this Administration are said to have been subjected to a rigorous screening process conducted under Attorney General Meese Were you at all Roe v Wade aside asked any of your positions on various points of law A I have no idea what the screening process was Youd have to ask the Attorney General Q No one spoke to you sir A I speak to people all the time Q No screening process directly with you A Id prefer not to  Q Judge I have a question that you can answer Can you give us the pronounciation of your name A Id be happy to do that SkuhLEEyuh Burgers Workload Q Mr Chief Justice did you at any point consider just telling the President that you know you just dont have time to run the bicentennial commission the constitutional  as a matter of fact youre the Chief Justice of the United States and youve got to do that BURGER Nobody that I know of could do all three of the jobs that I spoke of that Ive been trying to do for this last year One week recently after I had been carrying around a walking flu bug one of my staff informed me that I had logged 105 hours that week Now 80 and 90 I can handle but Im getting a little too old for 105 Q What has us all astounded here is the fact that youre the Chief Justice of the United States and youre putting that aside to handle a job that in fact is going to be over in a year A No three years Q Well three years whatever I think did you figure perhaps you could let the President take that burden off you so you could remain as Chief Justice Or were you simply weary of being Chief Justice A No I wasnt weary of being Chief Justice Its a lot of fun But I go back to what I said first We have inadequate preparation for the bicentennial of the Constitution Its a remarkable story its one of the great great stories in American history and its our job to tell it And were just getting organized we havent got a main headquarters yet were scattered in three buildings Weve got for Washington a piddling appropriation of 12 million and over 10 years ago John Warner had over 200 million If were going to celebrate this thing in the proper way and have people get an understanding in this country and elsewhere about what freedom means and that this is the instrument that gave that freedom and how it works theres a lot of work to be done I expect to be working literally full time Q You said this was the primary reason that you were resigning A Thats right Q What was the secondary reason A I didnt have a secondary reason Rehnquists New Job Q Justice Rehnquist you have had a reputation more as a thinker and writer on the Court than as an administrator Do you too consider it the culmination of a dream to be Chief Justice and thus have to take on all these administrative tasks REHNQUIST I wouldnt call it the culmination of a dream but its not every day when youre 61 years old that you get a chance to have a new job And you take on some things you dont like along with a lot of things that you do like BURGER That strikes as a perfect parallel Bill Rehnquist is the same age as I was when I was nominated  back in the Garfield Administration I think it was Changes in the Court Q Mr Chief Justice how have you seen the Court change philosophically during your tenure A Well if you would go to the history of the Supreme Court of the United States or of the country youll find that at different periods there are different needs and different problems and there are different answers And then sometimes you find that an answer that you gave two years ago or three or five doesnt quite fit and you adjust it We have been doing some adjusting That was done in the previous 15 years but we havent done a fraction of that adjusting that was done in the 15 years before my tenure began Q Do you regret any of your decisions sir Any of the opinions you wrote Would you like to change them looking back A I wish some of them were a little shorter Q Are you at all concerned that the ABA was not consulted apparently about your replacement on the Court A I dont know anything about the procedures not a thing I have never understood that the appointments to the Supreme Court automatically were cleared with the American Bar Sometimes theyre consulted and sometimes theyre not Q Mr Chief Justice if I could follow up on that You said that there had not been nearly the changes during your tenure as in the preceding 15 years Does that mean there was less need for change or it just did not happen A Ill leave that to you objective observers are a better judge of that than I
WASHINGTON; Hear Ye in the Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/opinion/washington-hear-ye-in-the-court.html,The surprising thing about the coming changes on the Supreme Court is that they have not occurred earlier With President Reagan approaching his sixth year in the White House and five of the nine members over 75 it was expected even in the last Presidential election that by now Mr Reagan would have been able to appoint a clear conservative majority The timing of Chief Justice Burgers resignation was a surprise It was known that he had become increasingly preoccupied in the last year with the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution and he gave this as the sole reason for stepping down next month At the same time though saying he was in excellent health he has been suffering from a painful back and respiratory difficulties and he told the press that working 105 hours a week was a bit much for a man of 78 There seems to be general agreement here among students of the Court on two points First that Associate Justice William Rehnquist nominated to succeed Chief Justice Burger and Judge Antonin Scalia of the Federal Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit nominated to fill the resulting vacancy are highly qualified conservative judges and will have no trouble being confirmed This might have been different if the Democrats were to gain control of the Senate in this Novembers elections and may help explain why the Administration is pleased with the present moves The result therefore is that the new Court will include Chief Justice Rehnquist at 61 Associate Justices White 69 OConnor 56 and Scalia 50 all conservatives plus Justice Stevens 66 and Justices Brennan Marshall Blackmun and Powell all over 75 The Democrats fearing that Mr Reagan will leave behind a young conservative Court that will sustain his policies long after hes gone are complaining that these appointments are clearly political But as Associate Prof David M OBrien of the University of Virginia notes in an excellent new book on the Supreme Court Storm Center the reality is that every appointment to the Court is political Justice Rehnquist left no doubt on this point in a speech he made at the University of Minnesota just before the Presidential election of 1984 There is no reason he said that a President should not appoint people to the Court who are sympathetic to his political and philosophical principles and nothing really to worry about The institution [ of the Court ]  he observed is so structured that a brand new Presidential appointee perhaps feeling himself strongly loyal to the President who appointed him and looking for colleagues of a similar mind on the Court is immediately beset with the institutional pressures    He identifies more and more strongly with the new institution of which he has become a member and he learns how much store is set by his behaving independently of his colleagues On such delicate constitutional questions as abortion prayer in the schools and desegregation of the schools Justice Rehnquist has been the most outspoken advocate of conservative policies He has managed to take these positions without personal animosity among his colleagues and is a great favorite with his clerks whom he allows to make the first draft of his opinions Also he has backed Chief Justice Burger in the effort to establish a national court of appeals to ease the case load and work load of the Court And while he is less interested in the administrative duties of the Court than Chief Justice Burger he indicated today that he could put up with them There is perhaps one surprise in the appointment of Judge Scalia While it is agreed here that he is articulate and personable it was thought that Robert Bork a former Yale University law professor who is also on the US Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit had a more brilliant career and having been passed over once despite the recommendation of the conservative wing of the Republican Party would this time be chosen Judge Bork wrote Senator Barry Goldwater of Arizona to President Ford is young and is a strict constructionist and would give continuity to the kind of Court that you want for at least 25 years Mr Ford however refused and so did Mr Reagan Judge Scalia a Roman Catholic who would be the first Justice on the Court of Italian descent is thought to be a more reliable conservative perhaps halfway between Justices Rehnquist and OConnor But in any event the longanticipated switch in the balance of power on the Court though not assured by these moves is undoubtedly on its way
"BURGER RETIRING, REHNQUIST NAMED CHIEF; SCALIA, APPEALS JUDGE, CHOSEN FOR COURT",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/burger-retiring-rehnquist-named-chief-scalia-appeals-judge-chosen-for-court.html,President Reagan today announced the retirement of Warren Earl Burger as Chief Justice of the United States after 17 years and the intention to nominate Associate Justice William Hubbs Rehnquist to replace him Mr Reagan also announced that upon Justice Rehnquists confirmation as Chief Justice by the Senate he would nominate Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to the Supreme Court Republican leaders of the Senate praised the selection of Justice Rehnquist but some Democrats expressed doubts about his record Lawmakers from both parties said Judge Scalias reputation as a legal scholar was likely to dissolve opposition to his nomination and many said the selections would shift the balance of the Court perceptibly to the right [ Page A32 ] A Decisive Move With the announcement today Mr Reagan moved decisively to insure that on the central issues of his social agenda  civil rights abortion and the constitutionality of independent Federal agencies  the Supreme Court would include a forceful number of Justices supporting the President White House officials insisted that there was no litmus test for selecting Judge Scalia and that he was not subject to any specific screening for opinions on school prayer abortion or other issues But officials who studied the records of the potential nominees to the Court were well aware that Judge Scalia was a deeply conservative thinker whose views on major issues were quite compatible with the Administrations policy agenda An Unexpected Activism Chief Justice Burgers years heading the Supreme Court were marked by an unexpected activism even in areas such as civil rights and criminal law Mr Burger was appointed by President Nixon in 1969 in an effort to seek judicial restraint in the Courts decisions Chief Justice Burger said he was retiring to devote his time entirely to organizing ceremonies for the 200th anniversary of the Constitution in 1987 Chief Justice Burger 78 years old who is chairman of the Commission on the Bicentennial of the United States Constitution denied he was leaving the Court because of poor health or weariness with the job I wasnt weary of being Chief Justice he said with a grin Its a lot of fun Asked if he was leaving for reasons of health Justice Burger said You make the diagnosis Do I look as though Im falling apart I never felt better in my life White House and Administration officials said today that Chief Justice Burger at a private White House meeting three weeks ago told the President unequivocally that he wanted to retire Mr Reagan who made the announcement at 2 PM today at the White House before a national television audience said Judge Scalia was noted for his intellectual power the lucidity of his opinions and the respect he enjoys among his colleagues His great personal energy the force of his intellect and the depth of his understanding of our constitutional jurisprudence uniquely qualify him for elevation to our highest court said Mr Reagan who stood in the White House beside Chief Justice Burger Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia White House officials said they expect no substantive opposition to Judge Scalia in the Senate where a majority vote is required for his confirmation He would be the first American of Italian descent to serve as a Justice the Supreme Court said and at 50 he is younger that any sitting Justice Quick Hearings Promised Senator Strom Thurmond the South Carolina Republican who heads the Senate Judiciary Committee which has jurisdiction over the nominations promised to hold hearings quickly I expect no problem in having either of the Presidents nominations confirmed he said Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d who was involved in the selection process said the President had adhered to three basic criteria in nominating Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia One is intellectual and lawyerly capability he said secondly integrity and thirdly a commitment to the interpretation of the law rather than being a lawmaker A senior Administration official also involved in the selection process said the nominations will have enormous influence on the direction of the Court for many years Republican leaders of the Senate praised Mr Reagans selection of Justice Rehnquist who was named to the Supreme Court in 1971 by President Nixon and has long been the Courts most conservative member Democrats vowed however to examine his record carefully before deciding whether to endorse his nomination as Chief Justice The views of Judge Scalia are not widely known He has criticized the Supreme Courts approval of affirmative action plans that include racial preferences hinted at disagreement with the Courts broad rulings limiting libel suits questioned the constitutional basis for the independence from the President of such agencies as the Federal Reserve Board and is said to be personally opposed to abortion Departure Is Set for July 10 The effective date of Chief Justice Burgers departure is July 10 when the Court expects to finish work on its current term although he said he would stay longer if needed A spokesman for the Court said Mr Burger would draw his full annual salary of 108400 in retirement Mr Reagan said Chief Justice Burger informed him three weeks ago of his desire to leave the Court to devote full time to the commission Chief Justice Burger said today It is vastly underfinanced and were going to have the devils own time in trying to do the kind of a job that ought to be done for this great event White House officials said Chief Justice Burgers intention to retire surprised the President and his chief of staff Donald T Regan who quickly established a highlevel committee to find a replacement Chief Justice Burger in his letter of resignation said that his work heading the commission on the Constitution was a fulltime enterprise and was an enormous and challenging task The responsibilities of serving as Chief Justice as well as running the commission were far more than he could handle the Chief Justice indicated Chief Justice Burger in a joking mood was asked by reporters if he would change some of the opinions he had written I wish some of them were a little shorter he said Justice Renhquist asked if the nomination to replace Chief Justice Burger was the culmination of a dream said I wouldnt call it the culmination of a dream but its not every day when youre 61 years old that you get a chance to have a new job Chief Justice Burger said That strikes me as a perfect parallel Bill Rehnquist is the same age as I was when I was nominated back in the Garfield Administration I think it was The two Justices and Judge Scalia broke into laughter

the next few years the Supreme Court will probably face a series of momentous cases dealing with civil rights abortion churchstate relations and the constitutionality of independent Federal agencies according to lawyers who follow the Court The Courts agenda became the object of increased attention today as President Reagan announced that Warren E Burger was retiring after 17 years as Chief Justice of the United States Mr Reagan said he would nominate William H Rehnquist to be the next Chief Justice and Antonin Scalia to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court Mr Scalia has been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia since 1982 when he was appointed by Mr Reagan Major undecided questions according to lawyers who closely follow the work of the High Court include the legality of various types of affirmative action in employment and education the propriety of state efforts to restrict access to abortion the permissible forms of state support for churchrelated institutions and the legal status of independent Federal agencies such as the Federal Trade Commission In his judicial opinions and essays Judge Scalia has generally insisted on a rigid separation of powers among the branches of Government raising questions about the constitutionality of independent agencies He has indicated that he is receptive to the Justice Department argument that such agencies are an anomaly a headless fourth branch of Government outside the legislative executive and judicial branches explicitly authorized in the Constitution Ruling on Budget Law Judge Scalia was a member of a threejudge panel that struck down a key provision of a new budgetbalancing law in February The court held the law unconstitutional on the ground that it violated the principle requiring separation of powers In a passage widely assumed to have been written by Judge Scalia the panel cast a legal shadow over independent agencies saying It is not as obvious today as it seemed in the 1930s that there can be such things as genuinely independent regulatory agencies The Supreme Court may be asked to consider numerous cases challenging the legal authority of such agencies in the next few years and Reagan Administration officials have encouraged such challenges in some of their public remarks Other issues likely to face the Court include exceptions to the rule that generally bars use of illegally seized evidence in criminal cases Government regulation of electronic communications media such as cable television and the proper balance of power between the Federal Government and the states in regulating economic activity Since 1978 the Supreme Court has enunciated a few general principles about the use of racial preferences designed to overcome the effects of discrimination The Court has approved certain types of affirmative action and disapproved others but its rulings have given rise to conflicting interpretations Yale Kamisar a professor at the University of Michigan Law School said that in terms of its importance to the Administration the abortion issue is in a category by itself and everything else pales into insignificance Ruling on Abortion By a 5to4 vote last week the Supreme Court reaffirmed its landmark 1973 decision establishing a constitutional right to abortion But in coming years lawyers said the Court will undoubtedly be asked to rule on the legality of other state efforts to regulate or restrict access to abortion The Court will also probably be asked again to overrule its 1973 decision in which the vote was 7 to 2 Kenneth S Geller a former Deputy Solicitor General of the United States said the Court would probably also be asked to reconsider the threepart test it has used in determining whether a state or Federal law represents an unconstitutional establishment of religion This test stipulates that to pass muster a law must have a clearly secular legislative purpose must neither advance nor inhibit religion and must avoid excessive government entanglement with religion Experts on the Supreme Court said there would be no difficulty in making the transition envisioned by President Reagan because the Court would by the end of the current term next month issue decisions in virtually all cases that had been briefed and argued There will be few if any cases to carry over to the next term Outlook on Libel Issue On another First Amendment issue the key question is whether the Court will begin cutting back on the protection it has given to news organizations in libel cases In a 1964 case The New York Times Company v Sullivan the High Court ruled that a state could not award damages to a public official for a defamatory falsehood unless he proved that the statement was made with knowledge of its falsity or with reckless disregard of whether it was true or false Judge Scalia has suggested that there is a distressing tendency for political commentators and columnists to descend from discussion of public issues to destruction of private reputations In a 1984 opinion he wrote that the rough treatment of people who entered the public political arena was fulsomely assured by the standards laid down in the 1964 case relating to defamation of public figures
THE SUPREME COURT: A LEGACY AND A LOOK AHEAD; BURGER RESHAPED OFFICE IF NOT LAW HE INHERITED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/supreme-court-legacy-look-ahead-burger-reshaped-office-if-not-law-he-inherited.html,Warren E Burger will be leaving a Supreme Court that in terms of judicial doctrine has not been notably different from the one he inherited 17 years ago when President Nixon named him the 15th Chief Justice of the United States That fact is striking because President Nixon selected the 61yearold Federal appeals court judge to fulfill a campaign pledge to name Justices who were practitioners of judicial restraint and who would turn back the activist tide of the Earl Warren years Seventeen years later no major doctrine of those years has been overruled In many ways the Court under Chief Justice Burger proved to be every bit as activist as the Court that Richard M Nixon campaigned against Endorsement of Busing In the field of civil rights for example it was an opinion by Chief Justice Burger that for the first time endorsed busing as a permissible tool for school desegregation On another subject the Chief Justice joined the 1973 majority that established the constitutional right to abortion although in a dissenting opinion just last week he indicated some doubts about that decision Even in criminal law although the Court did draw back somewhat from some precedents of the Warren era there was no sweeping retrenchment of the sort that had been widely predicted The very symbol of the Warren Court the Miranda decision that required suspects to be informed of their rights before interrogation in police custody survived basically unscathed In fact the Court under Chief Justice Burger remained essentially so faithful to the precedents it inherited that a 1983 collection of essays published under the sponsorship of the Society of American Law Teachers was titled The Burger Court The Counterrevolution That Wasnt Prof Vincent Blasi of Columbia Law School who edited that book wrote that the Court under Chief Justice Burger displayed a rootless activism inspired not by a particular moral vision but rather almost exclusively by discrete pragmatic judgments regarding how a moderate sensible judicial accommodation might help to resolve a potentially divisive public controversy But if Chief Justice Burger did not transform the Court or the law he did transform the office of Chief Justice He liked to say that he took his title seriously He was Chief Justice not of just the Supreme Court but of the United States and he took as his mandate the stewardship of the entire judicial system state as well as Federal He was one of the most active Chief Justices in history second in this century perhaps only to William Howard Taft He used the office as a platform from which to expound views on everything from legal education to prison reform to the administration of justice An array of new institutions was created under his aegis including the National Center for State Courts the Institute for Court Management the National Institute of Corrections and the Federal Judicial Center A Special Aim Is Not Realized But the Chief Justice did not accomplish one of his cherished goals the creation of a new Federal court that would ease the Supreme Courts workload by taking some of its cases He campaigned tirelessly for the new court which he called an intercircuit tribunal but never persuaded Congress such an institution was needed It was an irony of Warren Burgers years as Chief Justice that Supreme Court commentators frequently questioned the degree to which he actually led the Court over which he so energetically presided It was occasionally said of the Chief Justice that the attention he paid outside the Court to judicial administration came at the expense of the actual craft of judging of building and holding coalitions and of shaping doctrine A Chief Justice has only one of nine votes As Chief Justice Mr Burger had the power to assign opinions in which he was in the majority and he gave himself a share of highly visible cases particularly when the Court was united or nearly so But when the Court was closely divided on a case likely to require delicate inhouse diplomacy and sustained effort he often called on Justice William H Rehnquist named today to be the next Chief Justice Impact in Key Legal Areas Nonetheless Chief Justice Burger leaves a personal imprint in several key areas of the law His 1973 opinion on obscenity Miller v California ended some 15 years of legal turmoil by changing the focus of the search for a definition of obscenity from the entire country to local communities applying contemporary community standards He wrote several of the Courts most important cases interpreting the free speech and free press guarantees of the First Amendment These included the 1976 decision that effectively prohibited judges from imposing prepublication restraints to protect criminal defendants from negative pretrial publicity He was also one of the Courts most prolific writers on the constitutional relationship between church and state He wrote the 1971 decision Lemon v Kurtzman that set up the test for determining whether a particular government policy creates an unconstitutional establishment of religion In 1983 he wrote the opinion that permitted the City of Pawtucket RI to display a Nativity scene in the Christmas season But he was in dissent in 1984 when the Court struck down an Alabama law providing for a moment of silent prayer in the public schools Chief Justice Burger made the Court more interesting and accessible to the general public turning a sterile ground floor area into a kind of museum with art displays and changing exhibits But conversely he refused to take part in the morning ritual of announcing the Courts opinions from the bench to the courtroom audience Each of the other eight Justices typically reads a summary of his or her opinion or gives a brief offthecuff explanation of the case But Chief Justice Burger simply announces the name of the case and whether the lower court was affirmed or reversed Asked once why he did not join the practice of his colleagues he said he considered it a waste of time
MORE VIGOR FOR THE RIGHT; COURT WOULD EASE TOWARD CONSERVATIVISM WITHOUT ABRUPTLY CHANGING IN DIRECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/18/us/more-vigor-for-right-court-would-ease-toward-conservativism-without-abruptly.html,The ideological balance of the Supreme Court is likely to shift perceptibly to the right if the Senate confirms President Reagans selections of Justice William H Rehnquist to become Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia to become an Associate Justice But legal experts do not expect these changes alone to produce dramatic reversals of the Courts precedents on major issues Chief Justice Warren E Burger who is retiring is also a conservative although less so than Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia The two selected today are said by most students of their records to be more consistent more energetic and more intellectually formidable advocates of conservative views and of judicial restraint than Chief Justice Burger has been Persuasive Abilities Cited Both are regarded by ideological friends and foes alike as firstrate legal minds who have a clear view of where they want the Court to go and the persuasive powers to influence wavering colleagues in close cases But they may often find themselves outvoted on politically charged issues in which the Courts two consistent liberals Justices William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall are joined by some of the five in the shifting ideological center  Justices Harry A Blackmun John Paul Stevens Lewis F Powell Jr Byron R White and Sandra Day OConnor Conservatives who have been unhappy with some of Chief Justice Burgers votes on major issues including school desegregation through busing abortion affirmative action sex discrimination separation of church and state and press access to court proceedings hope for a more consistent ally in Judge Scalia Judge Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia has for example criticized the Supreme Courts approval of affirmative action plans that include racial preferences embraced an expansive view of Presidential power questioned the constitutional basis for the independence from the President of such agencies as the Federal Reserve Board criticized the Freedom of Information Act and hinted at disagreement with the Courts First Amendment rulings limiting libel suits He has also questioned the basis for the Supreme Courts recognition of a constitutional right to sexual privacy including abortion rights and has joined a ruling that the Constitution does not protect private homosexual acts between consenting adults A Roman Catholic he is said by acquaintances to be personally opposed to abortion But even if Judge Scalia were as a Justice to vote to allow states to restrict or prohibit abortion there would still be five solid votes for broad abortion rights as demonstrated by last weeks decision striking down a Pennsylvania law regulating abortion Role of the Courts More generally Judge Scalia has like Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and other Administration officials criticized the courts for invading the sphere of elected officials and assigning to themselves social judgments that ought better be left to the democratic process A Reagan appointee to the Appeals Court Judge Scalia has said he has an obligation to follow Supreme Court precedents even if he thinks them incorrect He has refrained from criticizing the Courts decisions as overtly as he did in his writings as a University of Chicago law professor While some members of the Court like the Chief Justice Earl Warren have done things that surprised and horrified the Presidents who appointed them this is much less likely in the case of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia whose legal philosophies seem remarkably compatible with Mr Reagans political philosophy They are known quantities having expressed consistent views on a range of political and legal issues over the years both in judicial opinions and in Judge Scalias case in academic writings Professor Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School said today that two issues on which Judge Scalias presence on the Court could make a difference are sex discrimination in which Chief Justice Burger interpreted the Constitution to strike down some state laws as discriminatory and freedom of speech in which Chief Justice Burger has written some opinions applauded by press groups and libertarians Another issue on which Judge Scalia might make a difference is affirmative action on which the Court has been splintered Tipping the Balance If as some experts speculated he were to support the Administrations broad attack on affirmative action plans that grant racial preferences it could tip the balance of the Court in some cases Chief Justice Burger has been something of a swing vote in affirmative action cases expressing concern about broad use of racial preferences but voting to approve such preferences in some cases including a 1980 decision upholding an act of Congress that required a specific percentage of Federal construction grants to be set aside for minorityowned businesses Justice Rehnquist has long been the Courts most conservative member Although Chief Justice Burger has often been aligned with him Mr Tribe and other scholars said Justice Rehnquist was much better equipped to be an intellectual leader As Chief Justice he would still have only one vote in a group that he himself said in 1984 was marked by the extraordinary independence that each Justice has from every other Justice But he would have more power to shape the Courts deliberations and to influence the national legal agenda The Chief Justice presides at the Courts private conferences assigns opinions when he is in the majority administers the Federal judiciary and can command far more attention from the news media and public than any other member of the Court The Chief Justice has a lot of subtle power to push the Court in the direction in which he wants it to go said Kenneth Geller a Washington lawyer who was for years one of the top Supreme Court litigators in the Solicitor Generals Office I think it could make a big difference to have Justice Rehnquist in the job This would not necessarily mean that issues that have gone one way by close votes would start going the other way with Justice Rehnquist as Chief Justice and Judge Scalia on the Court presumably as his ally Stable Voting Pattern The voting pattern should remain stable predicted Burt Neuborne legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union because Chief Justice Burger was aligned with Justice Rehnquist in the great majority of cases He added Burgers tenure demonstrates that merely being Chief Justice isnt enough to make you a leader of the Court Either you have to have a natural ideological majority or you have to have qualities of mind and heart that make you a natural leader Chief Justice Warren who led the Courts liberal majority as it became an engine of change in the 1950s and 1960s had both the ideological majority and leadership qualities other experts said While Justice Rehnquist has the mind and may have the heart he does not yet have enough allies on the Court to have a similar impact Mr Neuborne added that with the retirement of Chief Justice Burger and the addition to the Court of Judge Scalia even if they were absolutely identical in their views youre replacing a 78yearold man who is tired with a 50yearold man who is energetic and very gregarious The Guard Changing At the High Court In the Oval Office a surprise announcement by the Chief Justice three weeks ago set off a highlevel secret search for his replacement Page A32 Two conservatives a polished writer and a forceful scholar are Presidents choices for court posts Men in the News page A31 Momentous cases involving civil rights and abortion are

ORDER OF NUNS DEFIES VATICAN ON MOVE TO OUST 2 DISSENTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/order-of-nuns-defies-vatican-on-move-to-oust-2-dissenters.html,An international order of Roman Catholic nuns said yesterday that it would refuse a Vatican request to dismiss two Americans who signed an advertisement supporting the right to dissent from the churchs teaching on abortion However the leaders of the Romebased order the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur reprimanded the two nuns for what they saw as a lack of respect for the churchs teaching authority for an attitude of intransigence and for taking a stance favoring a womans rights to abortion The nuns Sisters Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey of Charleston WVa are the only two of the four priests and 24 nuns who signed the October 1984 advertisement who have not resolved their cases to the satisfaction of the Vatican The advertisement published in The New York Times said there was a diversity of opinions among Catholics on abortion Its publication stirred an uproar in the church partly because it seemed to some leaders to suggest that there was more than one Catholic teaching on abortion Cardinal Orders a Retraction After the advertisement was published Jerome Cardinal Hamer prefect of the Vaticans Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes directed the signers to retract their statement or face dismissal The other signers have all taken undisclosed steps to heal the breach The 1200word statement from the Notre Dame order was read to both nuns Tuesday in a telephone call from Rome and made public yesterday Sister Elizabeth Bowyer a leader of the 4000nun order acknowledged in a telephone interview from Rome that the statement might be seen by some Catholics as defying the Vatican But she said the order believed that its superior and not the Vatican had the prerogative of deciding whether a member should be dismissed Sister Barbara declined yesterday to answer specific questions about her orders statement saying she had not seen the full text But speaking for herself and Sister Patricia she said We are glad that our congregation has claimed their autonomy as a religious community In its statement the order said that many of the advertisements signers saw it as a call for dialogue about the churchs teaching on abortion and not as a proabortion statement Therefore it said We do not see in this action sufficient cause to initiate a process for dismissal The statement went on to praise the two nuns for their work among poor and sexually abused women in Charleston but it criticized the nuns for their conduct in the controversy We believe Sisters Barbvara and Patricias present position has serious potential for the giving of scandal and continues to reflect an attitude of intransigence rather than dialogue the statement said
POLITICS; ABORTION KNITS RELIGIOUS RIGHT INTO G.O.P. FABRIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/politics-abortion-knits-religious-right-into-gop-fabric.html,Carolyn Thompson chairman of the Pro Life Action Council in Iowa a politically active antiabortion group said it was not too many years ago that Presidential candidates wouldnt even talk to us That is no longer the case at least with Republicans Jack Kemp has spoken to us a number of times Pat Robertson has been out to see us Bob Dole wants to meet with us and Vice President Bush has asked for a meeting Mrs Thompson said Its nice to have the luxury of a whole field of candidates to choose from after all those years of abuse Mrs Thompson a nurse is a former Democrat who finds herself increasingly involved in Republican politics for one reason the abortion issue Since the election of Ronald Reagan as President in 1980 the antiabortion movement which includes people from both parties and independents has forged a strong political identification with the Republican Party a development that is affecting the character of not only the party but also the movement itself Issue Goes Out Into Mainstream Among other things antiabortion leaders say this has moved their struggle from the fringe of national politics into the mainstream of a major political party It has also underscored the importance of keeping a Republican in the White House the antiabortion leaders say because a Republican President is more likely to appoint Federal judges who can be counted on to reverse more than a decade of rulings affirming the right to abortion And that concern was reiterated by developments Tuesday at the Supreme Court when Chief Justice Warren E Burger announced that he would retire Dr John C Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee says the abortion issue has the potential to define the Republican Party in the 1980s in much the same way as the abolitionist movement to end slavery did before the Civil War The abortion issue is clearly moving our way he says Time and momentum are on our side and being identified with a major political party certainly helps our cause Some Fear an Alienation Over It Not all Republicans are comfortable with their partys assimilation of antiabortion activists Public opinion polls show that a substantial majority of people think that abortion is a decision best left to a woman and her doctor and some party strategists fear that the abortion issue could alienate many voters Even so there is no sign that the party is ready to put distance between itself and the antiabortion movement No other single social issue has bonded Republican conservatives as strongly as abortion In recent years it has become the principal source of political energy driving the religious right which is emerging as a significant element of the Republican coalition Last week in Denver where Dr Willkes organization held its annual convention three Republican Presidential hopefuls were on the program Bob Dole of Kansas the Senate majority leader Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York and the Rev Pat Robertson a television evangelist from Virginia Beach Va A fourth Vice President Bush was out of the country and unable to be present but he met with the groups leaders in Washington the week before and sent a message of support as did President Reagan Among Democrats Representative Richard A Gephardt of Missouri is the only 1988 Presidential hopeful whose record on abortion made him acceptable to activists on this issue But Mr Gephardt recently angered antiabortion groups by abandoning his position supporting a proposed constitutional amendment that would bar abortion except when the womans life was in danger Dr Willke said the influx of Protestant Christians into antiabortion ranks is nearing a floodtide and changing the face of the movement In its early stages he noted the movements leadership came mostly from among Roman Catholics a traditional Democratic constituency But as the movement has swollen with evangelicals and fundamentalist Christians antiabortion forces increasingly have woven themselves into the fabric of Republican politics Shift on Impact of Party In the past antiabortion groups have generally supported candidates strictly on the basis of their stand on abortion regardless of party But as they develop their political strategies for coming elections these groups say it is in their interest to strengthen their ties with the Republican Party The outcome of 1986 Senate elections and the 1988 Presidential contest they say will determine which party is to control the appointment and confirmation of Federal judges Some antiabortion organizations are advising their followers that even a vote for a Democrat who opposes abortion could hurt their cause If Democrats regain control of the Senate these groups warn they would control the Senate Judiciary Committee and be in a position to block the judicial nominations for the rest of Mr Reagans term At the news conference Tuesday with Chief Justice Burger Mr Reagan said he intended to nominate Associate Justice William H Rehnquist as the new Chief Justice of the United States and Judge Antonin Scalia of United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to take Mr Rehnquists place on the High Court He Cant Cite Any Decisions Douglas Johnson legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee said he knew of no opinion or writing by Mr Scalia on the abortion issue His exact views on the legal issues of abortion remain to be seen he added But some legal scholars familiar with the views of Mr Scalia a Roman Catholic say he is be personally opposed to abortion and feels that the Supreme Courts 1973 landmark decision in Roe v Wade the 7to2 ruling establishing a womans constitutional right to an abortion went too far Last week the Justices divided 5 to 4 in striking down a Pennsylvania law in a decision that further restricted the ability of states to regulate abortions In his dissent Chief Justice Burger called for a review of the Roe decision raising hopes among antiabortion activists that the Court could be moving toward a reversal As important as the Supreme Court is the National Right to Life Committees political literature urges its followers not to overlook the importance of Federal judges at the district and appeals level to their cause It is these courts that have time and time again struck down the state abortion regulations and only a small percentage of their decisions are ever reviewed by the Supreme Court the committee says in a booklet entitled Call to Conscience Furthermore it adds these lower courts will be crucial to the interpretation of protective state legislation passed once Roe v Wade is overturned Dr Willke says that if the Supreme Court reverses its 1973 decision The issue will go back to the states and remember that only a third of the states had legalized abortion before the Roe decision When that happens were going to fight in every state legislature and we have found them to be far more responsive to the will of the people
"IN HIS OWN WORDS: ANTONIN SCALIA ON ABORTION, BIAS AND LIBEL",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/in-his-own-words-antonin-scalia-on-abortion-bias-and-libel.html,In the abortion situation for example what right exists  the right of the woman who wants an abortion to have one or the right of the unborn child not to be aborted In the past that was considered to be a societal decision that would be made through the democratic process But now the courts have shown themselves willing to make that decision for us That is the major objection most people have with the direction the courts are now taking and it is the major reason why some people speak of an imperial judiciary The courts expansion stems in part from their function of deciding what are constitutional rights Much of their activity is in that area and I think they have gone too far They have found rights where society never believed they existed The Courts have enforced other rights socalled on which there is no societal agreement from the abortion cases at one extreme to school dress codes and things of that sort There is no national consensus about those things and there never has been The courts have no business being there That is one of the problems they are calling rights things which we do not all agree on  From a debate Dec 12 1978 at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington I have grave doubts about the wisdom of where we are going in affirmative action and in equal protection generally It seems to be the fact that the decisions of each of the Justices on the Court are tied together by threads of social preference and predisposition The chaos in which we find ourselves is wellenough exemplified by Bakke itself Four of the Justices tell us that both the Constitution and Title VI permit racial preference four of the Justices tell us that whatever the Constitution may permit Title VI forbids it And the law of the land pronounced by the one remaining Justice apparently is that title VI is no different from the Constitution governmental racial distinctions of any sort are odious to a free people and their validity inherently suspect they must pass the most exacting judicial examination and can only be justified by a compelling state interest We later learn that the compelling interest at issue in Bakke is the enormously important goal of assuring that in medical school  where we are dealing with students in an age range of 22 to 28 or in Bakkes case 33 to 39  we will expose these impressionable youngsters to a great diversity of people We want them to work and play with pianists maybe flute players We want people from the country from the city We want bespectacled chess champions and football players And oh yes we may want some racial minorities too If that is all it takes to overcome the presumption against discrimination by race we have witnessed an historic trivialization of the Constitution Justice Powells opinion which we must work with as the law of the land is thoroughly unconvincing as an honest hardminded reasoned analysis of an important provision of the Constitution Another example of pretense or selfdelusion The Department of Labor regulations concerning goals for hiring to overcome underutilization read as follows The purpose of a contractors establishment and use of goals is to insure that he meets his affirmative action obligation It is not intended and should not be used to discriminate against any applicant or employee because of race color religion sex or national origin This is quite literally incredible Once there is established a numerical figure the failure to meet it will have material adverse consequences namely the substantial risk of cutoff of Government contracts and the substantial certainty of disruptive and expensive Government investigations All that we know about human nature and human motivations indicates quite clearly that discrimination often will be produced in an effort to meet or exceed the magic number I am a businessman who has let us say six more jobs to fill and I am three short of my minority goal Reaching the goal will render my Government contracts secure and will save thousands of dollars in the expenses necessary to comply with the demands of an equal employment investigation If I consult my selfinterest which people tend to do I will hire three minority applicants even if they are somewhat less qualified than others When the results that are inevitable are compared with the results that are said to be intended one must conclude that the drafter of the regulation is either fooling us or fooling himself My father came to this country when he was a teenager Not only had he never profited from the sweat of any black mans brow I dont think he had ever seen a black man There are of course many white ethnic groups that came to this country in great numbers relatively late in its history  Italians Jews Poles who not only took no part in and derived no profit from the major historic suppression of the currently acknowledged minority groups but were in fact themselves the object of discrimination by the dominant AngloSaxon majority To be sure in relatively recent years some or all of these groups have been the beneficiaries of discrimination against blacks or have themselves practiced discrimination but to compare their racial debt  I must use that term since the concept of restorative justice implies it there is no creditor without a debtor  with that of those who plied the slave trade and who maintained a formal caste system for many years thereafter is to confuse a mountain with a molehill Yet curiously enough we find that in the system of restorative justice established by the Wisdoms and the Powells and the Whites it is precisely these groups that do most of the restoring It is they who to a disproportionate degree are the competitors with the urban blacks and Hispanics for jobs housing education But I not only question the principle upon which racial affirmative action is based I even question its effectiveness in achieving the desired goal of advancing a particular race When one reads the Bakke case the most striking factual data is the enormous divergence in the average college grades and average test scores of the regular admittees and the special minority admittees of the Davis Medical School Do you suppose the image of minority groups has been improved by this I suggest that to the contrary the very ability of minority group members to distinguish themselves and their race has been dreadfully impaired To put the issue to you in its starkest form If you must select your brain surgeon from among recent graduates of Davis Medical School and have nothing to go on but their names and pictures would you not be well advised  playing the odds  to eliminate all minority group members The person who was so ignorant as to say a Negro simply cannot become a truly outstanding doctor can now plausibly add and the fact that he obtained a degree from one of the best medical schools in the country doesnt prove a thing I am in short opposed to racial affirmative action for reasons of both principle and practicality Sexbased affirmative action presents somewhat different constitutional issues but it seems to me an equally poor idea for many of the reasons suggested above I do not on the other hand oppose  indeed I strongly favor  what might be called but for the coloration that the term has acquired in the context of its past use affirmative action programs of many types of help for the poor and disadvantaged It may well be that many or even most of thoske benefited by such programs would be members of minority races that the existing programs exclusively favor I would not care if all of them were The unacceptable vice is simply selecting or rejecting them on the basis of their race A person espousing the views I have expressed of course exposes himself to charges of at best insensitivity or at worst bigotry That is one reason these views are not expressed more often particularly in academia Beyond an anticipatory denial I must content myself with the observation that it must be a queer sort of bigotry indeed since it is shared by many intelligent members of the alleged target group Some of the most vocal opposition to racial affirmative action comes from minority group members who have seen the value of their accomplishments debased by the suspicion  no to be frank the reality  of a lower standard for their group in the universities and professions This new racial presumption imposed upon those who have lifted themselves above the effects of old racial presumptions is the most evil fruit of a fundamentally bad seed From racist principles flow racist results  From a 1979 article in Washington University Law Quarterly More plaintiffs should bear in mind that it is a normal human reaction after painstakingly examining and rejecting thirty invalid and almost absurd contentions to reject the thirtyfirst contention as well and make a clean sweep of the matter I have no other explanation for the majoritys affirmance of summary judgment dismissing what seems to me a classic and cooly crafted libel Evans and Novaks disparagement of Ollmans professional reputation The concurrence perceives a modern problem consisting of the freshening stream of libel actions which    may threaten the public and constitutional interest in free and frequently rough discussion and of claims for damages that are quite capable of silencing political commentators forever Perhaps that perception is correct though it is hard to square with the explosion of communications in general and political commentary in particular in this Media Age But then again perhaps those are right who discern a distressing tendency for our political commentary to descend from discussion of public issues to destruction of private reputations who believe that by putting some brake upon that tendency defamation liability under existing standards not only does not impair but fosters the type of discussion the first amendment is most concerned to protect and who view high libel judgments as no more than an accurate reflection of the fastly expanded damage that can be caused by media that are capable of holding individuals up to public obloquy from coast to coast and that reap financial rewards commensurate with that power I do not know the answers to these questions but I do know that it is frightening to think that the existence or nonexistence of a constitutional rule the willfully false disparagement of professional reputation in the context of political commentary cannot be actionable is to depend upon our ongoing personal assessments of such sociological factors And not only is our cloistered capacity to identify modern problems suspect but our ability to provide condign solutions through the rude means of constitutional prohibition is nonexistent What a strange notion that the problem of excessive libel awards should be solved by permitting in political debate intentional destruction of reputation  rather than by placing a legislative limit upon the amount of libel recovery It has not often been thought by the way that the press is among the least effective of legislative lobbyists  From a 1984 dissenting opinion in Ollman v Evans
"SCALIA'S VIEWS, STYLISHLY EXPRESSED, LINE UP WITH REAGAN'S",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/scalia-s-views-stylishly-expressed-line-up-with-reagan-s.html,Judge Antonin Scalia whom President Reagan said Tuesday he will name to the Supreme Court has criticized several major Supreme Court precedents and expressed clear views contrary to existing law on a wide range of contentious issues His writings over the years have advocated positions almost perfectly consistent with the Reagan Administrations conservative legal and political agenda and considerably more so than the judicial opinions of Chief Justice Warren E Burger who is retiring Among the issues on which Judge Scalias conservative views appear to match those of the Administration closely are abortion desegregation through busing preferences for women and members of minority groups the Freedom of Information Act and the need to curb lawsuits and to reduce the role of the courts in making policy While largely unknown to the general public Judge Scalias record both before and after Mr Reagan named him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia in 1982 has been closely studied by Justice Department officials They liked virtually everything they saw and have long listed him as a leading Supreme Court prospect These officials view his planned elevation as a capstone of their efforts  which experts call the most systematic by any Administration in modern history to reverse the course of the Federal judiciary Imperial Judiciary Assailed In opinions articles and debates Judge Scalia has said or strongly suggested among other things that the Supreme Court was wrong to recognize a constitutional right to abortion to approve racial affirmative action to order busing as a desegregation remedy and to strike down all existing death penalty laws in 1972 He has assailed what he calls the imperial judiciary as deciding issues it has no business deciding and as usurping the powers of other branches of Government and of the states He has criticized Congress as ducking political responsibility by writing righteoussounding legislation so vague as to be absolutely meaningless The result he said is that unelected judges are left to determine its real content He has questioned both the constitutional basis for and the policy justification for acts of Congress that insulate more than a dozen independent agencies including the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Reserve Board from Presidential control He is viewed by libel experts as deeply hostile to Supreme Court rulings that he has said have fulsomely assured the protection of the press from libel suits by public officials and public figures In expressing his views Judge Scalia has won a reputation as one of the smartest wittiest and most cogent stylists on the Federal courts using a combination of rigorous logic caustic irony and elegant rhetoric to skewer his opponents This talent which along with an appealing personality made him all the more attractive to conservatives seeking a champion at the Supreme Court is viewed by some critics of his views with a mixture of concern  because it could magnify his impact  and admiration Hes Savagely Subtle Bruce Sanford a Washington lawyer and libel expert said in an interview several months ago that Judge Scalia was viewed by press lawyers as one of the worst judges in the country on First Amendment and libel issues Mr Sanford added however Hes enormously intelligent Ironically he is one of the best writers currently serving on the courts of appeals What that man does with language in opinions is beautiful Hes humorous hes savagely subtle hes absolutely scathing at times and just in reading it you can feel the emotional commitment that he has to his views in the libel area In a 1979 article attacking affirmative action preferences for members of minority groups for example Judge Scalia stressing his own freedom from any notion of inherited racial guilt as the son of an Italian immigrant facetiously suggested that if the nations whites really wanted to repay a racial debt to various groups a more finely tuned system could be devised I have developed a modest proposal which I call RJHS  the Restorative Justice Handicapping System I only have applied it thus far to restorative justice for the Negro since obviously he has been the victim of the most widespread and systematic exploitation in this country but a similar system could be devised for other creditorraces creditorsexes or minority groups Under my system each individual in society would be assigned at birth Restorative Justice Handicapping Points determined on the basis of his or her ancestry Obviously the highest number of points must go to what we may loosely call the Aryans  the Powells the Whites the Stewarts the Burgers and in fact curiously enough the entire composition of the present Supreme Court with the exception of Justice Marshall Justices Would Not Shrink This grouping of North European races obviously played the greatest role in the suppression of the American black But unfortunately what was good enough for Nazi Germany is not good enough for our purposes We must further divide the Aryans into subgroups Noting that the Irish having arrived later probably owe less of a racial debt than the Germans for example he added It will to be sure be difficult drawing precise lines and establishing the correct number of handicapping points but having reviewed the Supreme Courts jurisprudence on abortion I am convinced that our Justices would not shrink from the task Judge Scalia also used a splenetic pen in a 1982 article titled The Freedom of Information Act Has No Clothes in which he assailed the 1974 amendments liberalizing the law which requires Federal agencies to open their files to citizens as a disaster This law he said is the Taj Mahal of the Doctrine of Unanticipated Consequences the Sistine Chapel of CostBenefit Analysis Ignored The amendments he asserted have greatly burdened investigative agencies and the courts adding They were promoted as a boon to the press the public interest group the little guy they have been used most frequently by corporate lawyers Abortion a Societal Decision On abortion Judge Scalia  a Catholic who is said to oppose it said in a 1978 debate In the abortion situation for example what right exists  the right of the woman who wants an abortion to have one or the right of the unborn child not to be aborted In the past that was considered to be a societal decision that would be made through the democratic process he said but now the courts have shown themselves willing to make that decision for us He added The courts have no business being there In his judicial opinions he has not challenged overtly the wisdom of Federal statutes or of Supreme Court precedents which lower court judges are bound to follow The criticial views he expressed as a law professor on the Freedom of Information Act would have nothing to do with my interpretation of it if I were sitting as a judge he said in his 1982 confirmation testimony Nevertheless he has managed to delight conservatives with majority concurring and dissenting opinions that have called for deference to Presidential decisions touching on foreign policy cutting back on access to the courts and holding acountable in libel suits media that are capable of holding individuals up to public obloquy from coast to coast and that reap financial rewards commensurate with that power Activism Can Be Conservative But inevitably Judge Scalia cannot please all of the conservatives all of the time For example some conservatives would like to see the courts go from the present broad protection of abortion rights to the opposite extreme of ruling that the Constitution requires states to ban abortion on the ground that a fetus is a person with a constitutional right to life Judge Scalia has not publicly suggested agreement with this view which would clash with his statements that such issues should be decided by the elected reprsentatives of the people It is more likely say conservatives including Bruce Fein a constitutional expert with the American Enterprise Institute here that he would vote to allow states to prohibit or to allow abortions as they choose While conservative critics of the Supreme Court have often assailed its liberal judicial activism Judge Scalia has recognized that judicial activism is a tool sometimes used by conservatives as well as liberals  both may be tempted to use vague constitutional phrases as a mandate for striking down laws they do not like He is a freemarket advocate who favors economic deregulation as a matter of policy But in a 1985 article he expressed disagreement with conservative scholars who have called for striking down many economic regulations as unconstitutional This issue presents something of a moment of truth for many conservatives who have been criticizing the courts in recent years he said They must decide whether they really believe as they have been saying that the courts are doing too much or whether they are actually nursing only the less principled grievance that the courts have not been doing what they want

"THE REHNQUIST FACTOR; His Supreme Court Opinions Clearly Show An Abiding Conservatism, Past and Present",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/rehnquist-factor-his-supreme-court-opinions-clearly-show-abiding-conservatism.html,William H Rehnquist has spent his 14 years on the Supreme Court at the cutting edge of conservative legal doctrine The Court has not always followed him but it has always had to respond to his strongly held views and distinctive voice On Tuesday President Reagan chose him for Chief Justice As such he would still have only one vote a Chief Justice is first among equals only if an innate ability to lead and persuade makes him a center of gravity in an institution that has been described as nine separate law firms Even with the addition of Antonin Scalia who is likely to be the new Chief Justices strong ideological ally the Courts dominant bloc will continue to be the moderate center that has prevented any dramatic doctrinal change over the 17 years of Warren E Burgers tenure Power to Assign Opinions But in perhaps subtle ways Justice Rehnquists new position is almost certain to enhance his influence in an institution where he already casts a large shadow The Chief Justice has the power to assign opinions in cases in which he is in the majority This is an important power because the Justice who circulates the initial draft of an opinion particularly in a sensitive case on which the Court is closely divided is the one who frames the issue and defines the terms of the debate Chief Justice Burger often called on Justice Rehnquist to play this role and he in turn can be expected to make strategic use of the opinionassigning power In the past Justice Rehnquist has been content to be a dissenter or at least to write a separate opinion if the majority opinion did not precisely embody his views Indications of New Interest But there are recent signs that he may have a growing interest in helping the Court to speak with one voice For example he joined the plurality opinion in a racial discrimination case last month although that opinions guarded endorsement of affirmative action was at variance with his own firmly stated opposition to that approach in other decisions William Rehnquist was a known quantity in 1971 when President Nixon whom he served as an Assistant Attorney General named him to the Court He had testified before Congressional committees 18 times to present the Nixon Administrations views on criminal law and other legal issues Those who followed his career then have rarely been surprised by his positions in the intervening years Nine years ago five years into Justice Rehnquists tenure the Harvard Law Review published a 64page preliminary appraisal by Prof David L Shapiro Its conclusions still appear valid Professor Shapiro analyzed Justice Rehnquists votes in hundreds of cases and concluded that the Justice was guided by these three basic propositions  Conflicts between the individual and the Government should be resolved against the individual  Conflicts between state and Federal authority should be resolved in favor of the states  Questions of the exercise of the jurisdiction of the Federal courts should be resolved against such exercise Among Justice Rehnquists more than 200 majority opinions are several that overturned broad remedial orders issued by lower courts to correct such problems as mistreatment of the institutionalized retarded abuse of civilians by the police in Philadelphia and overcrowding in the Federal prison in Manhattan There is not some sort of oneman onecell principle lurking in the due process clause he wrote in the opinion on prison crowding Curb on Rights of Suspects He has provided the Courts most consistent vote for limiting the rights of criminal suspects and defendants He wrote the 1984 opinion that created the first substantial exception to the Courts 1966 Miranda rule permitting the police to question suspects without the requisite warnings in the interest of public safety He has argued vigorously in opinions and speeches for a speedier conclusion to criminal appeals particularly death sentence appeals The existence of the death penalty in this country is virtually an illusion he wrote five years ago in a dissenting opinion that within a few years came to express the majoritys sentiment One of his strengths as a Supreme Court strategist has been patience a willingness to persist in expressing a minority view Sometimes a majority comes to his side eventually and sometimes it does not but in the process Justice Rehnquist succeeds in shifting the terms of the debate He has dissented from most of the Courts decisions upholding various remedies for racial discrimination from busing to affirmative action The Constitution does not require school boards to follow a policy of integration uber alles  he wrote in dissent in a 1979 case upholding busing in Columbus Ohio His was the only dissenting vote in the 1983 case that upheld the Federal Governments policy denying a Federal tax deduction for Bob Jones University which adhered to racially discriminatory policies Dissent on Abortion Rulings Justice Rehnquist has also been a consistent dissenter from the Courts abortion rulings He has also argued consistently sometimes for a majority and sometimes in dissent that the Constitution does not require a strict separation between church and state He prevailed in 1984 writing the opinion for a 5to4 majority that upheld a Minnesota law providing for tax deductions for parochial school tuition He was the lone dissenter in 1982 from an opinion by Chief Justice Burger holding that Massachusetts could not give churches a veto power over the awarding of nearby liquor licenses The state can constitutionally protect churches from liquor for the same reasons it can protect them from fire he wrote His most detailed expression of views on church and state came a year ago He dissented from the Courts decision that an Alabama law providing for a moment of silence in the public schools was unconstitutional The notion that the Constitution requires a wall of separation between church and state he wrote should be frankly and explicitly abandoned Affinity to Meese View Justice Rehnquist has come closer than anyone else on the Court to endorsing the view of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d that the Constitution should be interpreted in light of the intention of its 18thcentury framers If a constitutional theory has no basis in the history of the amendment it seeks to interpret is difficult to apply and yields unprincipled results I see little use in it he wrote in the Alabama case If Justice Rehnquists words are sometimes sharp they are almost always original He delights in aphorism and metaphor When he invokes American history to make a point it is likely to be a chapter from the history of the American West The Court may well be a more collegial institution under his leadership than it has been under Chief Justice Burger He has good personal relations with his colleagues as well as with Court employees many of whom regarded Chief Justice Burger as aloof and overly concerned with protocol but view Justice Rehnquist as informal and approachable
O'CONNER WAS ALSO REPORTED CONTENDER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/19/us/o-conner-was-also-reported-contender.html,Reagan Administration officials and conservatives close to the White House said today that Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor had been a key contender to replace Warren E Burger as Chief Justice of the United States They said however that she was rejected in favor of William H Rehnquist on the ground that she was relatively new to the Supreme Court Officials also said that Robert H Bork a prominent conservative legal scholar who is a judge of the United States Circuit Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia was seriously considered for the Supreme Court seat that will be vacated by Justice Rehnquist if his nomination is approved by the Senate Age Reported a Factor But Judge Bork was rejected in favor his colleague on the appeals court Judge Antonin Scalia Among the factors that weighed in Judge Scalias favor was his age Judge Scalia is 50 years old while Judge Bork is 59 Another was the political advantages for the Republican Party from President Reagans selecting the first ItalianAmerican to serve on the Court officials said White House officials meanwhile predicted rapid Senate confirmation of Justice Rehnquist as the nations Chief Justice and of Judge Scalia to replace him as Associate Justice Officials said the nominations would be transmitted to the Senate shortly after July 4 and the White House hoped confirmation could take place before a recess scheduled to start on Aug 15 My reading of the reaction on the Hill has been very positive and the measure of support on both sides of the House should bring about a smooth confirmation for both nominees said William L Ball 3d assistant to the President for legislative affairs The Senate Judiciary Committee and then the Senate must endorse the nominees by a majority vote Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina the chairman of the Judiciary Committee said he expected no particular strong opposition to Justice Rehnquist the Courts leading conservative since his appointment by President Nixon in 1971 White House and Congressional aides however expect prolonged and aggressive questioning by Democrats of the two nominees in view of their conservative positions that generally mirror Mr Reagans stance on social and civilliberties issues including abortion affirmative action and criminal procedure In selecting Justice Rehnquist to replace Chief Justice Burger as well as selecting Judge Scalia Mr Reagan has the opportunity to set in motion fundamental and longterm shifts in the Supreme Court that would insure conservative strength and possibly a conservative majority beyond the Reagan term Moreover Mr Reagan may have other prospects of nominating Justices to the Court Two of the most liberal Justices are William J Brennan Jr 80 and Thurgood Marshall 77 3 Involved in the Process The three Administration officials involved in the selection process for the Court Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff and Peter J Wallison the counsel to the President declined to discuss details Administration aides however as well as conservatives close to the White House said that Justice OConnor the first woman appointed to the Supreme Court was a key figure on the list but was rejected in part because she was relatively new to the Court Justice OConnor who is 56 was named to the Court by Mr Reagan in 1981 Mr Reagan had instructed the group to seek candidates among the ranks of sitting Supreme Court Justices and those already on the bench A list of 10 to 15 candidates for Chief Justice were drawn up White House officials said It was unclear if Justice OConnors decisions in a number of cases this year involving school prayer libel and abortion may have rankled the Administration But one conservative source close to the White House said It would be wrong to pick and choose one or two decisions where she may have disagreed and say Aha she wasnt philosophically pure You cannot assume that Instead this source and officials said Justice Rehnquists 14 years on the Supreme Court marking him as a consistent and highly articulate voice of conservative doctrine involving affirmative action tuition tax credits for parochial schools the death penalty abortion and other issues made him Mr Reagans favored choice Rehnquist had many things going for him said one official who cited the 61yearold Justices brilliance his consistency his ability to get along with colleagues In selecting Judge Scalia over Judge Bork Administration officials and others close to the White House cited several factors including age Bork Opinions Cited In addition Judge Bork has a reputation as an accomplished intellectual scholar but some of his opinions may have upset the Administration including one in 1984 in favor of a Marxist professor seeking to sue the syndicated columnists Rowland Evans and Robert Novak for disparaging comments Judge Scalia on the other hand dissented Conservatives close to the Administration and to Mr Meese and others said however that the selection of Judge Scalia was not based merely on ideological grounds or on the judges strong reputation even among liberals Beyond this central fact was that Judge Scalia is the father of nine the son of Catholic immigrants from Sicily and the first ItalianAmerican nominated to the Supreme Court said sources close to the Administration
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/books/books-of-the-times-430686.html,STORM CENTER The Supreme Court in American Politics By David M O Brien Illustrated 384 pages W W Norton 1895 LIKE the centers of real storms the Supreme Court is a tranquil area Despite clashes of ideology and personality and the occasional testy exchange it operates by a set of rituals traditions and customs developed over decades that make it a more orderly and courteous place than its coequal branches of Government Nonetheless as David M OBrien shows in his timely and illuminating analysis from the appointment of Justices to their choice of cases to the phrasing of decisions the High Court is as subject to the political weather as Congress and the executive branch He demonstrates in an undemonstrative way that the power of Americas preeminently antidemocratic and countermajoritarian institution rests upon the approval or acquiescence of the nation Although when we think about politics we tend to focus on the elected branches Alexis de Tocqueville was his usual acute and quotable self when he observed Scarcely any political question arises in the United States that is not resolved sooner or later into a judicial question The Court becomes what Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes called a storm centre when it addresses a passionstirring issue  integration crime abortion affirmative action Storm Center draws its examples mainly from such bubbling issues In reporting on the workings of the Burger Court now in process of giving way to the Rehnquist Court Mr OBrien who teaches at the University of Virginia is much less gossipy but more solid than Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong whose 1979 book The Brethren dwelt largely on the interplay of personality Mr OBrien offers figures demonstrating that although the Burger Court has proved more conservative than the Warren Court it has been even more activist as measured by the number of laws it has overturned It has also been notable for the number of dissents and of special interest the number of decisions by plurality rather than majority Given the fact that the Court is an oligarchy and everything depends on nine lords each of whom is likely to have strong opinions and a forceful personality it would be surprising if personal animosities did not find their way into its proceedings Mr OBrien recalls that Justice James C McReynolds whom he describes as antiSemitic would leave the conference room whenever Justice Louis D Brandeis spoke But Mr OBrien maintains convincingly that extraneous irritations play no great part in the great decisions The Justices are constrained by the forms of courtesy built into the Courts procedures they all shake hands before a conference by the delicacy of its political position and by other institutional and prudential considerations unexpected alliances are formed on touchy issues Mr OBrien is less interested in blowbyblow accounts of battles though he provides several good ones  than in exploring the Courts structure and operations He confirms what has become common knowledge that Justices are often chosen for their seeming ideological affinity to a sitting President only to disappoint their benefactor once installed Everyones favorite example of course is President Dwight D Eisenhowers selection of Chief Justice Earl Warren President Reagans advisers evidently know their history his latest nominations to the Court seem studiously intended to avoid any such surprises Mr OBrien is clear and interesting on the way the Justices apportion their work He reports that law clerks have gained influence in recent years as the workload has increased but finds their influence to be less than readers of The Brethren must have concluded The difference may be connected with the fact that Mr Woodward and Mr Armstrong obtained so much of their information from the clerks Despite the high value that the Court has placed on collegiality since the time of Chief Justice John Marshall and the strong desire for consensus especially on momentous matters major decisions have sometimes been bewilderingly fragmented Lower courts attempting to make sense of a decade of rulings on affirmative action cases for example still have their work cut out Even when the Justices can agree on a contentious issue they often show an awareness of the limits of their powers The most dramatic example came in Brown v Board of Education when a unanimous Court struck down separate but equal schools Even the Justices on high could see that the South was in no mood to implement desegregation and the Court added the phrase with all deliberate speed which everyone understood to mean unspeedy A degree of civil tranquillity was thus purchased by giving the South a prolonged breathing space it would be a decade before the nation was ready for the other branches of Government to produce a civil rights act that put muscle into the 1954 decision Finley Peter Dunnes Mr Dooley was sharp as usual when he noted that th supreme court follows th iliction returns The Court Mr OBrien shows has no stomach for taking on the whole country It tends to choose its arena and its moment judiciously and even so has seen its decisions undercut by Congress The tree of precedent has often been shaken by the winds of public opinion Mr OBriens summation is as tempered as the rest of his valuable book Major confrontations in constitutional politics like those over school desegregation school prayer and abortion are determined as much by what is possible in a system of free government and in a pluralistic society as by what the Court says about the meaning of the Constitution
ARCHDIOCESE TRIES MARKET RESEARCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/nyregion/archdiocese-tries-market-research.html,Does your priest talk too much about money Are you happy with his sermons Whats your opinion on the churchs stand on womens issues Is the church providing enough help for working parents drug addicts and the homeless The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York which for generations has offered guidance on a wide array of issues is turning the tables and asking New Yorkers essentially How are we doing With market research help from the accounting concern of Arthur Young  Company and the advertising agency BBDO the archdiocese has prepared a sophisticated questionnaire and distributed it in seven languages to worshipers in its 410 parishes In an effort to seek the opinions of unaffiliated Catholics Protestants and Jews the questionnaire was printed yesterday in New York Citys major daily newspapers as well as in suburban papers and the ethnic press including the Irish Echo Il Progresso El Diario and The New York Amsterdam News The church began to use advertising on a large scale for the first time last year in its Come Home at Christmas campaign which was aimed at alienated Catholics Crateloads of Responses Once the information from the questionnaires is gathered collated and processed it will be used to frame the issues that will be presented before the coming archdiocesan synod The synod which was proposed by John Cardinal OConnor soon after he became Archbishhop of New York two years ago will be held either next year or in 1988 The New York archdiocese  with 18 million Catholics the fourth largest in the nation  is made up of Manhattan Staten Island the Bronx and seven upstate counties Responses were coming in by the crateload yesterday at the synod office at the Catholic Center at 1011 First Avenue at 55th Street I dont know if they are positive or negative said Robert Dunne one of three seminarians sorting through the boxes at the office but it is clear that people have thought out the issues There are 38 questions on the form in such areas as church leadership parish performance family life and Catholic education Some of the questions are geared specifically to Catholics such as those concerning priests the liturgy and the participation of lay people Other questions on international issues interfaith dialogue and help for working parents are for the broader nonCatholic audience Filling in Blank Lines There are also three blank lines on the form so that people can add their own concerns and a series of questions on the demographics  including faith education and age  of the respondent While there are questions about womens issues and church teaching on sexual morality some of the most controversial issues facing the church including the churchs opposition to abortion to birth control and to homosexual behavior are not to be found on the form The questionnaire also does not solicit opinions on the churchs opposition to women serving as priests and its insistence that priests be celibate Neither does it deal with an issue important to many older Catholics namely the revival of the Latin mass We did not want to raise peoples hopes that we could decide at the synod on areas that are already fully defined by the church said the Rev James R Moore who is representing priests on the coordinating committee for the synod These are not under the realm of our Cardinal A synod is a gathering of church officials usually called for the purpose of reviewing church policy Last year Pope John Paul II held a synod to assess the decisions of the Second Vatican Council While Vatican synods are for cardinals bishops and other members of the heirarchy synods on the local level may also include members of religious orders deacons and lay people The last New York synod was held in 1950 by Francis Cardinal Spellman At the time the code of canon law allowed only priests to participate The code was revised in 1983 Deciding on Issues to Study About 250 people will attend the New York synod according to Father Moore who is coordinating the project with Sister Janet Baxendale representing religious orders and Haydee Borges the lay representative The synod members will consider proposals put forward by commissions that will study various issues of church life One of the purposes of the current questionnaire is to decide what issues should be included
A Court Reflecting Its Country,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/20/opinion/a-court-reflecting-its-country.html,How should we remember the Burger Court Probably best as a study in contradictions For 17 years Warren Burger tried to lead the Court away from its prior activism and he succeeded often Yet his Court handed down abortion decisions that made the Warren Court look strictconstructionist Chief Justice Burger wanted to brake the civil rights revolution but he himself refused to abandon affirmative action and gave equal rights for women their first enforcement The 15th Chief Justice lacked the votes to complete his main mission to reduce the influence of court rulings in American life President Nixon who appointed him had the same goal yet three of the four Nixon appointees discovered a constitutional right to choose an abortion A volatile electorate bounded from Nixon to Carter to Reagan while the Burger Court had to speak also with the voices of Roosevelt Eisenhower Kennedy Johnson and Ford The Court splintered more than it polarized reflecting the fractious moods of the electorate In a crisis however the Burger Court could deliver Perhaps its proudest moment came in 1974 when it unanimously ordered Richard Nixon to turn over the White House tape that proved his undoing in Watergate The Chief Justice referred back to John Marshall and Marbury v Madison to tell a recalcitrant President that it is emphatically the province and duty of the judicial department to say what the law is Chief Justice Burger can be believed when he says that was not his toughest case He venerates Presidential power and found it easy to write executive privilege into the Constitution But as a lawandorder justice he found it just as easy to state that even a Presidents privilege must yield to a legitimate grand jury inquiry With a similarly cold eye on institutional order the Chief Justice delivered the opinion that struck down the legislative veto In one of historys major statements on the proper relationship among governments branches he held that Congress could not block Presidential action without passing a proper law At times however this leader was forced to follow The Court spoke through the Chief Justice in the 1971 Swann case upholding busing as a tool for school desegregation but the words were forced upon him by fellow justices In time he and the other Nixon appointees dissented in a school case breaking years of unanimity on civil rights matters Yet as Justice Sandra Day OConnor observed recently the Court had again developed a degree of unanimity on the divisive issue of affirmative action to redress job discrimination The Court rejected Justice Burgers bid to overrule Miranda v Arizona which bars illegally obtained confessions But he had more success with a campaign he brought to the Court to limit the exclusionary rule that suppresses evidence obtained in illegal searches and seizures The Burger Court then should be remembered as much for registering the turbulence of its years as for its impact on them Like the public at large it could not finally reconcile the conflicts of values that so massively now lead contestants to court The Burger Court was not much driven by any single purpose It became a contentious Court for a contentious society
ACCEPTING DIVORCE: THE IRISH FACE A DELICATE VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/21/world/accepting-divorce-the-irish-face-a-delicate-vote.html,With the campaign to introduce a civil right to divorce winding into its final stages the Legion of Mary here in County Tipperary has called for a threehour prayer vigil in the cathedral in order to preserve Ireland as the last European nation that is constitutionally committed to the Roman Catholic ideal of an indissoluble marriage bond Proponents of a proposed constitutional amendment that is to be put to the voters in a referendum next Thursday say it is needed to deal with the spreading problem of marital breakdowns in Ireland which may involve as many as 70000 of an estimated 800000 couples Ireland they say has an increasing number of couples living together in stable unions who want to wed but cannot do so under the law because one of the partners has been in a marriage that failed The argument is easier to make in middleclass areas of Dublin that would like to be seen as cosmopolitan than it is here in the rural heartland 75 miles southwest of Dublin where an unmarried couple living together can still cause a scandal Fine Gael the dominant party in the minority coalition Government in Dublin that called the referendum is finding it harder than usual to get people here to distribute leaflets making the case for the yes vote sought by Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald the party leader Questions For Canvassers Those campaign workers the party has recruited drop the leaflets and move on quickly to the next house one of them said without seeking to engage voters in conversations that might prove embarrassing Andy Callanan a boiler operator who has been going door to door for the Labor Party said he is met with a lot of sullen looks and pointed questions about how he will ever find the nerve to go to mass again Still Mr Callanan added this referendum campaign is proving to be less vicious than the one three years ago that resulted in the passage of a constitutional amendment enshrining the law against abortion Tony OBrien the leader of the opposition Fianna Fail Party in the local council who is doubling as leader of the antidivorce campaign here although his party has avoided taking a stand on the issue acknowledged that this referendum is a totally different matter The people were going to vote against abortion no matter what he said But everyone knows someone who has a marriage problem The recognition of the problem appeared to be widespread eight weeks ago when Mr FitzGerald called the referendum in fulfillment of a longstanding pledge by his party At the start of the campaign a poll indicated that Fine Gael had the support of only 26 percent of the voters but 57 percent of those surveyed seemed to feel that the time had come for change on divorce Margin of Support Narrows Later polls still showed that supporters of change on divorce had the edge but the margin narrowed and the number of voters who said they were undecided on the issue rose sharply as the antidivorce campaign advanced counterarguments Mr FitzGerald and other advocates of divorce change had been prepared to defend the amendment against an attack on religious and moral grounds by the Roman Catholic bishops But they seemed to be thrown on the defensive when the antidivorce groups met them on their own secular ground with arguments about property inheritance rights and the status of women The bishops underscored the teachings of the church but avoided stark polemics in their joint statements The strongest condemnation from an ecclesiastical source came from Archbishop Kevin McNamara of Dublin an outspoken conservative who compared the effects of divorce on society to the radioactivity spread by the Chernobyl nuclear reactor This was balanced by the spokesman for the Catholic hierarchy Bishop Joseph Cassidy of Clonfert who said a Catholic could vote yes on the amendment after prayer and reflection without incurring moral fault Divorces Money Issues The arguments that seem to be chipping away at support for the amendment focus on injustices that might occur if divorced wives and the children of a first marriage lost the family home pension or other inheritance rights in a property settlement at the time of divorce Behind this lurks a debate on whether Ireland would or should become more like other Western societies as a result of the introduction of divorce Opponents of the measure have been citing statistics on family breakdown in Britain and the United States to support their case that stable marriages would be subtly undermined One antidivorce leaflet asserts that 93 percent of all divorced women in the United States end up below the poverty line The American Embassy apparently trying to avoid being drawn into the campaign sidestepped the question when asked whether this was so Mr FitzGerald has complained bitterly that the antidivorce campaign has been misrepresenting both the status quo in Ireland and the likely effects of his amendment At present he says abandoned wives have no property rights and the Government is forced to spend 35 million a year to maintain them The amendment he says would secure rights never previously recognized Strict Limits Set He also says the amendment offers divorce on a highly restrictive basis requiring proof that a marriage has failed for five years The Government promises to introduce further legislation stiffening that constitutional requirement by requiring a legal separation lasting two years before a divorce could be granted Still a brochure circulated by the AntiDivorce Campaign a singleissue group contends that divorce in Ireland would be less restrictive than anywhere else in the world Speaking in the lower house of Parliament Mary Harney a liberal member said Irish hypocrisy on various issues involving the family was being exposed in the campaign Divorce is not new in Ireland said Miss Harney a leader of a new party called the Progressive Democrats We have divorce Irish style We have people living in marriages who do not speak to each other for many years The Problems of Partition The liberal appeal also involves an argument that divorce is a necessary step toward an eventual resolution of the problems presented by Irelands partition Northern Irelands Protestants have to be shown it is argued that the Catholic majority here is prepared to live in a secular pluralistic society The contentions that Ireland needs to change or that something needs to be done to assuage the fears of Protestants tend to inspire a Catholic backlash however and have not been pressed in the campaign Certainly the liberal appeal is not often helpful here in County Tipperary where the amendment banning abortion was backed by an overwhelming 8to1 margin three years ago Mr Callanans Labor Party the junior partner in the governing coalition has made compassion for broken families its campaign theme Mr Callanan said he could sense that he was struggling against the current after doing some doorbell ringing in a middleclass section of Thurles this afternoon A teacher a nurse and a university student  the sort of people he felt the campaign should be attracting  had given him responses ranging from wary to hostile In an area like this we should be clicking he said edgily as he rang Sheila Craddocks bell Betwixt and Between You devil you Mrs Craddock said laughing when she realized she was being asked to vote yes on divorce Initially she said she thought she would support the amendment but now she was betwixt and between Its too late for this lot she said meaning her generation but it might matter to the next one Ive got seven of them myself five of them daughters I hate to think of them being knocked around in a few years time With one Sunday to go in the campaign supporters of the amendment are waiting nervously to see whether the church will make a final effort to solidify opposition to the amendment One possibility would be to read out a statement made by Pope John Paul II in Limerick during his visit to Ireland in 1979 May Ireland always continue to give witness before the modern world the Pope said to her traditional commitment corresponding to the true dignity of man to the sanctity and indissolubility of the marriage bond
SPAIN'S NEW FACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/magazine/spain-s-new-face.html,ASALSA BAND LED by two barebellied young women and a balding singer wearing a bow tie had been working up the crowd Across the top of the green and white outdoor stage an election banner read Por Buen Camino On the Good Road Then someone on the top tier of the grandstands saw him and a thundering chant of Felipe Felipe spread Felipe Gonzalez Marquez Prime Minister of Spain stepped before the crowd in Valencia He blushed as the cheering swept over him AFTER NEARLY FOUR YEARS IN office Felipe Gonzalez has emerged as one of Europes brightest political stars While the rest of the Continent is dominated by older leaders such as Helmut Kohl in West Germany or Margaret Thatcher in Britain the handsome boyishlooking Gonzalez draws throngs of cameramen and squealing teenage fans when he visits foreign capitals His forceful forwardlooking visions for Spain and a politically integrated Europe have made him a prized guest and speaker abroad European Socialists are on the defensive but he stands out as a proud exception Latinizing the European left as he puts it Fortyfour years old Gonzalez is running for his second term as Prime Minister in elections scheduled for today Even his principal opponents Manuel Fraga Iribarne of the centerright Popular Alliance and former Prime Minister Adolfo Suarez of the moderate Social Democratic Center  say that barring any unforeseen lastminute events the question is not whether he will win but by how much The elections thus seem to matter less than the attention they have focused on the country and its leadership What lies behind the dynamism of Gonzalez and a whole new generation of Spanish political figures is a new Spain itself The nation which next month will observe the 50th anniversary of the start of the Spanish Civil War has over the last decade undergone a quiet but dramatic revolution The arts are flourishing The famed senoritos the idle sons of the Spanish rich have become young professionals with rolledup shirt sleeves and the sons of bluecollar workers are getting college degrees The countrys young democracy is being held up as an example to other countries still laboring under dictatorships Gonzalez has moved aggressively to restore Spains identity and importance as a part of the West Spain in the last six months has joined the European Community and voted to stay in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization In Latin America Gonzalez has worked to reassert Spanish influence and has clashed with both the Reagan Administration and the Sandinistas over politics in Nicaragua Gonzalez himself is a Latin paradox Despite his charismatic hold on the nation he is little known beyond his public persona A modern television politician he tries to avoid facetoface campaigning Yet he relishes parliamentary debate And while his party has suffered some in opinion polls Gonzalezs own ratings have remained steadily high He has abandoned the ideology of the old Spanish left and replaced it with large doses of pragmatism and moderation What socialism and even the left has often represented in the south of Europe he said in a recent interview was this curious idea of permanently inventing the future while allowing the right to permanently govern the present We have broken that dynamic a little What were dealing with here is not inventing the future Were dealing with governing the present and transforming it with a practical vision of a freer more equal more just society HE MAYOR OF VAlencia a professorial looking Socialist with hornrimmed glasses was the first to rise Welcome to a free city to a European city to a democratic city he said proudly The Socialist president of the Valencian regional government spoke next in Catalan the old language of Valencia that was banned by Franco but is now taught in the schools Finally it was Gonzalezs turn He strode to the podium ran his fingers through his thick dark hair and then surprised everyone We have made errors he began We know you understand GONZALEZ COMES OUT OF A political class marked by its youth He was elected Prime Minister when he was 40 years old Today the average age of his Cabinet is barely 45 The same is true of most major opposition leaders In the years before his party came to power Gonzalez made a point of not wearing a tie and though he has outgrown that small act of youthful defiance his normal attire is an offtherack sports jacket He rose to high office in the image of the boy next door  a little fiery but honest idealistic even innocent Despite the gray fanning from his temples and despite the wear of four years in office some of that image remains Gonzalez and his wife Carmen Romero were strolling with this reporter one day recently on the leafy grounds of the Moncloa the Prime Ministers palace The talk turned to last years visit by President and Mrs Reagan The Gonzalezes said they liked the openness of the Americans and as the conversation flowed Gonzalez repeatedly referred to the Reagans as Nancy and Ron pronouncing Ron with a Spanishaccented roll of the tongue He did so without implying familiarity Gonzalez and Reagan despite their different political views have gotten along well in three separate meetings but Gonzalez is often uncharacteristically stiff around Reagan  not least because Reagan is fully 31 years his senior Talking about that awkwardness during our garden stroll Gonzalez seemed to be stepping back and looking upon himself in slight disbelief  disbelief that he was Prime Minister and his wife was first lady that they were on equal footing with the Nancys and Rons of the world Paradoxically Gonzalez has Francisco Franco to thank for much of his success Franco executed many of his political opponents then outlived most of the rest He ruled 36 years before his death in 1975 at the age of 82 The way was then open for a new generation But the challenge faced by Gonzalez and his peers was not simply political They found the need for an extraordinary national renewal involving a shift in the Spanish character itself and a break with 400 years of Spanish illusions The Spanish empire flourished in the 16th century then began a slow rot for the next 400 years European bourgeois values liberal intellectualism and political and religious tolerance were shut out in deference to a medieval code of honor piety and order Spain closed its borders to the Reformation the Enlightenment and even much of the Industrial Revolution Franco was only the last in a long line of leaders who sought to keep Spain Catholic antiCommunist antiliberal and free from all outside influences as he put it Republican politicians the few who came to power were hardly wiser Republican governments pursued their own wild social experiments and intolerances with an equally absolutist conviction It all came to a head in the threeyear Civil War Gonzalez was born March 5 1942 three years after the war in Seville the heart of the romantic Spain of bullfights and flamenco of Moorish castles and whitewashed villages The only one of four children of a dairy farmer to go to college Gonzalez studied law at the University of Seville It was there that he was drawn to the Spanish Socialist Workers Party by a slim bespectacled youth with an acerbic tongue Alfonso Guerra Twentyfive years later Guerra a brilliant organizer remains Gonzalezs alter ego as Deputy Prime Minister and party disciplinarian Gonzalez studied for six months in Belgium then returned to set up practice as a labor lawyer He won a reputation as a vigorous defender of workers as he and Guerra rebuilt their party  illegal activity in those days His dedication to the party was such that in 1969 he missed the civil ceremony of his wedding to Carmen for a meeting of the partys executive committee in Bayonne France By 1974 Gonzalez and his colleagues had wrested control of the Spanish party by winning the backing of the Socialist International and by befriending worldfamous Socialist leaders such as Willy Brandt Helmut Schmidt and Olaf Palme Those men with other European Socialists were looking to head off a Communist takeover in Spain after Franco They were impressed by Mr Gonzalezs moderation courage and organizational abilities He counts them among his mentors Gonzalez was arrested for his political activities in 1974 though he was freed on bail and the case was later dismissed On the night Franco died Gonzalez was in a Madrid apartment with friends A Socialist sympathizer telephoned from Francos hospital with the news Someone joyously proposed a champagne toast but Gonzalez objected I ask please that we dont toast the death of anyone much less a Spaniard one of those there remembers Gonzalez as saying It was indicative of the restraint and leadership that would take him through the heady years of the transition the writing of a new Constitution the election of two centerright governments and finally his landslide victory in 1982 Along the way he led the Socialists in their reconciliation with the monarchy and today Gonzalez enjoys a warm working relationship with King Juan Carlos still a politically influential figure after yielding the powers left him by Franco and supporting the transition to democracy Today the Socialists hold 202 of the 350 seats in the Congress of Deputies They also sit as heads of 11 of the 17 autonomias or regional governments and overwhelmingly dominate the local boards in the countrys cities and towns The oncemighty Spanish Communist Party now holds only four seats in the Congress down from 23 in 1979 Though the Communists under Santiago Carrillo one of the few civil war veterans in politics adopted a mild form of Eurocommunism Spaniards were as fearful of the extreme left as of a rightwing backlash Internal divisions further weakened the party Carrillo was finally replaced by a 40yearold former coal miner Gerardo Iglesias A centerright coalition the Popular Alliance has 106 seats under the leadership of Manuel Fraga Iribarne whose former post as a Franco minister limits his appeal The far right no longer controls any seats The remaining parliamentary seats are divided among regional parties particularly Basque and Catalan and small centrist factions In addition to being the largest and most united party the Socialists under Gonzalez have been able to capture the center at a time that the electorate has been steadily moving that way on its own This move to the center by ordinary Spaniards rejecting extreme options on either right or left has given Spanish democracy a new sense of stability In todays election parties of the far left supported by disenchanted leftwing Socialists are expected to pick up several seats Parties with regional appeal such as the Cataloniabased Democratic Reform Party of Miguel Roca Junyent may also pick up support But the biggest challenge to Gonzalezs singleparty majority will be the candidacy of Adolfo Suarez who is fondly remembered as the first elected Prime Minister of the postFranco era Handsome and debonaire Suarez is another member of the Gonzalez generation According to polls he could pick up enough seats to wield important influence But he is unlikely to pose a direct threat to Gonzalezs hold on power W HY IS IT THAT SPAIN never lived in peace and progress Gonzalez asked the crowd Why did the few steps forward end in ruin He was rolling at full strength now sermonizing with Jesuitlike fervor and didacticism Never had we been able to accommodate impatience with intolerance he said referring to Spains pattern of conflict between leftist zealots and rightist reactionaries We are breaking the cycle for the first time We have begun a project of progress he said but then his finger shot into the air With realism With realism REALISM HAS BECOME A GONZALEZ trademark  for better and for worse One recent day at the Prime Ministers palace for instance a meeting with the board of a state company was going pleasantly when the union man on the board raised a longstanding request to improve pension benefits Gonzalez answered that he wished workers would ask for less and work more Even the businessmen in the meeting were taken aback It was an example of Gonzalezs willingness to oppose even his supporters for what he sees as the greater good It was also an example of what his critics call Gonzalezs decaffeinated socialism and creeping arrogance At the heart of the wrangling is the economy Since taking office Gonzalez has enforced austerity in an effort to overhaul an overprotected and inefficient economy He has cut inflation from 14 percent to around 8 percent and has slowed the ballooning national budget Failing enterprises including banks shipyards and steel mills have been shut down bought out or merged Such hardnosed policy together with Spains recent entry into the Common Market has sent stocks soaring and foreign investors have arrived in strength Japanese diplomats say their country has made Spain its No 1 investment target in Europe But the effect on many areas of Spains economy has been traumatic leaving nearly 3 million Spaniards or 22 percent of the work force unemployed Labor business and political leaders generally agree that the austerity measures were needed We have undertaken an economic policy to make business healthy so that it can begin to hire workers again Gonzalez explained to a rally in Murcia You have to create wealth to share it But this was certainly a curious form of socialism The fact is that Gonzalez abandoned doctrinaire socialism long ago In 1979 he even resigned as party secretary general and returned to his post only after the Socialists had deleted Marxism from their platform The architect of the Gonzalez policies was not the Prime Minister himself  his grasp of economics is only fair  but a former minister of the economy Miguel Boyer a man who is now associated both with Gonzalezs greatest successes and his most embarrassing failures Gonzalez deeply admired Boyer a brilliant economist but Boyer resigned last summer less than 24 hours before Gonzalez was scheduled to announce a Cabinet reshuffle The changes were made largely to please Boyer but Boyer wanted also to become a deputy prime minister When Guerra and Gonzalez balked Boyer quit creating a Government crisis Gonzalezs announcement of the Cabinet changes at a press conference in Madrid was probably the worst performance of his political career as he fumbled for words and contradicted himself It isnt necessary to dramatize things he said The Government is going to continue acting as it has until now though if I said I werent worried I wouldnt be telling the truth I assume my obligations resolutely despite the incidents along the way For the next several months Gonzalez showed he could be morose and sullen He used the old Franco yacht the Azor for a holiday cruise a political blunder that added to criticism that he had turned rightward and grown to relish the trappings of power He argued that the yacht was state property not Francos But even his advisers were dismayed when in a show of contrariness he took the yacht out a second time He grew thinskinned about criticism When a television interviewer asked about his changed hair style a more modish cut he quickly ruffled his hair and denied any change By winter Gonzalez seemed back to his old self and has since appeared to edge leftward in several policy decisions increasing Government spending and raising pension benefits for many workers However the charges of arrogance have lingered and grown The Socialists wrote Pedro J Ramirez editor of the centrist newspaper Diario 16 are enamored of carpets protocol armored cars secretaries bodyguards trips abroad pictures in the newspaper and contact with whomever can show some measure of fame The greatest frictions have arisen in Gonzalezs relations with his union supporters  a symptom perhaps of his ideological drifting The problem has been revealed most clearly in a continuing dispute over Spains labor laws which provide workers with some of the strongest rights in any European country Employers groups estimate that it costs 25000 in required compensations to lay off an average Spanish worker The result is that companies are afraid to discharge hire or expand But given the high unemployment the Socialist unions have refused to budge on the laws except to allow some more temporary hiring Gonzalez upholding his pragmatic mostly freemarket model openly warns that the days of government protection are over and that with Spains entry into the European Community businesses must either compete or fail With their own rightwing parties out of power businessmen have had no choice but to go along But Gonzalez has been unable to convince his leftwing supporters to accept his approach leaving him frustrated and willing in an interview to accuse many union men of Francoist corporatist tendencies It is not possible to be sectarian and at the same time try to make the productive apparatus work he said Listen you can be Socialist but not stupid I am not a Socialist to share out misery I am a Socialist to carry out justice Gonzalezs pragmatism also extends to social and legal issues on which he has pursued reform slowly in order to avoid risking a conservative backlash Although he faced strong pressure within his party to legalize all forms of abortion for instance Gonzalez who ceased being a practicing Roman Catholic years ago allowed abortion to be legalized only for cases involving rape a malformed fetus or danger to the mother He has shown similar moderation in reorganizing the schools the police the judiciary and the military and in dealing with Basque separatist terrorists Gonzalezs decisions on such issues are influenced by the frequent private opinion polls he commissions and scrutinizes But for all his analyzing Gonzalez in the end relies on instinct His most important strategic decision  rejecting Marxism and moving his party toward the center  has been based on visceral judgments rather than cool calculation I DONT WANT TO BE PRESIdent of a Spain in second place he said I want Spain to be the first in Europe and in the West Whos going to integrate Spain into Europe Gonzalez asked the crowd Felipe they shouted back THE ENTHUSIASM AND ENERGY that Gonzalez and the Socialists have brought to Spanish Government and culture has captivated the rest of Europe bringing Spain closer to its Continental neighbors than at any time in recent memory European art collectors have been flocking to Spain to buy new painting and sculpture Spanish films have been winning Academy Awards and Cannes prizes Spanish fashion designers are beginning to show their work in Paris and Milan El Pais a daily started after Francos death is compared to Le Monde and other major international newspapers In part the cultural boom is a result of deliberate policy Museums have been made free for Spaniards and the Prado museum long venerable but tatty has undergone a major facelift The education budget has nearly doubled and new emphasis has been given to improving Spains generally poor universities But behind the cultural explosion and Gonzalezs own rise  there is also an important social phenomenon Spain has finally become a middleclass country It began in the 1950s under Franco Spaniards went to work as migrants in Northern Europe and European tourists came in such numbers that today Spain receives more tourists than any country in the world according to United Nations statistics Both movements brought money and ideas to Spain At the same time the economy took off tripling per capita income in the last 30 years Young people burgeoning with ambition have poured from the provinces into the cities In 1955 46 percent of the countrys workers were fishermen and farmers Today twothirds of those have abandoned the farm and the sea Spain has done in 30 years what most of the rest of Europe did in 130 years and the momentum is still pushing it forward Therein lies the source of much of Gonzalezs success The new middle class is the Gonzalez generation and it shares with him middleclass values and a vision of a modern and moderate Spain It is a vision that led Spain into the Common Market To Spaniards the Common Market is much more than tomatoes or rolled steel What has been decided upon is Spains great political decision to participate in a common West European destiny Gonzalez said in an interview Joining the Common Market he added was a priceless opportunity to modernize to catch the train of history For Gonzalez it is also the starting point for a new and active Spanish foreign policy Last month for example Gonzalez went to Moscow What transpired there was by international protocol extraordinary Gonzalez and the Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev were secluded together for nearly five hours each accompanied by only one aide Gonzalez is hardly an admirer of the Soviet Union In a lively luncheon with President Reagan in the Moncloa the two leaders swapped jokes Gonzalez told one about Karl Marx returning from the dead and saying over Soviet television Workers of the world  forgive me Now under Gonzalezs guidance Spain has confirmed its place in NATO The NATO referendum was the biggest hurdle of his administration Spain joined the North Atlantic Treaty Organization in 1982 but upon taking office Gonzalez halted the process of military integration promising the referendum He was leery of NATO then but in a major turnaround admitted to a change of mind and campaigned hard in favor of Spanish membership in the alliance In the referendum he risked his political career  suggesting at one point that he might resign if he lost Defying all polls Gonzalez won the referendum by the surprisingly large margin of nearly 53 percent to 40 percent He won by the dint of a disclipined party and his own popularity Spain had decided once and for all to throw in its lot with the West ending a Spanish inTellectUal fantasy that the countrys ties to the Arab world and Latin America made it somehow different But the victory was not unqualified To win over doubters Gonzalez the posibilista added three conditions to Spains NATO membership The first is that nuclear weapons will remain banned in Spain The second is that although Spain will participate in NATO military planning its forces will not be subject to direct NATO military command a bow to residual isolationist sentiments The third is that Gonzalez will work to reduce the number of American troops 12500 already authorized in Spain under a separate bilateral treaty Behind the third condition is antiAmericanism Its understandable Gonzalez said matteroffactly The Americans backed Franco Gonzalez argues that visceral antiAmericanism is outdated and also that the treaty allowing American bases in Spain is obsolete now that Spain is in NATO The treaty which dates back to 1953 and the cold war is being renegotiated and the Reagan Administration has been grudgingly amenable to Spanish demands The negotiations are an example of Gonzalezs independence American warplanes flying from bases in Britain to bomb Libya in April flew around Spain because of Gonzalezs reticence about allowing them to enter Spanish airspace He never said no but after Lieut Gen Vernon A Walters the American delegate to the United Nations felt out Gonzalez in vague terms during a secret meeting in Madrid the Americans never directly raised the issue The likelihood of explosive antiAmerican demonstrations was clear to both men according to Spanish officials and Gonzalez publicly condemned the raid In Latin America the return of Spanish democracy has made the mother country a model and cultural magnet Latin leaders almost weekly troop through Madrid to meet with Gonzalez He was swarmed like a pop idol by admiring crowds when he attended the inauguration of Raul Alfonsin in Argentina two years ago After Reagans visit to Madrid last year Gonzalez said he was surprised by what he saw as a lack of expertise in United States policy toward Latin America He differed with Reagan over putting pressure on Nicaragua But when three days later Nicaraguan President Daniel Ortega Saavedra showed up Gonzalez differed with Ortega too With Ortega by his side on a sofa in the Moncloa during a joint news conference Gonzalez said he would like to see more pluralism in Nicaragua He took umbrage when Ortega equated Reagan with Hitler The United States fought Hitler Gonzalez reminded him and added If a similar situation arises the United States would do it again T HE CHEERING AND hornblowing continued as the security men escorted Gonzalez off the stage and out to his waiting car His shirt was soaked He would travel the whole country in the campaign and the themes would be the same He said he felt more hesitant in his speeches now that he is no longer in the opposition and it came through I like Felipe without any titles before or after he said to lusty applause at one point but the ring of conviction wasnt there PALME IS DEAD FELLED by an assassin Brandt and Schmidt are in eclipse Frances Francois Mitterrand like Mario Soares in Portugal is president but has been forced to share power with opposition parties Italian Prime Minister Bettino Craxi also governs by virtue of compromise and Greek Prime Minister Andreas Papandreou has had little impact outside his own country Among Europes Socialists that leaves Gonzalez with unique influence and visibility He knows his unbroken string of successes cannot last The high unemployment rate the charges of arrogance the wear of decision making and political infighting will take their toll probably some in todays vote I dont hold it against anyone he said He insists he could give it all up For relaxation he toils weekends in a large hothouse garden he maintains down by the swimming pool of his residence Walking through the garden he stops to pull out a clutch of invading weeds from among the Swiss chard and swears his ambition after he leaves office is like his father to own a small farm Gardening is the art of patience he says More importantly it is the only thing that gives me the sense of having finished a job The plants grow Its the exact opposite of politics Still his youth and energy are striking and he seems unfazed by the rigors of the campaign He says he wants to see through what he has started  put a final shape to Spanish federalism to complete his restructuring of the economy and most of all to reestablish Spains place in the world
HAS REAGAN GOT THE COURT HE WANTS?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/weekinreview/has-reagan-got-the-court-he-wants.html,IN the heat of the 1984 Presidential campaign Justice William H Rehnquist gave a speech entitled Presidential Appointments to the Supreme Court It is natural and proper he said for a President to seek to shape the course of the law by naming Justices sympathetic to his political or philosophical principles But he added the effort is apt to be only partially successful If President Reagan is only partially successful in reversing the direction of the Federal courts it will not be for lack of trying In selecting Justice Rehnquist to succeed the retiring Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Judge Antonin Scalia to join the Supreme Court Mr Reagan has named men of impressive talents and appealing personalities whose records on the bench seem totally compatible with the Administrations views On issues including abortion affirmative action school prayer busing Presidential powers the death penalty obscenity crime and civil liberties Justice Rehnquist has been the Courts most conservative member since he was confirmed in 1972 Judge Scalia has been equally consistent as a law professor and since Mr Reagan made him an appellate judge in Washington in 1982 At least one more appointment would be needed to produce a dramatic change in the Courts moderate course  in particular to restrict abortion rights But Justice Rehnquists ability to persuade colleagues in close cases will be enhanced by his new position And he and Judge Scalia are both graceful writers with the intellectual firepower to plant seeds of legal change even in dissent Justice Rehnquist delights in the barbed epigram Judge Scalias writing blends analytical rigor with visceral intensity A standard cliche about the Supreme Court  that a President has no way of telling what an appointee will do once ensconced in a lifetime job  is at least partly myth In this respect the choices of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia are in instructive contrast with President Eisenhowers 1953 appointment of Chief Justice Earl Warren and to a lesser degree with Mr Reagans 1981 appointment of Justice Sandra Day OConnor Chief Justice Warren horrified Mr Eisenhower with liberal rulings on criminal law and civil rights Justice OConnor has turned out to be a more moderate conservative than Justice Rehnquist going against the Administration on some major issues including school prayer But ideological purity was not the primary criterion in those selections Mr Eisenhower had earlier promised the job to thenGovernor Warren of California a man of national stature Mr Reagan was fulfilling a campaign pledge to name the first woman Justice In the cases of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia however Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d is at the helm of an activist Justice Department bent on moving the courts to the right In his radio address yesterday Mr Reagan said his Supreme Court nominees were representative of the high caliber of our Federal court appointments He also urged the Senate to confirm his stalled nomination of Daniel A Manion for a Federal appellate judgeship assailing opponents for partisanship I believe the Senate should consider only a nominees qualifications and character not his political views Mr Reagan said But many Democrats and some Republicans say Mr Reagan is not practicing what he preaches An increasingly singleminded Administration drive to put conservative ideologues on the bench they say has produced some lower court candidates notable less for their legal professionalism than for their extremism or racial insensitivity  though Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia seem immune to such charges The point of Justice Rehnquists 1984 speech was less that people change once named to the Court  although some have  than that even Presidents and judicial nominees who agree on the current issues of importance lack the foresight to see what the great issues of 10 or 15 years hence are to be President Roosevelt he said sought and got Justices who would stop the Court from striking down the New Deal but a few years later when civil liberties issues became central the Roosevelt Court was rent asunder in rancorous squabbling A dominant conservative bloc on a future Court might for example have to sort out the tension between conservatives professed devotion to judicial restraint which would mean an end to what Judge Scalia as recently as Friday called judicial intrusion into the business of the political branches  and the urge to strike down economic regulations offensive to their freemarket philosophy Such a conflict Justice Scalia has said presents the moment of truth for many conservatives who have been criticizing

"KEMP, WITH NATIONAL DREAM, FACES FIGHT AT HOME",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/nyregion/kemp-with-national-dream-faces-fight-at-home.html,While Jack F Kemp was tossing a football for the Buffalo Bills 23 years ago James Keane was showing fans to their seats If hed ever taken his nose out of the air he would have seen me said Mr Keane a Buffalo Common Council member who now shares the political arena with Mr Kemp as the Democrat bidding for Mr Kemps House seat The quarterback may not have noticed the usher but the Congressman is being forced to take note of the challenger Suddenly instead of 1988  the vintage many people associate with Mr Kemp  there is 1986 for him to worry about From the Collins Moose lodge to the Gowanda Shriner parade from the Varysburg fire parade to the Warsaw dairy festival Mr Keane is tirelessly spreading his message throughout Erie County Jack Kemp cannot serve two masters He has betrayed the interests of western New York to fuel his Presidential ambitions By vigorously raising dozens of issues  from charges of possible misuse by Mr Kemp of a taxexempt foundation fund to the fact that there are towns in his district that Mr Kemp has never visited  Mr Keane has became the first serious contender the Republican Congressman has had since he went to Washington 16 years ago Hes making me spend more money and fight harder than I would have said Mr Kemp who is trying to divide his attention between Mr Keane and potential rivals named Bush and Dole I have to defend my reputation The Democrats are crowing Jim Keanes doing better than we ever could have hoped said Representative Tony Coelho of California the chairman of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee The committee plans to help Mr Keane with a maximum amount of money about 50000 if he keeps up the pace For not only do the Democrats have their first legitimate candidate in years in the district but they also have a chance to curb Mr Kemps traveling on behalf of lesserknown Republican Congressional candidates and to throw some gravel in his Presidential path Veteran politicians here do not think Mr Kemp is in any real danger As John R Sharpe the Republican Supervisor of Amherst puts it Jack Kemp gets me into the White House Jim Keane gets me into a bar in South Buffalo Even some people who come to Mr Keanes events agree Keanes a smart guy but Jack Kemps going to come back and eat him alive said John Chew a developer who attended a cocktail party for the Democrat Thursday night They love Kemp here Hes like Father Christmas and the tooth fairy and the AllAmerican football hero rolled into one But Mr Keane has put Mr Kemp in a difficult position He must conduct a twotiered campaign  an open one for his House seat and a shadow one in the rest of the country to explore his chances for the Presidency Although the former athlete says he is sick of football metaphors there are times when nothing else will really do Its like football Mr Kemp said The worst team in the National Football League can give you a battle If you take anything for granted you get your head knocked off For the first time he must go on the defensive explaining political positions on trade and taxes and Federal financing that while they have made him a star with conservatives across the country do not always jibe with the interests of a district that has suffered through a difficult period as a Rust Belt area where auto and steel plants have closed Crashing a Kemp Event Mr Keane is feeling so high about his longshot quest these days that he even took the unorthodox move of crashing a Kemp campaign event today at a senior citizens home in Clarence north of Buffalo While Mr Kemp shook hands on one side of the lot Mr Keane pronounced cane shook hands on the other Mr Kemp ignored his pesky challenger as did 77yearold Florence Perry Jacks been with us for a long time and were all hoping hes going to get something very special in Washington soon  if you know what I mean she whispered conspiratorially Mr Keane is not daunted by Mr Kemps glamour and popularity  he watched grinning as women swooned over the Congressman and men snapped pictures The challenger is a peppery former firefighter and son of a mailman who comes from a family of 16 He is married to a firefighter  one of the first women on the Buffalo force  and has four children One of his favorite books is Trinity by Leon Uris he loves singing Irish songs over a bottle of Genesee beer considers anyone not born in Buffalo unlucky and says his roots in Erie County are so deep that the last time they had a family picnic 500 people came A Nuisance at First When the 40yearold Democrat started telling Mr Kemp to wake up and smell the coffee he seemed merely a vague nuisance like a piece of paper stuck on Mr Kemps shoe or a gnat buzzing round his carefully coiffed head Keane is the kind of a guy said Mr Kemps aide John Buckley who would dive head first into Lake Erie with his clothes on if he thought there was one line of publicity in it When Mr Keane charged that Mr Kemp was a carpetbagger a Los Angeles native who did not even live in the district and merely owned a house in Hamburg that he rented out the Congressman countercharged that Mr Keane did not live in the district either He lives in Buffalo five blocks from the boundary of the 31st District which includes the suburbs of Buffalo but not the city This week their engagement escalated When Mr Kemp resigned as chairman of a taxexempt foundation  the Fund for an American Renaissance after an article in The Buffalo News said he was using the organization to help pay for political activities Mr Keane had his first big issue He filed a suit in Federal District Court in Buffalo on Thursday saying the fund violated an Internal Revenue Service regulation preventing a taxexempt fund from participating in a campaign on behalf of any candidate Kemp Defends Foundation The Buffalo Bills paid 100 for Jack Kemp on waivers Mr Keane said Now the price has gone up Contributors pay 50000 to his foundation How much influence in Washington does that buy The Congressman dismisses the charges about the foundation which he said had been established to study public policy and was not engaged in partisan activity Maybe there should be a debate about these kinds of foundations Mr Kemp said but right now the law says theyre legal Mr Kemp who is 50 has been averaging 20 appearances a month around the country and one or two trips back to the district a month His peripatetic style was lampooned in a cartoon in The Buffalo News featuring Mr Kemp coming back to his Washington office from a Presidential campaign swing only to find there had been an election held in a place called Buffalo Buffalo Buffalo mused the Congressman Rings a bell A Split Personality While he said he planned to come to the district more often he will not sacrifice his national agenda Last week alone he was in Cleveland Akron Denver Houston and Orlando before he arrived in Buffalo this morning He spent several hours in Buffalo before flying off to be the guest star at two speaking appearances in New Hampshire for Robert C Smith a freshman Republican Representative Showing one side of a split political personality Mr Kemp talked to the editorial board of The Amherst Bee about transit funds and Ellicott Creek floodcontrol funds and the New York State tax rate which he said drove Bethlehem Steel from the state Then he traveled to the Quality Inn in Dover NH for the fundraising event for Mr Smith and switched to a more highly charged Washington insider mode Ive been here in New Hampshire a few times he said with a broad grin You may even see me again Quoting Thomas Jefferson and Victor Hugo he sounded his familiar visionary themes of less Federal government and more opportunity for growth and more opportunity for minority groups finishing with a rousing cry for freedom  America will once again be a city set on a hill Mr Keane is as conservative as Mr Kemp on many social issues  the Democrat does not believe in abortion under any circumstances or in racial quotas or special laws protecting homosexuals He believes in the death penalty and in school prayer But he is hitting hard on differences  like the trade issue and Federal aid Defense of Principles Mr Kemp is passing out press releases detailing the urban development grants and Federal floodcontrol funds he has obtained But he has to spend more time these days defending his conservative principles about cutting Federal money and encouraging free trade When Mr Keane talks about the industry that has left the area and driven out young residents because the country does not have enough protectionist measures Mr Kemp rebuts The way to help the industrial Northeast improve opportunities for trade is not to bash Japan for being successful Pretty soon wed be xenophobic he said The legislators who want protectionism are often the ones who drive Toyotas and have Sony television sets The world doesnt work that way Were interdependent For a long time Mr Kemp has taken his seat for granted He was so popular and felt so safe  helped by redistricting that spliced in some rural Republican areas and cut out bluecollar Democratic ones  that he spent more time traveling in other parts of the country than at home Mr Keane delights in painting his opponent as an absentee Congressman There was an article in Esquire magazine that said Jack Kemp visited 30 states and made 150 speeches last year he said The article is dated Oct 24 1978 Its all right to take a year off to campaign for President but a decade He points out that Mr Kemps voting average is 88 percent several points under the national average and that of his fellow western New York Congressman Why isnt he in Washington or western New York instead of flitting about the country giving speeches on the gold standard Mr Keane asks Apologies to Java Mr Keane recalled a press release last May announcing the appointment of a consultant to Mr Kemps reelection campaign As reported in the local newspaper it described the Congressmans district as including suburbs of Buffalo stretching east all the way to the edge of Monroe County Actually the district extends at least 45 miles farther east to the edge of Seneca County Mr Kemp is still confident enough to laugh when asked about Mr Keanes charge that he has never even visited the town of Java in his district No Ive never been there and I apologize to the people of Java said Mr Kemp He seems comfortable at the moment with blending his local and national ambitions After his speech tonight in New Hampshire Mr Kemp expressed confidence He talked about his national persona and said he was trying to shorten his speeches so that he did not bore people You know he said driving toward a helicopter that would take him back to Logan International Airport in Boston John Kennedy never spoke more than 15 minutes But then after a few moments of silence the Congressman spoke again and he was not thinking about the White House Well get to Java he said almost to himself
THE REAGAN LEGACY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/magazine/the-reagan-legacy.html,HE COMPARES HIS legacy to FDRS and if Franklin D Roosevelts impact on the nation remained powerful years after his departure Ronald Reagan believes and numerous politicians academics and economists agree with him  that his impact will prove just as farreaching Like FDR may I say Im not trying to destroy what is best in our system of humane free government Im doing everything I can to save it President Reagan remarks As if expressing his own credo for the Presidency Mr Reagan recently said of FDR He gave confidence to the people He never lost faith in this country for one minute While it seems evident that Mr Reagans legacy will be seen as having both positive and negative aspects it is clear that his impact like FDRs rests in large part on restoring the primacy of the Presidency as an institution after nearly two decades of White House disarray marked by Vietnam Watergate and the hostages in Iran First of all he has contributed a spirit of good will and grace to the Presidency and American life generally and turned the Presidency into a vigorous and forceful instrument of national policy says Senator Edward M Kennedy who nonetheless criticizes Mr Reagans economic social and civilrights policies Says Gov Mario M Cuomo of New York What hes reminded me of is the importance of a leader being perceived as a force By his personal conduct when hes shot when hes told he has cancer when he goes to Normandy  the way hes deported himself has been a moral instruction to my children By virture of Mr Reagans victories says Mr Cuomo the Presdient has generated a whole new introspection on the part of the Democratic Party He adds The results can only be positive Perhaps even more significant for national politics after Ronald Reagan the President has not only strengthened the conservative movement he has also institutionalized it Stuart E Eizenstat who was President Carters chief domestic policy adviser observes What Reagan and his people have done is place a whole generation of conservative to rightwing people with no experience and given them not only a taste of power but experience in running a government just as FDR did with Democrats who then stayed on through the 60s and 70s Conservatives are in levels now that run deep in government and unlike the people who came in with Eisenhower Nixon and Ford who didnt have Bernard Weinraub is a White House correspondent for The Times a burning ideology and saw it as their obligation to do public service this group has a much more longterm commitment to staying on and shaping government says Mr Eizenstat Any Administration in the future  Democrat or Republican will have to face a bureaucracy considerably shifted to the right and very consciously so Adds Representative Jack F Kemp who views himself as an ideological if not Presidential heir to Mr Reagan There used to be a mean streak in the Republican conservative movement Conservatives were viewed as not very concerned about people If he hasnt removed that permanently hes ameliorated it Peggy Noonan a departing White House speechwriter and a vocal conservative says The first thing a successful President has to do is capture the imagination of the people In lightening the tax burden of the citizenry by ending the age of limits and beginning the age of growth and by instituting a more downtoearth and lessenthralled approach to the Soviet Union Ronald Reagan communicated this historic message We have nothing to fear but fear itself That phrase one of FDRs best known underlines the fact that in speeches President Reagan himself often stirs memories of FDR  in talking about welfare as a subtle destroyer of the human spirit about the value of prayer about restoring the autonomy of state and local governments even about the benefits of United StatesSaudi Arabian friendship Nearly six years into the Reagan Presidency and on the verge of obtaining a sweeping restructuring of the tax code that has been the cornerstone of his second term  Mr Reagans comparison with FDR seems unerringly accurate His two remaining years in the White House leave him vulnerable of course to an unexpected international crisis or a domestic economic slide that could darken his Presidency But now as historians economists politicians and his own associates begin examining the Reagan legacy FDR and RR as some senior aides refer to him seem perfectly  if ironically  matched In the words of Charles O Jones former editor of the American Political Science Review and a professor at the University of Virginia they are bookend Presidents  one in the direction of more government and trying to make system work and this one trying to make it work in the sense of less government Theyre both radical but in totally different directions On the face of it the idea of a link between between Ronald Reagan and Franklin D Roosevelt may seem not only tenuous but also incongruous After all Roosevelt began the New Deal and Mr Reagan effectively ended 50 years of socialwelfare expansion that had been engendered by that New Deal The Roosevelt programs grew out of a need to assist the millions of citizens shattered by the Depression under Mr Reagan hunger has increased according to a number of studies despite the nations economic upturn and the poverty rate is higher than it was in the 1970s while budget cuts have resulted in the permanent loss to 700000 families of all or part of their benefits Liberals concede that some of the cuts may have been warranted and that the prospect of restoring aid to these poor and moderateincome families after Mr Reagan leaves office seems improbable If the President leaves a single legacy it is that he appears to have almost totally eliminated for years to come any discussion of new socialwelfare initiatives Roosevelt weighted the judiciary toward liberalism while Mr Reagan  in what may emerge as one of his most significant legacies  has begun reshaping the Federal bench with judges of a conservative bent who will have an enduring impact for years to come says Prof Susan R Estrich of the Harvard Law School She points out that many of the Reagan appointees appear to have been deliberately selected for their youth Reagan will be out of the White House in two years but well be arguing before these guys for the next 20 or 30 years she says By the time he leaves office Mr Reagan will have probably named more than half of the 761member Federal judiciary Their impact will probably be felt most in criminal justice civilrights policy the social agenda  including abortion prayer in school and womens rights and business regulations Roosevelt stabilized the economy while Mr Reagans fiscal policies centering on a deep tax cut and a sizable military buildup have increased alreadyhuge budget deficits that have helped devastate important sectors of the economy Most visibly  and permanently  thousands of families have left their farms numerous rural banks have been forced out of business and thousands of other businesses that deal with farmers have collapsed The farm belts debt crisis will shadow Midwest states years after the Reagan Presidency ends Beyond this 40 percent of income tax dollars go for interest on the national debt  a debt now standing at 2 trillion almost half of it amassed during the Reagan years And even though the White House has endorsed efforts to reduce the annual deficits through the GrammRudmanHollings bill economists say that the huge accumulation of debt will weigh on the economy for many years This burden is likely to cause interest rates to remain unusually high distort the value of the dollar cause American industries continued difficulty in their competition with foreigners and constrain the Governments ability to help the unemployed and the poor On a personal level FDR was consumed by his work in the Oval Office working deep into the night while Mr Reagan leaves the Oval Office by 6 PM positively enjoying his job as Chief Executive unlike Jimmy Carter and never complaining about the loneliness of making tough decisions To many political figures including Democrats Mr Reagan will have an enduring impact on future Presidents in the way he has managed the Presidency the way in which he adheres to two or three specific goals such as cutting taxes or raising defense spending without appearing overwhelmed by the job as Jimmy Carter did his personal confidence his ability to distance himself from crisis or bad news his successful efforts with a skilled staff to plan the day around television opportunities and assure a flow of positive symbols and images N A CHILLY MARCH evening last year Ronald Reagan left the White House for a local hotel to address the 12th annual Conservative Political Action Conference dinner The mood was festive and the President quickly warmed to the partisan crowd The tide of history Mr Reagan said was now moving irresistibly in the direction of conservatism after 50 years of liberal drift Republicans were no longer defenders of the status quo but creators of a future marked by less regulation lower taxes and economic growth Beyond that he said perhaps the greatest triumph of modern conservatism has been to stop allowing the left and the intelligentsia to tell average Americans that they were hopelessly out of date utterly trite and    reactionary The normal was portrayed as eccentric and only the abnormal was worthy of emulation said Mr Reagan The irreverence was celebrated but only irreverence about certain things Irreverence toward say organized religion Yes Irreverence toward establishment liberalism Not much of that They celebrated their courage in taking on safe targets and patted each other on the back for slinging stones at a confused Goliath who was too demoralized  and really too good to fight back But now one simply senses it the American people are no longer on the defensive Given the Presidents gift for exaggeration and selfcongratulation the speech seemed unremarkable But as a projection of Mr Reagans views of his legacy and a demonstration of the themes that have dominated his terms  from reshaping the national agenda to slowing the growth of domestic spending from changing the priorities of the Federal budget in favor of more military spending to restoring a sense of national pride and endorsing certain middleclass values  the speech served as both a secondterm marching call to the faithful and an embodiment of the Reagan Revolution The moment is ours and we must seize it said the President in a hoarse voice There is work to do Although he is the most influential President in 50 years even his aides acknowledge that Mr Reagan with two years left in the White House to seize a revolution has only scraped around the edges of the welfare state leaving it largely intact In fact there has actually been an an increase in the number of Federal workers because of the shift of emphasis to defense despite the pledge to reduce big government And the promises to abolish everything from the Department of Energy to the Department of Education and to balance the Federal budget have been abandoned Yet political figures academics and economists assessing the Reagan years say that after six years the legacy of Ronald Reagan is  even with its failures  an extraordinarily powerful one and that his impact will affect domestic and foreign policy and the Presidency itself through the 1990s He has restored the Presidency as an institution after a run of basically three failed Presidencies says Henry Hugh Heclo a professor of government at Harvard He had a clear idea of what he wanted  cut the budget for the domestic side and raise it for the military  and maintained command of the agenda Hes made it clear you dont have to be hyperactive to be President to have an answer for every question Its OK for a President not to know everything He seemed to make the job manageable And although the basic textural fact of his popularity is the sustained economic upturn what also makes him popular is he actually seems like a normal human being Hes knowable hes likable Hes not weird You think of Johnson and Nixon and Carter And then theres Reagan Hes someone youd be happy to have in your living room But there are also contradictions in the Reagan Presidency that according to some historians raise the possibility that in 10 or 20 years the Reagan era will be viewed merely as a strange interlude in American politics For example his personal popularity ratings especially high for a secondterm President are not matched by public support for some of his key policies As Fred I Greenstein a professor of politics at Princeton puts it He is more successful than any recent President in establishing space between himself and his policies Certainly to many observers the Reagan legacy is not an especially happy one Government may or may not be able to solve the problems of inflation unemployment and growth in an increasingly competitive world economy but one could hope that it would at least not make matters worse in the process of trying to make them better writes Isabel V Sawhill an economist in Perspectives on the Reagan Years a collection of essays edited by John L Palmer that is scheduled to be published late this summer by the influential Urban Institute Yet this is the true legacy of the Reagan years There have been earlier periods of economic mismanagement but few if any can rival the current Governments tolerance of budget deficits that virtually guarantee poorer productivity performance in the future and a further erosion of our relative standard of living SIMILAR VIEW IS voiced by Senator Daniel P Moynihan Ronald Reagan as an immensely popular President has done the polity a great service he says We needed a popular President The social order is peaceable and in good order From LBJs time and Vietnam to Watergate and then the Iranian hostages we needed that But he has crippled the economy of the nation and this will be with us for the rest of the century And Richard P Nathan a professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University says looking at Mr Reagans economic and social policies The Reagan Administration marks a watershed in domestic policy and signals a fundamental shift in attitude in which the Federal Government takes on a much smaller responsibility for social and urban issues The Roosevelt New Deal served as a period of ascendancy in both identifying and dealing with social needs The Reagan Presidency marks a turning away from that agenda by stopping the growth in Federal efforts and spending in certain social programs by turning over authority to state governments in areas where the Federal Government previously played an important role In the economic field the 1981 tax cuts the dramatic fall in inflation from 124 percent to less than 4 percent and the break in the wageprice spiral which some attribute to Mr Reagans determined handling of the air traffic controllers strike are hallmarks of the Reagan years Murray L Weidenbaum chairman of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers in 198182 says that the breakup of the air traffic controllers union was the single most important event in American labor relations in more than a decade  strike activity is at its lowest point in 30 years Mr Reagans ability to crush the strike undoubtedly will make future Presidents far less inhibited about similar moves The first year of the Reagan Administration was marked by its most significant legislative achievment and the pivot of the Presidents domestic program  the Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981 The measure encompassed such goals as reducing the size and scope of the Federal Government in domestic affairs although Mr Reagan in his budgets also sought big increases in defense spending fundamental changes in welfare policy which restricted eligibility and reduced benefits in the main Federalstate program and the establishment of block grants which sought to shift domestic priorities to the states The budget act of 1981 is the most important piece of domestic legislation since the Social Security Act of 1935 writes Professor Nathan in the soontobepublished Urban Institute book The 1981 budget act represented a marked shift in direction on social spending and encompassed fundamental changes in the substance of domestic policy and in American Federalism Poor families have suffered in large numbers the disadvantaged have borne a disproportionate share of the burden compared to politically powerful middleclass constituents ranging from some farmers to veterans to Social Security recipients The new tax revision however if passed has provisions for the poor that could take many off the tax rolls The cuts have lets face it caused a considerable amount of pain remarks Jack A Meyer a resident fellow at the American Enterprise Institute and president of a Washington social welfare research firm He also notes that cuts in supplemental income for the working poor would send a longterm signal to people in lowincome households that were not going to reward work were not going to reward holding families together and itll have an effect beyond Reagan Were restricting public assistance to split families headed by nonworking adults What this means is we have not addressed the issue of longterm welfare dependency we have not addressed the issue of people in this society caught in the cycle of teenage pregnancy and crime and longterm welfare dependency It is these budget cuts involving the poor that raise questions about Mr Reagans future standing among other Presidents When it came time great Presidents bent over backwards to speak for the less privileged to take a moral stance and Reagan hasnt done that says Thomas E Cronin an author of several books on the Presidency who teaches at Colorado College History will treat Reagan less well than the public opinion polls today because being popular is not necessarily doing the right thing Reaganisms celebration of a nation of communities has no real answer when such communities entrench equality and merrily suppress the individualism of those falling out of the mainstream of particular small groups norms writes Professor Heclo of Harvard in the Urban Institute book The economic as opposed to the social face of Reagans individualism can easily be portrayed as playing to the most rationalized forms of selfishness  looking out for No 1 is the best way of helping the country There can arise a determined insensitivity that passes for toughmindedness The economic losers are not victims just incompetents Reaganism then becomes a rationale for the nation to secede from some downcast fraction of its own inhabitants T HE ECONOMY the booming stock market inflation of only 3 or 4 percent thanks in large part to the oil price collapse the move toward singledigit mortgage rates serve as the underpinning for the Presidents popularity But the huge budget deficit sluggish productivity growth growing foreign debt and the decline in the dollars value which raises import prices create a shadowy even ominous backdrop Asked why the President and his chief of staff Donald T Regan did not seem to view the deficit with the same concern as many economists despite their endorsement of the GrammRudmanHollings balancedbudget act William A Niskanen former acting chairman of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers replied If the deficit were causing nearterm economic problems theyd be concerned But it hasnt Its just too easy to put off It has proved to be consistent with moderately good economic conditions Mr Reagans impact on the Republican Party  and national politics  offers one of the more striking contradictions about a conservative President who is extraordinarily popular in a nation undergoing considerable social change The irony has not been lost on Democratic and Republican politicians Although he embodies for many voters an America of small towns tightlyknit families and religious values Mr Reagan came of age in show business enjoys a ribald joke rarely goes to church became the first divorced man to serve as President and has had an oftenstrained relationship with his children Assessing Mr Reagans impact on the political process however especially on the Republican Party has a potentially significant negative side The President his Attorney General Edwin L Meese 3d and his Education Secretary William J Bennett have paid obeisance to the religious right The religious right has been legitimized by the six years of Ronald Reagan theyre no longer regarded as a fringe group theyre part of the power structure says Kevin Phillips a Republican political analyst In the same way that the Democrats had been perceived as bending too far to organized labor to minorities to gays the Republicans are in danger of being seen as tilting too far to to the religious right The likelihood is that the Republican agenda will be affected by the Rev Marion G Pat Robertson and the Rev Jerry Falwell Accordingly the Republicans face pressures to adopt programs involving social and religious values that are anathema to a relatively libertarian youthful constituency that voted heavily for Ronald Reagan in 1984 The growing crisis in the Republican Party is how to do they resolve the social agenda of the religious right which the President has done so much to legitimize says Patrick Caddell the Democratic polltaker How do they restrain those impulses at a time when politics is shifting to a generation whose hallmark is tolerance on social issues It is quite possible Mr Caddell continues that Mr Reagan has unwittingly created a monster that could seize the Republican Party Even Richard Wirthlin Mr Reagans polltaker concedes that a social schism between economic conservatives and social libertarians could open up in 1988 But Mr Wirthlin observes that one of the more unusual twists of the 1984 Presidential campaign was that Mr Reagan received a far higher percentage of votes from those under 24 than he had in 1980 What attracted the young to Reagan were qualities that voters also saw in FDR stability and direction M R REAGANS huge defense buildup also stirs negative questions about his legacy His campaign rhetoric about fraud waste and abuse in government has been turned on its head and Republicans have joined Democrats in condemning fraud waste and abuse at the Pentagon The consensus for increased defense spending has withered and it seems improbable that even Republican Presidential contenders such as Vice President George Bush or Jack Kemp will focus their campaigns on the need for steppedup military spending Democrats concede that abroad the United States now projects selfconfidence and authority for the first time since Vietnam  no small feat although United StatesSoviet relations arms control the Middle East and Central America remain in a state of uncertainty But says William G Hyland editor of the journal Foreign Affairs Historically Reagan will be remembered for reopening the question of strategic defenses as a broad issue a question thats been closed since the postwar period a question that was buttoned up no one was talking about it except one or two people on the fringes Mr Eizenstat says that one of the most significant results of Mr Reagans tenure is that America has finally come to terms with the Vietnam legacy The Libyan raid the Grenada invasion support for rebels in Nicaragua Angola Afghanistan and elsewhere marked a turning point that will affect future Administrations The sense that America was paralyzed in projecting its power after Vietnam was ended by Reagan says Mr Eizenstat Future Administrations will no longer be inhibited by Vietnam future Administrations will have more leeway in projecting US economic and military power without running into the constant argument of Vietnam Give Reagan credit for one thing says Walter F Mondale who gives him credit for little else Hes uncanny in his ability to create a sense of feeling good of enhancing the American spirit of pumping up the American sense of selfworth He belongs to the marketers school of politics its not substance its positioning and selling Its not policy its polling Its market surveys its filmmaking its using the skills of Hollywood to lead the country And its been so successful Id be surprised if a lot of politicians werent influenced by it But Mr Reagans successful political career is hardly just the result of Hollywood technique He is a shrewd calculating and to some degree manipulative politician and ideologue And even Mr Mondale agrees that Mr Reagans two landslide Presidential victories his leadership style have altered the nations politics for the future Reagan has made as much of a midcourse correction in the direction of American policy and politics as it is possible to make in a noncrisis environment and his accomplishments have been extraordinary in the sense that for the last five years everybody has played off his agenda  everybody says Mr Eizenstat Its not whether you cut domestic spending its how much Its not whether you increase defense spending but how much He has captured the high ground on virtually every major issue of consequence and controlled the debate as well as any President since Roosevelt Mr Reagans visionary zeal in seeking to turn the Republicans into the nations majority party has transformed the nations political scene for the near future It will take an extraordinary candidate and set of circumstances for the Democrats to win the Presidency in the foreseeable future says Mr Eizenstat Mr Reagans Presidential persona  his style  has impressed other politicians who confess that theyve learned from him Hes conducted himself with grace with control with generosity says Governor Cuomo His personal strength has produced high poll figures  certainly not his position on the economy Hes totally nonmenacing so affable that if youre vulnerable youre poor you have to believe hes a man of feeling He has succeeded in changing the terms of the national debate over domestic policy antipoverty programs were reduced grants to the states and communities that enabled them to hire the jobless were eliminated and middleincome college students became ineligible for Governmentbacked loans Yet if Mr Reagan yearned to overturn the welfare state he has failed in doing so The current view of Reagans legacy is that he made assaults on government and he attempted to shrink government says Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey He tried to do that But the result of his eight years will be the closing of any debate on the value acceptability and existence of the modern welfare state In fact because of overwhelming Congressional resistance to fundamental changes in domestic programs Social Security civilrights acts the Clean Air act consumer protection and Federal aid to education remain on the books some of them diminished but all still effective Although six years into his Presidency some critics dismiss Mr Reagan  and Reaganism  as an aberration an interregnum in American politics with marginal impact most academics and politicians say that the Reagan years will symbolize as have few other Administrations in decades the way most Americans of the era view themselves their neighbors and their Government Just as liberalism made it all right to talk about sex Reaganism made it all right to talk about patriotism work requirements and family values parochial allegiances moral purpose and yes imposing middleclass values on others writes Professor Heclo of Harvard in the Urban Institute book Reaganism has a future because Americans want to talk about these things in politics Reaganism is an upbeat positive political message In this regard there is much in common with the older liberal tradition of the Happy Warrior Happy Days are Here Again and politics of joy Reaganism like the headiest days of liberalism offers a vision in which Americans can have it all world leadership economic growthmanship without guilt or hard choices Americans have only to believe in their own dreams To the experts who speak of limitations economic contradictions tradeoffs United States international decline Reaganism offers the classic American response Nuts
The Rehnquist Court: a Watershed,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/22/opinion/the-rehnquist-court-a-watershed.html,President Reagans longexpected chance to reshape the United States Supreme Court has presented itself at last and the President has seized it in a way that signals a watershed in the history of the Court With Chief Justice Warren E Burgers announcement that he will step down at the end of the Courts current term the Presidents nominations of Associate Justice William H Rehnquist to become Chief Justice of the United States and of Judge Antonin Scalia to become an Associate Justice are plainly designed to produce seismic change in the content of our constitutional law and in the role of the Supreme Court in our political system Despite the prospects for radical change one assumes that because of the exceptional ability and unquestioned integrity of the two men Senate confirmation will be quick and easy The naming of a new Chief Justice tends to produce a special sense of impending change in the Court Partly this is symbolic Ever since our fourth Chief Justice the incomparable John Marshall put his nationalist stamp on the Court in his seminal 34year tenure from 1801 to 1835 periods in the Courts history have tended to be identified by the tenures of Chief Justices The Court is the symbol of continuity in our nations Government the institutional embodiment of our Constitution which is as Marshall once said intended to endure for all ages to come It is insulated from electoral rhythms outlasting administrations and large enough in its membership of nine so as almost never to be recast in a stroke The Chief Justice is the personal embodiment of this sense of continuity It signifies in our history that alongside our 40 Presidents we have had only 15 Chief Justices and that several in addition to Marshall have served across entire eras in our nations development Chief Justice Burger after all served alongside four Presidents during 17 years of extraordinary political volatility Beyond longevity and symbolism a number of Chief Justices have by intellect personal force or ability to capture the nations constitutional ideals or anxieties dominated the work of the Court as a whole during their tenures One thinks of the impact of Chief Justices Marshall and Roger Brooke Taney in the long sweep of their successive tenures from 1801 to 1865 of William Howard Taft in the 1920s of Charles Evans Hughes in the 1930s and of course of Earl Warren in the 1950s and 1960s A Chief Justice is only one voice and vote among nine to be sure But the power to preside over the conferences that set the Courts docket and canvass the merits of cases for decision to assign majority opinions or dissents and to speak out on basic questions of Federal law and jurisdiction can be profoundly influential tools in the hands of a Chief Justice who will use them It is hard even when looking back to take the measure of a period in the Courts history When one remembers that great nationbuilding jurisprudence of the Marshall Court ended in an era of growing state challenges to national authority that the Taney Court wound up with a fatal embrace of the specter of slavery and that the demise of the main constitutional achievements of the Warren Court was confidently predicted when Chief Justice Burger and three other strict constructionists  Harry A Blackmun Lewis F Powell and Mr Rehnquist  were appointed to the Court by President Richard M Nixon within a space of three years one sees the difficulty of appraising the historical significance of an era of the Supreme Court even at its close Will William Rehnquist come to be associated with the great Chief Justices Will he lead the Court to a vision of constitutional law structure that grips the nation to decisions that summon up in an enduring way our deep constitutional idealism Justice Rehnquist is a person of extraordinary intellectual power and utter confidence in his own constitutional convictions Like the man he once served as law clerk Justice Robert H Jackson Justice Rehnquist is a masterly writer with a sharp and sarcastic pen He is a warm and engaging person without pretense Despite his rigid and systematic constitutional ideology he has an open and playful manner in discussions He is a shrewd tactician in the arts of persuasion He has the qualities of intellect strength of conviction and personality to be an influential Chief Justice The question is whether his reactionary constitutional vision is so out of touch with that of his colleagues and the temper of the times that all his powers of intellect and personality cannot overcome the essential isolation that has been the overriding characteristic of his service on the Court to date Partly of course this question turns on who his colleagues are and will be Judge Scalia seems likely to be strong ally of Justice Rehnquist on most constitutional issues in harmony on general questions of constitutional structure and philosophy Judge Scalia is himself a powerful intellect with a biting and effective pen He has scholarly skills in massing data and argument that probably exceed those of anyone now on the Court He has a gregarious winning personality He seems virtually certain to bring tremendous strengths to Justice Rehnquists reactionary program With Justice Sandra Day OConnor they will make a formidable trio If President Reagan makes one or two more appointments Justice Rehnquist may well preside over a Court with a likeminded majority The consequences would be striking to contemplate and would distance the Rehnquist Court from the Burger Court almost as much as from the Warren Court It must be remembered that the Burger Court has reaffirmed the most significant constitutional work of the Warren Court in race relations and reapportionment has upheld and even extended the essential protections of freedom of the press created by the Warren Court and has left largely intact several major elements of the Warren Courts work in criminal procedure Moreover by most measures of judicial activism and doctrinal innovation the Burger Court exceeded in its abortion decisions anything done by the Warren Court And historians will doubtless see the Burger Courts decision to expedite the Watergate tapes case and to rush the matter to judgment before the House of Representatives could conclude its impeachment proceedings against President Nixon as one of the prime crisisresolving initiatives in the Courts entire history In short for all its many important differences with the Warren Court the Burger Court left most of the Warren Courts constitutional legacy intact and embarked on several major activist forays of its own Now presumably William Rehnquist will have his chance as Chief Justice to lead the Supreme Court away from the activist constitutional premises and methods of the Warren Court Justice Rehnquists record is sharply at odds with virtually all major aspects of the Warren Courts constitutional innovations It may well be that the nation is ready for a reaction in constitutional fundamentals The Warren Courts valiant efforts to exorcise the constitutional demon of racism required the Court to upset longheld patterns of deference to state courts and state legislatures Racism was ingrained not only in state laws dealing explicitly with race but also in the administration of state criminal laws and state election laws and in state responses to exercises of freedom of expression particularly in the streets The patterns of Federal judicial dominance that emerged to promote racial equality however were not limited to race relations and activism in pursuit of racial equality easily and naturally led to activism in pursuit of other constitutional ends The Warren Courts activism rested on the notion that the Supreme Court must pursue the longdeferred vindication of the rights of blacks because of their exclusion from political participation and from the administration of criminal law and because segregation reduced blacks to the status of legal outcasts But now that black people are at least in rudimentary and formal ways participants in politics and law administration the premise that judicial activism is essential to the constitutional protection of minorities is under challenge This threatens further constitutional progress for black people and once habits of judicial deference set in with respect to race they will tend to generalize themselves throughout constitutional law as did the habits of activism before For the past 50 years our constitutional law has been playing out patterns set in motion by the Constitutional Revolution of 1938 when the Supreme Court as reconstituted by Franklin D Roosevelt retreated from judicial activism in economic regulation and began to build a theory of activism for protection of minority rights and civil liberties In many ways Charles Evans Hughes the great Chief Justice of the 1930s is the doctrinal godfather of the Warren Court The nominations of Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia represent a major challenge to this jurisprudence of civil rights and civil liberties that traces back to the 1930s In their approach to civil liberties and perhaps civil rights as well they stand for a degree of deference to the states and to the political branches that parallels the handsoff approach to review of economic regulation taken by the Supreme Court since the 1930s Thus these appointments constitute a greater challenge to the received tradition of constitutional law than any we have seen for a half century

PRESIDENT DENOUNCES ABORTION AS 'MURDER',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/us/president-denounces-abortion-as-murder.html,President Reagan today called abortion murder but said he had made no effort to seek the views of his judicial nominees on this or any other social issue Mr Reagan made the remarks in the course of discussing social issues and his judicial appointments in a wideranging interview with The Los Angeles Times a transcript of which was released by the White House In opposing abortion the President said I dont think that Im trying to do something that is taking a privilege away from womanhood because I dont think that womanhood should be considering murder a privilege Strong Language Used Mr Reagans language on abortion was some of the strongest he has used in discussing the issue In past statements for example he has referred to abortion as taking the life of a living human being In the interview today the issue was raised in the context of whether Mr Reagan thought his judicial nominations would bring about a change in the way the courts interpret the law on abortion school prayer and other social issues In nominating Federal judges Mr Reagan said he had never given a litmus test to any of his appointments including his latest choice for a position on the Supreme Court Antonin Scalia Interpreters of the Law Mr Reagan said I feel very strongly about those social issues but I also place my confidence in the fact that the one thing that I do seek are judges that will interpret the law and not write the law Asked if he agreed with a statement by Pat Buchanan the director of White House communications that the Administrations court appointments and not legislative initiatives were the key to advancing the social agenda of conservatives the President replied Yes On other matters Mr Reagan said  The Government is doing all that we can to finance research to find a cure for AIDS but until that happens Americans should store their own blood to avoid catching AIDS from a blood transfusion  He will remain neutral in the 1988 Republican Presidential primary campaign even if his close friend Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada should enter the race against Vice President Bush I cannot take sides in the primary he said The President also said the Supreme Court decision banning prayer in public schools is just not in keeping with the Constitution at all
PAT ROBERTSON LOOKS TO SOUTH AND EVANGELICALS AS KEY TO 1988,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/us/pat-robertson-looks-to-south-and-evangelicals-as-key-to-1988.html,State by state through the huge new churches the handsome new clubs and restaurants of the New South the Rev Marion G Pat Robertson the television evangelist is promoting himself for the Presidency He is a Republican and it is in a Southern regional primary he says that the nomination will be won It was in the election of Jimmy Carter another Southerner as President that the evangelical Christian vote became an important factor and it has grown more potent through a decade of political awakening In the process television ministers of the religious right like the Rev Jerry Falwell have become powerful brokers within the national Republican Party structure heavily influencing the form and appearance of the party its candidates and its platform But Mr Robertson who commands the largest national television audience of them all from the studios of his Christian Broadcasting Network in Virginia Beach Va is the first to enter the secular world of politics as a possible candidate himself It is a historic venture and while political strategists doubt he can win the nomination a Robertson candidacy would affect both the nominating process and the Christian community being called upon to support a preacher for the top secular role the United States offers None of the other television preachers have crossed the line drawn against such personal engagement in temporal affairs But Mr Robertson was the son of a United States Senator before he became an ordained Southern Baptist minister and the smiling host of The 700 Club Evangelical Christians Form Core of Support As he barnstorms the region in his corporate jet a surge of people predominantly evangelical Christians are rallying to his cause providing it with money and volunteer labor And many are doing so because they accept his quest as literally the will of God We feel like if hes heard from God Himself we ar definitely excited about having him as a candidate Travis Burke pastor of the charismatic New Life Family Church said after listening to Mr Robertson here Mr Burke and his wife Carleta were among a scattering of preachers and lay Christians from across north central Florida who came to St Marys Primitive Baptist Church one recent afternoon to hear Mr Robertson talk about the literacy program his television ministry is promoting The pastor nodded in agreement as Mr Robertson who is 56 years old spoke of the deplorable state of American schools Praise God Mr Burke exclaimed as Mr Robertson described how his program could teach the illiterate to read Mr Burke said he was going the next morning to a breakfast meeting of the Freedom Council which Mr Robertson calls his political arm and would gladly work through his 80member church for Mr Robertsons candidacy as long as were not doing anything illegal Part of the Freedom Councils work is to educate ministers like Mr Burke in what political activity is legal under the Federal tax laws In training seminars over the last 14 months in various cities in Florida the Freedom Council has trained as many as 800 preachers most of them evangelicals in the political process said Richard Pinsky the Florida coordinator Last month with the help of such pastors Mr Robertson stunned the campaign organizations of Vice President Bush and Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York when he outperformed them both by deploying more precinct delegate candidates in the first round of Michigans complex process for selecting delegates to the national convention in 1988 In Nebraska this month a smaller but similar wave of evangelical Christians aligned with the Freedom Council swept control of the Republican county conventions in Douglas County where Omaha is situated and in Lancaster County which includes Lincoln God is calling these people to get involved said Bob Garrett the Nebraska coordinator of the Freedom Council The Lord he explained does speak to us  He makes his mind known to us with signs or a still small voice or an audible voice That particular view says Gary Jarmin a Washington political consultant to organizations of the religious right is most representative of Pats base among the charismaticPentecostal community Such charismatic Christians make up 15 to 20 percent of the approximately 50 million evangelical Protestants in the United States he said They believe that these things are ordained of God he said With important decisions they always lay in the hands of God to guide them Mr Jarmin said and everything they do is what God led them to do If Pat decides to run then for them that is a Godled decision Number of Charismatics Is Growing Rapidly The number of such charismatic Christians is growing rapidly and many of those religious decisions are made by people in their adult years William S Rosasco 3d a wealthy business executive who is a Democratic State Committeeman from the Florida Panhandle was a fraternity brother and close friend of Mr Robertsons when both were members of Sigma Alpha Epsilon at Washington  Lee University It was not until after college that each found his way into the charismatic fold Mr Robertson scion of an old Virginia family whose father A Willis Robertson represented Virginia in the Senate went on to graduate from Yale Law School and entered business in New York before recognizing the emptiness in his life he says now Thirty years ago he says he was dining with a missionary friend of his mothers at the Barclay Hotel in Philadelphia when the missionary confronted him with the weakness of his claim to salvation At that point I confessed Jesus Christ had died for my sins Mr Robertson says His life changed direction He went to the Biblical Seminary in New York and when his young son developed a high fever and a doctor could not be found he says he began begging God to please heal him The fever broke and he reached within himself to find some way to thank God Something gave way Mr Robertson says I began to speak in something very much like an African dialect It was a precious experience Ever since he has practiced faith healing and speaking in tongues all the while building an empire of three television stations the third largest cable network in the country an audience estimated by Nielsen at 27 million to 28 million viewers a month and an accredited graduate school CBN University The 700 Club of which he is the host is a Christian talk and news program that in its early days needed 700 people to contribute 10 a month to stay on the air Mr Rosascos own conversion came about eight years ago after his daughter nearly died in an automobile accident and he now shares the perspective that moves Mr Robertson and his charismatic followers If Pat runs its going to be because God has spoken to him Mr Rosasco says If he is led to do it then God will move whatever obstacles He needs to move to put him where He wants him to be Robertson Moderates His Oratory Mr Robertson declared himself a Prophet of God in an angry letter to a critic four years ago but now shies away from such talk At plainly secular events he speaks in carefully even enthusiastically secular terms At the Florida Economics Club a business luncheon forum studded with university presidents and former Governors he spoke familiarly of the oilman T Boone Pickens and the OpEd page of The Wall Street Journal He discussed the debilitating effect of the budget and trade deficits and of the decline of the American industrial base And he predicted the Dow Jones industrial average would hit 3000 even 3500 within two or three years creating a new wave of great personal wealth from the stock market I called my broker and said I want to margin right up to the limit  I think this thing is going to go big  Mr Robertson told the crowd Gerald Lewis a Democrat who is the Comptroller of Florida said He was saying all the right things He was establishing his credentials as someone who really understands the national economy If he were going to campaign as a minister amid a lot of antiabortion and school prayer talk hes smart enough to know thats not going to take him very far It is at events that are evangelical in audience and organization as with the affluent bornagain group he addressed at the Governors Club here that Mr Robertson raises those issues bitterly attacking Supreme Court rulings There he is frequently introduced as Gods answer for a troubled society God we praise You that once again a man has been given to us to meet this crisis said the pastor who offered the dinner invocation And at the close of each rally arranged by the Freedom Council someone invariably asks if he will run for President He responds grinning broadly as he did here at the Christian Heritage Church Let me ask you should I do it That brought 1500 evangelicals to their feet in a roar of joyous supplication You Have to Consider What the Lord Wants With each stop in an exhausting schedule of speeches rallies and news conferences strung through Alabama Florida Georgia Mississippi Tennessee and Texas Mr Robertson is promising to declare himself in or out of the race for the Republican nomination by this August or September Of course you always have to consider what the Lord wants he was quoted as saying in The Saturday Evening Post article that first raised the subject of his candidacy 15 months ago If He were to say Run for President then obviously any man of God would have to obey Mr Robertson no longer mentions heeding Gods instruction Nor does he volunteer comment on speaking in tongues or asking God to heal the sick Charismatics and Pentecostalists believe these gifts are signs of having the Holy Spirit within but they are practices that seem exotic to others and are actually considered demonic by some fundamentalists Such opposing views illustrate the warring perspectives within the evangelical tent which houses many doctrinally different factions The charismatics and Pentecostalists came later to the political awakening than the fundamentalists and Mr Robertsons ability to enlist new ranks of voters from these camps draws admiration from strategists for other leading Republican aspirants to the Presidency John P Newport provost of the Southwestern Baptist Theological Seminary in Fort Worth said he thought the spread of charismatic Christianity was the fastestgrowing phenomenon in North America Charismatics who stand ready to be energized by Mr Robertson believe they can discern the will of God he said Obviously he said this is sort of scary Some Doubts Persist About His Appeal Mr Robertson has proved that he can galvanize the faithful legions waiting to be Godled and that their numbers can be effective in caucus and convention situations But it remains to be seen whether a large enough percentage of them can be persuaded to turn out and vote in Republican primaries to affect the delegate count And it also remains to be seen said Mr Jarmin the political consultant for the religious right whether Mr Robertson could unite all the strains within the evangelical community or whether he could appeal to voters beyond it Republican strategists and consultants in other quarters say Mr Robertson cannot attract broad enough support to win the nomination Nor is the partys ideological posture likely to be affected by a Robertson candidacy they say because his social stands are already the partys But if he should run and fail a segment of contemporary Christianity could be left stranded on unfamiliar secular ground facing a crisis of faith Ive seen this happen before in local races Mr Jarmin said They run They fail Then they say to themselves I thought this was ordained of God What happened 
"The Hubbard Poll: Move Over, Gallup",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/24/us/the-hubbard-poll-move-over-gallup.html,Members of Congress use all kinds of measures to gauge their constituents feelings on national issues They read and count the mail for example and they meet with individuals constituent groups and lobbyists Representative Carroll Hubbard Jr Democrat of Kentucky has a broader approach While many members do at least some polling Mr Hubbard has made a tradition of it his aides say Annually for 12 years he has mailed out about 200000 questionnaires trying to reach every constituent in his western Kentucky district And he says the responses while not scientific help guide my voting I dont always vote just to please the majority Mr Hubbard emphasized But he added that the responses to the questionnaire  he has received about 34000 so far this year help him to stay in touch with his constituents Its always helpful to know what my constituents are thinking when Im considering these issues he said The most remarkable thing about the poll results he says is that although some opinions have changed over the years most of the answers have stayed pretty much the same One area where Mr Hubbard said he had noticed a discernible shift in opinion was on the abortion question It used to run about 3070 with 30 percent in favor of the Supreme Courts decision to permit legalized abortion he said But it gets closer every year Mr Hubbards survey this year which covers issues as diverse as legalized abortion and airquality legislation so far shows 14340 constituents in favor of the abortion decision and 18658 opposed Mr Hubbard himself is opposed As valuable as the polling data are the size of the sample makes compiling the results an onerous task So to relieve his staff of the time required to pull the responses together Mr Hubbard has enlisted the support of several Kentucky political science professors and their students Mr Hubbards wife Carol also takes a turn at tabulating he added And while the constituents views are always important they sometimes have to vie for attention with other powerful voices On the issue of aid to antiCommunist guerrillas in Nicaragua for instance Mr Hubbards constituency registered its disapproval though by a close margin But Mr Hubbard who said he was genuinely undecided on the issue noted that he was on his way to a luncheon today at the White House where Reagan Administration officials were preparing to make their case poll or no poll

Topics; Presidential Insults: On 'Murder',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/opinion/topics-presidential-insults-on-murder.html,Last January the President of the United States told a member of the National RighttoLife Committee that an end to bombings and other violence would earn the movement a lot of Brownie points This week he himself committed the crudest rhetorical violence In opposing abortion Mr Reagan said I dont think that Im trying to do something that is taking a privilege away from womanhood because I dont think that womanhood should be considering murder a privilege Mr Reagan has long opposed abortion and its no secret that he would like to see the Supreme Court overturn Roe v Wade its decision that made abortion legal But one does not expect the President  precisely because he is the President  to hurl such gratuitous invective at those who hold different views By calling the millions of American women who have chosen to end their pregnancies murderers Mr Reagan moves from the picket line against abortion toward the ranks of those who aim to punish and even harm people who disagree Their cause was always Mr Reagans cause and so it seems now is their language
Nothing Centrist About Abortion Decision,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/25/opinion/l-nothing-centrist-about-abortion-decision-708886.html,To the Editor Your editorial praising the latest Supreme Court abortion decision The Court Pushes Back Landslides Do Not Legitimize Extremists June 12 proclaims that the Court has saved us from the hard right positions which the Reagan Administration would impose upon the country and has pushed us back to the decent center and the bipartisan social consensus developed over three decades If the Reagan opposition to abortion is the hard right position what is the hard left position that puts the Court in the center It is difficult to imagine any position to the left of the one taken by the Court that abortion is a constitutionally protected right which prohibits a state even from collecting information about abortions or requiring that women be informed of the risks involved or the alternatives to abortion What would the more extreme left position be That women are constitutionally required to have abortions It might be argued more plausibly that Associate Justice Byron R Whites dissent is in the center that the Constitution says nothing about abortion pro or con and that the American people should be free to resolve the issue through their elected representatives There was an uneasy bipartisan social consensus on abortion enacted into law by majorities in the several states before the 1973 Roe v Wade decision But the Supreme Court disrupted that consensus by the Roe decision pushing the country to the hard left There has been no consensus since You may disagree with the Reagan position but you can hardly argue that the President has disrupted a social consensus that was destroyed by the Court itself more than a decade ago GLEN E THUROW Associate Professor of Politics University of Dallas Irving Tex June 12 1986
RESULTS OF ALABAMA PRIMARY MAY BE CHALLENGED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/26/us/results-of-alabama-primary-may-be-challenged.html,State Attorney General Charles Graddick said today that unofficial returns proved he won a razorthin victory in the Democratic gubernatorial runoff primary Tuesday in Alabama But his opponent Lieut Gov Bill Baxley would not concede and may demand a recount While Mr Graddick paid a 55minute courtesy call this morning on Gov George C Wallace the venerable but ailing political icon he aims to succeed Mr Baxley huddled with aides to go over returns that show him losing by 6602 votes of 926569 cast It was the narrowest margin ever recorded in a statewide political race in Alabama Mr Graddick said that Mr Baxley told him today that he would not challenge the vote But aides to Mr Baxley who was not available to reporters said privately that a votebyvote challenge was being considered Party officials will canvass the tally this weekend and the results will be sent to state officials Monday for certification Mr Graddicks margin is fewer than two votes for each of the states 4230 precincts Election Materials Impounded Because of the close vote and fears of vote tampering Mr Graddick asked an Alabama judge Tuesday night to issue an order impounding all election materials to prevent tampering But the judges order caused confusion among county voting officials and today the state Democratic Party chairman John Baker said that a national accounting firm would be employed to help party officials insure an accurate canvass of county returns Mr Graddicks victory in an election to choose the Democratic successor to Mr Wallace would mean that the postWallace political era in Alabama would begin on a conservative political footing Mr Graddick 41 years old a former Republican from Mobile who switched party allegiance 10 years ago is a staunch conservative His support Tuesday was described by political experts as nearly identical with the constituency of the surburban and rural upper and middleincome white voters who carried Alabama for President Reagan in 1984 He received little support from black voters who make up about 25 percent of the Democratic Partys registration in the state Only a few months ago Mr Graddick who finished second to Mr Baxley in a crowded field of five Democrats in the first primary June 3 was given little chance of winning A TwoParty Election The election Tuesday was not a Democratic primary said Gerald Johnson a political science professor at Auburn University It was a twoparty election between a conservative Republican who happened to be running as a Democrat and a traditional Democrat Some supporters of Mr Baxley said they were concerned that voters who cast ballots in the Republican primary on June 3 might have crossed over in Tuesdays balloting to vote for Mr Graddick in the Democratic primary Marty Connors the executive director of the Alabama Republican Party said Republicans provided the vital margin for Mr Graddick They were panicked that a liberal like Mr Baxley might win he said But Mr Baker said he thought that the number of crossover voters was statistically insignificant He said that the party did not plan to challenge the crossover ballots although Mr Baxley might choose to do so Mr Baker was among Democratic Party leaders who had gone to court in an attempt to block the crossover voting by Republicans earlier this week saying it violated party rules But a Mobile County judge said any attempt by election officials to block such crossover voting was itself illegal In the November election Mr Graddick would face Guy Hunt a 52yearold farmer and businessman who won the Republican Partys gubenatorial nomination June 3 But Mr Hunt is given little if any chance in the race The defeat of Mr Baxley a former Attorney General who was once described as the boy wonder of Alabama politics seemed to deal a sharp setback to more liberal elements in the state including blacks labor leaders state employees and school teachers who in recent years had come to dominate the Democratic Party leadership Mr Graddick said One thing the election showed was that the Democratic Party in Alabama had wandered too far away from mainstream Alabamians and I think we got to bring it back In his campaign Mr Graddick did not seek endorsements from the states major black political leaders and he critized Mr Baxley in television commercials for having the support of black politicians Mr Graddick who has served for eight years as Attorney General is an advocate of capital punishment and a foe of abortion He vowed in the campaign to purge the schools of homosexual teachers NameCalling Campaign Mr Graddick won by galvinizing white voters by appealing to racism said J L Chestnut Jr a lawyer in Selma who is the chairman of the New South Coalition one of the two key black political groups that had endorsed the 45yearold Mr Baxley His election is a step backwards for Alabama The threeweek runoff campaign was marked by namecalling and accusations of racial politics and was described by some as the dirtiest campaign in the state since 1970 when Mr Wallace played on white fears to defeat Gov Albert Brewer Governor Wallace announced last April that he would not seek a fifth term as Governor citing failing health and the pain from an assassination attempt in 1972 that left him paralyzed below the waist Mr Wallace 66 who dominated the states political scene over three decades declined to endorse any gubernatorial candidate in the primary His son George Wallace Jr won the Democratic nomination as State Treasurer
THE ADOPTION MARKET: A VARIETY OF OPTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/26/garden/the-adoption-market-a-variety-of-options.html,EILEEN thought she would never have a child of her own She had put off starting a family because of her career and then found herself at the age of 41 a vice president of a Wall Street brokerage firm divorced and infertile When she tried to adopt a baby she learned that licensed agencies rarely arranged adoptions of infants for single parents and almost never if a parent was 40 or over She tried to adopt a foreignborn infant but it took her a year just to get the proper forms Everybody in the world had to know what I was doing said Eileen who is attractive has gray hair bright blue eyes and until recently lived alone with a Persian cat It was the most humiliating kind of process Finally Eileen who asked that her last name not be used turned to the gray market the legal but controversial world of private adoption A lawyer suggested she place ads in several smalltown newspapers and three months later she stood in a hospital delivery room as her adoptive son Andrew was born In exchange she paid the biological mothers hospital bills I spent so many years believing it was impossible Eileen said the other day at her home as Andrew now almost 3 months old wriggled beside her on the couch Now when I see a young couple around I want to stop them and say Dont put it off  At a time when parents seeking to adopt outnumber adoptable American infants  as much as 100 to 1 by some estimates  more people frustrated in their search to adopt infants from agencies are turning to lawyers doctors the clergy and other sources to arrange what are known as independent adoptions In 1982 the number of children adopted in this gray market actually exceeded the number adopted through licensed private agencies the first time that has happened since 1961 according to the most recent statistics collected by the National Committee for Adoption a Washingtonbased lobbying group for adoption agencies The number of adoptions made through licensed private agencies decreased to 14549 in 1982 from 18100 in 1975 while the number of independent adoptions increased to 16743 in 1982 from 11000 in 1975 according to the committees statistics There are three ways to adopt a child through a public agency when the child has become the responsibility of the state through a private adoption agency when a child is either referred by the state or the mother goes directly to the agency or through a private adoption independently arranged by the childs parents with the help of a third party The majority of infants are adopted independently said Dr William L Pierce the president of the Committee for Adoption The agencies simply do not have the infants the couples are looking for he said The New York Foundling Hospital for example one of the most respected and oldest private adoption agencies in the country last year arranged for two adoptions by white couples seeking infants of their own race according to Cecilia Rivera Healy the director of adoption She said her waiting list for such adoptions has hundreds of couples on it For white infants its been very scarce for a number of years she said There was a time about 20 years ago when New York Foundling had many many white infants Its decreased and I think now its less than ever Adoption agency officials say that they are looking for people to adopt older children and children with disabilities Adoptions of foreignborn children have nearly doubled from 4868 in 1981 to 8327 in 1984 Dr Pierce said Some 60 percent of the children adopted are born in Korea But the number of American infants put up for adoption childwelfare officials say has shrunk because today there are fewer taboos against abortion and against a mothers raising her child out of wedlock At the same time according to adoption officials more people are seeking to adopt because more women like Eileen are delaying having children to pursue careers Infertility therapy groups estimate that as many as one in five couples of reproductive age have difficulty conceiving Both the increased demand for adoptable infants and the decreased supply has led to what Dr Pierce describes as a baby chase atmosphere in the country which has has spurred more graymarket adoptions and the controversy surrounding them An American Bar Association committee which has been trying since 1981 to devise an adoption statute that could be used as a national model has been unable to agree on one because of the debate within the lawyers association over independent adoptions Sanford N Katz a law professor at Boston College who has written three books on adoption including When Parents Fail appointed the original ABA adoption committee in 1981 It was disbanded two years later after its proposed statute was voted down Mr Katz said and a new committee plans to release a new version of the model act at the ABAs winter meeting The controversy surrounds not independent versus agency placement but rather the question is Should there be regulation of the placement of children  Mr Katz said Dr Pierce and the adoption agencies he represents object to independent adoptions because the intermediaries for the most part lawyers have not been trained to find homes for children They also say that the confidentiality of adoptive parents is not protected that custody fights have resulted when biological parents have later sought and successfully won the return of a child that adoptive couples are not adequately screened and that biological parents do not receive enough counseling about their options such as temporarily placing a child with foster parents On the other hand parents who have adopted children independently and the lawyers who represent them say that the biological mothers get a chance to screen prospective parents that the mothers and babies get better medical care because adoptive parents pay for it and that adoptive couples who feel they are qualified to be parents  although they have been rejected by agencies  get a chance to adopt Blanche L Gelber a Manhattan adoption lawyer who works with agencies and advises clients on private adoptions said biological mothers often chose private adoptions to avoid the constant intervention of a social worker from an agency They also have more control and information about the adoptive parents she said Eileen paid 15000 to 20000 primarily in medical costs which were higher than average because Andrew was born prematurely In general legal fees range from 1500 to 3500 Independent placements are illegal in nine states Connecticut Delaware Georgia Massachusetts Michigan Minnesota North Dakota Rhode Island and Virginia They are restricted in four others Montana Nebraska New Jersey and Wisconsin But that may be changing There has been pressure in the Connecticut Legislature to make independent adoptions legal There is a move by states to liberalize adoptions Dr Pierce said Many of the protections which would otherwise be present are being eroded
SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; MOST AIRLINES HELD EXEMPT ON HANDICAPPED RIGHTS RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/28/us/supreme-court-roundup-most-airlines-held-exempt-on-handicapped-rights-rule.html,The Supreme Court ruled today that almost all commercial airlines are not covered by a 1973 Federal law that bars discrimination against handicapped people The Justices in a 6to3 vote reversed a Federal appellate courts ruling that upset Federal regulations exempting most airlines from detailed antidiscrimination rules Those regulations had been challenged by groups representing handicapped passengers The fact that airlines benefit from Federal aid to airports and the Federal air traffic control system the Supreme Court ruled does not bring them under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which bars discrimination against handicapped people in any program or activity receiving Federal financial assistance Only airlines that actually receive Federal financial aid are covered by the law in their onboard activities Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr wrote in the majority opinion Only a few small airlines receive such aid Reagan Administrations Victory The decision today also appears to affect three other similarly worded Federal civil rights laws which bar discrimination on grounds of race sex and age It would appear that those laws too would apply only to recipients of direct or indirect Federal aid It was a victory for the Reagan Administration which had appealed the Federal appellate decision Todays ruling was based in part on the Courts ruling in the 1984 Grove City College case which accepted the Administrations narrow reading of a similarly worded Federal law that bars sex discrimination by colleges that receive Federal money The Court ruled then that the law barred sex discrimination only in those departments or programs that received Federal aid not by a college as a whole Legislation pending in Congress to overrule the 1984 decision has broad support but has been stalled by a dispute over a relatively minor abortion regulation Supporters of the legislation said they hoped the decision today would give it new impetus The Courts ruling may be important chiefly as a legal precedent exempting from antidiscrimination laws activities by private concerns that benefit from Federal programs but do not directly receive Federal money or other aid It will probably have little immediate practical effect on air travel by handicapped people They have a general vaguely worded right not to be discriminated against in air transportation under a section of the regulations that was not challenged in the case decided today But Arlene Battis alawyer with the Paralyzed Veterans of America which had challenged the Department of Transportation regulations said today that full Section 504 coverage was needed to prevent some airlines from continuing such practices as requiring handicapped people to have attendants with them when they fly and to sit on blankets in case they are incontinent Even if the decision had gone the other way it would not have required airlines to make costly structural alterations to planes to accommodate handicapped people Appeals Courts Ruling A threejudge Federal appeals court panel here had ruled that the law covered all commercial air travel because airlines benefited so pervasively from Federal assistance to airports Justice Powell said this reasoning was contrary to the intent of Congress for it would give section 504 almost limitless coverage drawing in whole classes of persons and businesses with only an indirect relation to aviation as well as trucking concerns that use federally financed interstate highways and those that use port facilities The airlines do not actually receive the aid he said They only benefit from airports use of the aid Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall in a dissent joined by Associate Justices William J Brennan Jr and Harry A Blackmun said commercial airlines that required handicapped passengers to submit to conditions not imposed on other passengers discriminatorily deny the handicapped the benefits of federally funded programs or activities supporting the airport and airway system He said airlines necessarily act as gatekeepers controlling who shall enjoy and under what conditions important benefits under federally funded and conducted programs Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Associate Justices Byron R White William H Rehnquist John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day OConnor joined the majority opinion in the case United States v Paralyzed Veterans No 85289 The Court also took these actions today Food Stamp Rules The Justices voted 6 to 3 to uphold amendments to the Federal Food Stamp Program that make it harder for parents children and siblings who live in the same home to obtain benefits than for more distant relatives or groups of unrelated people who live in the same home The amendments enacted by Congress in 1981 and 1982 to protect against fraud and abuse generally treat parents children and siblings who live together as a single household even if they do not buy food and prepare meals together assigning them smaller benefits than they would receive if they were treated as separate households In the case Lyng v Castillo No 85250 the Justices reversed a Federal District Court in Texas and upheld the amendments as a rational way of seeking to prevent fraud or mistakes in a huge program Sex Discrimination The Court unanimously ruled that a Federal appellate court should not have blocked an investigation by the Ohio Civil Rights Commission of a sex discrimination complaint by a former teacher against a religious school The case Ohio Civil Rights Commission v Dayton Christian Schools No 85488 began when a teacher at Dayton Christian Schools became pregnant and school officials told her she could not work the following year because of the schools religious belief that a mother should stay home with small her chldren When the teacher consulted a lawyer she was dismissed She filed a sex discrimination charge with the Ohio Civil Rights Commission but the school obtained an order from a Federal appellate court barring the commission from proceeding against it The appellate court said enforcement of the sex discrimination law against the school would violate its First Amendment right to free exercise of religion and the separation of church and state Justice Rehnquist wrote for the High Court that the lower Federal courts should have abstained from exercising jurisdiction over the case because of the need to respect comity and Federalism Four members of the Court did not join his opinion but agreed that Federal court intervention at the investigative stage was premature
G.O.P. GATHERING CONSIDERS POLITICAL LIFE AFTER REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/us/gop-gathering-considers-political-life-after-reagan.html,Republican Party leaders today ended a threeday meeting here that publicly celebrated the political vitality of the Reagan Presidency and privately wrestled with the longterm implications of his latest victories on Capital Hill Our main advantage right now is the strength of Ronald Reagan and the weakness of the Democrats said one participant at this meeting of the Republican National Committee The question is how will the party fare on its own That question seemed to be at the center of the discussions here Despite the partys dramatic gains under Mr Reagans leadership officials said its national coalition was fragile Our party cannot afford to rest on its laurels Frank J Fahrenkopf Jr the committee chairman told the gathering The fact that a majority of Republicans today are under 40 presents us with a responsibility to look to the future to promote bold solutions for the 21st century This is the only way we can continue our growth as a party Mitch Daniels a White House political aide urged party leaders to savor one of the most dramatic and historic weeks of the Reagan Presidency Mr Daniels saying that even some of Mr Reagans aides were surprised by his success on Capitol Hill called attention to the Senates passage of a major tax bill and the Democraticcontrolled Houses approval of the 100 million in aid Mr Reagan had sought for the Nicaraguan rebels He said that only a parliamentary maneuver by Democrats kept the Senate from confirming the nomination of Daniel A Manion as a Federal appeals court judge in Chicago Better Prospects Seen Mr Daniels assistant to the President for political and intergovernmental affairs said these issues had strengthened the Presidents authority and the reelection prospects of Republican Senate candidates this fall He said the tax bill would erase the lingering stereotype that we are the party of wealth and big business Some Republicans and political professionals said they saw no signs that the tax bill which cleared the Senate on a vote of 97 to 3 was emerging as an issue in the fall campaign They also expressed concern that the issue of aiding the Nicaraguan rebels could be risky for their party Most public opinion polls show that Americans by a substantial majority are opposed to Mr Reagans policy toward Nicaragua Another uncertainty some Republicans said in interviews was how voters would react to Mr Reagans appointment of conservative Federal judges especially if their decisions reversed longstanding court rulings on abortion school prayer and other social issues The Manion nomination appears to have already created political problems for at least one Republican Senator Slade Gorton of Washington Mr Gorton voted in favor of the nomination after the White House agreed to clear the Senators choice for a Federal district judgeship in his state His Democratic opponent Brock Adams accused Mr Gorton of selling out his principles and vowed to make vote an issue in their campaign Concern Over Blacks In panel discussions Republicans exchanged views on how to expand their partys base especially among blacks Mr Fahrenkopf in his address Friday said Republicans could not afford to wait for blacks to come to the belief that they had benefited from Mr Reagans economic policies We as a party have an additional challenge with the black community he said Republicans do not intend to turn their backs on black America its history or its problems In private conversations some Republicans expressed concern that the partys effort in this area would be futile if the Reagan Administration was seen as abandoning civil rights programs and those seeking to increase job opportunities for blacks There also seemed to be mixed views on how the religious right would fit into the partys future Some Republican state chairmen said Christian fundamentalism in politics had the potential to bring into the party conservative Democrats and voters who have not been active in either party But Don Moseley a district party chairman from Virginia said that in his state religious fundamentalists had shown more interest in promoting single candidates or single issues I dont think the majority of these singleissue people stay in the party for long he said Theyre in and then theyre out We want people in our party as individuals and not as a bloc White House Assailed on Manion WASHINGTON June 28 AP  A Democratic senator today accused Mr Reagan and Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d of threatening the independence of the Federal judiciary by making deals to win Senate confirmation of Mr Manion Judicial pork barreling is dead wrong Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware said in the Democrats weekly radio address It was clear that a majority of the Senate did not favor the Manion confirmation Mr Biden said But when it came time to vote the White House made a deal with some senators by agreeing to appoint individuals to the Federal bench that the President or Ed Meese had opposed only hours ago
THE NATION; ALABAMA PRIMARY ENDS UP A SQUEAKER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/29/weekinreview/the-nation-alabama-primary-ends-up-a-squeaker.html,WHEN voters went to the polls here in last weeks Democratic gubernatorial runoff they were not only choosing a candidate to succeed the retiring George Corley Wallace they were also helping to chart a new political course for Alabama or so they might have thought For years this has been one of the few remaining New South states with an Old Southstyle governor But the postWallace era got off to a shaky start After a meanspirited campaign fraught with namecalling suggestions of marital infidelity and accusations of racial politics conservative state Attorney General Charles Graddick claimed a waferthin victory over Lieut Gov Bill Baxley a populist who had been the longtime favorite to succeed Mr Wallace The election was so close that the results are almost certain to be challenged in a recount With more than 926500 votes cast unofficial returns showed Mr Graddick with a 6602 vote lead the narrowest margin ever recorded in a statewide political contest At weeks end Mr Baxley still had not conceded Mr Graddick citing fears of vote tampering caused some confusion among local officials when late on election night he obtained a court order impounding ballot boxes Democratic party leaders subsequently hired an accounting firm to help canvass the results before turning them over to state election administrators this week for formal certification To the distress of many Democrats here Mr Graddick a former Republican who switched parties only 10 years ago had urged Republicans to vote for him in Tuesdays runoff Republicans have their own nominee Guy Hunt a farmer and businessman in the November election If Mr Graddick eventually prevails the postWallace era in Alabama politics will have a distinctly conservative tone An outspoken foe of abortion and advocate of capital punishment Mr Graddick portrayed himself as an independentminded politician not beholden to any camp His constituency last week was not unlike the one that carried Alabama for President Reagan in 1984  conservative white voters from the small towns and wellheeled suburbs of Alabamas larger cities Blacks in Alabama who make up a fourth of the registered Democrats voted overwhelmingly for Mr Baxley After helping reelect Mr Wallace to his fourth and final term in 1982 black leaders wasted little time in describing the election of Mr Graddick as a step backwards The contest between the two men who emerged in front of a field of five Democrats on June 3 seemed more like a general election than a party primary If Mr Graddick was the choice of white Republicanleaning conservatives Mr Baxleys candidacy was founded on the traditional Democratic coalition of blacks union leaders and school teachers who have dominated the party leadership and the Legislature in recent years Mr Graddick vowed last week to work against those groups and to bring the party leadership more in line with what he called the mainstream thinking of Alabamians But first Mr Graddick who began his campaign last winter as an underdog will have to survive possible challenges to an election that was decided by fewer than two votes apiece in each of the states 4230 precincts

The Senators' Judicial 'Litmus',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/06/30/opinion/the-senators-judicial-litmus.html,For more than a year now the Senate Judiciary Committee has struggled to thwart President Reagans constitutionally rooted power of appointment First William Bradford Reynolds failed to win approval to be associate attorney general More recently Jefferson B Sessions 3d was refused support for a district judgeship And now the confirmation of Daniel Manion under attack from the liberal left in and out of Government has been held up by parliamentary maneuver What has been common to all three cases is the alleged objectivity of the attack competence not ideology was said to be the Senators primary criterion But now the ideological cat is out of the senatorial bag Following the Presidents recent nominations to the United States Supreme Court Senator Paul Simon confessed that ideology is a reasonable consideration for the Senate to make in judging the qualifications of Judge Antonin Scalia and Justice William H Rehnquist The partisan politics involved in this process is interesting in and of itself But it is not the cause for the deepest concern Much more troubling is the nearly suffocating liberal juridical dogma that pervades the media and the legal professoriate The real problem is not the Senate but the opinions of those  men like Laurence H Tribe of Harvard University Law School and Herman Schwartz of American University Law School  upon whom many Senators are likely to depend The basic ideological argument being raised against the Reagan appointments is that they are too much in lockstep with the Presidents own conservatism The need the critics are already insisting is for judges who are truly independent judges who will have the moral fortitude to stand against the ideological tides that wash through our politics This is at best a disingenuous argument For what the critics demand is not in fact intellectual independence but slavish intellectual conformity  conformity with the Warren Court liberalism that has for so long corrupted our law schools and tainted our judicial politics It is a mindless and strident liberalism that Ronald Reagan twice showed to be on the way out  if indeed not already vanquished Critics of the Reagan judiciary have long bewailed the Administrations alleged use of a conservative litmus test in choosing whom to appoint to the Federal bench Yet now the Senate is threatening to do exactly that many critics now insist that it is essential to question Judge Scalia and Justice Rehnquist on particular substantive issues such as abortion and school prayer What this means in a nutshell is that the critics would have the Senate approve only judges who subscribe to the current academic orthodoxy that holds that there should be no difference between constitutional law and moral theory This view dangerously stretches the Constitution yet those who reject it are branded as heretics and readied to be burned at the stake of academic opinion These scholarly fires of ideological loathing are regularly stoked by publications such as the Harvard Law Review and The New York Review of Books The fact of the matter is that there are two majorities out there One is the general public whose sentiments have been galvanized and expressed by the President The other is the legal profession especially in the law schools It is not clear why the biases of a single profession should be more compelling than the general sense of the American people as a whole But what is clear is that a judge or justice should be both willing and able to resist both majorities in defense of constitutional principle And that is what those nominated by the President have all been about The ever prescient Alexis de Tocqueville observed long ago that Federal judges must be statesmen able to steer out of the current when the tide threatens to carry them away and with them the sovereignty of the Union and obedience to its laws Steering out of the rushing swirling currents of contemporary academic opinion may very well be the greatest task facing any judge or justice today What bothers the critics the most apparently is that the Presidents nominees seem quite capable of meeting that challenge

"HIGH COURT, 5-4, SAYS STATES HAVE THE RIGHT TO OUTLAW PRIVATE HOMOSEXUAL ACTS; PRIVACY LAW AND HISTORY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/01/us/high-court-5-4-says-states-have-right-outlaw-private-homosexual-acts-privacy-law.html,With its decision today that the constitutional right to privacy does not extend to homosexual conduct the Supreme Court interrupted the expansion of the concept of privacy on which it embarked more than 60 years ago The 5to4 majority drew a sharp line of demarcation between those choices that are fundamental to heterosexual life whether and whom to marry whether to conceive a child whether to carry a pregnancy to term  and the decision to engage in homosexual acts The heterosexual choices fall within the zone of privacy that the Court has defined with greater or lesser clarity in dozens of cases The line stretches back to a pair of decisions in the mid1920s that gave parents the right to make basic choices about their childrens education and more recently includes rulings on contraception and abortion No Resemblance to Precedents Writing for the majority today Associate Justice Byron R White canvassed those precedents and then observed We think it evident that none of the rights announced in those cases bears any resemblance to the claimed constitutional right of homosexuals to engage in acts of sodomy that is asserted in this case Arguments to the contrary Justice White said were insupportable and facetious The Court looked to history for reasons that the constitutional boundary should be so immutable why the zone of privacy should not extend to intimate relations between people of the same sex Condemnation of homosexuality Justice White wrote has ancient roots The Georgia law at issue dates to 1816 The original 13 states all outlawed homosexual acts as did all 50 states until 1961 Since then either legislation or court decisions have made private homosexual acts between consenting adults no longer criminal in 26 states Second Basis for Decision The Court frequently uses history as a guide although not invariably For example it overlooked history in 1967 when it declared unconstitutional a Virginia law that barred interracial marriage Sixteen states had such laws at the time and Virginia defended its statute on the ground that it protected traditional moral values But there was a second basis for the decision today that offers an insight into the Courts current mood extending beyond the constitutional question at hand The Court would not seek to discover new fundamental rights Justice White said because the Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when its decisions are not rooted in the language or design of the Constitution He said this was painfully demonstrated by the faceoff between the Executive and the Court in the 1930s a reference to President Roosevelts abortive effort to pack a Supreme Court that had invoked the Constitution to block many New Deal programs By expanding the list of fundamental rights Justice White said the judiciary necessarily takes to itself further authority to govern the country without express constitutional authority The Consensus Factor This portion of the opinion was an unusually explicit discussion of a factor that is always present when the Court finds itself at the frontiers of constitutional law the Courts sense of where its judgment fits within the broader social consensus Historically many Justices have believed that to place the Court too far ahead of the consensus too often is to hurt the institution to make it vulnerable to use Justice Whites word to attack from the political branches In this context Justice White did not mention the Courts landmark privacy decision Roe v Wade which established abortion as a constitutional right But he and William H Rehnquist the Chief Justicedesignate who also joined todays opinion were the two dissenters in the 1973 abortion case They have dissented from all the subsequent decisions expanding on the principles of Roe v Wade The Court is keenly aware that the political furor over Roe v Wade has yet to die down The fact that Justices White and Rehnquist garnered a majority for the decision today may indicate that the Court simply has no appetite for venturing once again into uncharted territory The expected arrival of Antonin Scalia will not change that mood it is virtually certain based on his judicial and scholarly writing that he would have voted with the majority Chief Justice Warren E Burger who is retiring next month voted in the majority Other Challenges Possible In addressing itself to the issue of homosexual acts the Court did not foreclose other constitutional challenges to other laws affecting the rights of homosexuals such as a challenge based on the 14th Amendments equal protection guarantee to laws that discriminate against homosexuals in such areas as housing and employment Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who provided the majoritys crucial fifth vote today suggested in a concurring opinion that the Eighth Amendments prohibition against cruel and unusual punishment might bar prison sentences for homosexual acts The four Justices who dissented Harry A Blackmun John Paul Stevens William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall offered a drastically different vision of the right to privacy Justice Blackmun said the issue was more profound than merely the choice of sexual act but rather encompassed as well what he called the fundamental interest all individuals have in controlling the nature of their intimate associations with others His dissenting opinion was a strongly worded plea for expanding the zone of privacy to encompass human sexuality in all its forms traditional or not approved by society at large or not as long as the parties involved are consenting adults That is not an invitation that the Court is likely to accept in the foreseeable future
"PRIVATE-EYE DRAMA, ABC'S 'SPENSER: FOR HIRE'",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/01/arts/private-eye-drama-abc-s-spenser-for-hire.html,AFTER tumbling to the bottom of the ratings ABC is hardpressed to find bright spots on its programming schedule these days but in a pinch Spenser For Hire would be a moderately promising candidate The ratings for the detective series in its first season were of the borderline variety but given the rest of ABCs lineup the show attracted enough interest and reviewer support to merit renewal Spenser For Hire will be back in the fall Considering its promise more than its achievement the show deserves the break Based on the novels of Robert B Parker who has been devising approximately one Spenser caper a year since the early 1970s the series stars Robert Urich as the Boston private detective who left the police force because the rules cramped his unorthodox wisecracking style When not disabling or annihilating the standard mix of urban thugs and swindlers Spenser is partial to quoting poetry especially Wordsworth Today Mr Parkers Spenser would be fiftyish Mr Urichs developed for television by John Wilder is a wellpreserved fortyish Such presumably are the hunk demands of prime time Spenser lives with a woman named Susan Barbara Stock and has a complicated tough but tender friendship with a man named Hawk Avery Brooks In any event played to a spiffily wicked turn by Mr Brooks Hawk is an intriguing creation whether working out with Spenser at the local gym or prowling around the city in his expensive clothes and luxury car He always seems to know a little more than anyone else and he is apparently physically invincible In fact he almost steals the show One curious problem with the series so far is that Spenser is a touch too nice He has lost the ironic edge of the original Mr Parkers hero is indeed like most fictional detectives mired in hardboiled sentimentality He can dream of a more comforting past where as one novel puts it theres a kind of mellowness and a memory of another time and another America But a moment later he can sadly admit that it probably never was America though Televisions Spenser shies away from the more uncomfortable perspective Still if Mr Parker had to produce one novel a year this single season of the television series has been forced to churn out some 28 episodes which ABC is currently running on Tuesdays at 10 PM Not surprisingly many of the plots are merely serviceable dotted with the perfunctory shootouts and car chases Nevertheless the series has managed to establish a distinctive personality The key characters are well conceived as are such regulars as the police lieutenant Richard Jaeckel and the police sergeant Ron McLarty Furthermore and not least a good deal of the location shooting is actually done in Boston lending the shows a precise and welldefined sense of place which is rare in American prime time Tonights installment has Spenser looking for an illegal alien The twist the mans helpless son is being held as bait by an overzealous immigration official This is fairly ordinary Spenser and rather pedestrian television But occasionally the series takes an unexpected turn getting into areas that are beyond the average privateeye thriller In one episode for instance rebroadcast last week Spenser and Susan find themselves confronting the fact of her pregnancy Written by Robert Hamilton that story begins with Spenser killing after the requisite chase through crowded streets a twobit hoodlum who had been contracted to murder him But then Spenser learns from Hawk that the dead man had two young children both of whom seem delighted that they will never have to see their father again Taking the youngsters under his wing temporarily Spenser begins to notice that Susan is looking troubled and distant Finally guessing that shes pregnant he urges her to have the baby but she is reluctant to give a child life with a father who is constantly on the edge of violence and uncertainty Watching Spenser winning the affections of the dead mans children Susan exasperated by his sense of justice and obligation asks Are you ever going to realize you cant take on the world Sure he says when I grow up Susan is charmed but not convinced In the final scene she is in a hospital bed obviously having had an abortion A disappointed Spenser confides Susan and I had gone to war but still unyielding loved each other Guess thats the only road to peace Any privateeye format has its limitations There is not much room for character development The only significant change in Mr Parkers Spenser over nearly 14 years is that he has switched from bourbon to Irish whisky Still as a reciter of poetry and an amateur chef of some sensitivity tough sarcastic Spenser should be able to snare a quality television run for himself Kojak did it with a lollipop And Mr Urich is prettier than Telly Savalas
"HIGH COURT, 5-4, SHARPLY LIMITS CONSTITUTIONAL PROTECTION FOR ADS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/business/high-court-5-4-sharply-limits-constitutional-protection-for-ads.html,The Supreme Court sharply limiting First Amendment protection for commercial speech today ruled 5 to 4 that governments may sometimes ban truthful advertising of products and services that are legal to sell The decision upheld Puerto Ricos tight restrictions on local advertising of casino gambling which is legal there It also appeared to support the constitutionality of restrictions on advertising of liquor and perhaps of cigarettes and other products Associate Justice William H Rehnquists majority opinion suggested broadly but somewhat ambiguously that states can ban or restrict advertising of products or activities deemed harmful such as cigarettes alcoholic beverages and prostitution A Lesser Step for States Justice Rehnquist reasoned that if it would be constitutional for a state to prohibit the sale of a product deemed harmful then the state may also take the lesser step of banning or restricting advertising of that product without banning its sale He rejected arguments by major news organizations advertising groups the American Newspaper Publishers Association and others as friends of the Court that Puerto Ricos restrictions on casino advertising were contrary to the Courts previous First Amendment rulings Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr dissenting accused the majority of dramatically shrinking the scope of First Amendment protection available to commercial speech and giving government officials unprecedented authority to eviscerate constitutionally protected expression Associate Justice John Paul Stevens dissented separately Associate Justices Thurgood Marshall and Harry A Blackmun signed both dissents Justice Brennan said the Puerto Rico law clearly violates the First Amendment because a government may not suppress truthful commercial speech in order to discourage its residents from engaging in lawful activity Puerto Rico had argued that the advertising curbs were supported by its interest in allowing casinos to operate to attract tourist dollars while protecting the islands own residents from excessive involvement in casino gambling saying it would lead to the disruption of moral and cultural patterns and increase local crime such as prostitution and corruption A Puerto Rico court in upholding the restrictions on casino advertising in 1984 interpreted them as allowing an advertisement in The New York Times or in other print or electronic media aimed at tourists rather than local residents Todays decision Posados de Puerto Rico v Tourism Co No 841903 came in an appeal by a casino owner who had been fined for violating the restrictions Justice Rehnquist said the case was different from previous cases in which the Court has struck down state laws banning advertisement of contraceptives and abortion clinics In those cases he said the underlying conduct that was the subject of the advertising restrictions was constitutionally protected and could not have been prohibited by the state Here on the other hand the Puerto Rico Legislature surely could have prohibited casino gambling by the residents of Puerto Rico altogether he said In our view the greater power to completely ban casino gambling necessarily includes the lesser power to ban advertising of casino gambling Justice Stevens said in his dissent that the Puerto Rico law blatantly discriminates between publications by applying one standard to The New York Times and another to The San Juan Star He said Perhaps since Puerto Rico somewhat ambivalently regards a gambling casino as a good thing for the local proprietor and an evil for the local patrons the ban on local advertising might be viewed as a form of protection against the poison that Puerto Rico uses to attract strangers into its web The effect of todays decision on various existing and proposed restrictions on cigarette advertising is somewhat unclear partly because it is unclear whether it would be unconstitutional for a government to ban cigarette smoking States are empowered to ban liquor sales under the 21st Amendment Leonard Orkin a New York lawyer who specializes in advertising and First Amendment law said the decision was not likely to lead to immediate changes in advertising policies for cigarettes and other products The Puerto Rico case is of interest because of the unusual legal question of whether it is acceptable to distinguish between local advertising and other advertising not because of any broad impact it will have he said Curbs on Cigarette Ads In 1972 before the Court had explicitly recognized that the First Amendment provides a degree of protection for commercial speech it summarily affirmed without explanation an act of Congress barring radio and television advertising of cigarettes More recently the American Medical Association and others have called for a ban on all advertising including print advertising of all tobacco products Last month seven members of the House of Representatives introduced such legislation The Tobacco Institute assailed the proposal as blatantly unconstitutional The American Civil Liberties Union and some First Amendment experts agreed But todays decision could encourage advocates of such legislation The majority opinion suggested broad deference to what Justice Rehnquist called the interest of Puerto Rico or any government in restricting activities it deems harmful to the health safety or welfare of its citizens

Crime in the Bedroom,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/02/opinion/crime-in-the-bedroom.html,A narrow Supreme Court majority taking a narrow view of the rights at stake has given states renewed license to regulate sexual conduct they deem deviant In a 5to4 ruling endorsing Georgias right to declare sodomy a crime the Court crudely rejects as facetious the argument that such a law invades privacy and strikes at deeply personal basic liberties Though many states and cities have lost interest in searching bedrooms all are again free to pry into the private lives not only of homosexuals as in the case at court but also of heterosexual partners and even married couples This was a gratuitous and petty ruling an offense to American societys maturing standards of individual dignity The Court says such intrusive laws have ancient roots So do laws against racial intermarriage contraception and abortion that the Court has rightly struck down as unconstitutional invasions of liberty So does reverence for the home from which British judges long ago barred the King Surely a Constitution that safeguards the individuals right to choose a mate and plan a family without the states instruction has room for a privacy right that protects the most intimate and personal human relations Writing for the Court Justice Byron White mocks the challengers for supposedly claiming that the Federal Constitution confers a fundamental right upon homosexuals to engage in sodomy Surely that formulation perverts the case if not the law It is the right of states to criminalize anal and oral sex  and every Americans private sex  that was at issue Having belittled the danger to liberty Justice White imagines dangers to law He worries that striking down a sodomy law would leave the state powerless to legislate against say incest The easy answer comes in Justice Harry Blackmuns eloquent dissent Obviously no right of privacy can bar the state from protecting the health and safety of minors or innocent offspring And decidedly not at issue though perhaps unduly infecting the Courts judgment was the widespread debate about the states power to regulate sexual practices in public Justice Blackmun addresses these lurking questions squarely It is precisely because the issue raised by this case touches the heart of what makes individuals what they are that we should be especially sensitive to the rights of those whose choices upset the majority Disapproval of homosexuality Justice Blackmun adds cannot justify invading the houses hearts and minds of citizens who choose to live their lives differently    no matter how uncomfortable a certain group may make the majority of this Court Appealing to a calmer time a higher wisdom and a broader grasp of liberty he hopes as all Americans should for a Court that will reconsider and conclude that legislating for the bedroom poses a far greater threat to constitutional values than tolerance of nonconformity could ever do

REBUFF TO ADMINISTRATION; DECISION MAY HALT ITS EFFORTS TO DISMANTLE EMPLOYMENT PLANS THAT SET RACIAL GOALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/03/us/rebuff-administration-decision-may-halt-its-efforts-dismantle-employment-plans.html,The Supreme Courts rulings today on affirmative action amount to a rejection of the policies and arguments that the Reagan Administration has been advancing for six years in the field of civil rights Since President Reagan took office Justice Department officials have argued that numerical hiring and promotion goals were invalid as a remedy for employment discrimination and that relief could be awarded only to identified victims of discrimination The Court explicitly and forcefully rejected that argument today in cases involving a New York labor union and the Cleveland Fire Department Raceconscious remedies including goals may be appropriate where an employer or a labor union has engaged in persistent or egregious discrimination or where necessary to dissipate the lingering effects of pervasive discrimination Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr wrote in a passage summarizing the logic of a majority of the Court Rebuffs for the Administration The ruling is the latest in a series of defeats suffered by the Administration in Supreme Court cases concerned with the essence of Mr Reagans domestic agenda The other cases this year involved abortion voting rights Social Security disability benefits and the treatment of handicapped infants William Bradford Reynolds the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights has denounced raceconscious remedies and numerical goals as morally wrong He has led the Administrations campaign against consent decrees in which state and local governments agreed to use hiring goals to undo the effects of discrimination against black and Hispanic workers and women The Court today said that an employer and employees could voluntarily adopt broader remedies through a consent decree than a judge might have awarded after a trial In practical terms the new decisions will force the Administration to reconsider its allout assault on hiring goals Police and fire departments with affirmative action plans designed to correct historical patterns of discrimination can now keep those programs in place with greater confidence that they will not be struck down But the Administration can plausibly contend that the decision in the New York case applies only to the most blatant instances of race discrimination Repeatedly since 1964 the Court said the sheet metal workers union had been found guilty of discrimination against black and Hispanic workers and the union was twice cited for contempt of court The hallmark of the Reagan Administrations civil rights policy as enunciated by the Justice Department in courts throughout the country has been broad categorical statements about the illegality of racial preferences and numerical goals The Court today delivered 135 pages of opinions full of nuance and thoughtful distinctions thus rejecting the broad prohibition urged by the Solicitor General of the United States Charles Fried We have said that raceconscious remedies which are not victimspecific are never permissible Mr Fried explained The Court has said Not never but hardly ever  In the New York case the High Court upheld a goal remarkable for its specificity 2923 percent of the unions members are to be black or Hispanic by Aug 31 next year This figure reflects the percentage of nonwhites in the relevant labor pool in the New York area The goal was first set by a Federal district judge in 1975 and the deadline for compliance has been repeatedly extended The Supreme Court took these extensions as evidence that the goal was indeed a goal to be reached for not a rigid quota A Tremendous Victory Seen Barry L Goldstein a lawyer with the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc called the decisions a tremendous victory for affirmative action Together he said they constitute a clear rejection of the position argued by the Reagan Justice Department The Justice Department position was enthusiastically endorsed by some members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights including the chairman Clarence M Pendleton Jr who insisted that remedies for discrimination should be limited to individual victims The Courts rulings today reject the logic of these officials arguments as well The rulings may have a decisive effect on the outcome of a battle between Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Labor Secretary Bill Brock The issue is the Justice Departments effort to revise a 1965 executive order under which Federal contractors have been required to hire and promote women and members of minority groups The order is enforced by the Labor Department which requires many contractors to set goals to correct underutilization of women and minoritygroup workers Justice Department Undercut Justice Brennans opinion today in the New York case cited the executive order as evidence that Congress and the Labor Department understood and accepted the use of racial preferences in the years after passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1964 Todays decisions severely undercut the Justice Departments effort to rewrite the executive order to outlaw all racial preferences The Supreme Court did not pass judgment on the Labor Department program for Government contractors But todays decisions strengthen the hand of Secretary Brock in resisting the Justice Departments effort And it virtually guarantees that the current Justice Department proposals will remain stalled at the White House without approval from President Reagan Associate Justice William H Rehnquist Mr Reagans nominee for Chief Justice voted against a majority of the Court in both cases today He condemned what he called the evil of courtsanctioned racial quotas and he said the civil rights law does not allow us to grant relief to blacks who were not actual victims of discrimination His words combined with the cautious careful opinions of Associate Justices Lewis F Powell Jr and Sandra Day OConnor strongly suggest that the outcome might be different another day in another case depending on the details of the affirmative action plan under review
"THE GROUP, 12 YEARS LATER",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/magazine/the-group-12-years-later.html,ALL FIVE women in Norma Goldsteins living room on the Upper West Side of Manhattan feel as if theyve come home Norma a 54yearold pianist settles into a corner of the couch Alice Campagna a 44yearold restaurant owner scours the room for an ashtray Andrea Sedlak a 39yearold senior research scientist pours herself a glass of wine Brenda Boozer 38 an opera singer and Carol Morra 45 an actress catch up on news of each other as they fill their plates with chicken More than a decade ago the five were part of a womens consciousnessraising group initiated by the National Organization for Women They held weekly meetings in the neighborhood  often in this very apartment  between 1972 and 1974 Every Tuesday night they divulged their thoughts feelings and fears about issues prescribed by NOW as being pertinent to consciousnessraising body image first sexual encounters marriage sexism in the workplace aging abortion to name a few Their group  which included at times as many as 11 women  followed the format that had been created by the New York Radical Feminists and modified by NOW A topic from the prepared list was selected for each meeting topics were also introduced by the women themselves Each woman was allowed free space to talk for as long as she liked without interruption Women who were by nature reticent therefore had as much opportunity to speak as women who were inclined to run the show Sometimes there were tears and expressions of anger Sometimes there was the release of communal laughter as on the night each of them learned she was not the only one to be obsessed about her breast size And sometimes there were shocking revelations when one or another confessed to having been abused as a child or to having been raped But mostly there was the freedom to say what was on their minds and the comforting realization that they were all in this together In 1974 having covered all the topics in the NOW format the group disbanded and this is the first time these five women have been together in the same room since Only Norma and Alice still live in New York Andrea has just settled in a Maryland suburb outside Washington Brenda has moved to Westchester County Carol lives in Beverly Hills Calif The reunion brims with nostalgia Remember the night we talked about sexual positions asks Carol laughing It changed my life Norma remembers the evening they invited men and how their presence seemed to alter the womens behavior Alice recalls the first time she ever attended a group meeting I walked into the room and said Wow This is where I belong  There was love in that group says Andrea wistfully Adds Brenda Theres been nothing like it in my life ever since IN THE EARLY 1970S CONSCIOUSnessraising a womanbywoman systematic program of education was among the highest priorities of the womens movement Some date its origins to the mid60s when groups of leftists met in Tampa Fla for selfcriticism sessions using as a focal point the teachings of Mao Zedong The practice made its way north where in 1969 it was incorporated into the manifesto of the Redstockings a radical feminist splinter group By 1972 however consciousnessraising had come under the umbrella of the National Organization for Women which clearly outlined its purposes to break down the barriers between women to encourage open communication among them and to help them develop pride in their sex Some individuals it was understood would use the insights gained in consciousnessraising solely in their personal lives without becoming active in the womens movement But it was hoped that the collective experience would radicalize many of the women and encourage them to become agents for change By 1973 some 80000 to 100000 women across the country belonged to small feminist groups most of which met for consciousnessraising It is a measure of the success of the feminist activism of the 1960s and 70s that the lessons of consciousnessraising are now part of our common cultural rhetoric and that a whole generation of American women have grown up in a society familiar with feminist doctrine Womens rights are an integral part of our social and political discourse In culture and commerce the contributions of women both in general and in particular are sought and recognized with greater consistency than they were a dozen years ago Yet as all idealistic causes must over time feminism has yielded its intensity to other pressing issues and it is evident that the womens movement has slipped into a period of dormancy Women coming of age today though they have benefited from the efforts of the preceding generation particularly in the area of career opportunities have turned away from a collective focus The dwindling number of women who remain activists find themselves largely concentrating on specific projects the establishment of rape crisis centers for example or the campaign against pornography A personalized form of feminism has taken over in the daytoday struggles of women in the home and in the workplace the collective outcry for equality that issued from activists of a generation ago echoes today in the demand for respect by women who refuse to be bullied by bosses colleagues or husbands The stories of the five women at the reunion illustrate this history on an individual scale In 1972 each of them came to the group seeking a feminist perspective on her life Today they still call themselves feminists the term suggests a value system to which they yet subscribe But for them as they look back consciousnessraising appears to have been a mixed blessing It encouraged their pursuit of careers for example but those among them who have not achieved their professional goals are particularly hard on themselves and they are all confounded by the problem of combining work and motherhood In fact the strongest tie that unites the four women who have children is the unqualified pride they take in having been good mothers And for the fifth Andrea childless as yet getting pregnant is her first priority The women are angry that motherhood remains devalued in our society perhaps even more so since women have been encouraged to leave the home They wonder why just being a mother isnt good enough It is one aspect of womanhood they feel feminism has failed to address The five women also discovered that a raised consciousness has not insured their happiness with men They say that a feminist perspective has a way of sabotaging relationships with men whose expectations are rooted in traditional roles or that striving for acrosstheboard equality can lead to debilitating power struggles even in the best of partnerships Norma maintains her marriage was saved by consciousnessraising But Alice a divorced mother in 1972 who is the only single woman in the group today says that the group sessions may have made her relationships with men more difficult Carol realizing her marriage couldnt survive in a feminist context submerged her feminism For all five consciousnessraising amounted to a ceremonial introduction to life as a woman an organized lifesupport system that is largely unavailable to women in our society today In fact when Brenda says There has been nothing like it in my life ever since she could be speaking for tens of thousands of women who struggle in their daily lives to be feminists but who do so without the onceaweek shot in the arm that characterized consciousnessraising In a way it was a little like telling a child she should learn to ride a bike buying the bike for the child convincing her to get on it then vanishing as she wobbled wildly down the street A generation ago feminists argued that womens groups like this one provided women with tools to combat their problems In the portraits below the five women who attended the reunion discuss the circumstances that brought them to consciousnessraising and the events of their lives since they last congregated Did the group make a difference Each of them remembers its eyeopening importance in 1972 But concerning the discoveries the women have made in the intervening years Alice Campagna puts it most succinctly Life she says is not a consciousnessraising group NORMA GOLDSTEIN I have not been able to apply a lot of things I learned in the group to my personal life Norma says I have not pursued a career the way I dreamed it I still feel that to be financially dependent is to be at a serious disadvantage Ive done this to myself and it has been very hard to unravel Normas selfcriticism is a little surprising because she is so clearly an accomplished person She went to the Juilliard School of music on a scholarship and graduated at 19 Four years ago at the age of 50 she graduated summa cum laude from Hunter College majoring in philosophy She has recently taken up oil painting and this spring won a scholarship to the Art Students League Her marriage of 34 years is thriving and she is proud of the job she has done raising her two children Nancy 24 and Steven 19 both of whom live at home Still she finds it hard to account for herself Im disappointed she says Normas dissatisfaction stems from her not realizing the lifelong goal of becoming a concert pianist I want the respect that comes from that kind of achievement she says Ive worked hard at it I gave up my teen years for it After Juilliard she married and though she did play a few small recitals she concentrated on doing what women did then settling down to raise a family She still practices daily and gives lessons But what was once her dream she says has settled down to a little painful pocket of frustration Ironically participation in the group which promoted the notion of individual accomplishment may have resulted in exacerbating her sense of failure She feels herself now a victim of her past ambition and todays emphasis on success I had a friend once who said she woke up every morning and asked herself how she was doing in life and I used to think that was a little crazy Norma says But when I turned 50 I became one of those people But if consciousnessraising was in part responsible for Normas current unease she nonetheless maintains it was an important step To her group she remains hugely grateful I could cry this very minute she says when I think of what it did for me What the group did was save her marriage In 1972 Norma had been married all her life or so it seemed then At 40 she was taking motherhood seriously but her 21year marriage to Bob Goldstein a commercial artist was foundering She heard about consciousnessraising groups at a NOW meeting Immediately upon joining the group she recalls I began to lose the paranoid sense of This is happening only to me and to see my situation as one that all women deal with This is not to say I didnt suffer Even though I understand things now I still suffer But it helped absolutely Norma also gives credit to her husband who unlike many other men who were being confronted with the demands of feminism in their personal lives listened to the news Norma was bringing home week by week He was smart enough and insightful enough to listen to the issues and to see the justice says Norma My marriage has succeeded because of that  because he heard and he understood The oldest member of the group Norma more than the others brought an intellectual rigor to their discussions She alone was fluent in the semantics of feminism reading the works of feminist writers and insisting that the others do so During this time she became practically obsessed with feminism And though over the years the obsession has waned she is experiencing now a rekindled passion This spring she traveled with her daughter to Washington to participate in a prochoice march to the White House Its easy to put feminism on a back burner unless theres an issue that arouses your feelings Norma says Denying women the right to choose to have an abortion or not arouses me In fact it enrages me But you cant just go march and then clap your hands and say Thats done You have to keep up the pressure You have to resist the forces that are trying to take these rights away In her renewed fervor Norma fears that the past decade has turned women inward away from one another and away too from the notion that solidarity among women is ultimately a source of personal strength Feminism is not separate from your life she says It is not an objective topic I was telling a woman the other day about having been in a consciousnessraising group and she said Oh my god I could never be in a group like that I mean I dont even like being with women And I was practically tonguetied with sadness There are still so many women who hate themselves and each other ALICE CAMPAGNA Last night i saw The Killing Fields and I felt like adopting a child from Cambodia but I know I wont Alice says I could go on marches but I never do Ive gotten more tired I want to read mystery books and go shopping Shortly after the group disbanded in 1974 Alices engagement with feminism receded Consciousnessraising though did make a difference for her she says because of it she sees her personal struggle in a feminist context But she knows the days of her commitment are over About her lapsed activism she is cheerfully resigned Im ashamed to say my own issue is surviving Alice says Im a lot more middleclass I dont know if Im more conservative but maybe I am I think were all more conservative Im not as closed a person as I once was but I dont have the hunger to share that I did then Consciousnessraising takes a lot of energy and Im putting that energy into other things Theres a part of me that would like to belong to a group now but theres a part of me thats just too lazy In 1972 Alice had long straight hair parted in the middle as was the style then She dressed she says in arty clothes  jeans a black leotard and jewelry A single parent in the days before such status became epidemic she was raising her 6yearold son Adam with little from her former husband Living in a small apartment on the minimal wages she earned as a waitress she was looking for a man to come along and take care of her At 30 Alice was a nascent feminist Shed been trapped in a miserable marriage in Michigan during her 20s and until she met Norma Goldstein who would introduce her to the group she had shared few confidences with other females In the atmosphere in which she was raised women were people with whom you were competitive people from whom you kept secrets When she joined the group she says I went from being an infant to being a woman Today at 44 Alice is thinner than she was at 30 she admits that she has been nearly anorexic at times When she is anxious she says she simply stops eating She still smokes cigarettes and says shell give them up someday Her hair is cropped short You cant be in your 40s and have long hair she says and laughs Alice owns a restaurant called Vintages on Columbus Avenue Her son Adam is now 20 and has completed his junior year at the University of Pennsylvania When he comes home they share her Riverside Drive apartment She says only half in jest that she is now a capitalist and that on any given day she wakes up thinking about the weather an important consideration in her business Asked if shes happy she says that depends on what day it is what time of day you call her whether Adam is home with her how her business is going She thinks its an asinine question If feminism didnt take with Alice over the long haul certain lessons learned in the group nonetheless stuck with her The meetings about sex stand out in her memory I was a mess of misinformation she recalls I thought I wasnt having the right kind of orgasm I thought something was wrong with me that I was a freak But I learned through the group that sex was wonderful Its affected not only my own life but also the way Ive taught my son about women Alice is very clear about her greatest success  her son She is proud of her mothering and her relationship with Adam remains the most joyous part of her life On the other hand she says My biggest failure is that I havent had a man in my life  a successful long long relationship In the years immediately following her involvement with the group she sometimes found it hard to find a man who understood her feminist concerns A lot of the reasons my relationships with men didnt work was that the men may have been mouthing that they were feminists she says but at heart they werent Today she says she would take any man with two legs only kidding and that if she could change anything in her life it would be to have more money not kidding At heart however she is still much the same woman she was in 1972 I would describe myself as a 44yearold human being who is still struggling I dont know what I want  as a woman I like being alone yet I think I have to be married I still have the same strings manipulating me that I did 14 years ago I think Ill have the same problems till the day I die ANDREA SEDLAK I just found this saying and put it on my refrigerator Andrea remarks It says Happiness is having something to do someone to love and something to hope for I guess that covers all of my bases A bromide perhaps but one that didnt apply to Andrea Sedlaks life until very recently She got married for the first time in October 1984 to a physical chemist she met by putting an ad in the local paper in New Haven where she was living at the time and last August she bought with him her first house Her career as a senior research scientist at Westat a consulting firm just outside of Washington is at last well established Her 40th birthday will be in December her greatest hope is to be pregnant before then After what she describes as 14 years of tortuous meandering around the country  to Kansas to North Carolina to Connecticut to Iowa and finally to Maryland  Andrea Sedlak is settling down Unlike many of her professional peers however Andrea Sedlak couldnt be described as a yuppie She isnt a consumer Her new home is small and modest  decorated much like a graduate students might be At work she still wears the suits she was given when she was in high school As a hobby she raises finches The first member of her New Jersey workingclass family to attend college Andrea was exposed in the 1960s and early 70s to new ideas that still characterize her thinking A shy fragilelooking woman who speaks in thoughtful measured cadences her feminism is couched in a rhetoric that echoes that of a generation ago But its tinged now with personal need as if it isnt solidarity shes speaking of but companionship Women feel alone she says We are usually the only mother or the only wife in the house Our problems seem unique In 1972 Andrea Sedlak was 25 and studying psychology at Columbia University She had been politically active as a leader in a student effort to do away with comprehensive exams but didnt know much about feminism Because she was curious about the movement and also because she was having personal problems with men she joined the group From it she says  I got a very powerful message of Youre OK It was my first discovery that such a message existed In 1973 Andrea left New York in search of a job During the next 12 years she would organize womens groups all over the country wherever she happened to be In the beginning she established consciousnessraising groups Later she organized support groups specifically for rape victims and she worked in a shelter for battered women When I was in the group I saw how powerContinued on Page 32 ful a peer support group was and I thought to myself if my feeling of relief was so great then a person who had gone through some really bad experiences  like being raped or being battered  would stand to benefit even more Of all the women reunited in Norma Goldsteins living room Andrea feels the most hankering to belong to a womens group now Recently she underwent surgery in an effort to reverse her infertility and perhaps in her concern over the outcome of the operation she confesses to a loneliness that she cant quite come to terms with She also admits to financial problems Medical bills and a hefty new mortgage have sapped her resources I dont exactly need basic training all over again but Ive been thinking that it would be nice to have a group right now Andrea says I guess what I miss is the large amount of sharing that goes on  the number of different comparisons you have for yourself Andrea like Norma finds a link between the individual concerns of women and their collective predicament But like Alice she has discovered that with the advance of time her consuming passions are private ones I feel Ive come further than Ive ever been but I have a lot of fears about it not working out for me she says I want to have a child BRENDA BOOZER I look at what I have in my life and I say These are the choices I have made  You could say life has been kind to Brenda Boozer She lives in a Stanford White brick mansion on an estate that used to belong to a Rockefeller and at first glance it looks like a small college She is an established opera star a mezzosoprano and a principal artist with the Met She has a 2yearold son named Alexander whom she describes as a miracle child And she is married to the talented comedianactor Robert Klein At 38 she also happens to be beautiful The thing about myself that I think is different from other people she says is that when I was 3 my grandmother said I was going to be an opera star  and from then on I was headed to be a performer Ive always been dedicated I havent had a lot of time for introspection I just lived my life and went about my goals Brenda seems to have been a rather unlikely candidate for a consciousnessraising group She was not active in the womens movement was not politically motivated and had no pressing personal problems to sort out In fact she has no memory of why she joined the group In 1972 she was studying voice in New York  having had what she describes as a joyous childhood in Atlanta in the home of liberal Southern parents who were part of the civil rights movement She was already living with Robert they married in 1973  whom she had met when they were both performing in Candide  in a comfortable apartment on Riverside Drive Nevertheless one evening she found herself the host of a group meeting in her living room Her own sheltered life and the blinders she wore in pursuit of her chosen goal were temporarily knocked askew She says One of the most incredible things that happened to me in the group was a real bonding with other women  women who were very different from me I grew to have compassion for the struggles women were going through The group wasnt there to talk about how happy we were Fourteen years later Brenda isnt any more active in the womens movement than she was before she joined the group For her unlike the others womens issues and her own personal strivings dont necessarily overlap You cant chase two rabbits at the same time she says Im happily married I cant wait to have another child Im thrilled about my singing and Im loving the work I do I couldnt be more fulfilled It feels so overwhelming Brenda likes to give credit where credit is due  to herself and to God The biggest change in my life since I was in the group is my spiritual growth I pray every day I go to church regularly She reports having had a religious experience looking up at da Vincis Annunciation in a museum in Florence It is a painting of the angel Gabriel announcing to Mary that she would bear the Child I really feel like God was speaking to me she says that he was calling me Two months later she was pregnant with Alexander Her husband who is Jewish doesnt share her religious fervor and Brenda says that she thinks he is threatened by it as he has been at times by what she describes as her control Shortly after she left the group in 1974 Brenda auditioned for the Santa Fe Opera company and was accepted Robert needed her with him and asked that she not go but she went anyway Im not sure how much that decision had to do with the group I already had the strength to go and the group helped me in my conviction Conviction remains a strong suit with Brenda she tends to get what she wants Her biggest problem she says is finding time for everything She describes a typical day this way If I dont have a performance I get up around 830 I like to spend quality time with Alexander in the morning We go to the lake or the farm across the street We are always doing something fun Then Ill be back here at 10 to vocalize for an hour before the pianist comes Marion the nanny gives Alexander lunch but I always put him to bed for his nap Then I will probably have to go to the city for a rehearsal or a coaching session until 5 when I come back to play with my son There are a thousand things with the house  15 phone calls on the machine someone with the wallpaper I always put Alexander to bed around 9 and then after that if Roberts here we might have dinner together and thats my time to be with him Then I will make a couple of phone calls take my bath and study some music I have a real busy schedule Brenda believes that feminism is about changing yourself Yet apart from her religious awakening she appears to have changed remarkably little To be sure she is richer and more well known and she now has a son whom she dearly loves but certain characteristics remain The group she says gave us more strength to go in the direction we wanted to go To distinguish herself from the other members of the group she says Ive been successful CAROL MORRA After a hiatus of nearly two decades during which she concentrated solely on her marriage and family Carol Morra wants to be an actress again She is a vivacious personality with a 1000watt smile someone who by her own admission chooses to see the glass halffull rather than halfempty It is tempting however to think the positive attitude an act  her biggest role to date One of the first things she says is that after 23 years she is still desperately in love with her husband Buddy a personal manager for entertainers in Los Angeles and that her life is where she wants it to be Reminded of this later she looks surprised You mean you believed all that baloney I told you Pressed Carol admits she has serious doubts about having given up her 20s and 30s when she was the most beautiful and the most creative to the service of her husband and children My choice was to preserve my marriage at all costs and I try to keep a sense of joy in my household she says But the person whos neglected is me I take a back seat and I find that difficult In all the years that Buddy and I have been going out socially for his business only one person has ever asked me a serious question Ironically Carol made her choice during her time in consciousnessraising The group forced me to look at my values and to think about what was really important to me she says I saw that it was possible to really screw up my marriage because I was becoming awakened to a lot of things A group of women sitting around do not always say great things about their marriages So there was a little bit of a mental shakeup Fortunately I recovered The marriage was my first priority Carol came to the group because of her friendship with Brenda Buddy was Robert Kleins manager and the four had regular dinners together Carol recalls Brenda said I think you should join this consciousnessraising group Im in We sit around and talk about different topics and we share I said Hey that sounds cute Brenda said Theres nothing cute about it  In the fall of 1972 Carol and Buddy were living on 94th Street and Amsterdam Avenue with their three children Adam 7 Paris 2 and Ali who was just 3 months old Carol who had attended the School of Performing Arts and who had been on the road for five years acting singing and dancing in musicals had met Buddy at a frozenfoods counter in New York and was married to him five months later Two years after her son was born Carol gave up her career to be as she puts it Miss Mommy At the time she had no regrets So Carol went to her first consciousnessraising meeting with an attitude of Show me Within the structured confines of the group she found to her surprise that she could allow herself to be introspective an indulgence she had always avoided and that in fact she seems to have forgone since She says she takes great pains never to be alone Im not really happy being with myself she admits If ever Im alone with nothing to do which is almost impossible to think of Im on the phone Today living with Buddy and the kids in Beverly Hills Carol is trying once again to get her career in gear She has managed to do some television work in the last five years appearing under the professional name of Carol Gordon on The Love Boat Remington Steele Dynasty and Not Necessarily the News But she is 45 now and its not as easy as it might have been 20 years ago She says Its only in retrospect that I realized that hey those were very important years for me I could have used them In fact it is when she thinks about the scarcity of parts available to her now  because of her age and because she is a woman that her brand of feminism is most likely to surface I dont think people realize this she says but most of the TV work is geared to men I see whats available and I feel a resentment that something like 70 percent of the roles in this business are male parts Carol was a participant in the first womens march down Fifth Avenue nearly two decades ago but when she wakes up in the morning today she says Im not thinking about marching on the streets Im usually hoping that the shower will be nice when I get in I get confused about political issues I really do She is out of the house three mornings a week at 815 for tapdancing lessons She also takes Spanish lessons and in addition to having three children still at home she recently served as understudy for the lead in a local theater production All this activity requires energy something Carol has in abundance It is her most striking quality and it has stood her in good stead in her marriage Buddy loves watching me walk into a room and be bubbly and effervescent and with her children You give me two pillows and Ive got a puppet show going Carol sees no room in her life for a consciousnessraising group now We became women in that group she says It was an initiation rite like a rite of passage That happens only once I said it changed my life and it did But it was like taking a wonderful course in school You study for a year and later you can remember only three or four sentences about it Those are the things that stay with you
"RURAL, SUBURBAN AND KINKY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/books/rural-suburban-and-kinky.html,BINDWEED By Christianne Balk 54 pp New York Collier BooksMacmillan Publishing Company Cloth 1395 Paper 795 THE FIRE MUSIC By Liz Rosenberg 58 pp Pennsylvania University of Pittsburgh Press Cloth 1595 Paper 695 LOCAL TIME By Stephen Dunn 110 pp New York William Morrow  Company Cloth 1495 Paper 695 CHRISTIANNE BALKS Bindweed winner of the 1985 Walt Whitman Award of the Academy of American Poets as the best first book of poems by an American shows some of the awkwardness and tentativeness characteristic of younger poets but it also introduces an artist resonant with talent Ms Balk writes poems that stay close to nature tapping the rhythms of the changing seasons for metaphors of the human life cycle and rounding out natures powerful processes with the human qualities of joy loss and grief In The Young Widow Talks to Herself the husbands absence is felt to be a gouge in the snow  Scooped between the spruce trees and just as we feel the cold concentration of the widows sorrow we can also project the time when spring flowers will occupy the exact same place But poems fixed on death and tragedy when they are written by a 33yearold poet who as we are told is a veteran of many writing workshops are sometimes hard to trust We suspect that the privacy of suffering and the time needed to come to terms with the loss of a loved one would resist the creative writing classrooms atmosphere of formal criticism and approval by consensus It is true that many of the poems in this book have death as their subject matter a speakers miscarriage or abortion the premature death of a lover But many of the better poems turn to less morbid concerns In Artists Room a violin maker becomes an alchemist who mixes jars of beetle resins  With tree gum purple crystal and amber dye to find a finish for the instrument that is so pure it burns as anthracite A buoyant optimism runs through Elegy a bizarre poem about an airplane that crashes one March in a snowy mountain region What is so strange here is that the poet conjures up ways the crash victims might save themselves Snowshoe frames can be made of metal from plane keels sleds built from wings harnesses woven from shroud lines  Cloudy streams of fresh water can be found and salmon tomcod needlefish and pike caught In a way the poem showcases Ms Balks knowledge of the natural world as she tosses out more strategies and possibilities for the unfortunates Bushes can be dug for the starchy roots cupfungus bracken and the inner white bark of willow poplar and birch can be eaten But then as if to show that silver clouds have their dark lining she returns to the site of the accident and reminds us The Brooks Range stretches from Cape Lisburne to Demarcation Point and few of its mountains are mapped The alternation between documentary reportage of the disaster and the suspenseful unfolding of the narrative makes for a wonderfully fresh and novel poem The range of Ms Balks poetry is impressive but it can also be a bit distracting One cannot help wondering just how strong her work will be when she hones her themes and styles and perfects them If Ms Balks esthetic is rooted in the rural Liz Rosenbergs must be spoken of as suburban In The Fire Music even a poem set near a country lake tells us the smell of pine unfurls like motel soap  we opened in some double room of childhood Though the effect is often comic she begins a poem titled A Suburban Childhood confessing that having a crush was how I existed the mundane situations become a little tiresome The Christmas Cactus is about buds on a cactus which are late in opening All during the Christmas rush I waited for the thing to come alive Eyed it while I gift wrapped scarves withered it with scorn as I threw the green and silver bundles under the tree But when the flowers do bloom like the girls that shine at a high school dance from their corner of the gym the metaphors power is dissipated by the ordinariness of the setting Yet there is something extremely lovable about this book Ms Rosenberg is eager to jump into experience with the innocence of an enthusiast and the vulnerability of a lover Although many poems are chaotic and vague they do have fire and music In The Longing for Eternal Life Ms Rosenberg even wonders if she is connecting with all life has to offer Why is it hard to live like this  simply to live she asks the implied answer being life is not simple Indeed it is when she catches the complexity of life that her work shines In The Lighthouse the poet finds her spiritual aspirations mirrored in the beacon I want to live like that she declares to be a great and watchful eye  that sends all its light out and takes nothing back The experiences in The Fire Music are entered through doors that seem to open from the middle of rooms Images and situations are presented to us with the immediacy of dreams A poem about taking a trip on a train is followed by one that begins I love how old men carry purses for their wives Some of the titles like Alone With the Shoe Manufacturer in His Memorial Park have a strangeness to them that is reminiscent of Wallace Stevens The trick then is to go into the books kaleidoscope of pages and choose which patterns and images satisfy Stephen Dunn is a more seasoned poet having published five books of poems before his latest Local Time a volume in the National Poetry Series this one chosen by Dave Smith As one might expect Mr Dunns experience as a writer gives his poems greater confidence and facility and he explores everyday life more thoroughly and certainly with a sharper sense of the absurd than Ms Balk or Ms Rosenberg In this book Mr Dunn is everybodys friendly neighbor He is what mothers want their sons to be He is good and his obsession with moral and ethical propriety both distinguishes his poetry and slightly alienates those of us who cannot quite resolve our own problems with gentleness and understanding Yet on the other side of this idealistic striving lies a kind of frustration and sadness and a downright kinkiness seeps through the seams of many poems In Completion a man doing the woodwork on a new den wants nothing more than to show off his efforts to his wife when she comes home However When his wife returned from work he said Look its finished but he knew the room meant nothing to her Many of the poems trace a contemporary American constellation of romantic love monogamous eroticism and marital tension Those poems are among the best in the book and in them Mr Dunns struggle for sensitivity especially in his relations with a woman he writes about in many of these poems seems not only appropriate but admirable Mr Dunn reminds us that when we wake up next to someone we love a simple thing like the words good morning  have a history of tones pray to say them evenly And lines from The Night the Children Were Away sound as if the incident described had to have happened in California although the poet lives in New Jersey When she comes home hes waiting for her on the secluded deck naked the wine open her favorite cheese already sliced Later in the same poem those pitfalls of modern marriage  routine overbearing familiarity and boredom  are bravely banished by the poets determination to make love profanely as if the profane were the only way to disturb to waken the sacred That is tongueincheek wisdom American poets in this century have done much to expand the subject matter of poetry William Carlos Williams wrote that so much depends on a red wheelbarrow next to a white chicken Gary Snyder snipped a recipe out of a cookbook and declared it to be his poem But it has taken Stephen Dunn in Aerial in the Pines to attack at last the problem of the tree in the backyard that is interfering with the television antenna To cut off the top branches of the majestic pine once unthinkable for us was a bit of nature traded for clear reception Sarcasm aside these poems work and even though they present pictures of our lives as common and sometimes dull they manage to exalt them

LIBERTY WEEKEND/THE PEOPLE; LIBERTY CONFEREES DEBATE JUDGES' ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/nyregion/liberty-weekend-the-people-liberty-conferees-debate-judges-role.html,The spirit of concord that had settled over New York in tribute to the Statue of Liberty was disrupted yesterday in tribute to the practice of liberty While the rest of the city was outdoors celebrating 100 years of history a score of officials scholars judges lawyers and writers spent the day in a Times Square hotel arguing over the future of liberty in America It was the start of a twoday meeting Liberty  the Next 100 Years at the Marriott Marquis an effort in the words of James MacGregor Burns the Woodrow Wilson Professor of Government at Williams College and one of the panelists to add cerebration to the celebration It also added controversy as the Solicitor General of the United States Charles Fried criticized not only the views of Floyd Abrams the specialist in First Amendment law who served as his adversary but also those of former Supreme Court Justice Arthur J Goldberg Mr Abrams meanwhile criticized the views of Mr Fried and more pointedly those of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d Constitution as Legend The issue had to do with the latitude the courts may permit themselves in interpreting the Constitution Mr Fried a chief advocate of the Reagan Adminstrations opposition to the Supreme Court holdings on such matters as abortion and affirmative action said he believed the Constitution should be interpreted rather than invented He mocked the view that the Constitution is our legend which he attributed to Justice Goldberg who was not at the conference If judges treat it as a legend and not as a legal document he asked why should not they rather than elected legislators have the power to make the law Meese Criticized Mr Fried rejected the notion of an unelected judiciary interpreting the Constitution according to its own personal morals and philosophies and concluded that there was no greater threat to liberty than for judges to create their own law Mr Abrams began his rebuttal with a reminder that about a year ago Attorney General Meese took exception to the generally established holding that the 14th Amendment makes the Bill of Rights applicable to the states He called the Attorney Generals view a radical proposition that would mean that the Constitution would permit New York to ban newspapers California to establish a state religion and Kansas to deny criminal defendants the right to counsel Although he agreed with Mr Fried that judges opinions should be informed by the intentions of the framers of the Constitution Mr Abrams observed with regard to cases he is now handling that the revered framers knew nothing of exit polls nothing of broadcasters nothing of outdoor advertising in the fashion in which it now exists Resorting to the Courts Mr Abrams charged that those who speak of original intent seem only to care about that intent when it supports the social policies they find congenial Midge Decter executive director of the Committee for a Free World sided with Mr Fried but made her argument on political grounds As she described the situation powerful people many of them judges and lawyers who have no faith that they can achieve their favorite causes such as the Equal Rights Amendment in the political forum are resorting to the courts instead Much of the nation she said sees this as tyranny A second panel which asked Can Free Speech Become Too Costly found Norman Dorsen president of the American Civil Liberties Union facing Michael Novak the author and columnist for The National Review Mr Dorsen put forward a maximum protection theory which would bar prior restraint of speech bans on peaceful protests and laws to restrict sexually explicit material Mr Novak did not say no to maximum protection but he did not say yes either He held out the hope that a mature liberal society would be able to find ways preferably through community action rather than law to deal with the nearby sex shops which he said he had passed with his 14yearold daughter with a certain shame That brought murmurs of recognition from the panel and some of the 250 people in the audience and the session ended with spirited exchanges among the panelists on just what could be done about pornography
MIXED OPINIONS; THE SUPREME COURT WORKS AT ITS MANDATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/06/weekinreview/mixed-opinions-the-supreme-court-works-at-its-mandate.html,HANDING down major decisions last week on homosexual relations gerrymandering and affirmative action among others the Supreme Court also had important things to say about its role in governing the nation Important but deeply discordant  and some said inconsistent In the face of the most determined push by any Administration in 50 years to curb the power of judges to set social policy the Court dealt a major defeat to the Reagan Administration in two affirmative action cases But in those as in some of the other hard cases it could achieve no consensus on what the law is or what its own mission should be The Courts ambivalence about what the law is was evident once again in its reluctant embrace of affirmative action A solid majority of the Court firmly rejected the major premise of the Administrations civil rights policies  that courtordered racial preferences in hiring and promotion are illegal except to benefit individuals who were personally victims of discrimination A solid majority also stressed that judges should impose affirmative action only as a lastditch remedy for egregious discrimination and renounced rigid quotas But the 5to4 vote in a case involving a New York City sheet metal workers local upheld a courtordered 2923 percent goal for minority membership in the union And a 6to3 vote in a case involving firefighters in Cleveland gave lower courts broad latitude to approve consent decrees that include racial preferences The practical effect of the decisions will be to insulate from challenge many employment plans the details of which the Court might not itself approve Two Decisions Two Views The Courts ambivalence about what its mission should be was encapsulated in two decisions handed down together both announced by Justice Byron R White In one the Court took a narrow view of its role in protecting privacy ruling 5 to 4 that the Constitution does not protect homosexual relations between consenting adults even in their own homes from prosecution In the other it assumed 6 to 3 the power to obliterate election districts anywhere in the nation if a dominant political party in a state legislature has drawn them so as to consistently degrade its rivals voting strength Superficially unrelated both cases raised in its starkest form a question that lies in the background of every constitutional decision What mandate has a group of unelected lifetenured judges to strike down democratically enacted laws None at all Justice White said when no more is at stake than the interest of homosexuals in conducting their intimate relationships as they please His majority opinion upheld  as applied to homosexuals  a Georgia law making any oral or anal sex a criminal offense Whether such laws are wise or desirable was beside the point he said The Court is most vulnerable and comes nearest to illegitimacy when it deals with judgemade law In a majority opinion reminiscent of his recent dissent calling for the Court to abandon its decisions permitting abortionJustice White dismissed almost scornfully arguments for extending the Courts line of precedents recognizing a vague right of sexual privacy Citing the ancient roots of sodomy laws he characterized as facetious any claim that a right to engage in such conduct was secured by the Fourteenth Amendments general protection of liberty But in the gerrymandering case Justice White abandoned judicial restraint for a bold new judicial incursion into what he called the most political of legislative functions the drawing of election district lines Despite the ancient roots of partisan gerrymandering  it began before the term was coined in 1812  last week was the first time the Supreme Court has asserted the power to do anything about it While the Court upheld 7 to 2 the specific Indiana redistricting plan in the case Justice White led the way in asserting the power to decide such cases citing the Fourteenth Amendments guarantee of equal protection of the laws He did not suggest the authors of those words intended to outlaw partisan gerrymanders Rather he used the traditional process of extending the logic of precedents step by step into new frontiers The building blocks were the Courts one person one vote decisions and those banning racial gerrymandering Justice Whites technique was remarkably similar to the arguments made in the Georgia case  by the four dissenters  for extending to homosexual relations the Courts protection of sexual privacy Indeed all four joined him in asserting judicial power over gerrymandering But three of the four who joined Justice White in the sodomy case accused him in the gerrymandering case of reflexive application of precedent I do not believe and the Court offers not a shred of evidence to suggest wrote Justice Sandra Day OConnor that the Framers of the Constitution intended the judicial power to encompass the making of such fundamental choices about how this Nation is to be governed MAKING LAW AT THE END OF TERM AFFIRMATIVE ACTION Rejecting the Administrations civil rights arguments the Court upheld 5 to 4 a numerical membership goal imposed by a judge on a New York City union and declined 6 to 3 to overturn a Cleveland plan preferentially promoting minority firefighters GERRYMANDERING The Court ruled 6 to 3 that manipulation of election district lines by the majority in a state legislature violates the Constitution when it consistently degrades the voting power of other parties But it upheld the Indiana districts in question on the ground that the gerrymandering was not so severe as be unconstitutional VOTING RIGHTS Rejecting the Reagan Administrations narrow interpretation of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act the Court as Congressional leaders of both parties urged unanimously struck down four North Carolina election districts that diluted black voting power By 6 to 3 it upheld a fifth district SEXUAL PRIVACY In upholding 5 to 4 a Georgia sodomy law that makes any oral or anal sex a crime the Court ruled that the Constitution does not protect private homosexual relations between consenting adults But the Justices declined to say whether the Constitution would protect heterosexual couples from prosecution under the same law THE FIRST AMENDMENT By deciding 5 to 4 that Puerto Rico may ban local advertising of casino gambling the Court limited its protection of commercial speech suggesting that states may also restrict advertising of liquor cigarettes and other products that are legal but considered harmful But in a 7 to 2 ruling the Court extended to pretrial hearings its recognition of a qualified First Amendment right to attend criminal trials STILL TO COME   The Court has not yet issued its ruling on the constitutionality of the

DEFINING WOMEN'S RIGHTS WILL AID ABORTION DEBATE; The Fanatic's Lexicon,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/opinion/l-defining-women-s-rights-will-aid-abortion-debate-the-fanatic-s-lexicon-401486.html,To the Editor There must be thousands of women in this country for whom resort to abortion was not merely a matter of choice any number of circumstances come to mind in which such things as rape disease extreme mental or physical immaturity danger of a fullterm pregnancy to the mothers life affected the decision to abort We know that many women who had involuntarily to put an end to their pregnancies are prone to melancholy and often prolonged depression after the operation How must such women feel then when they are called murderers by the President of the United States This gross piece of insensitivity was in a newspaper interview news story June 24 in which Mr Reagan said speaking of abortion I dont think that womanhood should be considering murder a privilege We have become used to the cruel and wounding scurrilities shouted by partisans of the Right to Life movement at women outside abortion clinics Abortion with such people is an emotional not an intellectual issue and we cannot expect either rational or civilized discourse from them We do not however expect our President to lift one of the favorite words  murder  from the fanatics lexicon and apply it to what for many citizens is a most painful and tragic matter ALBERT HUBBELL Westport Conn June 24 1986
LIBERTY PANEL PONDERS WHEREFORES OF FREEDOM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/nyregion/liberty-panel-ponders-wherefores-of-freedom.html,A simplesounding question kept intruding into the weekends conference on Liberty  the Next 100 Years as one panelist put it Free for what purpose In the spirit of the birthday party for the Statue of Liberty in which the nation was engaged a couple of panelists asserted that liberty was good in itself But as the discussion got down to specifics it seemed to be only the beginning of a quest that no one found easy to put into words The closest the panelists came was the faith or hope that liberty would lead to a sense of community Two writers Roger Rosenblatt a liberal and Michael Novak who is identified with the neoconservatives both voiced a longing for community that won sympathy from the score of scholars officials and others in the last day of the twoday conference at the Marriott Marquis Hotel The purpose of liberty Mr Rosenblatt suggested was to enable people to achieve the common good But the panelists brought together by the conference chairman Richard D Heffner sometimes differed on what constitutes the common good On some issues community sentiment far from seeming an outgrowth of liberty seemed to be its antagonist For example if there was anyone in the room who had a favorable word for the Xrated movie houses not far from the hotel he did not utter it But when the coauthor of an antipornography statute that had recently been rejected by the courts as unconstitutional Catharine A MacKinnon offered a punitive approach to those who profit from pornography she met opposition from some Yet the aspiration toward a community that included even the opposition kept coming through Eleanor Smeal the president of the National Organization for Women was severely criticized by several panelists including Mayor Koch and the former president of the United Auto Workers Douglas A Fraser for charging that religious fundamentalists who oppose her organizations views on the proposed equal rights amendment abortion and laws regarding homosexuals are exhibiting neofascist tendencies By contrast the cofounder of the Parents Music Resource Center Tipper Gore got a warm response for her groups effort to get record companies to identify on record jackets the sexually explicit lyrics inside The civil libertarians present liked her approach of relying on community pressures rather than legal constraints of asking not that any record be banned but only that parents be given an opportunity to discover before a purchase was made what their children were buying Miss Gore seemed to have found a means of making community feelings respected in a way that also respected the First Amendment The chairman of the United States Holocaust Memorial Council Elie Wiesel stretched the ideal of community further calling on America to open its doors to anyone who wanted to enter for economic as well as political reasons A father who cannot feed his children is not free he said Other panelists too urged that the sufferings of minorities in America not be forgotten amid the fireworks That theme seemed to be in the mind of the Woodrow Wilson Professor of Government at Williams College James MacGregor Burns when he voiced his feeling in the waning minutes of the conference that the constitutional system today is incapable of dealing with Americas enduring inequalities The Constitution he said is not a sacred document it is a charter of government that was made by man and can be changed by man Professor Burns also pointed out that two more celebrations were in Americas near future next year brings the 200th anniversary of the drafting of the Constitution and the spring of 1989 will be the bicentennial of the new Federal Governments setting up shop in New York Professor Burns suggested to Mayor Koch that that might be an occasion for an even bigger celebration than the one just ending which was enough to leave most people speechless
A STUDY ASSESSES TRAITS OF WOMEN WHO KILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/style/a-study-assesses-traits-of-women-who-kill.html,A new research study of women who kill a group that has been given relatively little attention by social scientists dispels some common myths about these women They are neither more emotional nor less predictable than men who kill the study has found And most do not conform to the stereotype of the Arsenic and Old Lace killer or to the pattern of figures like Bonnie Parker But women who commit homicide do share common characteristics the research suggests They are likely to have experienced significant levels of loss and bereavement in both their childhood and adult lives And often they have been exposed to high levels of family violence as children as well as violence in their adult relationships with men In addition they are likely to be living extremely stressful lives as adults while feeling overwhelming isolation associated with intense resentment against those they perceive as having wronged them There have been few studies of female criminal homicide behavior said John T Kirkpatrick coauthor of a twoyear study of 76 women who have killed Although an average of 1500 women commit homicide in the United States each year much of the previous research has focused on male homicide offenders Common Stereotypes Since 85 percent of murders are committed by men it was understandable that so much of the research focused on males said Dr Kirkpatrick a stress researcher who is assistant dean of the College of Liberal Arts at the University of New Hampshire There are a number of common but inaccurate stereotypes about these women he said One is the Arsenic and Old Lace stereotype the grandmotherly type who murders through stealth and deception Another is that of the Bonnie Parker type who is believed to act not on her own but at the behest of a man But these kinds of offenders are unusual said John A Humphrey professor of sociology at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro the studys other author One who fit this pattern he said was Margie Velma Barfield executed Nov 2 1984 for murdering her fiance Stuart Taylor by lacing his beer with arsenic She also had confessed to poisoning her mother and two other elderly people she had cared for as a nurse This kind of cool deliberate killing is not only atypical of women but also of men Dr Humphrey said Also atypical he said are contract killings by women such as Elizabeth Ann Duncan the previous woman to be executed in this country at San Quentin Prison in California in 1962 She was convicted of hiring two men to kill her sons pregnant wife Women who kill in this way are also very rare but when it does happen the victim is usually someone they know he said Its not a business dealing as it is with men who contract to kill Far more common he said are women who kill after having been abused by a husband a lover or an exhusband as in the case of Bernadette Powell who was convicted in 1978 of killing her former spouse in a motel in Ithaca NY Usually these crimes occur after longstanding provocation Dr Humphrey said The offenders studied by the researchers were imprisoned at the North Carolina Correctional Center for Women in Raleigh The life histories of the offenders were recorded by Dr Kirkpatrick and Dr Humphrey in interviews lasting from three to 12 hours The women who were promised anonymity for participating in the study ranged in age from 17 to 56 at the time of their homicides The researchers findings were presented recently at the second national Conference on Social Stress at the University of New Hampshire and will be published in scholarly journals as well as in a book Thirtyeight percent of the offenders were white 57 percent were black and 5 percent were American Indians Eightyseven percent of the womens victims were males 51 percent of victims were black the youngest victim was 1 month old and the oldest was 76 years Dr Kirkpatrick and Dr Humphrey compared their findings with earlier research on men done by Dr Humphrey and Stuart Palmer of the University of New Hampshire and found no evidence to support the idea that the women offenders were more emotional or unpredictable in their actions said Dr Kirkpatrick This had been a contention of some previous research which was biased ideologically said Dr Humphrey He added that female homicide has been used in support of male sexist arguments and also to support feminist theories Some feminists have theorized that female homicide was the result of the prolonged experience of oppression at the hands of men Dr Kirkpatrick said But this seems terribly simplistic he said The similarities between men and women who kill were far greater than the differences There were however variations for example the men interviewed in previous research had not suffered the stress of abortion or miscarriage as some women had and had generally assumed few childcare responsibilities A principal difference between the men and women he said is this Among the men a lot of homicides occurred over the most trivial things  leaning on a car say or not paying 50 cents owed Its as if these men are on the edge of violence most of the time and anything can precipitate it However he said In order for women to kill it had to be perceived by them as a lifethreatening situation affecting their physical or emotional wellbeing He said that from this finding the researchers believe that women appear to have the resources to keep from murdering the social support they give each other to put up with all manner of adversity for a longer period of time Dr Kirkpatrick said Obviously societal factors like the fact that women dont earn as much as men do could figure into their lives But its not the primary cause That cause the researchers said seems linked to the womens life histories and to the kinds of stress and the severity of stress they encountered Nearly all came from very violent upbringings and experienced high levels of domestic violence seeing their mothers and fathers fighting often with weapons said Dr Kirkpatrick Many had experienced intrasibling violence he added and some were beaten and nearly tortured by their brothers One third of the women reported being sexually abused as children What may be learned is that when there is conflict you resolve that conflict violently said Dr Humphrey They believe there is no point in trying to negotiate In addition more than half the women had lost a loved one in childhood and a sixth reported the death of a child More than half had had a family member or friend die during the womens adult years Loss a Source of Stress Loss is an important source of stress because not only is it stressful in itself Dr Humphrey said but it also precipitates other stress as when they have to move in with grandparents or drop out of school due to the death of a parent The women often described themselves in a way that the researchers chose to characterize as the only ones a phrase used by the singer Rickie Lee Jones in her 1981 Living It Up album These are women who feel at once overpowering aloneness and simmering resentment of others Dr Humphrey said They feel that the world is conspiring against them they harbor great resentment for the wrongs they have suffered and believe they are the only ones who are so afflicted Often Dr Kirkpatrick said the feeling of isolation combined with blaming and resentful behavior becomes a selffulfilling prophecy since they do not seem to seek out any social support and reject help he said
Defining Women's Rights Will Aid Abortion Debate,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/07/opinion/l-defining-women-s-rights-will-aid-abortion-debate-701386.html,To the Editor Another 5to4 decision of the United States Supreme Court in an abortionrelated case emphasizes sharp differences among the Justices and among the people of our nation front page June 12 On June 11 the Court struck down Pennsylvania legislation providing for a more informed consent by the pregnant woman and for protection of the life of an aborted but viable fetus Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun writing for the majority provides what appears more like a doctrinaire tract by the National Abortion Rights Action League Strongly defensive of the 1973 Roe v Wade decision in which he also wrote for the majority he strikes down Pennsylvanias requirement that the pregnant woman be advised of availability of medical benefits for childbirth and that the father is responsible for financial assistance in child support as poorly disguised elements of discouragement for the abortion decision Sic transit gloria justitiae Chief Justice Warren E Burger in his dissent observes that the Courts astounding rationale is that such information might have the effect of discouraging abortion as though abortion is something to be advocated and encouraged Justices Sandra Day OConnor and Byron R White in stinging separate dissents each of them joined by Justice William H Rehnquist assert that even on the basis of Roe the majority has departed from that decision by abandoning the compelling interest of the state in protecting fetal life after viability Justice OConnor goes even further in affirming that interest in protecting life throughout pregnancy She was not on the Court when Roe was decided but her dissent suggests the need for a reconsideration of that decision Chief Justice Burger states flatly that Roe should be reexamined The Court minority deals with the conflict of rights between a womans freedom and the right to life of the developing individual The majority sees womens freedom even uninformed as allcontrolling Progress in resolving the political and juridical conflict could well be advanced by defining the categories of womens rights and distinguishing between abortion rights and other components in womens issues The narrow focus on abortion as the symbolic womens issue has been regarded by many as a factor in the defeat of the Equal Rights Amendment and of Walter F Mondale early and loudly endorsed by the National Organization for Women which later demanded that he choose a proabortion woman as a running mate Similar failure to distinguish among womens issues has also been characteristic of many prolife partisans with patriarchal attitudes and practices deeply entrenched indeed in my own church and in other quarters Abortion opponents could further the dialogue and their cause by aggressively supporting the full range of womens rights excluding abortion on substantive grounds of justice as well as tactical grounds of persuading public opinion Our nations people are deeply divided on this issue which will be resolved neither by the singleissue simplicities of some abortion opponents nor by the doctrinaire simplicity of the Court majority in this case Msgr HARRY J BYRNE New York June 20 1986
The Court Was 'Superficial' In the Homosexuality Case,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/opinion/the-court-was-superficial-in-the-homosexuality-case.html,Last week the Supreme Court decided one of the major open issues in American constitutional law concluding that the Government has the power to criminalize private consensual homosexual acts Legal scholars have been discussing this issue for several decades stimulated by Supreme Court cases expanding the protection of privacy by increasing public attention to homosexuality and by an extraordinarily rich philosophic literature going back to John Stuart Mill on the legitimacy of morals legislation Now after avoiding the issue for years the Supreme Court has spoken in a written opinion that is so superficial peremptory and insensitive that it deserves to be criticized on this ground alone quite apart from the Courts conclusion about the constitutionality of sodomy laws Consider just two of the questions raised by the case First what is meant by the explicit provision in the Constitution protecting individual liberty from governmental infringements The Supreme Court has already held that this provision includes the liberty to use contraceptives to live with whom one wishes to use pornographic material in ones home to have an abortion if one chooses and to engage in other private conduct related to family marriage and procreation Does the concept of constitutional liberty reflected in those prior cases extend to private sexual conduct between people of the same sex If not the reason must be more convincing than the Courts onesentence assertion No connection between family marriage or procreation on the one hand and homosexual activity on the other has been demonstrated by the Court of Appeals or by respondent In truth Michael Hardwick the homosexual who first brought this case the Court of Appeals that originally ruled on it and Justice Harry A Blackmuns dissent all made a clear connection The principle underlying the various earlier cases they argued was that liberty includes intimate associations and private conduct central to ones fulfillment as a person including sexual activity and that this principle required protection of homosexual intimacies as well as heterosexual ones Perhaps that connection between the earlier cases and this one is not sufficient but the Court does not tell us why The Court does tell us that proscriptions against [ homosexuality ] have ancient roots But as the Court itself acknowledges the constitutional guarantee of liberty protects not only conduct that has been protected throughout our history and tradition but also freedoms that we have come to see as implicit in the concept of ordered liberty If history and tradition were an exclusive guide many constitutional protections we take for granted today would not exist Mr Hardwick and his defenders did not argue that history or tradition have protected homosexual rights they argued instead that given the importance of intimate associations in a persons life and in a free society a homosexuals right to have consensual sexual relationships in his home is an element of ordered liberty The Court treats this argument no better than a historybased one calling it at best facetious But insults do not take the place of arguments The Court is equally offhanded about a second major issue  the question of whether or not the Government may punish private conduct purely on the ground that it is deemed immoral without any evidence of concrete harm to others This has for centuries been one of the most debated issues in the AngloAmerican legal tradition Yet a Supreme Court majority has now disposed of it summarily saying simply We do not agree The Court does not give reasons or respond to the serious arguments on the other side or explain why the Governments invocation of morality is deemed sufficient here although the Supreme Court has rejected it in earlier cases The Courts refusal to engage these two large questions seriously or even respond to Justice Blackmuns dissent is more than an intellectual failing It is also an insult  to homosexuals but also to any Americans who care about liberty In characterizing one of Mr Hardwicks weightiest arguments as at best facetious the Court makes its hostility explicit Chief Justice Warren Burgers concurring opinion is pervasively hostile calling homosexual acts heinous and asserting that eliminating laws against homosexuals would cast aside millenia of moral teaching Perhaps even more striking than the majoritys offhandedness and hostility is the opinions failure to acknowledge in any way the human dimension of this issue Not a single sentence expresses any understanding of the fact that this case involves human beings who have needs for intimacy love and sexual expression like the rest of us Not a single sentence acknowledges the human anguish that antihomosexual statutes can create or that these laws criminalize an American minority that has been struggling for political and civil membership for many years These are not extraconstitutional matters they are certainly relevant in deciding what ordered liberty means Can it be that the justices do not see this human dimension To have addressed these things would not necessarily have required the Court to change its conclusions on constitutional law or to express approval of homosexual behavior But such sensitivity would have made a difference It is one thing to lose it is even worse to lose believing ones claim has not even received respectful consideration Fair judicial decisionmaking requires that consideration The Courts insensitivity and offhandedness in this case represent more than a human deficiency they represent a serious deficiency in the art of judging That failing is especially troublesome in this case because it may affect the broader political response to the decision As the Court notes a constitutional case decides only what a legislature is allowed to do not what is desirable But here the Court treats homosexuals claims in such a dismissive way that it conveys a sense that similar treatment by legislatures would be appropriate The opinion exacerbates homosexuals already marginal status It will also encourage public officials to summarily dismiss as facetious any argument that antihomosexual laws intrude upon a personal freedom worth tolerating In short it will encourage the adoption and enforcement of such laws
JUSTICE DEPT. CLEARS CONSUMER SAFETY OFFICIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/08/us/justice-dept-clears-consumer-safety-official.html,A Justice Department investigation has cleared Terrence M Scanlon a member of the Consumer Product Safety Commission of charges that he had misused his office As a result the Senate has scheduled a vote on his confirmation as chairman of the commission for next Tuesday The Justice Department informed the Senate and the commission of the results of its investigation on June 17 but the departments letter has not been made public Mr Scanlons confirmation was held up last December when Senator Paul Simon Democrat of Illinois and Senator William Proxmire Democrat of Wisconsin blocked a vote on the floor of the Senate They raised several objections to the appointment and said the Senate should not vote until it had received the results of the Justice Department investigation which had been requested by Representative John D Dingell Democrat of Michigan and Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California Prosecution Is Not Warranted In the Justice Department letter John R Bolton an assistant attorney general wrote We wish to advise you that the departments public integrity section has conducted a thorough investigation of the allegations against Mr Scanlon and as a result of this investigation we have determined that criminal prosecution is not warranted Accordingly the departments investigation has been closed The charges of impropriety had been raised by Joan Claybrook a consumer activist who is president of Public Citizen and others They charged that Mr Scanlon had used his Government office to do work for an antiabortion organization that he had passed secret information to companies being investigated by the commission and that he had held improper meetings with a representative of the toy industry whose products frequently come under the commissions scrutiny Consumer groups had hoped to block Mr Scanlons ascendance to chairmanship viewing him as not sufficiently diligent in protecting consumers against faulty products Preference for Negotiation Mr Scanlon has disputed this asserting that his preference for negotiating with companies to seek voluntary compliance was more effective than bringing charges that frequently are contested through long court proceedings Mr Scanlon is a Democrat but he has wide support among Republicans in Congress while most of the opposition to his appointment has come from Democrats Mr Scanlon reached at his home where he is recuperating from back surgery said I am pleased that a long and exhaustive investigation is completed He said he believed he would now be confirmed by the Senate Reaction From Opponents Ms Claybrook said she believed the wording of the Justice Department letter meant that her allegations had been sustained and that the Senate ought to reject the nomination There wasnt much question that he made false statements and that he misused Government personnel Ms Claybrook said Whether or not the Justice Department felt it merited criminal prosecution it certainly seems to me that his ethical behavior would require that he not be appointed to high public office Senator Simon reached in Champaign Ill said he would oppose the nomination on the floor but said he expected Mr Scanlon to be confirmed Asked to comment on the Justice Department statement Senator Simon said They took it to a grand jury and he was cleared of any indictable offense But that was a peripheral issue The real issue in my opinion is whether he is there to protect the consumer Clearly his interest has been to protect the industries accused of violations If he is approved we ought to change the name from the Consumer Product Safety Commission to something else because he is not interested in protecting the consumer
TV REVIEWS; CHIEF JUSTICE BURGER ON CBS NEWS SPECIAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/09/arts/tv-reviews-chief-justice-burger-on-cbs-news-special.html,WARREN E BURGER Chief Justice of the United States can be seen tonight with Bill Moyers Never before apparently has a Chief Justice been interviewed at such length and never before certainly has a Chief Justice been interviewed in the Supreme Court in front of a television camera That however is only a footnote the question is what does Chief Justice Burger say In fact he doesnt say much and this in a way is reassuring The onehour program The Burger Years a CBS News special on Channel 2 at 8 PM was filmed June 17 and 18 On June 17 Chief Justice Burger announced that he would leave the Court and devote his time to the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution I consider that celebration he says more important than my staying on the Court Nonetheless Mr Moyers understandably wants to talk about the Court not the celebration and about Chief Justice Burger The United States has had 40 Presidents but only 15 Chief Justices They have been our most remote public figures although as heads of the judicial branch they have held equal rank with the Presidents So consider the burning issues on which we want to hear Chief Justice Burger speak capital punishment say school prayer or a womans right to have an abortion Chief Justice Burger talks about death sentences Every one of the capital cases is a painful experience Mr Moyers sensing an opportunity puts a question Are you implying he asks that you oppose the death penalty Chief Justice Burger barely takes time to ponder No he says Im not implying it one way or the other And abortion Isnt that issue as Mr Moyers says one of the most divisive in America right now Chief Justice Burger says it probably is Mr Moyers sensing another opportunity says he understands that the Chief Justice has wrestled with abortion and gone back and forth in his thinking No Chief Justice Burger says I havent gone back and forth And school prayer Why has this so stirred up the country Chief Justice Burger says it hasnt stirred up the country only certain people But either way he says prayer would do no harm Mr Moyers and Chief Justice Burger continue then until once again Mr Moyers closes in Now he says I detect you personally would be in favor of letting children pray in school No the Chief Justice says you detect wrong there Is Chief Justice Burger equivocating No he is not and he does give us two great clues to his thinking The first comes when he refers to a former member of the Court of Appeals as a very great practical judge The judge when told that it might be unconstitutional to have the marshal begin court sessions with the words God save the United States and this honorable court said that if his colleagues voted to ban the ritual words he would say the words himself That the Chief Justice says ended the discussion The second clue comes when Chief Justice Burger discusses how he assigns the written opinions the other Justices write I take into account he says who will write the narrowest opinion  the narrowest just enough to decide that case What emerges then is a cautious man conscious that the Republic moves slowly and that if it does not it can be torn apart Indeed Chief Justice Burger is most eloquent talking not about the present but the past Only 125 years ago he notes Robert E Lee although he opposed both slavery and secession chose to defend Virginia and not the Union Just think he says that almost 100 years after the Revolutionary War loyalty to the state and not the nation was still the frame of mind of a great many people Presumably that is no longer the frame of mind today but the fragility Chief Justice Burger seems to say is still there A Chief Justice must not strain the social fabric without cause Chief Justice Burger says it is comforting to be criticized by both liberals and conservatives socalled liberals socalled conservatives It means he is in a safe position The Burger Years in fact is not a bad history lesson Mr Moyers looks and acts very much an attentive mildly disputatious graduate student Chief Justice Burger at the age of 78 is a judicious Mr Chips Watch the program because it has something to say
HIGH COURT'S 1985-86 TERM: MIXED RESULTS FOR PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/10/us/high-court-s-1985-86-term-mixed-results-for-president.html,In the Supreme Court term that ended Monday President Reagan won a significant reaffirmation of Presidential primacy in executing the laws but he suffered a series of major defeats on issues at the heart of his social agenda The most notable aspect of the term was the Reagan Administrations boldness in urging its views of the law upon the Court perhaps more aggressively than any predecessor in the past 50 years The Court responded by rejecting the Administrations advice firmly and sometimes testily in major decisions on abortion affirmative action minority voting rights rules designed to require medical care for infants with severe disabilities and other issues Some Victories for Reagan The Administration did achieve several victories the most notable of which was the Courts decision last Monday striking down the central provision of the new budgetbalancing law as an encroachment on Presidential authority But that ruling represented a cautious extension of a decadelong trend strengthening the President against Congress rather than a broad endorsement of this Administrations distinctive views on the separation of powers In general the Court steered a moderate course through a docket laden with an unusual number of politically charged issues shifting from left to right of center from one issue to the next as Warren E Burger who is retiring ended 17 years as Chief Justice In major decisions that did not involve the Administration the Court ruled for the first time that the Constitution bars severe forms of partisan gerrymandering and that it does not protect private homosexual relations between consenting adults The reasoning of the latter decision most constitutional theorists agreed could not easily be squared either with the Courts broad reaffirmation of abortion rights announced in another decision in the term just ended or with its precedents recognizing a right to sexual privacy for heterosexuals Reversing the Courts direction has been a major Administration priority since the 1980 Presidential campaign The effort took on more emphasis last year when Edwin Meese 3d succeeded William French Smith as Attorney General and Charles Fried succeeded Rex E Lee as Solicitor General Conservative Activists Both Mr Meese and Mr Fried are conservative activists far bolder than their predecessors in urging the Court to overrule or depart from its own precedents and adopt the Administrations views of the law Mr Fried filed the first brief in decades in which the Government urged the Court to overturn a major precedent its 1973 decision legalizing abortion The Court not only declined this invitation but curbed state power even to regulate abortion procedures more than ever before Critics including some former lawyers in the Solicitor Generals office who declined to be named said the Administrations tactics in this and other cases may have backfired irritating some of the Justices to the point that the Government may have lost some cases it would have won with a more subtle approach SmartAleck Insiders In an interview today Mr Fried dismissed such critics as smartaleck insiders who show disrespect for the Court by suggesting that its members would be swayed by peevishness He stressed that the Administration had won some significant cases and had apparently influenced the Courts thinking in others The most dramatic example of the Courts adopting his arguments Mr Fried said was its decision upholding as applied to homosexuals a Georgia law making it a crime to engage in sodomy Mr Fried did not file a brief or take a position in that case But he said today that the argument we made in terms of constitutional methodology in the abortion case was precisely the argument that showed up just a few weeks later in the sodomy decision That argument he said was that the Court should not invent rights not specified in the Constitution But in some of the cases in which Mr Fried did file briefs the Court ruled against him by lopsided margins A Rebuff on Voting Rights The Justices were unanimous in rejecting the Justice Departments narrow interpretation of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act and in rebuffing its effort to use procedural barriers to block mental patients from suing for disability benefits In some other cases several members of the Court and occasionally a majority had unusually sharp criticism for the Justice Departments arguments asserting in one affirmative action case that its brief twists the plain language used by Congress The Administrations conservative views did prevail in some significant cases of lesser magnitude such as last Mondays decision giving school officials broad latitude to discipline students for indecent speech As has always been the case the Justice Department won many more cases than it lost 78 percent Mr Fried said Most involved Federal Government positions that would not vary from one Administration to the next Presidential Authority Upheld This was true of the Courts acceptance last Monday of the Administrations view that the automatic mechanism for cutting spending at the heart of the budgetbalancing law unconstitutionally encroached on Presidential authority by giving executive power to the Comptroller General While the decision in Bowsher v Synar agreed with the constitutional doubts Mr Reagan expressed when he signed the law in December the Court explicitly declined to endorse Mr Meeses attack in two speeches on the independence of several regulatory agencies from Presidential control The Court also avoided adopting Mr Frieds position that only a subordinate of the President could be given the power to order spending cuts needed to meet the laws deficit targets Instead it accepted his narrower alternative argument that this power could not be given to the Comptroller General because of an obscure 1921 law subjecting him to removal by Congress The Justice Department probably would have made both arguments no matter who was President Mr Fried and some former officials noted It was on what some Administration lawyers call conservative agenda issuesthat the Court was least receptive to its views Following are summaries of some of the Courts most important rulings in the term that began last Oct 7 Discrimination In three major affirmative action decisions the Court reaffirmed its support for limited use of racial preferences for members of minority groups to redress specific job discrimination when other measures would not work In Wygant v Jackson Board of Education the Court in a 5to4 decision struck down as unconstitutional a Michigan school boards policy of laying off white teachers ahead of members of minority groups with less seniority It stressed both the lack of proof of any past discrimination by the school board that needed redress and the plans severe impact on laidoff white teachers But contrary to the Administration view it suggested that a public employer could make limited use of numerical hiring goals favoring members of minorities when needed to remedy its own past discrimination or to achieve racial diversity on a faculty In Local 28 v Equal Employment Opportunity Commission the Court upheld by 5 to 4 a lower court order requiring a New York City sheet metal union to eradicate its own egregious discrimination against members of minorities by meeting a 2923 percent minority membership goal While rejecting the Administrations arguments against all such numerical goals the Court stressed that they should be used sparingly and should never be enforced as quotas or simply to achieve racial balance In Local 93 v Cleveland the Court ruled that judges have broad latitude to approve over objections by white employees or unions consent decrees in which employers agree to adopt racial preferences to settle discrimination suits by employees who are members of minority groups In another major civil rights ruling the Court held unanimously that severe or pervasive sexual harassement of an employee by a supervisor violates the Federal law against sex discrimination in the workplace Meritor Savings Bank v Vinson In United States v Paralyzed Veterans of America the Court again upheld the Administrations narrow view of the antidiscrimination laws that apply to programs that receiving Federal money It ruled that a 1973 law barring discrimination against people with disabilities does not apply to commercial airlines except for the few that receive direct Federal grants Privacy The Court reaffirmed its commitment to broad abortion rights which the Administration had urged it to abandon By a vote of 5 to 4 the Court struck down a 1982 Pennsylvania law requiring doctors to provide women seeking abortions with detailed information about the risks and alternatives to file reports with the state and to take specific steps to insure live births in lateterm abortions While the majority seemed more adamant then ever in barring states from attempting even to dissuade women from having abortions two dissenters said states should be allowed to prohibit abortions The other two were more ambiguous but said they would uphold some restrictions on abortion Thornburg v American College In another 5to4 decision that bitterly divided the Court the majority held that the Constitution does not bar criminal prosecution for homosexual relations between consenting adults even in the privacy of their own homes All those who had voted for broad abortion rights dissented except Justice Lewis F Powell Jr Bowers v Hardwick Reapportionment In the gerrymandering case the Court asserted for the first time the power to strike down election district lines if a majority party in a legislature has manipulated them so severely as to consistently degrade the voting strength of another party But the Court upheld Indianas state legislative districts in the case Davis v Bandemer It held that the gerrymandering by Indianas Republicans had not had such a prolonged and severe effect as to violate the constitutional rights of Democrats In the first major test of the 1982 amendments to the Voting Rights Act the Court rejected the Administrations narrow view of the rights of minority voters and invalidated four North Carolina election districts that it said made it too hard for blacks to elect their preferred candidiates to the legislature Free Speech and Press The Court gave schools broad leeway to discipline students for indecent speech upholding the twoday suspension of a 17yearold student for using sexual metaphors to tout the virility of his candidate for student government in a speech to a school assembly Bethel School District v Fraser Sharply limiting First Amendment protection for commercial speech the Court upheld Puerto Ricos ban on local advertising of casino gambling It suggested that states may also restrict advertising of liquor cigarettes and other products that are legal but deemed harmful Posadas de Puerto Rico v Tourism Company The Court held that local zoning officials have broad powers to use zoning laws to bar movie theaters from showing sexually explicit films near homes schools churches or parks City of Renton v Playtime Theatres In Philadelphia Newspapers v Hepps the Court held that a person suing a news organization for libel must bear the burden of proving the falsity of damaging statements about him at least when the statements involve matters of public concern In another significant libel law victory for the press the Court ruled that libel suits by public officials and public figures in Federal courts must be dismissed before trial unless the evidence suggests they can prove libel with convincing clarity Anderson v Liberty Lobby The Court also extended to pretrial criminal hearings the qualified First Amendment right of the public and press to attend criminal trials PressEnterprise v Superior Court Criminal Law Prosecutors continued to win most criminal law cases but there were some significant victories for defendants and civil libertarians In the terms most important criminal law ruling the Court overturned a 1965 decision and held that prosecutors may not exclude blacks from juries based on the possibility that they would favor defendants of their own race The decision Batson v Kentucky also established an evidentiary standard making it easier for black defendants to prove unconstitutional discrimination by prosecutors who use their peremptory challenges to exclude blacks from juries The Court also ruled in Vasquez v Hillery that the conviction of any defendant indicted by a grand jury from which members of his race had been illegally excluded must be reversed In Turner v Murray it held that a black defendant facing a possible death penalty for murder of a white victim was entitled to have prospective jurors questioned about racial bias The Court rejected one of the last sweeping challenges to the procedures used by most states in cases in which death is a possible penalty It ruled in Lockhart v McCree that committed opponents of the death penalty may be barred from juries in capital cases regardless of whether this increases the likelihood of conviction The Court also ruled that the Constitution bars execution of convicted murderers who have become so insane they do not know they are about to be executed or the reason for it Ford v Wainwright The Court refused to extend its curb on police efforts to elicit information from suspects on one front while adding a new curb on anoother front In Moran v Burbine it held that police may use deception or apparently even force if necessary to keep a defense attorney away while they interrogate a criminal suspect and that they need not tell the suspect that the attorney is trying to reach him Noting that the police in the case had complied with the 1966 decision in Miranda v Arizona by informing the suspect of his rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present the Court declined to add a new requirement that the police cooperate with a lawyers independent efforts to reach the suspect Mr Fried counted this as his major criminal law victory of the term saying it put a fence around Miranda as he had urged His brief in the case made no reference to Mr Meeses denunciation of the Miranda decision itself as infamous Justice Sandra Day OConnors majority opinion explicitly stated that Miranda as written strikes the proper balance In Maine v Moulton the Court rejected the Justice Departments advice on a related issue It held that statements an informer with a hidden transmitter elicited from an indicted defendant could not be used to convict the defendant of the crime charged in the indictment even though the police who arranged the recording had reason to expect the defendant would discuss a plan to kill a witness The Court ruled in California v Ciraolo that the police do not need a warrant to spy from airplanes on the fenced yards of private homes In Dow Chemical v United States it held that the Environmental Protection Agency did not need a warrant to take aerial photographs of an industrial complex Antitrust and Business The Court encouraged trial courts to dismiss before trial antitrust suits in which the evidence of an illegal conspiracy seems implausible The case Matsushita v Zenith was a victory for 21 Japanese television manufacturers who were sued by the Zenith Electronics Corporation and another competitor It said the alleged Japanese conspiracy to destroy American producers by depressing prices to unprofitable levels in the United States would be economically senseless because it would hurt the Japanese companies too The Court upheld a strict rent control ordinance in Berkeley Calif against an antitrust suit by landlords holding that unilateral imposition of regulatory controls by a government does not amount to a antitrust conspiracy Fisher v Berkeley The Court ruled that the Federal Reserve Board had no authority to regulate limitedservice banks which restrict their activities so as to skirt the statutory definition of banks and thus avoid restrictions on interstate banking and other regulations Board of Governors v Dimension Financial Other Cases The Court ruled that the military could discipline an Orthodox Jewish officer for wearing a yarmulke indoors while in uniform holding that the militarys interest in enforcing its dress code outweighed the officers religious obligation to keep his head covered Goldman v Weinberger In Bowen v American Hospital Association the Court invalidated the Administrations Baby Doe rules which required hospitals to give Federal investigators access to their records and included other measures to force lifeprolonging medical treatment for newborn infants with severe disabilities In Bowen v City of New York the Court ruled unanimously that thousands of mentally ill New Yorkers had a right to sue the Government for illegally using a clandestine policy to deny them disability benefits It rejected the Justice Departments position that they had forfeited any right to court relief by failing to comply with statutory appeal deadlines and administrative procedures THE SUPREME COURT SESSION TALLY FOR LEFT AND RIGHT Justices William J Brennan Jr and William H Rehnquist intellectual leaders of the

ADDITION OF SCALIA'S VOTE UNLIKELY TO ALTER RULINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/11/us/addition-of-scalia-s-vote-unlikely-to-alter-rulings.html,The Supreme Courts voting patterns in the term that ended Monday suggest that none of the major cases would have been decided differently if President Reagans nominee to the court Judge Antonin Scalia had been voting instead of Chief Justice Warren E Burger who is retiring While Judge Scalia who sits on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia is expected to add intellectual vigor and leadership to the Courts conservative wing the balance of power on most issues is expected to remain with the moderate center But the large number of important cases decided by votes of 5 to 4 on issues including abortion and affirmative action suggests that a decisive shift to the right may occur if another of the aging Justices steps down while President Reagan is in office In every major case this term the winning side was supported either by Justice Lewis F Powell Jr who at 78 years of age is the most critical swing vote or by Justice Sandra Day OConnor 56 or by both of them Five years after Mr Reagan appointed her Justice OConnor has emerged as a key member of the Courts center group Record of Independence While Justice OConnor has leaned to the right in some major cases involving affirmative action religious freedom and other issues she has rejected the positions of the Administration of Chief Justice Burger and of Justice William H Rehnquist Mr Reagans nominee to be the next Chief Justice Chief Justice Burger and Justice Rehnquist were the Courts most consistent conservatives voting together in the vast majority of the 147 cases decided by signed opinions They were allied in 31 of the 34 cases decided by one vote Chief Justice Burger plans to retire as soon as Justice Rehnquist is confirmed by the Senate probably in August Judge Scalia would fill the resulting vacancy as an Associate Justice and his record suggests he will vote similarly to Justice Rehnquist and Chief Justice Burger Justice Powell voted with the majority in 28 of the 34 cases that were decided by 5to4 votes Justice OConnor voted with the majority in 25 of those 34 cases Justice Powell dissented less than any other member of the Court 13 times with Justice OConnor dissenting 14 times Justices William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall who hold down the liberal wing cast the most dissenting votes 51 for Justice Brennan and 50 for Justice Marshall In the 74 cases in which Justices Rehnquist and Brennan the courts intellectual leaders and ideological polestars took opposite sides Justice Rehnquist was in the majority in 48 and Justice Brennan in 26 In all of the 30 cases that involved criminal law Justice Rehnquist supported the prosecution and Justice Brennan the defense The prosecution won 22 of them the defense 8
A Misguided Approach To Teen-Age Pregnancy,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/11/opinion/l-a-misguided-approach-to-teen-age-pregnancy-245586.html,To the Editor At a time when tremendous public attention has been drawn to the phenomenon of babies having babies it seems particularly incongruous not to mention ill advised and cruel for New York State to be halting Medicaid assistance to as many as 4000 pregnant teenagers a year news story June 15 The states courts have long acknowledged that young women even those residing with and dependent on their parents are entitled to various forms of public assistance and medical assistance on behalf of their children despite the theoretical ability of the grandparents to support the grandchild What these decisions reflect is that in New York grandparents do not have a legal obligation to support their grandchildren The same reasoning has been applied to pregnant teenagers seeking medical assistance relating to pregnancy The decision to halt Medicaid for pregnant teenagers on the ground that their parents income renders them ineligible cannot be properly understood as a money saver because any withholding of medical assistance whether it be for prenatal care or for abortions is likely to result in greater expenditures in the long run The most likely result of this shortsighted decision is that the young women will delay seeking medical attention and will be forced into backalley abortions The cost will be paid not just with dollars but with young lives EILEEN KAUFMAN Asst Professor of Law Touro College Huntington LI June 16 1986

"The Third Branch, Upheld",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/opinion/the-third-branch-upheld.html,Warren Burgers last opinion as Chief Justice was momentous yet the country reacted calmly In nullifying one of Congresss most important recent pieces of legislation the GrammRudmanHollings budget law Justice Burger showed how far hed traveled  and how near the public consensus the Court still stands Eighteen years ago in another famous case before the Court of Appeals Judge Burger had declined to challenge the Houses refusal to seat the late Adam Clayton Powell The checks and balances we boast of can check and balance just so far he wrote then That each branch may thus occasionally make errors for which there may be no effective remedy is one of the prices we pay for this independence this separateness That Burger opinion was reversed in June 1969 by the last ruling of his predecessor Chief Justice Earl Warren who said the situation required no more than an interpretation of the Constitution By last week in his own final trespass on Congresss powers Mr Burger was just as direct No one can doubt that Congress and the President are confronted with fiscal and economic problems of unprecedented magnitude but the fact that a given law or procedure is efficient convenient and useful in facilitating functions of government standing alone will not save it if it is contrary to the Constitution This was no valedictory spree The supposedly restrained Burger Court struck down more Federal laws more state laws and more Supreme Court precedents than even the activist Warren Court and in about the same number of years Nor did the Burger Court display all the deference expected of it toward the Presidency In its last year it was especially hard on the Reagan Administrations more extreme arguments concerning voting rights affirmative action disability payments and abortion Spanning the years from Presidents Nixon to Reagan both of whom tried to force its opinions the Burger Court managed to retain a healthy independence President Reagan vows to try even harder now to staff the Court with more predictable votes and to press on it even tougher legal arguments If he gets the vacancies he undoubtedly has the will and the candidates But by now elevating Justice Rehnquist to Chief Justice and replacing Mr Burgers vote with Antonin Scalias he will not greatly alter the Courts delicate balance The Court has been both balanced and remarkably sensitive It has caught the national mood not merely followed the election returns Like the country the Court has admired Ronald Reagan but by no means all his policies it has shown weariness with welfare but insisted on justice for the poor and sick it has been distrustful of racial quotas but unwilling to countenance discrimination Warren Burgers Court by pursuing its separate function wound up being an affirmative actor in the American system
OPINION NARROWS OVER HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/us/opinion-narrows-over-high-court.html,The American public is now about evenly split on whether the Supreme Court is too liberal or too conservative in its decisions the latest New York TimesCBS News Poll shows The public is also closely divided on whether the Court is doing a good job a view it clearly rejected in the late 1960s and early 1970s Moreover in two key areas abortion and the rights of people accused of crime the public sided with the High Court and against its critics The survey of 1618 adults was taken last month just after Chief Justice Warren E Burger announced his retirement and President Reagan announced plans to solidify the conservative forces on the Court with the nominations of Associate Justice William H Rehnquist to be Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia of the Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia to be an Associate Justice of the Supreme Court The June 1923 telephone poll thus preceded the Courts decisions permitting states to outlaw sodomy and striking down the central provision of the budgetbalancing law but it appeared to show a longterm trend toward support of the Court 41 Rated Court Fair For example the TimesCBS News Poll found that 7 percent of the public rated the Court excellent 39 percent called it good 41 percent graded it fair and 7 percent said it was poor The difference between those who gave positive ratings of excellent and good and those who gave negative ratings of fair and poor did not exceed the polls margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points But in Gallup Poll measurements of the same question from 1968 through 1973 clear majorities of 51 to 54 percent rated the Court fair or poor When the public was asked in the TimesCBS News Poll if the Court in general was too liberal or too conservative in its decisions 34 percent said too liberal 38 percent said too conservative and 10 percent said that it was about right In a Gallup Poll taken in July 1973 35 percent said it was too liberal and only 26 percent said it was too conservative Seventeen percent said it was about right In the TimesCBS News Poll people who said the Courts decisions were too liberal were unhappier with the Court than those who called it too conservative Fortytwo percent of those who said it was too liberal rated it excellent or good while 57 percent rated it fair or poor Of those who called the High Court too conservative 47 percent called it excellent or good while 52 percent said it was fair or poor 1973 Groups More Critical In 1973 the same pattern had emerged although both groups were more critical of the Court than their 1986 counterparts The TimesCBS News Poll also found that only a third of the public said that the Supreme Court was too soft on people accused of crimes The respondents were asked Do you think the Supreme Court has gone too far in protecting the rights of people accused of crimes or do you think it has generally done what is necessary to see that the accused are treated fairly While 34 percent said the Court had gone too far to protect the accused 51 percent said it had done the necessary and another 5 percent said it had not done enough on behalf of the accused That question had not been asked in any previous poll But a question about the Court and abortion first asked by Gallup in 1974 found a modest plurality 49 to 43 percent saying that they favored the Courts having ruled that a woman may go to a doctor to end her pregnancy at any time during the first three months of pregnancy In 1974 1981 and in January of this year Gallup found the country about evenly split on the issue HOW THE POLL WAS CONDUCTED The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll is based on telephone interviews conducted June 19 through 23 with 1618 adults around the United States excluding Alaska and Hawaii The sample of telephone exchanges called was selected by a computer from a complete list of exchanges in the country The exchanges were chosen so as to insure that each region of the country was represented in proportion to its population For each exchange the telephone numbers were formed by random digits thus permitting access to both listed and unlisted residential numbers The results have also been weighted to take account of household size and number of residential telephones and to adjust for variations in the sample relating to region race sex age and education In theory in 19 cases out of 20 the results based on such samples will differ by no more than 3 percentage points in either direction from what would have been obtained by interviewing all adult Americans The error for smaller subgroups is larger For example for those who said the Supreme Court was too conservative or those who said it was too liberal the margin of sampling error is plus or minus four percentage points In addition to sampling error the practical difficulties of conducting any survey of public opinion may introduce other sources of error into the poll
RHODE ISLAND CHARTER CHANGE WOULD BAR ABORTION SUPPORT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/13/us/rhode-island-charter-change-would-bar-abortion-support.html,Voters in this heavily Catholic state will decide in November whether the Rhode Island Constitution should include an amendment prohibiting state financing of abortion The amendment would also prohibit abortions except to save the life of the mother but the amendment notes that the provision would not be enforced unless the United States Supreme Court reversed its stand against most state abortion restrictions A Governors order currently forbids use of state money for abortions in Rhode Island The proposed amendment was placed on the ballot by a 100member Constitutional Convention that met from January to May Among the 14 questions that the convention agreed to place before the voters were whether the terms for the Governor and state legislators should be extended to four years from two and whether the Legislature should get its first raise in 86 years from a daily salary of 5 to approximately 78 64 of Rhode Islanders Catholic The abortion question was the most controversial adopted by the convention receiving 52 votes one more than required for approval About 64 percent of Rhode Islanders are Catholic The question the last on the ballot asks Should the state be banned from using taxes to pay for abortions and should unborn life and handicapped and criminally ill persons be given paramount constitutional protection The proposed amendment is similar to one that the Massachusetts Legislature has also placed on the November ballot The Rhode Island chapter of the American Civil Liberies Union has charged that the wording of the question does not make clear that the amendment would restrict almost all abortions Groups on both sides of the issue are expected to campaign diligently The Rhode Island constitutional gathering the first since 1973 convened in January after voters overwhelmingly approved it in the 1984 general election One delegate was chosen from each Congressional district in nonpartisan elections last fall According to the Constitution voters must be asked at least once every 10 years whether a convention should be held

DIOXIN OF '76 ITALIAN ACCIDENT REPORTED DESTROYED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/14/us/dioxin-of-76-italian-accident-reported-destroyed.html,Ten years after a chemical plant accident sent a white cloud of dioxincontaminated steam and gas into the atmosphere over Seveso Italy public health officials in Switzerland say they have finally completed disposing of the last of the contaminated wastes Four hundred people have recovered from burns suffered in the accident at the Icmesa plant on July 10 1976 as have 193 who got chloracne a skin infection Many people who had to leave contaminated homes in the area near Milan have returned officials say And the 41 barrels of wastes contaminated with dioxin one of the most toxic chemicals known were incinerated at a special oven run by CibaGeigy a Swiss chemical concern based in Basel Health officials of the governments of Switzerland and the city of Basel have declared that the burning involved no further release of dioxin Report Is Submitted on It The wastes contaminated by dioxin were incinerated in Basel without representing a danger either for the personnel charged with the task or the local population the national and city health officials said in a report on the operation It shows that organic problem wastes including those containing significant amounts of polychlorinated dioxins and furanes as well as their predecessor substances can be burned without danger to humans and the environment Although the incineration was finished a year ago officials say it is still too early to say if the process used in Basel can point the way to safe burning of municipal wastes Because of the high temperatures needed for the Seveso wastes plus specialized testing and monitoring experts here believe the process may be too costly for general application by municipalities which create dioxin in the burning of regular wastes Dr Bruno Boehlen head of the Swiss Office of Environmental Protection and Dr Hansjoerg Renk a spokesman for the Seveso plants parent company the Swiss chemical combine HoffmannLaRoche say the incineration has paved the way for future disposal of such substances and that one immediate result may be less stringent requirements for landfills to dispose of dioxincontaminated material It Drew Worldwide Attention The rupture at the Reparto B reaction vessel in 1976 at the Icmesa plant owned by Givaudan a subsidiary of HoffmannLa Roche drew worldwide attention even though no one was killed and earlier chemical accidents had been judged more lethal Officials at HoffmanLaRoche say they believe the wide attention was due in part to photographs of young children who suffered skin burns from the highly caustic gases released in the accident But the key issue was a lack of knowledge about dioxin or TCDD which is formally designated 2378tetrachlordibenzoparadioxin This byproduct is produced at temperatures above 160 degrees centigrade in some chemical processes such as the manufacture of 245TCP or trichlorophenol which is used in herbicides In the case of Icmesa TCP was being produced for use in the disinfectant hexachlorophene Givaudan a Genevabased company manufactures perfume flavorings and disinfectants Enormous Strains Created Because of the lack of knowledge about dioxin says a separate report produced by HoffmannLaRoche to mark the 10th anniversary the extent of the danger was difficult to assess This uncertainty places enormous strains on people in the accident zone who though not exhibiting any symptoms might have come into contact with the substance this report said The contamination led to the wholescale slaughter of thousands of small domestic animals in the region as well as horses cows and goats and long decontamination efforts including removal of topsoil and debris from the area HoffmannLaRoche maintains that no one died as a direct result of the accident But it notes that the Seveso production manager Paolo Paoletti who was one of those charged with culpability was shot dead Feb 5 1980 apparently in reprisal by terrorists who identified themselves as members of Front Line a farleft urban guerrilla group Nevertheless data gathered on the effects of dioxin suggested that it is one of the most toxic manmade substances even in minute amounts and some exposed animals ultimately died It was discovered that some animals were more resistant to dioxin for example hamsters which could withstand 10000 times more dioxin than guinea pigs In its report HoffmannLa Roche said laboratory experiments with animals found that dioxin could have both inhibiting and stimulating effects on the immune system increase enzyme activity of the liver and cause tumors spontaneous abortion fetal malformation and chloracne But HoffmannLaRoche officials maintain that with the exception of chloracne there is no evidence of any damage to health of humans from dioxin Protests in Basel Over Barrels Still the arrival of the 41 barrels of contaminated wastes prompted environmental protests in Basel in 1983 and the authorities supervising the disposal said they took extraordinary measures to assure that as little dioxin as possible was released in the incineration Officials say the entire process took three years including test burnings with constant monitoring The actual burning at temperatures exceeding 1200 degrees centigrade took 100 hours and cost more than 25 million No or only very small amounts of dioxin were registered in exhaust fumes the report said concluding that burning such substances safely required knowledge of the composition of all the wastes involved and constant checking of the emissions Problematic organic wastes particularly those containing notable quantities of dioxin and polychlorinated furanes can thus be incinerated without presenting a risk for people or the environment Public Concern Persists Still public concern has persisted in part because of the remaining concern about the health risks of exposure to dioxin and the complex and timeconsuming nature of the incineration We would only know weeks after the test whether it had actually worked said Dr Boehlen whose Office of Environmental Protection supervised the burning This was not good for public confidence There will still be the need for landfills because such incinerations as the one done in Basel produce lots of slag because of the mixing of 30 tons of sand with the 22 tons of wastes Dr Renk said This slag is only very slightly toxic So you dont need a fullfledged toxicwaste landfill But the same sort of result may not apply to dioxin created in the burning of municipal wastes Higher Levels Are Charged It has been shown that the levels of dioxin that go out of some municipal waste incinerators is actually higher than those that existed during the actual dioxin incineration in Basel Dr Renk said I think it is above all a question of economics because special hazardous waste incinerators work at

wastes during this experience but maybe the Government will be able to find ways and means to apply it

SAFETY BOARD AIDE NAMED TO 3D TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/16/us/safety-board-aide-named-to-3d-term.html,President Reagan today nominated Jim Burnett to serve a third twoyear term as chairman of the National Transportation Safety Board The announcement ended several months of uncertainty in Congress after it was learned the White House was considering other candidates for the post Opponents of Mr Burnett had encouraged the White House to appoint someone who would be less of a potential adversary with the transportation industry and the Department of Transportation Mr Burnett a 38yearold former Arkansas municipal judge has infuriated some segments of the industry particularly railroads and airlines with his aggressive advocacy of tougher safety regulations His efforts at reorganizing the safety board also alienated many longtime employes Officials of the Senate Committee on Commerce Science and Transportation which must approve the nomination said his chances of winning approval appeared fine The White House declined to explain the considerations in determining whether Mr Burnett or someone else would be asked to head the board which investigates air rail and gas pipeline accidents and major highway accidents and recommends safety precautions In April the chairmen and ranking minority members of the House and Senate aviation subcommittees wrote Mr Reagan urging that Mr Burnett be reappointed asserting that it would give him a chance to continue the excellent work he had done for transportation safety Representative John Paul Hammerschmidt Republican of Arkansas said speculation was that the Department of Transportation had heartburn over Mr Burnett It was widely known that several divisions of the department particularly the Federal Aviation Administration had been unhappy with Mr Burnetts pronouncements about aviation safety asserting he was pushing too hard The department said today that it had never opposed his nomination and derided public reports that it had SCANLON CONFIRMED BY SENATE WASHINGTON July 15 UPI  The Senate voted 63 to 33 today to confirm President Reagans nomination of Terrence M Scanlon as chairman of the Consumer Product Safety Commission Mr Scanlon a conservative Democrat received a recess appointment to the post by Mr Reagan in December 1984 but the nomination had been held up in the Senate while the Justice Department investigated charges that he had used Federal employees and equipment to promote opposition to abortion Mr Scanlon called the charges baseless and the Justice Department determined that criminal prosecution was not warranted
Praise for the Court's Unpredictability,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/16/opinion/praise-for-the-court-s-unpredictability.html,Once again the Burger Court has confounded its critics The most recent batch of cases the last to be decided during the tenure of the retiring Chief Justice defies ideological classification On issues ranging from capital punishment to sodomy press reporting of judicial proceedings to tasteless speech at high school assemblies racial preferences in employment to the separation of Government powers in the task of budget control the Court has produced a mosaic of decisions that no one could have predicted Perhaps that is as it should be a fitting valedictory for an era in which the Supreme Court managed to please neither the left nor the right neither the politicians nor the academy Conservative politicians reaction to the Burger Court is especially interesting The political right is frustrated that a Court appointed almost entirely by Republican Presidents it has been 19 years since a Democrat named a Justice should take a measured complex view of such constitutional issues as religion in the public schools abortion affirmative action and capital punishment Emboldened by its electoral landslide the Administration feels it is entitled to appoint judges throughout the Federal judiciary whose decisions on these and other issues are predictably in consonance with conservative political ideology The unpredictability of the Burger Court is in my view one of its greatest strengths The constitutional tradition of the United States a tradition virtually all political factions have a stake in preserving was built by judges whose decisions disappointed the Presidents who appointed them Had such Justices as John Marshall Oliver Wendell Holmes and Charles Evans Hughes been more predictable in the way they decided cases our constitutional law would be very different than it is and much the poorer Of course not all forms of unpredictability contribute to the development of a vital constitutional tradition The political community has a right to expect from its judges some fixed points of reference in the way the Constitution is interpreted A court would act lawlessly for example were it to hold at this late date that the Government lacks constitutional authority to regulate labor relations in the private sector or that the strictures of the First Amendment limit only the Congress and not state and local governments Both decisions could be reconciled with a literal interpretation of the constitutional text but they would defeat settled expectations that are integral to the constitutional tradition as it has evolved There are such things as easy cases and a court is dutybound to decide them in a predictable way Virtually none of the disputes that reach the Supreme Court are easy cases Most of them concern issues for which the sources of legal authority  constitutional text original understanding evolving tradition precedent  do not yield determinate answers Even for such cases however the Courts decisions ought to be predictable in certain respects There is little to be said for a court opinion that leaves lawyers who read it confused about the basis for the judgment and thereby uncertain how to advise clients or prepare subsequent cases Basic canons of judicial craft require a good measure of predictability regarding the narrower more immediate legal implications of specific decisions Beyond that it is fair to ask of judges that their patterns of decision be reasonably coherent and consistent Precedents that are arguably at odds with a new judgment ought to be distinguished or overruled It may even be proper to expect that major developments in constitutional interpretation be foreshadowed somewhat in earlier cases as was true for Brown v Board of Education school desegregation and Miranda v Arizona confessions but not Engel v Vitale school prayer or Roe v Wade abortion During the 17 years of Chief Justice Warren Burgers tenure the Court has occasionally been guilty of judgments that were disturbingly unpredictable in one or another of the ways just described but hardly more guilty than most previous Courts Modern commentators tend to forget the shortcomings of craft that characterized the Courts decisions on child labor during the 1920s or labor picketing during the 1940s What seems to trouble the sharpest critics of the Burger Court is a different kind of unpredictability the difficulty of knowing in advance how the Court will resolve an issue such as the teaching of creationism in the public schools that may arouse political passions but for which no well established line of precedents exists and often the difficulty of knowing how an individual Justice will think about such an issue The quality of the Courts work would suffer were this type of unpredictability to be significantly reduced For a predictable judge is one whose ideology makes him uninterested in original arguments new perspectives untidy facts He is a judge whose major premises swamp his analysis of cases A judge whose decisions are highly predictable is not influenced much by the unique experience of reading briefs hearing argument on both sides of a dispute and thinking carefully about an issue with the knowledge that people will actually be affected by ones conclusion That can be an intensely personal and absorbing experience It can also be an enlightening experience one that the best judges use to get beneath the surface of a case and beyond their own preconceptions The unpredictability that results from openmindedness is the essence of good judging It would be a mistake to equate this praiseworthy unpredictability with the absence of vision or with adherence to any particular set of principles regarding how the Constitution should be interpreted Chief Justice Earl Warren and Justice William O Douglas were both civil libertarians but Justice Warrens judging was far less predictable than that of Justice Douglas Both Justice John Marshall Harlan and current Chief Justicedesignate William Rehnquist can be considered deeply conservative judges yet Justice Harlans decisions were notably less predictable than Justice Rehnquists have been to date Justices John Paul Stevens and Sandra Day OConnor have been especially impressive in their unpredictability  they consistently produce opinions that contribute fresh thinking to the problems they address Yet their basic instincts and preconceptions differ markedly while both Justices can be described as moderates Justice Stevens is far more concerned with individual rights Justice OConnor with states rights What the best judges have in common is not their preconceptions but the capacity to think past their preconceptions Depending on electoral currents that are themselves unpredictable the next era of the Supreme Court may be dominated by Justices who are predisposed to grant Government wide power to regulate the individual and promote majoritarian morality In time I am confident the pendulum will shift and people who believe in the central importance of individual rights will again be appointed to the bench ideally without our first having to endure the kinds of object lessons here and abroad that kindled the Warren Courts concern for those rights In either type of era the nation will be well served if the Supreme Court is staffed by men and women who are as good at thinking beyond their preconceptions and hence as unpredictable as most of the Justices of the Burger Court have been
CENTERS' ABORTION ADS CALLED 'BOGUS',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/16/nyregion/centers-abortion-ads-called-bogus.html,An abortionrights group said yesterday that a number of bogus clinics are advertising themselves as centers for women seeking abortions when their main purpose is to persuade women to continue their pregnancies The organization the New York Metropolitan Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights said that as many as 2100 such centers were being operated around the country by antiabortion groups It said that at least five operate in New York City and Westchester County and advertise in the Nynex Yellow Pages under the heading Clinics J Michael Byers the business manager for the Pearson Foundation of St Louis which operates more than 20 of the centers around the country said that listing them as clinics was proper We wish to encourage them to advertise anywhere if they can get the attention of the abortionbound and save their babies from death he said After all shes going to get the truth which she doesnt get at the abortuary Ads in Yellow Pages Some of the local centers identified by the rights coalition run advertisements in the Yellow Pages that begin Are you thinking of an abortion and offer free pregnancy tests birth control information and financial assistance The coalition founded 10 years ago by representatives of major Protestant denominations and several Jewish organizations said women who come to the centers are given a widely available urine test that can be performed by people who have no medical license Such tests if not properly verified could mislead women into thinking they are not pregnant when they are thus preventing them from receiving proper prenatal care or being alert to such hazardous conditions as a tubal pregnancy the coalition said The coalition said the centers refuse to help women get abortions are not staffed by doctors and do not examine the women after the pregnancy tests The centers the coalition said try to frighten women into forgoing abortions by presenting them with misleading statistics about the hazards of abortion and showing them slides and pamphlets with pictures of dead fetuses What Is a Clinic Peter Slocum a spokesman for the New York State Health Department said an incorporated medical center offering diagnosis and treatment must receive a license from the state However if a place chooses to call itself a clinic but does not offer medical services it does not require such a license he said Lanie Accles a spokesman for the New York State Attorney Generals office said the office had received a number of complaints saying that some centers had been misrepresenting themselves as abortion clinics She said the office is investigating although she did not identify any individual centers that had been the subject of complaints Amy Sutnik a public information associate of Planned Parenthood of New York City who attended the news conference and spoke of visiting two of the clinics said they exploit women who are in an emotional crisis over unplanned pregnancies Theyre lured into these centers and given inaccurate and unobjective information so they cant decide whats best for themselves she said The coalition identified these centers in the New York area Options 80 Fifth Avenue in Manhattan Manhattan Pregnancy Services 210 East 23d Street in Manhattan AAA Pregnancy Problem Services at 6802 5th Avenue in Brooklyn Crisis Pregnancy Center of New York at 322 New Dorp Lane in Staten Island and Alternative Pregnancy Care in Mahopac Falls NY At Options Silvana Guido the director refused to let a reporter inside She described her group as a volunteer agency that offers assistance to pregnant women and said it was absurd to accuse it of trying to deceive women The offices of Manhattan Pregnancy Services appeared much like a pediatricians waiting room down to the childrens tables and toys Robert Nelson a volunteer said the group offers free urine tests and presents slide shows on options during pregnancy We always encourage them to keep the child he said Abortion is the worst option a person can choose Mary Elias director of the Brooklyn center would not consent to an interview saying We offer help to women who come in They can take it or not take it The Staten Island office was closed yesterday and there was no answer at the Mahopac Falls number Aid From Foundation Simha Rosenberg director of the coalition said several of the clinics are associated with the Pearson Foundation an organization set in 1970 by Robert J Pearson a home builder and Roman Catholic layman who opposes abortion Mr Byers said the foundation may have provided advice and manuals to people trying to set up the New York area centers Mr Byers contended that some abortion clinics misrepresent themselves with ambiguous titles or by promising to offer reproductive services when in fact they primarily offer abortions Meade Arble a spokesman at the Nynex Information Resources Company said it does not check whether advertisers listed in the Yellow Pages as clinics offer medical services
CONGRESS RATIFIES SPENDING CUTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/18/us/congress-ratifies-spending-cuts.html,Congress today overwhelmingly ratified 117 billion in spending cuts made earlier under the budgetbalancing law The House approved the cuts by 339 to 72 a larger margin than the Democratic leadership had expected The Senate then approved them on a voice vote with no dissent and sent them to President Reagan Administration officials have said Mr Reagan will sign the bill The 117 billion was cut in March from hundreds of Federal programs for 1986 under the laws automatic spendingcut mechanism But the Supreme Court struck down this mechanism last week and ruled the cuts invalid It stayed its order for 60 days to permit Congress to affirm the cuts and keep them in effect Domenici Sees Minor Test In striking down the automatic mechanism the Court said it violated the Constitutions separation of powers by giving to an officer of Congress the Controller General executive powers to estimate allocate and order the cuts needed to meet deficit targets Senator Pete V Domenici of New Mexico a Republican who is chairman of the Senate Budget Committee was not overly optimistic about the future of the fallback provision He said before the votes in the House and the Senate It will be at least a minor test and I stress minor test as to whether the fallback will work After voting to keep the spending cuts intact the House began to debate an appropriations bill for the Commerce State and Justice Departments that is 1 billion over the target approved in the 1987 Congressional budget resolution But in response to calls for some fiscal responsibility the House tonight voted a 5 percent acrosstheboard cut excluding the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Drug Enforcement Administration The vote on this amendment was 213 to 125 The bill was approved 269 to 66 after the House adopted an amendment on a voice vote to ban the use of Federal funds abortions in prisons Even with the 5 percent cut the 124 billion is still several hundred million dollars over the budget ceiling and reflects the continued difficulty the Congress has had in cutting the deficit especially when popular domestic spending programs are involved The bill provides funds for many of the domestic programs that the President has sought to terminate or cut sharply in the past five years It also sharply reduces Mr Reagans request for enhanced embassy security and would gradually eliminate the Civil Rights Commission 175 Million for UN Earlier the House voted a 175 million United States contribution to the United Nations On voice votes it adopted amendments to eliminate the 75 million contribution to the United Nations Department of Public Information The margin in the House to reaffirm the budget cuts raised some expectations for the future of the fallback provision Under that provision the House and Senate have to approve the same cuts and then send the bill to the President for his signature or veto Worry Over Political Will Mr Domenici among others is worried that Congress will not have the political will to approve the cuts under the fallback provision and support efforts to repair the law by revising and restoring the automatic mechanism The three Senate sponsors of the law are to announce on Friday a proposal that would give power over the cuts to the Director of the Office of Management and Budget The proposal according to one sponsor Senator Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina would include provisions to limit the discretion of the director In the House some leaders are saying they do not like the proposal to shift the authority to the budget office because there was no way to limit the directors discretion and keep the proposal constitutional Representative Thomas S Foley of Washington the Democratic whip in the House said some members were interested in sticking with the fallback provision But he did suggest a new proposal that would keep the present arrangement under which the Office of Management and Budget and the Congressional Budget Office estimate the deficit to determine if the ceiling 144 billion in 1987 has been breached by 10 billion or more If it is breached acrosstheboard cuts are specified This order then goes to the Comptroller But the Comptrollers order to the President in this case would not be mandatory Instead the President would have the option of signing it or vetoing it Much Power Would Shift Mr Foley acknowledged that the cuts would no longer be automatic But he and other members said such a proposal would shift much of the political responsibility for cutting the deficit to the President Later Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida the ranking Democrat on the Senate Budget Committee suggested that he might favor a temporary assignment of the automatic spending cut mechanism to the OMB for this year Then Congress could take time to create a permanent mechanism more to everyones liking Of the 117 billion in spending cuts voted last March half came in military spending and half in nonmilitary programs excluding Social Security and a group of programs for the poor In the military budget the acrosstheboard cut was 49 percent in each program while in the nonmilitary programs it was 43 percent In addition the 1986 costofliving increases for Federal and military retirees were canceled Estimates Over Ceiling The Commerce State and Justice Departments appropriations bill according to the Congressional Budget Office is within its budget authority ceiling of 129 billion for 1987 Budget authority can be used over several years But the estimated actual spending for the fiscal year 1987 was 11 billion over its ceiling With the 5 percent cut spending is still several hundred million dollars over the ceiling according to Representative Bill Frenzel the Minnesota Republican who proposed the cut Among the programs this bill supports that Mr Reagan wanted to end are the Economic Development Administration the Legal Services Corporation and the juvenile justice and delinquency prevention program The bill also rejects the Presidents proposal to gradually eliminate the Small Business Administration Mr Reagans 28 billion request for the Department of State was cut 11 billion For diplomatic security the bill approves 227 million which is 862 million less then Mr Reagan wanted
RESEARCHER REPORTS SUCCESS IN TESTS TO DETECT HEMOPHILIA IN FETUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/18/us/researcher-reports-success-in-tests-to-detect-hemophilia-in-fetus.html,A high degree of success in diagnosing hemophilia before birth by analyzing DNA was reported here today at a genetics meeting The same method has also been used to detect those who are not hemophiliacs but carry the defective gene and are capable of passing it on to their sons said Dr Stylianos E Antonarakis of the Johns Hopkins Medical Institutions in a report to a genetics conference at the Jackson Laboratory here It is estimated that one in every 10000 boys born in this country will suffer from hemophilia the hereditary disease in which the blood fails to clot properly Hemophilia results from a defect in the DNA in the gene that is the blueprint for making blood factor 8 one of the crucial substances in blood Defects Found by Research Dr Antonarakis said the diagnostic tests have only become available within the past year as new research has made clear the details of the chemical defects in the patients DNA that result in lifelong bleeding problems in people who have the disease New research has disclosed a remarkable number of such specific defects all different but all producing the full severity of the hereditary blood disease The new tests are based on scientists ability to detect the specific mutations in the individuals DNA He said the new tests allowed much safer and more effective testing in the fetus than had ever been possible The medical scientist said he believed the laboratory at Johns Hopkins was the only one in the country doing prenatal testing for hemophilia Within the past year scientists at Johns Hopkins have found a total of 10 different mutations in the gene for blood factor 8 any one of which will cause hemophilia He said scientists at Genentech Inc a biotechnology company in South San Francisco Calif have independently found five others Throughout life hemophilia victims are in danger of bleeding to death from minor cuts and often suffer disabling effects from internal bleeding The patients often need transfusions of blood factor 8 to curb bleeding Breakthroughs in Technique In the past fetal diagnosis has only been possible by using the technique of fetoscopy to remove enough blood from a fetus to study its ability to coagulate Dr Antonarakis said The new tests require only a small sample of DNA from fetal tissue that can be obtained by taking a sample of amniotic fluid or by taking a sample of tissue from the exterior of the amniotic sac Dr Antonarakis said the tests are for families in which hemophilia has already appeared The medical research team at Johns Hopkins has studied 84 families about half for detection of healthy carriers of the disease the others for diagnosis in fetuses In some cases he said prospective parents who were considering abortion changed their minds when the diagnostic tests showed that the baby would not have the disease The mutations that have been detected in the gene for blood factor 8 are of two kinds deletions of parts of the gene and changes that substitute a single subunit of the DNA for another thus changing the message that is encoded in its chemistry The single subunit changes equivalent to a change in one letter of a word that would change it to a different word that has an entirely different meaning for example replacing an h with a p and thus changing the word from hill to pill The molecules of DNA that serve as a persons genetic archive are made of long chains of four basic subunits repeated many times in various combinations A single gene will contain several thousand of the subunits The four are the relatively simple chemicals adenine thymine guanine and cytosine Dr Antonarakis said scientists have discovered recently that the sequence of cytosine followed by guanine in such a chain is often particularly susceptible to mutation Enzymes that cut the DNA strand when it encounters a sequence that contains a cytosineguanine sequence have proved valuable in detecting the point mutations that result in hemophilia he said The genetics meeting here is sponsored by the Jackson Laboratory the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation and Johns Hopkins
SOLICITOR GENERAL'S OFFICE; Tasting the Salty Air of Politics and Criticism,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/18/us/solicitor-general-s-office-tasting-the-salty-air-of-politics-and-criticism.html,The Solicitor Generals Office an elite corps of lawyers who represent the Government in the Supreme Court has usually been viewed as a place where law takes precedence over politics But in the Reagan Administration it has become a focus of intense political debate Critics say the Administration has politicized the office especially since Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d and Solicitor General Charles Fried took office last year by aggressively urging the Court to bring the law into step with the Administrations policies and to repudiate the Courts own precedents Former Solicitors General Archibald Cox Erwin N Griswold and Wade H McCree and some lawyers who have worked under Mr Fried have expressed more muted concern that the Administrations assertive posture may have damaged the special stature of the office Mr Fried rejects such criticisms as nonsense He said this week that most of the critics were so hostile to the Administrations views that they cant bear to even have them stated The Worst Drubbing As support for their views the critics cite the Courts firm rejection in the term ended last week  sometimes in unusually barbed tones  of Mr Frieds ideologically charged arguments on issues at the heart of the Administrations political agenda The Court handed major defeats to the Administration by reaffirming support for abortion rights and for affirmative action in the workplace and by unanimously rejecting Mr Frieds narrow interpretation of the 1982 Voting Rights Act amendments The past term was the worst drubbing the Solicitor Generals Office has taken in the Supreme Court in many years according to Burt Neuborne litigation director for the American Civil Liberties Union Bruce Fein a constitutional specialist who supports the Administration calls it the worst term for any Administration in half a century Mr Neuborne says the Administration lost cases it could have won because it acted like just another interest group and made politically tinged arguments that stampeded the Courts middle against them Several former Justice Department lawyers made the same observation At the center of the storm is Mr Fried a tall 51yearold native of Czechoslovakia with the scholarly demeanor of the law professor he was until last year He attracted a heavier barrage of criticism than perhaps any other Solicitor General in modern history even before he got the job when as Acting Solicitor General last summer he urged the Supreme Court in a brief to abandon its protection of abortion rights Mr Fried noting that he won a respectable 71 percent of his cases this year said that the clarity of our arguments had helped shape the longterm evolution of the law even when those arguments had not won the Courts triumphant embrace His bitterness at any suggestion that he has subordinated legal integrity to political expediency was evident in his angry response to a gibe by Mr Griswold who as Dean of Harvard Law School hired him to join its faculty 25 years ago Mr Griswold the Solicitor General from 1967 to 1973 had said in a televised interview that Mr Frieds abortion brief was so contrary to the offices traditional deference to the Court that it apparently was filed pursuant to instructions This Mr Fried said Monday was a shameful thing for him to say Today he revised himself saying I think that charge is shameful because its false Mr Griswold for his part said this week that he might have been too hard in his comment With Mr Meese assailing the Supreme Courts decisions the Solicitor Generals Office has certainly been a hotter spot than in the past when it was viewed as almost an appendage of the Court Aside from bitter attacks by some ideological adversaries and more measured criticisms by some subordinates in opinions of the Court Mr Fried has been the target of barbed asides of a kind rarely if ever aimed at his predecessors In a plurality opinion rejecting the Administrations broad attack on affirmative action preferences for example Justice William J Brennan Jr copiously documented the conflicts between Mr Frieds brief and earlier Justice Department positions and said his positon twists the plain language used by Congress Meantime three of four top career lawyers in the office with nearly 40 years of experience among them resigned in the past year Each said he had personal reasons for leaving but colleagues say unhappiness with the MeeseFried regime was a factor Mr Fried counters that we have a very warm and friendly office now and that the quality of the lawyers is as high as its ever been Even critics credit Mr Fried with bringing in topnotch legal talent to fill the vacancies and filing wellcrafted briefs with a few exceptions The briefs were wellreasoned Mr Neuborne said The problem was that they staked out extreme positions and if you stake out an extreme position in this Court youre going to lose because the balance of power is held by pragmatists Such criticism obscures the fact that Mr Fried has been far less aggressive in challenging existing law in his arguments to the Court than Mr Meese has been in his public statements On the other hand Mr Fried has been far less deferential to the Court than his immediate predecessor Rex E Lee who avoided broad positions that the Court was clearly unprepared to accept Mr Lee won praise from some of Mr Frieds critics but was excoriated by conservative activists close to Mr Meese for not pushing hard enough Mr Lee says both he and Mr Fried are victims of what I think is the reality of todays world That reality he adds is that you cannot be the Solicitor General of the United States and avoid one of two images  either that youre not boldly conservative enough or that youre not respectful enough of the Supreme Court

VATICAN REPORT THREATENS PRO-CHOICE NUNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/22/world/vatican-report-threatens-pro-choice-nuns.html,The Vatican today formally threatened to take disciplinary action against two American nuns who signed an advertisement during the 1984 presidential campaign supporting the right of Roman Catholics to dissent from the churchs opposition to abortion In a statement the Vatican office that deals with religious orders also said it had cleared an additional 25 American nuns priests and brothers who also signed the advertisement but have since made public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion The two nuns under threat Sisters Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey who work in a shelter for the homeless in Charleston W Va have refused to make such a declaration In the announcement today the Vaticans first formal comment since the case began Jerome Cardinal Hamer the prefect of the Congregation for Religious and Secular Institutes appeared to be issuing a direct challenge to the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur the order to which the two nuns belong In a statement last month the order said it would resist a Vatican request to dismiss them The statement criticized the two nuns for their endorsement of the advertisement but said We do not see in this action sufficient cause to initiate a process for dismissal Vatican officials familiar with the case said the Cardinals frustration over the two holdouts stemmed from their refusal to accept a form of retraction that was far milder than his office had originally sought In addition Cardinal Hamer and other Vatican officials have been angered by the sisters statements that they would continue to be active in movements in favor of abortion rights An Implied Threat The Vatican statement today said that the Holy See is closely following the efforts of the general government of the Notre Dame sisters with the hope that the cases of their two sisters will be resolved without having to begin formal disciplinary procedures in accord with church law This was seen in the Vatican as a clear threat to carry out formal disciplinary procedures if the order did not convince Sisters Barbara and Patricia to back off their stand Sister Elizabeth Bowyer one of the five members of the Romebased orders governing group declined to comment on the case today She said last month that the order had asked the two sisters to clarify their prochoice position The case of the signers of the ad which appeared in The New York Times on Oct 7 1984 has become one of the most important tests of the Vaticans campaign to sanction clerics who publicly differ with official Church teaching Two sentences in the advertisement were regarded as particularly offensive by the Vatican and many Roman Catholic leaders in the United States Statement of recent Popes and of the Catholic hierarchy have condemned the direct termination of prenatal life as morally wrong in all instances There is a mistaken belief in American society that this is the only legitimate Catholic position The ad also said that a large number of Catholic theologians believed that abortion can sometimes be a moral choice Vatican officials were angered because the language went beyond the legal and political arguments over abortion and appeared to call into question the Churchs firmly stated teaching that abortion is murder Cardinal Hamer has said the statement was a source of confusion and even scandal to many Catholics The advertisement appeared in the midst of the 1984 presidential campaign At the time Geraldine Ferraro a Roman Catholic who was the Democratic nominee for vice president was being challenged by members of the National Conference of Bishops for her stand in favor of legal abortion
DALLAS PROSECUTOR: 36 YEARS A LAW-AND-ORDER ICON,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/22/us/dallas-prosecutor-36-years-a-law-and-order-icon.html,On a death penalty case you usually dont want a juror over 60 who might die tomorrow but you never know Henry Wade said sitting back in his chair and meditating on his own private calculus of punishments I had two jurors who were 85 and one of them jumped up and threatened to whip the defense lawyer said Mr Wade the Dallas County District Attorney He gave the defendant the death penalty and showed up the next day to ask if Id killed him yet He wanted to save his soul for the Lord The man was some kind of offbrand church and he was kind of nutty on religion but he was a good juror for us There are few certainties in the legal system but for the last 36 years the one overwhelming constant here has been the dominating presence of Henry Wade who has served as something of a lawandorder icon since he became District Attorney in 1950 Mr Wades career has had some conspicuous moments in the national eye There was the prosecution in 1964 of Jack Ruby who killed Lee Harvey Oswald In 1970 his office was sued by a woman who sought an abortion and thus his name is part of Roe v Wade the landmark Supreme Court decision And there was the Lenell Geter case ending in 1984 in which a young black engineer with no criminal background was finally freed after being given a life sentence for a robbery prosecutors later said he did not commit But as Mr Wade prepares to step down at the end of the year the national recognition of his office as one of the most relentless prosecutorial machines in the country pales before Mr Wades status locally Few people have defined Dallass conservative instincts as decisively as the 71yearold Mr Wade It is as hard for people here to think of the District Attorneys office without Henry Wade as it is to think of the Dallas Cowboys without Tom Landry Efficient and Effective His former chief lieutenant Doug Mulder said It was the most efficient and effective prosecuting machine in the country Some critics say it was too efficient and effective seeking Draconian sentences and concentrating more on convictions than justice Others especially citing the Geter case say it has slipped in recent years But Mr Mulder recently summed up the prevailing mood when he told Mr Wade at a roast in his honor Thanks for being the only legend most of us will ever know Mr Wades incessant cigar chewing folksy drawl and fondness for dominoes and mucking about on his 140acre farm have given him an artfully deceiving image Melvin Belli who unsuccessfully defended Mr Ruby called Mr Wade a country bumpkin But the folsky manner masked a keen legal mind and a fierce competitive streak Mr Wades career has been marked at times to a point bordering on caricature by a belief in the efficacy of punishment As a prosecutor he asked for the death sentence 30 times and got it 29 times In his last court appearance in 1973 before he restricted himself to administrative duties he won 5005year prison terms for two kidnappers Even his critics say one of Mr Wades achievements has been to keep the office independent locally His first crusade in the early 1950s was against drunken drivers and victims came from all parts of town He says one of his proudest achievements has been keeping organized crime activity to a minimum in Dallas But tough prosecution has not had much impact on Dallass crime rate where property crime has been among the highest in the nation It has been a model for Texas a solid office an honest office but its glory days are long gone said Peter Lesser a local defense attorney who has twice run for district attorney himself unsuccessfully once against Mr Wade and once to succeed him Henry Wade built a great house but if you leave the roof alone for 36 years its going to leak If the Geter case was Mr Wades most recent and least pleasant foray into the national spotlight the Ruby prosecution is still his best known After a gap of 23 years the passions of the case have mellowed and when Mr Wade reminisces on it he does so with a vague halfsmile as if evoking a distant bizarre spectacle There must have been 300 reporters crowding around he recalled of the scene the night of the assassination of President Kennedy here Nov 22 1963 And suddenly theres Ruby he said yelling Henry youre wanted on the telephone It turned out to be a disk jockey called the Weird Beard Ruby had called him and said he could get an exclusive interview The next day Mr Ruby shot and killed Oswald a crime for which Mr Wade won a conviction and death sentence He mused for a while on the trial and its aftermath No question he had some loose cells in his brain he said of Mr Ruby but when asked if he ever felt any sympathy for him Mr Wades rueful smile immediately flicked off Im not inclined to feel sorry for any defendants in a trial Henry Wade said
THE FEDERALIST SOCIETY: The cover of a pamphlet published by the Federalist Society; Judge Scalia's Cheerleaders,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/23/us/federalist-society-cover-pamphlet-published-federalist-society-judge-scalia-s.html,Probably no organization in Washington is happier with the nomination of Antonin Scalia as a Justice of the Supreme Court than the Federalist Society a group of conservative lawyers and law students We are very happy with his nomination said Steven G Calabresi a special assistant to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d who is national chairman of the group He is exactly the kind of person we want on the Supreme Court The Federalist Society is named after the Federalist Papers in which Alexander Hamilton James Madison and John Jay urged adoption of the Constitution The group was founded in 1981 by three law students  Mr Calabresi at Yale and Lee Liberman and David McIntosh at the University of Chicago  who were unhappy with what they saw as liberal bias in most law schools according to Mr Calabresi They recruited Antonin Scalia then a professor at the University of Chicago Law School to be an adviser to the organization The Federalist Society now has 70 chapters at law schools throughout the nation and lawyers divisions in Washington New York Los Angeles and Chicago for a total membership of 2000 Since setting up a national office in Washington three years ago the group has also become a wellspring of talent for the Reagan Administration with many of its members including all three of its founders holding policymaking positions at the Justice Department and others represented at the White House and on the Federal bench Spreading Its Message The group organizes conservative legal symposiums at law schools throughout the nation It also tries to get across its message through publication of books and pamphlets and by sponsoring monthly luncheons in Washington that are attended by more than 100 lawyers in the capital Mr Calabresi says that although the group is conservative it does not necessarily take a unified stand on current issues He said for example that the members ranging from antiGovernment libertarians to Christian fundamentalists who favor Government involvement in moral issues would probably be split in half on the constitutionality of abortion laws and the death penalty The groups brochure says its purpose is to reorder priorities within the legal system to place a premium on individual liberty traditional values and the rule of law and to create a conservative network that extends to all levels of the legal community The Federalist Society has become a potent voice for conservative legal thinking in law schools and in the Government Mr Calabresi says more than half the 153 Reaganappointed Justice Department employees and all 12 assistant attorneys general are members or have spoken at Federalist Society events Obviously we do not run the Justice Department Mr Calabresi said But we definitely have had an influence in terms of bringing in conservatives who otherwise would not go into Government The president of the Washington chapter is Stephen J Markman an Assistant Attorney General in charge of legal policy who represents the Justice Department at White House meetings to select judges for the Federal bench The Federalist Society provides a good opportunity for us to get to know people who share the constitutional conservative perspective of the Attorney General and the President Mr Markman said To that extent it is helpful to the Administration in attempting to develop a conservative approach A current joke among members of the Society is that as soon as a law school professor is designated as an adviser to the Society the Reagan Administration nominates him for a Federal judgeship It happened with Mr Scalia at the University of Chicago who is now on the District of Columbia Circuit Court of Appeals Ralph Winter a former Yale professor now on the Second Circuit and Stephen F Williams a former professor at the University of Colorado now on the District of Columbia Circuit Other sympathetic legal scholars appointed to circuit courts include Robert H Bork District of Columbia Richard A Posner and Frank Easterbrook Seventh Circuit and John T Noonan Jr Ninth Circuit Scalia is one of their favorites said Anthony T Podesta president of the American Way a liberal constitutional watchdog organization Having a set of cheerleaders strategically placed in the Administration certainly helps with appointments In other parts of the Government the group is making an impact as well Michael J Horowitz former counsel to the Office of Management and the Budget now in private practice in Washington said he had made a point of hiring members of the organization for Government jobs while he was at the White House Twenty years from now we will see our Cabinet secretaries and Federal Justices coming from the Federalist Society he said A 400000 Budget The groups budget funded by annual membership dues of 25 for lawyers and 5 for students and by grants from conservative foundations doubled last year to 400000 with new 100000 grants from the Sarah Scaife Foundation in Pittsburgh and the Bradley Foundation from Milwaukee The group also received a 73000 grant from the National Endowment for the Humanities to sponsor symposiums in Chicago and Atlanta on the 200th anniversary of the Constitution Nan Aron executive director of the Washington Alliance for Justice an association of public interest legal groups criticized the Governments financial support for the conservative organization and said the Society seeks to change the role of the Federal courts to one that would uphold the right of the Government against the individual But Mr Calabresi said the Society upholds any individual rights that are protected by the Constitution We do not think the courts should override Constitutional objectives he said But they should not add or subtract to its original intent as some courts have done in the past
BRIEFING; Anti-Abortion Bill,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/24/us/briefing-anti-abortion-bill.html,The White House is helping frame a sweeping bill to be introduced by the Presidential aspirant Jack F Kemp and two other members of the House Backers expect Mr Reagan to put his prestige behind the bill The authors Mr Kemp who represents upstate New York Henry J Hyde of Illinois and Vin Weber of Minnesota all Republicans met recently with Donald T Regan the White House chief of staff and other top aides to work out the language The emerging bill is a direct assault on the Supreme Courts Roe v Wade decision upholding abortion as legal One of the bills three major points would be a finding by Congress that life begins at the moment of conception Although adoption of that language would not directly affect the Roe decision it would put the Congress on record as saying that an embryo is a person from the moment of conception The Supreme Court has in the past been reluctant to reject findings of Congress so the matter could have some weight when the abortion question again comes before the Court possibly after the retirement or death of one or more of the five Justices who were in the majority on the Roe decision A decision by the Court that a person exists from the moment of conception would probably mean not only that states could prohibit abortions but that abortions would be illegal on their face inasmuch as they would deprive a person of life without due process of law For the moment the proposed legislation would permanently prohibit spending any Federal funds for abortion and ban financing for any organization that provided abortions
AROUND THE NATION; 11 Nuns Deny Statement By Vatican on Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/25/us/around-the-nation-11-nuns-deny-statement-by-vatican-on-abortion.html,Eleven nuns who signed a 1984 advertisement saying a diversity of opinions regarding abortion exists among committed Catholics today denied a Vatican statement that they now adhere to the Roman Catholic Churchs teaching on abortion Their statement was prompted by a new threat to expel two Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey Sisters of Notre Dame who work in Charleston WVa for refusing to publicly adhere to the churchs opposition to all abortion The 11 said they objected to using settlements in their case to pressure and isolate Sisters Ferraro and Hussey On Monday the Vatican said it had accepted public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion from 25 priests religious brothers and nuns who signed the Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion that appeared in the advertisement in The New York Times Oct 7 1984 The 11 nuns said they categorically denied making declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion
BRIEFING; An Invitation From Kemp,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/25/us/briefing-an-invitation-from-kemp.html,Last year in an advertising campaign Planned Parenthood attacked Representative Jack F Kemp as a politician out to destroy our nations family planning program which it says is the only proven way to prevent abortion But the Republican from upstate New York overlooked this hostility the other day and sent Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood a chatty fourpage letter It opened Dear Faye and invited her to join a special group of my close friends and key advisers at a cost it developed on page 3 of a 1000 annual contribution Also offered was a chance to join for 5000 a still more select group that attends small informal dinners with Mr Kemp and other Washington luminaries Mrs Wattleton described by an aide as dumbfounded has not replied

THE TALK OF MOSCOW; CHERNOBYL FALLOUT: APOCALYPTIC TALE AND FEAR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/26/world/the-talk-of-moscow-chernobyl-fallout-apocalyptic-tale-and-fear.html,A prominent Russian writer recently produced a tattered old Bible and with a practiced hand turned to Revelations Listen he said this is incredible And the third angel sounded and there fell a great star from heaven burning as it were a lamp and it fell upon the third part of the rivers and upon the fountains of waters and the name of the star is called wormwood and the third part of the waters became wormwood and many men died of the waters because they were made bitter  In a dictionary he showed the Ukrainian word for wormwood a bitter wild herb used as a tonic in rural Russia chernobyl The writer an atheist was hardly alone in pointing out the apocalyptic reference to the star called chernobyl With the uncanny speed common to rumor in the Soviet Union the discovery had spread across the Soviet land contributing to the swelling body of lore that has shaped the public consciousness of the disaster at the Chernobyl atomic power plant in the Ukraine In the three months since an explosion ripped open the fourth reactor at the plant Chernobyl has become an indelible part of Soviet life whether as an inevitable topic in kitchen conversation as a daily subject in the national press as a source of rumor sensation and threat or as a direct influence on daily life The dangers of radiation at first played down in the press have finally become a topic of open discussion On July 17 the official youth league newspaper Komsomolskaya Pravda published a long and detailed article on the various radioactive elements and their characteristics including the threat of cancers At public gatherings like the congress of the Union of Writers it has become common to hear references to the grief of Chernobyl that has beset our land Poems and even a novel have been published on the horror of the atom gone out of control and the heroism of those who battled the inferno through the early hours of April 26 Most of the 28 who died are being buried in a special heroes plot in a cemetery at Mitino a village outside Moscow Countless vacation plans have been thrown askew by the fact that priority for rooms at resorts is given to those displaced by Chernobyl or by fears of swimming in potentially contaminated waters Produce at farmers markets is treated with suspicion and vendors with Ukrainian or Byelorussian accents are avoided Ukrainian newspapers have written about farmers who try to avoid the radiation checks mandatory at markets and have warned against eating currants or gooseberries in a broad area around Chernobyl Rumors persist despite denials in the press about the dangers of radioactive rain or the powers of vodka and especially cabernet wine to flush radiation from the body The main Ukrainian newspaper expressed surprise that some women have had abortions because of Chernobyl Among many Russians that passage from Revelations  also known as the Apocalypse  has touched a strong penchant for superstition in the national character giving Chernobyl the quality of an almost supernatural disaster The scope of the disaster has been driven home by the almost daily accounts in the press of huge projects under way to undo the consequences of Chernobyl A Politburo report published this week reported about two billion rubles in direct damage  about 27 billion But the indirect cost of the enormous struggle to seal the ruptured reactor to safeguard water supplies to build whole towns of new housing and to decontaminate more than 1000 square miles of farmland and villages is incalculable Wednesdays issue of the Communist Party newspaper Pravda reported work on a new town called Zeleny Mys for 10000 Chernobyl workers indirectly acknowledging for the first time that the settlement of Pripyat adjacent to the power plant has in effect been abandoned Other papers have reported work on other smaller new settlements In Kiev 7500 apartments have been turned over to evacuees as have 500 in Chernigov Some 112000 people were moved out of contaminated areas and many remain in temporary housing and in temporary jobs Some 310000 children from the northern Ukraine and southern Byelorussia have been sent to summer camps and the authorities have not yet indicated when they will start to return Newspapers have reported that brigades of workers are transported daily from Kiev 70 miles away while other Chernobyl workers have been settled on river cruisers moored on the Pripyat River The loss of electricity from Chernobyl has posed serious problems for the Ukraine The official press agency Tass has reported that factories have been ordered to take special measures to conserve power including staggered shifts and days off to compensate for electricity lost because of the disaster The authorities have pledged to have the first and second reactors back in operation by Oct 1 But the third sharing common generating facilities with the fourth has been shut down for an indefinite period Papers have reported roundtheclock work to entomb the ruptured fourth reactor in concrete and to decontaminate the station A first stage tunneling under the reactor and laying a concrete cushion has already been completed But the Soviet television said on Thursday that work on the actual concrete shell must await construction of a protective concrete barrier that would enable workers to approach closer to the highly radioactive reactor Special remotecontrol bulldozers and cranes have been produced to move earth and pour concrete in areas still considered too dangerous for people The papers have also described extensive efforts to preclude the spread of contaminated ground water or rainwater to rivers One project under way is to drill 73 wells of up to 120 feet in depth to intercept ground water before it reaches the power plant and to pump it into the Pripyat River Tass reported that a special detachment of weather aircraft had been assembled to sprinkle clouds over the 18mile danger zone with compounds that prevent rainfall Within a week of the first scattering of such meteorological bombs the considerable precipitation over the 30kilometer zone practically came to a complete stop Tass said An entire alternative water supply has been prepared for Kiev in case the Dnieper River became contaminated Tass reported The project included building a new pumping station to tap water from the Desna River through two fourmilelong conduits In addition Kiev officials reported the drilling of 58 new artesian wells around the city Efforts to decontaminate the ground have included plans to cover large stretches around the power station with concrete In some contaminated villages layers of soil have been removed to special dumps and replaced with truckedin dirt and the Government newspaper Izvestia reported that cow dung had to be buried because it showed a propensity to absorb high levels of radioactivity

BALLOT QUESTIONS MAY TEST DUKAKIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/us/ballot-questions-may-test-dukakis.html,Massachusetts voters will find questions on a wide range of issues in the voting booths in November including public financing of abortions mandatory use of seat belts limits on state taxing authority and hazardous waste cleanup efforts While Gov Michael S Dukakis is widely expected to coast to reelection people in political circles say the ballot questions will show whether his personal popularity carries over to his policies Republicans have indicated that they will make issues of the more controversial ballot questions in hopes of building up opposition to Mr Dukakis Eight questions will appear statewide on the Nov 4 ballot including two proposed amendments to the states Constitution three proposed laws a referendum on a current law and two nonbinding questions on public policy Additional questions will appear in different regions on such issues as the use of nuclear power Taking Sides on Abortion A question that already is drawing some national interest is a proposed constitutional amendment that would permit the State Legislature to restrict abortions as much as Federal law permits and regulate abortion financing The National Organization for Women and the League of Women Voters have pledged their resources to defeat that initiative while the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Boston is expected to play a major role for the measure The church also is backing a constitutional amendment that would allow the state to commit public funds to private schools Two other questions have been pushed as campaign issues by the Republican Party One opposed by Mr Dukakis would limit state tax increases to the level of growth in total wages earned by taxpayers The same question would eliminate by 1987 a 75 percent state surtax on income that was imposed by Mr Dukakis in 1975 in his first term The Legislature resolved this issue last year however when it passed its own repeal but the State Attorney General would not permit the question to be removed from the ballot Republicans also are identified with a ballot question that seeks to repeal a mandatory seat belt law passed in 1985 The law was drafted by the administration of the Democratic Governor as one of a series of measures Mr Dukakis has endorsed to reduce highway fatalities May Raise Voter Turnout Public opinion experts say the ballot questions could be the major drawing card for this years elections A lot remains to be seen in what kind of money goes into communication budgets for the campaigns and whether the questions will motivate voters to go to the polls said Edward J Reilly of KRC Research in Cambridge If there are low budgets and the major factor is the gubernatorial race we wont have a high voter turnout Thomas R Kiley a Boston pollster and political consultant said that even though early surveys indicate Mr Dukakiss reelection may be a foregone conclusion the ballot questions pose some potential problems for the Governor Hes not at risk but certainly some of his policies and ideas are at risk Mr Kiley said In a sense the voter has an opportunity to vote twice and perhaps register disapproval on a number of issues Michael Goldman another campaign consultant said this could work to the Governors advantage If you wanted to show you were unhappy with Dukakis in 1978 you had to vote against him Mr Goldman said Now you have an initiative petition to do it This allows voters to show approval or disapproval without voting against him Thats to Michaels advantage obviously The analysts generally agreed that if there were no ballot questions the election would have little potential for spark They attributed this to Mr Dukakiss popularity his organization and the Republicans disorganization The Governor has a campaign fund of more than 1 million and a high favorability rating even among Republicans In contrast the Republicans had no challenger for Mr Dukakis until last week when a former Democratic cabinet secretary George S Kariotis emerged as a candidate Mr Kariotis has since changed his party affiliation

1984 visited a hospital for the first time in June and told a psychiatrist that she had suddenly begun experiencing strange symptoms  bouts of fear combined with breathlessness and chest pain In the second week of July she returned to the hospital where the doctor treating her Santosh Kumar Tandon said cases like Mrs Bees were still turning up Psychiatric problems the doctor said were emerging as one of the major chronic ailments among victims widening the magnitude of the disaster one and a half years after the gas leak killed more than 2100 people Medical experts in this central Indian city 375 miles south of New Delhi say exposure to methyl isocyanate the gas that leaked has permanently injured about 86000 people about onethird of them severely A total of more than 200000 people have been treated at the citys hospitals most of them at the time of the gas leak in December 1984 Health officials are doing a doortodoor survey of the gasdevastated neighborhoods in Bhopal trying to identify psychiatric cases Dr Tandon said one medical study had surveyed 1400 families of which about 15 percent had psychiatric problems Patients Complaints Recur We are getting the occasional new

be many with problems like Mrs Bees who had not even visited hospitals He reported that the symptoms of those who were injured by the gas were different from the symptoms normally observed in psychiatric cases in Bhopal Ninety percent of the cases coming to us are patients of anxiety and depression but the depressive features are different the 30yearold doctor said Here the physical complaints are exaggerated such as fatigue restlessness breathlessness and headaches Initially he said patients went to doctors for what were regarded as physical ailments Only later were they referred to the mental health clinics Dr Tandon did not have a figure for the number of patients found to have psychiatric problems as identified in the survey which is continuing But the proportion of cases to population studied is lower than the 22 percent found in April in a hospitalbased survey reported by the Indian Council for Medical Research the countrys top medical research body The current study is larger and includes recent information while the councils report was based on limited studies conducted in early 1985 Stillbirths and Infant Deaths Another significant finding by doctors studying victims of Bhopal is related to the children born to gasinjured mothers Doctors reported 56 stillbirths of a total of 2566 births This they said represents a fourfold increase over the national average Infant deaths within a week of birth were placed at 91 or about two times the national average The finding confirms a report issued in April by the Indian Council for Medical Research The mortality rates are higher than those reported by the council last December for these categories Vulluri Ramalingaswami the councils director general said in a recent interview that the new data are based on information that became available only after the 2566 pregnancies ended He and others said the number of spontaneous abortions 355 was very high three times the national average Studies are continuing on the longterm effects of the gas on the surviving children Experts Disagreements The medical effort has been complicated officials say by continuing clashes between key medical figures departmental feuds and a lack of coordination between researchers at the main hospital and others in the field In any other country perhaps you would have had one big new center built to treat the patients for different ailments one specialist said He added that patients were visiting different government clinics and private nursing homes There is no followup from one place the doctor said adding that patients are overdosed because there is no single line of treatment for the victims The doctor who is doing research for the New Delhibased medical council also said patients did not always cooperate with researchers They do not want to spend the whole day getting tests done he said because by doing so they will lose a days earnings The majority of the gas patients are poor and malnourished This doctors say makes their recovery chances bleaker The most common chronic complaints among people exposed to the gas are breathing problems and coughs The councils survey of 85000 people including an unaffected control group of 20000 found about 12350 patients or 19 percent of the total surveyed population had chestrelated problems caused by damage to the lungs and the respiratory system This figure is consistent with previous reports that 10000 to 20000 people were experiencing such problems Patients Conditions Unchanged Dr N P Mishra who is studying the lung functions of 1085 patients at Hamidia Hospital described their condition as stable  showing no improvement and no deterioration Dr Mishra said his patients had shown dramatic improvement between the time of the leak and about March of last year But since then he said there has been little improvement Those who were heavily exposed are damaged for life he said Little can be done about them Anwar Mohammed who sells fruit for a living says he needs to return to the clinics for the medicine and a checkup every week For the past year I have felt no real improvement he said as he waited in the noisy corridor There is this cough It feels as if something is tearing at your throat I cant really take deep breaths or carry heavy loads But Swarj Puri the former police chief of Bhopal who was in the gas cloud on the night of the accident says he has noticed a visible improvement in his health I guess my army background also has helped said Mr Puri who has begun playing tennis after a long break But my health is not completely normal Blood and Liver Damage Apart from the usual complaints doctors here confirmed the Indian medical councils reports of continuing longterm damage to the kidneys the liver blood and the nervous system But they said that the eyesight of many gas victims has improved and that there have been no cases of blindness Scores of patients continue to report occasional irritation of the eyes blurred vision and conjunctivitis Health officials are reluctant to give detailed information on the medical dimensions of the accident apparently concerned about the possible effect such information could have on future litigation involving the Indian Government and Union Carbide
OPPOSITION TO REHNQUIST NOMINATION HARDENS AS 2 NEW WITNESSES EMERGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/us/opposition-to-rehnquist-nomination-hardens-as-2-new-witnesses-emerge.html,Liberal opposition to the nomination of Justice William H Rehnquist to be the 16th Chief Justice of the United States is hardening amid a flurry of renewed allegations to be aired at hearings beginning Tuesday But most opponents concede confirmation is highly probable unless damaging new information emerges Justice Rehnquist 61 years old would be the most consistent conservative to head the Court in more than 50 years most scholars agree Democrats on the Judiciary Committee plan to question President Reagans nominee closely about allegations that he misled the Senate before it confirmed him in 1971 as an Associate Justice The hearing will run through Wednesday and perhaps beyond Harassment of Blacks Questioned The allegations center on Justice Rehnquists denials in 1971 that he had participated in the early 1960s in Republican harassment of black and Hispanic voters in Phoenix and that he had urged as a law clerk in 1952 that the Court uphold racial segregation of schools Two new witnesses this week contradicted Justice Rehnquists denial that he had participated in aggressive challenges to the qualification of black and Hispanic voters at polling places in Phoenix Civil rights leaders and other prospective witnesses also plan to argue that Justice Rehnquists philosophy is so hostile to civil rights and civil liberties and so far to the right of the mainstream that he is unfit to head the Federal judiciary They will stress his remarkably consistent record of voting often in solitary dissent to uphold governmental power and reject contentions by individuals that their rights have been violated Over the past three decades he has demonstrated a marked insensitivity to the victims of discrimination said Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights Predicting substantial opposition in the civil rights community Mr Neas said the Senate must weigh whether this man is an extremist on civil rights and civil liberties issues But Terry Eastland the Justice Departments top spokesman said Justice Rehnquist falls squarely within the traditional mainstream of American thinking which says that a judge should interpret the law and apply it rather than invent it His opponents are the ones who are at the margins not him Qualifications Are Conceded Justice Rehnquists superior intellectual qualifications for the job are conceded even by his opponents Despite the allegations that he misled the Senate in 1971 senators and aides said his eventual confirmation seems assured unless damaging new evidence emerges Some moderatetoliberal Senators who strongly disagree with Justice Rehnquists conservative views were said to be torn between concern that he would roll back decades of constitutional law if he could and reluctance to oppose a nominee with such outstanding credentials The American Bar Associations Standing Committee on Federal Judiciary has privately notified the Justice Department that it voted unanimously to rate Justice Rehnquist well qualified the highest of three possible ratings an Administration official said Judge Antonin Scalia of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Mr Reagans nominee to become an Associate Justice won the same well qualified rating from the bar association His confirmation hearing is set to begin Aug 5 Mr Reagan announced the two nominations June 17 together with Chief Justice Warren E Burgers retirement to take effect when a successor was confirmed and sworn in Both nominees seem perfectly in step with Mr Reagans policies Justice Rehnquist has strongly opposed the Courts legalization of abortion affirmative action preferences for minority group members and busing to achieve school desegration Supports Prayer in School He has almost always voted against women aliens and illegitimate children who have contended they were victims of discrimination and against criminal defendants who have charged violations of their rights He has consistently voted against the press in libel cases and has supported school prayer and state aid to religious schools He has strongly supported Presidential power and in a departure from his usual deference to legislative enactments has sought to strike down acts of Congress that he says infringe on state sovereignty Justice Rehnquist has also been a strong supporter of the death penalty going back to 1953 when as a law clerk to Justice Robert H Jackson he wrote that Julius and Ethel Rosenberg convicted of passing atomic secrets to the Soviet Union were fitting candidiates for execution It is too bad that drawing and quartering has been abolished his memorandum Justice Jackson added Justice Rehnquist has voted with the majority more often than not as it has drifted jerkily to the right in recent years and has written more than his share of important majority opinions winning a reputation as perhaps the Courts most pungent stylist But critics say the record shows his views on racial and sexual discrimination are less sympathetic to minority group members and women than those of any other member of the Court in recent decades Justice Rehnquist denied before his confirmation in 1971 statements by several voters that he had participated in the challenges of black and Hispanic voters in Phoenix He has refused to comment further until Tuesdays hearing But two new witnesses including a former Federal prosecutor have recently challenged his account Justice Rehnquist said in a Nov 20 1971 letter to the Judiciary Committee that while he had participated in Republican efforts to check voter qualifications from 1958 through 1964 in none of these years did I personally engage in challenging the qualifications of any voters He said in the letter that he strongly disapproved of any scattergun use of literacy challenges and told one Republican in 1962 to stop such harassment and intimidation But the Rev Snelson W McGriff of Phoenix said in an telephone interview today that in 1964 or before he had seen a man whom he had identified from a photograph in 1971 as William Rehnquist challenging black voters by demanding that they read from a card Charles W Pine Arizonas Democratic chairman from 1972 to 1976 said today that he expected to testify Wednesday that he had seen William Rehnquist question at least two black men waiting in line outside a polling place in 1962 or 1964 He strode up to them and he said in a firm voice Pardon me are you a qualified voter  Mr Pine said When a man said yes Mr Pine recalled Mr Rehnquist asked  What proof do you have or words to that effect Mr Pine said this implied falsely that if you dont have credentials you cant vote and it caused two black men to leave the line Unlike Mr McGriff Mr Pine did not made his account public in 1971 Another new scheduled witness is James J Brosnahan a San Francisco lawyer who was an assistant United States attorney in Phoenix in 1962 He said in a telephone interview that Justice Rehnquists 1971 account does not comport with my recollection adding I have thought about Bill Rehnquist and the challenging of these black folks for a long time Mr Brosnahan said that when he went to a South Phoenix polling place that November to investigate complaints from minority group voters I saw Bill Rehnquist whom I knew My best recollection is that he was serving as a challenger Mr Brosnahan said I cannot recall exactly what he did But he added Some of the people he was working with on that day were aggressively challenging blacks and Hispanics by demanding that they read something Mr Brosnahan said it was legal then to challenge voters if there was reason to believe they were illiterate but what they were doing was challenging a great number of people with no basis for doing it in a clear effort to slow down the line and reduce the number of votes in these precincts Mr Brosnahan said Federal prosecutors had decided prosecution for voter harassment was not warranted He said that one problem was that it was sort of like a barroom brawl so there would be disputes about what happened Memorandum Is Questioned Justice Rehnquists 1971 account of his 1952 memorandum on school segregation has since been questioned as implausible by scholars including Dennis Hutchinson of the University of Chicago who is writing a biography of Justice Jackson and others who have studied Justice Jacksons papers and other historical materials The 1952 memorandum initialed whr said I realize that it is an unpopular and unhumanitarian position for which I have been excoriated by liberal colleagues but I think Plessy v Ferguson was right and should be reaffirmed Plessy v Ferguson was the 1896 decision establishing the doctrine that the Constitution allowed separate but equal segregated facilities The Court overruled it in 1954 when it struck down school segregation by a unanimous vote which Justice Jackson joined In a December 1971 letter to the Judiciary Committee Justice Rehnquist said the 1952 memorandum was prepared by me as a statement of Justice Jacksons tentative views and was not an accurate statement of my own views at the time He added that I fully support the 1954 desegregation ruling

2 NUNS AT EYE OF DISPUTE ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/27/us/2-nuns-at-eye-of-dispute-on-abortion.html,In a hot and busy old house here each day two Roman Catholic nuns Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey tell people who are poor and abused that they must stand up for their rights and fight when unjustly treated If we walked away from our own fight with the church over abortion asked Sister Barbara how could we go on telling others to be strong and keep fighting On the other side arguing with equal fervor is the Vatican which says the Roman Catholic Church must speak with one voice in opposition to abortion Vatican officials have raised the question of whether people with strongly divergent views on key theological issues have the right to call themselves Catholic nuns The confrontation between the Vatican and the two nuns from Charleston dates to the 1984 Presidential campaign when the sisters joined 22 other nuns in signing an advertisement arguing that there was a diversity of opinion among American Catholics on the question of abortion The situation heated up Monday when a high Vatican official Jerome Cardinal Hamer singled out the two women with a threat of disciplinary action All the others who signed the advertisement the Cardinal said had cleared themselves by making public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion They Resist Pressure Sister Barbara 42 years old and Sister Patricia 36 have resisted repeated Vatican pressure to sign such a declaration and in fact have gone beyond the position taken in the original advertisement which appeared in The New York Times on Oct 7 1984 Not only do they support the right of others to dissent they said they have dissented themselves taking the position that as Sister Barbara put it abortion can be a moral choice The sisters say that their activism for abortion as well as their challenge to the church grew out of the work that they have done since coming five years ago to Covenant House the center for the poor that they run just a mile from West Virginias golddomed Capitol Each day dozens of people many of them homeless alcoholic or sexually abused come to the center The sisters help them find the right services at shelters clinics food pantries and employment centers and provide stopgap relief The center has an emergency fund to help pay rent gas and electric bills  last year it gave out nearly 32000  and it has hot showers and machines for washing and drying clothing In a time that West Virginia is experiencing an 88 percent unemployment rate and suffering from the effects of the Southeastern drought the center has been particularly busy helping 60 to 100 people a day Both nuns earn 16000 a year for their work at Covenant House which is run by 27 churches and temples in the Charleston area Both send 500 a month to the provincial houses of their order the Sisters of Notre Dame de Namur Not Stereotypical The two women quickly dispell the old stereotype of Catholic nuns in habits who go about their business in a manner submissive to their superiors and stern with their charges Sister Patricia favors slacks and Sister Barbara lively patterned skirts There is no door to the office they share and a conversation with them is often interrupted by calls out the open bay window to passersby Hi Rodger Sister Patricia sang out hows the new apartment Coming along coming along said Rodger Wood With the help of the nuns Mr Wood a 48yearold who had been homeless was matched with a roommate and given an apartment to live in He still stops by Covenant House regularly to look for parttime work do his laundry or help out with chores Im Catholic said Mr Wood and I dont like abortion either But the church is more than abortion The Pope and the bishops and the cardinals dont know whats going on here If theyd spend a couple of days here I think it might open their eyes a little 11 Others Back Them The women said they drew strength from the support of many of the people they work with as well as from a statement issued on Thursday from 11 of the other nuns who signed the 1984 advertisement The nuns asserted that Cardinal Hamer had misrepresented their stands on abortion in an attempt to pressure and isolate the two Charleston nuns The exact nature of the statements by the 22 other nuns is not fully known because some of the cases were closed internally by the nuns religious orders Six nuns from the Sisters of Loretto in Denver have said that they signed a statement that human life is sacred and inviolable It was not meant one of the Denver sisters said to retract her stand in favor of the right of a woman to choose abortion The sisters said it would be very painful to be forcibly separated from their religous order But they said that they expected to continue to run Covenant House if that happened The sisters were asked why they stayed in a church with which they so forcefully diagreed The church for me is larger than the hierarchy said Sister Patricia The church is a community of faith believers that believes in justice And this is the church that is real and good and alive
STUDY VIEWS REAGAN LEGACY DIMLY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/29/us/study-views-reagan-legacy-dimly.html,A fouryear nonpartisan project evaluating the domestic record of the Reagan Administration has produced a final volume suggesting that part of its legacy may be a faltering economy growing divisions on religious issues and confusion in both political parties The book also says that while President Reagan brought about a dramatic change in the role of government in Americans lives the Reagan years have actually seen growing agreement on the principles that underlay Franklin D Roosevelts New Deal The assessment is contained in Perspectives on the Reagan Years to be published in September by the Urban Institute a private Washingtonbased research organization The book is part of the institutes Changing Domestic Priorities project set up in 1982 to make a rigorous and impartial assessment of the changes Mr Reagan sought in the Government The findings published in 25 volumes have been one of the chief sources for political scientists historians and journalists in judging what has and has not been accomplished William Gorham head of the institute said the intent of the new and final volume was to place the policy debate in the larger historical context of Americas evolving public purposes and to provide an interpretation of where the nation seems to be going The concern is less with the Reagan Administration per se than with the contribution of the Reagan years to the enduring realities of American public life he said The authors nine scholars involved in research on Reagan Administration initiatives were asked to stand as far back from very recent history as the short passage of time would permit and assess the probable significance of this history for the future John L Palmer codirector of the Changing Domestic Priorities project said in the final chapter synthesizing and adding to the views of the others that there was agreement that rather than turning back the advances in social programs of the past 50 years the Reagan Administration has thus far served primarily to consolidate the public philosophy that emerged in the New Deal and postNew Deal years insofar as Americans have sorted out the role of the government in the formation and maintenance of our public values We have accepted the idea that the government owes an assurance of economic stability to the middle class and somewhat more doubtfully we have validated the notion of a safety net for the most dependent of our people he wrote Behind all the sound and fury about values all that Americans have managed to agree on is just about what we agreed on in the Depression  that is arguments about principles must bow to economic expediency It was not just that Congress refused to go along with many of the Presidents proposed cuts in domestic programs according to Richard P Nathan professor of public and international affairs at Princeton University who headed a separate study of changes in Federal aid Mr Reagans appointees used administrative means to dismantle much of the Federal domestic apparatus he wrote But the state and local governments then moved in he said increased their spending and thus maintained many of the programs in housing health care welfare and other areas that the Reagan Administration opposed not simply for the purpose of transferring authority to the states but also on ideological grounds Ronald Reagan has been an effective leader in Washington in putting his stamp on the domestic policies of the US national Government Mr Nathan concluded But in a real sense his stamp appears to have been canceled  not fully but partially  by state and local policies and actions Leadership and Respect The authors gave Mr Reagan high marks on leadership and restoring public respect in the Presidency but faulted him as using his leadership ability to make people feel good rather than to acquaint them with the harsh realities they might face Isabel V Sawhill codirector of the research project said the effort to restore prosperity through tax cuts had been put into effect with no evidence that it would work She said inflation has not been eliminated but only suppressed while productivity growth had not increased In short the problems of inflation unemployment and a disappointing rate of productivity growth remain she wrote The flirtation with supplyside economics concern about the resulting deficits and an unusually fierce ideological debate have simply diverted peoples attention from these more fundamental problems The nation is no nearer to solutions Administration officials take issue with this view saying lasting improvements have been made and the authors agree there has been real value in the restoration of selfconfidence among Americans under the Reagan leadership Yet they keep returning to the condition the country may find itself in after Mr Reagan leaves office and to his place in history Neglect and Hypocrisy Reaganism urges Americans to dream dreams but these are necessarily dreams of private advantage not public accomplishment wrote Hugh Heclo professor of government at Harvard Any ideology of negative government is likely to fall prey in the history books to collective tasks left undone and an ideology that simultaneously reasserts public moralism is especially vunerable to charges of both neglect and hypocrisy Will President Reagan whatever might be said about his luck escape the judgment of having presided over a period when America marked time and stored up problems for the future Nathan Glazer professor of education and sociology at Harvard takes issue with the conclusions of some political analysts that the coalition of interests Mr Reagan put together will fall apart when he leaves the White House leading to a decline in the influence of the fundamentalist Christian right with its emphasis on such social issues as support for prayer in the schools and opposition to abortion and busing for school desegregation I believe the coalition will hold and the fundamentalist conservative element will continue to participate actively in it he wrote It brings to the Republican coalition a kind of strength it has not had for 60 years Through the social agenda it reaches into lowincome and low status occupation groups and in particular into the South Blurring Political Lines Mr Palmer in his summary said he found the divisions within the Republican coalition deeply disturbing He said that although the corporations and the Yuppies more often than not do support the President without any particular reference to religious convictions the evangelical moralists stand alone with the President in asserting Gods blessing over American free enterprise He said it was disturbing because in the past religion has provided the cohesion for the founding and holding together of American democracy But now the split between evangelicals and mainstream denominations is testament to the absolute incoherence of our public dialogue about values The only thing that most of us seem to be able to agree about right now is that every American has a right to enrich himself as best he can within the rules of the game  and that toward the end of enrichment there should be fewer rules Mr Palmer said Looking to the future of the political parties Mr Palmer said the liberal Democrats were dominant for so long that they still cling however discordantly to notions of civic virtue and collective good and refuse to admit the possibility that virtue and good might sometimes be incompatible with economic prosperity Conservative Republicans he said cling to the notion of economic liberty and do not want to admit the possibility that liberty alone leaves Americans with no basis whatsoever for public agreement on moral values We are back to the Founding Fathers he concluded but with a difference the glue  the religious conviction that gave the confidence  is gone Other authors of the book are Victor Halberstadt professor of public finance at the University of Leiden the Netherlands Robert H Haveman professor of economics at the University

WILENTZ REAPPOINTMENT CLEARED BY JERSEY PANEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/30/nyregion/wilentz-reappointment-cleared-by-jersey-panel.html,The State Senate Judiciary Committee today released the nomination of Robert N Wilentz to continue as Chief Justice of the State Supreme Court The action was taken after two days of hearings that were dominated by a debate over whether Mr Wilentz lived in New Jersey or New York The nomination now goes to the full 40member Senate which is to vote Thursday If Mr Wilentz is confirmed as expected the 59yearold Chief Justice would have tenure until the age of 70 Mr Wilentz who has an apartment in Perth Amboy and a home in Deal on the Jersey Shore also has an apartment in Manhattan where he has stayed virtually every night since October 1984 when his wife Jacqueline began undergoing chemotherapy for cancer in New York City Mr Wilentz said he hoped to be able to resume his former routine of staying in his Perth Amboy apartment five nights a week and visiting the Manhattan apartment only on weekends if his wifes condition continues to improve She has begun a new regimen using hormone pills instead of chemotherapy he said Children in New York Schools The couple sold their house in Perth Amboy and purchased the New York apartment in 1971 so they could be nearer to their three children who were attending schools in New York Mr Wilentz said that although he had residences in both states he was domiciled solely in New Jersey He said that he voted and paid his taxes from his 166 Water Street address in Perth Amboy and that he considered New Jersey his home The question of residency was the one issue that formed the basis for the decisions of the 11 committee members all of whom praised Mr Wilentzs integrity competence and candor during the hearing The vote to release the nomination was 9 to 2 with Senators John H Dorsey Republican of Boonton and Raymond J Zane Democrat of Woodbury casting negative votes because they said they believed Mr Wilentz was a New York resident Mr Dorsey has also been a leading critic of the court under Mr Wilentzs leadership because he said it has usurped the policymaking role that properly belongs to the Legislature The great activism of the court pits the judiciary against the Legislature and the Legislature against the judiciary he said Mr Wilentz was supported by the New Jersey Bar Association and opposed by the New Jersey Right to Life Committee for some of the courts decisions including one allowing the financing of abortions through Medicaid
Contradictions,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/07/31/opinion/contradictions.html,When the Supreme Court recently upheld the right of the states to regulate private sexual conduct it inflamed people who believe in privacy gratified people who dislike homosexuals  and gave new force to some striking contradictions in American attitudes These can be framed as questions Why is it that the people most outraged when government puts its hand in your pocket for taxes are often the people quickest to applaud when government sticks its nose into your bedroom Why is it that the people who believe most fiercely in capital punishment are often the same people who proclaiming the right to life most bitterly oppose abortion Why is it that the people most opposed to giving welfare assistance to distraught young mothers are often those who fight hardest against providing sex education and contraception to poor teenagers The answer in each case is that these may not be contradictions at all For what they demonstrate best is not inconsistency about life but consistency about punishment In this view crime absolutely must not pay The state should kill murderers no matter that oh dear it sometimes kills the wrong man Sin must not pay The careless teenage girl should bear the badge and burden of her shame no matter how little she really knows about sex and no matter how incapable she a child is of raising a baby To those of this Puritan persuasion government has a sober duty Far from getting off peoples backs it should impose a strict moral harness Others of us are left to believe that it is barbarous for the state prone to error to kill We are left to believe  to know  that thousands of babies are conceived out of pathetic ignorance or a misguided hunger to be taken seriously And when it comes to sexual conduct between consenting adults in their own homes  well if thats not privacy what is Government often must legislate and enforce morality but whenever it does it tilts inescapably toward conformity and vengeance Yet when the very definition of life liberty and happiness is in dispute it is governments duty to tilt instead toward diversity and compassion
NEW YORK IRISH GRASP NEW IMAGE AND POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/01/nyregion/new-york-irish-grasp-new-image-and-power.html,For some time now it has been the fashion to offer last hurrahs for New Yorks IrishAmerican community When they emigrated from the city to the suburbs in the 1950s when they moved out of the working class and the Democratic Party when they lost control of City Hall and the telephone company when the prizefighters and crooners and writers were no longer Irish it was said that the group was heading for bland assimilation But the hurrah may be more lasting than last It is true as the Irish joke goes that it is easier to be canonized now than to find a Celt on the Board of Estimate or in a citywide office But from the ashes of the power the Irish held in New York City when they made up a quarter of its population now only 9 percent claim that heritage from at least one parent  Irish politicians have emerged as a statewide force Even as Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan continues the traditional IrishDemocratic Party alliance the states Republican slate this year has been dubbed the other St Patricks Day parade After Senator Alfonse M DAmato the lineup consists of four IrishCatholic politicians from the citys suburbs and upstate with the names ORourke Kavanagh King and Regan As the classic image of the New York Irish fades  the Tammany pols and priests and judges the cops and chambermaids who have become part of American folklore  another one is taking its place There has been assimilation but the Irish identity continues to burn strong There is fresh interest  a sort of designer ethnicity  developing among generations whose success has wiped out the memory of the No Irish Need Apply signs in the windows of New York businesses And there is a fresh wave of thousands of immigrants from the old country  mostly illegal  who are escaping the 17 percent unemployment rate in Ireland and reviving the old Irish neighborhoods and bars and sporting events in the North Bronx and Queens The brighter shade of green in the states ethnic mosaic is apparent in several other areas the popularity of Irish weekends at Catskills hotels where corned beef and cabbage and Erin Go Bragh potato pancakes replace kreplach and latkes the renewed interest in Irish crafts music and history the increased subscription of New Yorks Irish newspaper The Echo the success of the citys sleek new magazine Irish America and the current popularity of Irish names for infants In Some Ways More Irish Than Ever Fifty years ago there were priests who wouldnt baptize a baby Brigid because it was identified with an illiterate kitchen maid said the Rev Andrew M Greeley the author and research associate at the National Opinion Research Center at the University of Chicago Now its a fashionable name Indeed the New York State Health Department reports that Sean Kevin Ryan Megan and Kelly all made its list of the most popular baby names this year for the first time The American Irish after three or four generations may have lost their Irish traits but in other respects they are more Irish than ever said Father Greeley Nobody is astonished that Jews can become very successful in America and still maintain a Jewish subculture he said I dont think it should come as any particular surprise that Irish and Italians manage to do the same thing There has been a decline in influence in some institutions and some areas but a rise in influence in others The states IrishAmerican legislators and lobby showed a surprising amount of clout recently when they argued passionately and successfully  despite the opposition of Warren M Anderson the Senate majority leader  for a bill setting standards for investing state money in companies doing business in Northern Ireland New York was the first state to pass such a bill aimed at preventing discrimination against Catholics who are in the minority in Northern Ireland We have a history of kicking each other in the shins as Irish Americans said Assemblyman John C Dearie the Bronx Democrat who wrote the bill But we need to think about Ireland on the 364 days a year when there isnt a parade and bagpipes The Legislature also passed an appropriation of 50000 to establish an IrishAmerican museum in the state It is telling too that Governor Cuomo has met twice in the last month with IrishAmerican groups  once addressing the national convention of the Ancient Order of Hibernians in Buffalo and again with IrishAmerican leaders in City Hall here John Cardinal OConnor the Roman Catholic Archbishop of New York by speaking out in opposition to abortion and on other issues has certainly bolstered the influence of the church in the affairs of the city New Roles in Society Bring a New Ethnicity If there are fewer policemen in New York who have Irish names there are more stockbrokers who do The police commissioner is no longer Robert J McGuire but the chairman of the New York Stock Exchange is John J Phelan Jr Twenty years ago if an Irishman had a daughter who was a stenographer he thought he was doing pretty good said Paul ODwyer a lawyer and former City Council President Now the young IrishAmericans want to get into the yuppie class Some of my own grandchildren even Dr Kevin M Cahill the president general of the Irish Historical Society said he thinks the stereotypes are slowly being set aside People always thought of the Irish as drinking beer or playing the pipes he said But now they are seeing people of Irish extraction in surprising areas from ballerinas at the American Ballet Theater to singers at the Metropolitan Opera Yet Father Greeley said his studies show continuity rather than change among the Irish They are still disproportionately Catholic he said They still choose careers in law and government service They are still more interested in history than psychology They still enjoy politics but it is now more often the politics of the foreign service than the politics of the precinct They still have big drinking problems and they still produce strong women Father Greeley sees much of this new ethnicity as a selfconscious imitation of ancestors In American society particularly in New York he said everybody has to be somebody Tommy Makem the Irish troubadour who has been performing in New York for 30 years notes that he has been getting more reaction at his East Side bar in the last three years than ever before A wonderful number of people speak to me after performances about Gaelic lessons and books to read by writers from Ireland and music he said But a few tribal purists like Sean Walsh a Bronx lawyer who is on the board of the Irish Art Center dismiss much of the interest as faddish Weve married Italian girls and moved to the suburbs he said scornfully This new ethnicity is horribly inauthentic only shades removed from green hats green bagels and green beer Not the stuff of nationhood Eoin McKiernan of the Irish Cultural Institute in St Paul also prods the group to be more serious about protecting its heritage saying they have fallen behind the Jews Poles and Italians in this regard Whats with the Irish Mr McKiernan writes in the July issue of IrishAmerica Where are their libraries education center art collections research facilities and foundations On what scale do Irish Americans promote or sponsor Irish cultural programming William V Shannon a professor of history at Boston University and a former United States Ambassador to Ireland agreed that much of the current renaissance is superficial People like to give their child a very Irish name and drink Baileys Irish Cream and buy Waterford crystal Mr Shannon said But they dont act on the American scene as Irish anymore voting for or against someone because theyre Irish And there is no greater involvement among the majority of American Irish in the problems in Northern Ireland The Revival Is Carried By a New Green Wave But the Irish pool in the city may benefit from a new green wave of immigrants The Central Statistics Office in Dublin issued a preliminary report saying that 30000 people left the country from April 1985 to April 1986 The year before 20000 left Authorities on Irish culture here estimate that between 10000 and 15000 of them have settled in New York The Irish are flocking to New York illegally said Mr Shannon If immigration officials made it possible there would be a new Ireland rising in New York in the coming decade But they cant rejuvenate the Irish in politics if they cant vote for themselves But the new immigrants better educated than their forbears have revived several Irish neighborhoods and bars as well as the Sunday football and hurling games in Gaelic Park in the Riverdale section of the Bronx Legal immigration from Ireland is limited to 500 people a year Some politicians including Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr in the House of Representatives have proposed raising the limit to 4500 But even if the crop of newcomers are legalized they are not likely to go into politics Its not necessary for the Irish to enter politics now because theyre not being kicked around any more Mr ODwyer said They can find expression in areas previously closed to them The Irish arrived in New York with no mercantile tradition and with little experience in owning property or administering important affairs Their character Mr Shannon said was carved from centuries of military defeats exploitation by the English during the 17th and 18th centuries and condescension by the ruling AngloIrish ascendancy families in the 19th century But as they have moved into areas such as advertising insurance public relations television and salesmanship where skills in writing and talking are important they are also developing their own business tradition Irish names pepper the list of heads of Fortune 500 companies and an analysis by Father Greeley at the National Opinion Research Center last year showed that IrishCatholic families were second only to Jewish families in average income and in educational attainments The days in which there was significant prejudice against the Irish in terms of country clubs banks and the like is pretty much over said George Sternlieb director of the Rutgers Center for Policy Research Theyre welcome to the executive suite if they can make it From the Mainstream A New Influence If the younger IrishAmericans no longer entertain feelings of inferiority to the WASP establishment as Mr ODwyer claims they also do not seem to be producing the artists that the race is famous for  the Eugene ONeills and Brendan Behans and George M Cohans who once inspired the New York theatrical and literary worlds Genius is turned out by a sense of hunger said Mr ODwyer Living off the fat of the land doesnt produce much creative writing and the like The Irish influence is more private now and their values are more mainstream Theres a certain forgetfulness of their own past and their own sufferings said Mr ODwyer Many IrishAmericans are less sensitive to the problems of todays minorities than they should be President Reagan for instance claims hes a shamrock boy but he makes cutbacks to the poor Many leaders in the Irish community in New York have a benign attitude toward the way their role in the ethnic mosaic is evolving We should feel happy that weve graced all the other races with our bloodlines said J Pat Burns the first vice president of the Patrolmans Benevolent Association in the city He said he counts several friends on the force who have Irish mothers but Italian surnames as Irish The Irish had their swing at running the place and now theyve moved on to bigger and better things said Bill Burke the senior vice president of the Bank of Ireland Robert F Wagner who counts himself as the last Irish mayor of New York City because his mother was Margaret McTague from Jersey City said he feels little nostalgia I think it hurts the city that they havent the brains of the Irish to meet some of these problems we have here today Mr Wagner who was Mayor from 1954 to 1965 said But for people coming from a small country over there in Europe to be such an influence throughout the world well I think weve done pretty darn well Like Mr Wagner many Irish say they look back fondly at the days when the political trinity of New York was so staunchly Irish Catholic and Democratic that when a Tammany Hall ward heeler told his boss that a politician named OBrien had turned Republican the boss snapped Thats a lie I saw him at mass last Sunday The roster of Brooklyn district leaders will never again be read  as Mayor Abraham D Beame did once in a speech at the Friendly Sons of St Patrick dinner  as an Irish lyric Bill Heffernan Fogarty Madden and Lacey Sharkey and Ryan Kelly and Casey Whitty Walsh Curan and Cunningham Sinnott Gleason and Brown and Bannigan Nolan Malone Powers and Quinn and Lantry Walsh and Heffernan Jim The Brooklyn leadership roster now reads Anthony Genovesi Minucci and Finney Garson Golden Gold and Gill Messina and Aquila Cohn and DeLeon Barbaro and Santo Lupka and Aquila and Ragusa Plotnick Arberman Feigenbaum and Hightower Vann and Rosenfeld Rabbi And to the Irish it has its own sort of melting pot poetry

TV VIEW; WHY SOME OLD SHOWS NEVER FADE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/03/arts/tv-view-why-some-old-shows-never-fade.html,Why do some television series linger on in syndication year after year resisting a final interment There is no single reason Some of the old series were huge hits when first shown in prime time others barely made it Some were wonderfully well produced others were downright tacky There is not much to connect Star Trek say with Gilligans Island or The Honeymooners with Lost in Space At some level however they have all become imbedded in the popular culture even if scarcely an adult can be found who will ever admit to watching anything as vacuous as Gilligans Island Old series that endure and become much loved have no common denominator save one They all wear remarkably well At the same time some of the great hits of yesteryear do not wear at all Laugh In was a national phenomenon from 1968 to 1973 no one would watch it today Its humor was topical and nothing on television dies more quickly than a topical joke Comedy is comedy but a joke is only a joke and The Smothers Brothers Comedy Hour considered politically daring and sophisticated in the late 1960s would not interest anyone now Indeed it is a rule in television that last seasons daring is this seasons yawn Who now would bother to tune in once again to find out if Bea Arthurs Maude would really undergo an abortion The other thing that does not wear well on television is violence It is true that old police shows linger but there is hardly one that can be called much loved Their appeal is fleeting Starsky and Hutch Kojak Baretta and a dozen other old police series are shown now for no other reason than logistics They help to fill air time Few have achieved real distinction and fans do not memorize passages of dialogue and exchange pieces of trivia about the series The only exception here may be The Untouchables which was first shown on ABC in 1959 and may stay in reruns forever The background 1930s Chicago is terrific it gives us information to collect Eliot Nesss office was in the Federal Building and the room number was 208 Otherwise violence is not enduring neither are the accouterments that accompany each new seasons violence Miami Vice may be artfully filmed but it is likely that we will still be watching Phil Silvers as Sergeant Bilko long after we have forgotten which detective on Miami Vice was Crockett and which was Tubbs A series that bases part of its appeal on the actors wardrobes is not made for the ages Fashions change Miami Vice is part of a disposable culture Which brings us back to the question Why do some series linger The answer seems to have something to do with amiability Gilligans Island first seen in 1964 may indeed be the dumbest series ever to be successful in prime time some critics have called it just that On the other hand it is nontaxing and one of televisions legitimate functions although not often recognized is to kill time as painlessly as possible Gilligans Island attracts no cult but it is possibly the best program in the world to watch if you are say at home and alone and miserable with the flu Consider other series that now seem to be part of the culture Virtually every one even if not intended as comedy possesses the amiability factor at least to some degree Episodes of Star Trek conclude as often as not with Kirk Spock and McCoy celebrating their friendship Indeed most shows that endure celebrate friendship one way or another partnerships are extolled Even Gilligan had the Skipper Think of Felix and Oscar in The Odd Couple Maxwell Smart and Agent 99 in Get Smart and Hawkeye and Trapper John or BJ his successor in MASH MASH has often been called televisions most imaginative call for peace Solemn nonsense has been written about this The real subject of MASH is camaraderie in wartime To be sure other factors make a series endure superior writing for one imaginative casting for another Get Smart with Don Adams and Barbara Feldon as Maxwell Smart and 99 had both Some of the catch phrases  Sorry about that chief or Would you believe     became part of the public vocabulary This is another difference between lasting comedy and ephemeral police shows Comedy lines pass into general currency television cops except for Sgt Joe Friday on Dragnet Just the facts maam seldom get quoted Ensemble acting also contributes to durability most of the good comedies have it Think of The Mary Tyler Moore Show Barney Miller and Taxi No programs about lone wolves generate mass appeal over the long haul which is a reason that westerns no matter how popular they may be when shown first in prime time do not seem to have real staying power We do not love heroes who act alone The Prisoner with Patrick McGoohan is just possibly the most provocative actionandadventure series ever filmed a bleak vision of technology and totalitarianism joined Mr McGoohan however plays one of the alltime great loners In its first run the series lasted but a single summer on CBS and most recently could be seen locally only on the select confine of public televisions WNYCChannel 31 What all this means is that we give our hearts although not necessarily our minds to the programs that best reflect and cater to the national psyche We are a gregarious people and we would rather be amused than instructed We also seem to place a high value on the traditional virtues Friendship and family are prized Violence catches our attention but only momentarily Then it must be replaced by a different presentation of violence or else our attention will flag The only programs that secure a place in the permanent repertory are the ones that confirm the contours of our identity For better or worse they comfort rather than afflict
SCALIA RETURNS SOFT ANSWERS TO SENATORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/06/us/scalia-returns-soft-answers-to-senators.html,Judge Antonin Scalia gave glimpses of his conservative views on such issues as constitutional interpretation today in lowkey testimony before the Senate Judiciary Committee which is considering his nomination to the Supreme Court But he declined to answer most of the questions in which the senators were most interested those bearing on his views on such specific issues as abortion rights Asked by Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts whether if confirmed you expect to overrule the Supreme Courts 1973 decision legalizing abortion in certain circumstances Judge Scalia said I dont think it would be proper for me to answer because he said he could later be accused of having a less than impartial view He added I assure you I have no agenda I am not going onto the Supreme Court with a list of things that I want to do My only agenda is to be a good judge There was little apparent opposition to Judge Scalia although some senators expressed disagreement with his views Senator Paul Simon Democrat of Illinois said after the hearing that he would not be surprised if the Scalia nomination were to be unanimously approved by the 18member committee Contrast to Rehnquist Hearing Todays calm although occasionally punctuated by partisan jibes among Democratic and Republican committee members contrasted with last weeks sometimes turbulent fourday hearing on Associate Justice William H Rehnquist Judge Scalia is President Reagans nominee to take Justice Rehnquists seat on the Supreme Court if the latter is confirmed as Chief Justice of the United States Judge Scalia has been on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since Mr Reagan appointed him in 1982 The 50yearold nominee displaying occasional flashes of his widely acclaimed sense of humor testified for six hours before the Senate Judiciary Committee as his wife Maureen and nine children sat behind him As a law professor in 1978 Mr Scalia suggested at a public debate that the Supreme Court had no business striking down antiabortion laws Today he said that while the committee was free to consider views he had expressed in the past he could not elaborate on them He declined to say whether he still agreed with an article he wrote in 1982 criticizing the 1974 amendments to the Freedom of Information Act saying that he had to avoid publicly prejudging issues that might come before him as a Justice He added I dont know of anything from my opinions or my writings that would display anything other than a high regard and desire to implement to the utmost the requirements of the First Amendment Less Aggressive Questioning Some Republicans on the committee used their opening statements today to denounce Democrats for what Senator Alan K Simpson of Wyoming described as the attempted evisceration of William Rehnquist at last weeks hearing But the questioning of Judge Scalia was far less aggressive Although his record places him like Justice Rehnquist well to the right of the Supreme Courts present ideological center liberal Democratic senators said today that they knew of no basis for raising the kinds of questions about his veracity or character that they said were raised by the Rehnquist nomination At one point after Judge Scalia jokingly noted that he was trying in todays testimony to fight against his usual inclination to challenge the views of his audience Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware said Well let yourself go because its been pretty boring so far In general Judge Scalia took the position that as a judge his function was to apply laws written by others not to work for his own views of what the right policy should be You write it and Ill enforce it he said at one point to Senator Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona Views on Miranda Decision Judge Scalia did express views on two issues that seemed at least superfically to contrast with those of Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d one of those who participated in his selection The first was raised by Senator Strom Thurmond the South Carolina Republican who is the committee chairman who asked Judge Scalias view of the Supreme Courts requirement in its 1966 decision in Miranda v Arizona that the police warn arrested suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present at any interrogation Judge Scalia responded As a policy matter I think  as far as I know everybody thinks  its a good idea to warn a suspect what his rights are as soon as practicable Mr Meese has repeatedly attacked the Miranda decision as an infamous decision that prevents the police from obtaining information from criminals When asked by Senator Biden whether he agreed with the view most often identified with Mr Meese that judges interpreting the Constitution should stick to the original intent of those who framed the provisions Judge Scalia seemed to suggest only partial agreement He said he thought the original intent was a very important guide but he said that for example he did not believe that lashing and other antiquated forms of punishment would be constitutional now just because they were widely used in 1789 when the Eighth Amendments prohibition of cruel and unusual punishment was adopted At the end of a discussion of his attitude toward affirmative action rograms mandating the elimination of discrimination in employment he said There should be no doubt about my commitment to a society without discrimination Asked whether he thought Court had reached a consensus that affirmative action was appropriate he said The one thing I can say for sure about the Supreme Court decisions is they havent answered a lot of questions The hearing is to continue Wednesday The American Bar Associations Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary disclosed today that it had unanimously found Judge Scalia well qualified the highest of three possible ratings for Supreme Court nominees
REAGAN PREDICTS IMPACT OF JUDICIAL APPOINTEES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/06/us/reagan-predicts-impact-of-judicial-appointees.html,President Reagan said today that by the end of his second term 45 percent of all Federal judges would be his appointees whose decisions on abortion pornography crime and other issues would have a longrange impact In a speech from the Oval Office that was transmitted by satellite to the 104th annual convention of the Knights of Columbus in Chicago Mr Reagan reaffirmed his opposition to abortion He also expressed concern that Congress would take its summer recess next week before the Senate could act on a 100 million aid package for the counterrevolutionary forces in Nicaragua We need that assistance now Mr Reagan said Further delay is risking the lives of the Nicaraguan patriots In the text of the Presidents remarks which was distributed before the speech Mr Reagan said For Congress to go home without providing the necessary support for the contras would be to risk the permanent loss of Nicaragua to the Soviet bloc Praise for 2 Cardinals Mr Reagans remarks to the worlds largest Catholic laymens organization with 14 million members included praise for John Cardinal OConnor of New York and Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston The two Cardinals have offered the resources of the Church to women who decide to bring an unwanted pregnancy to term Although Mr Reagan signed a liberal abortion law as Governor of California he has opposed abortion in recent years The President said he had been criticized for mixing religion and politics because he supported prolife legislation It is not our heritage as Americans to turn our backs on massive legalized abortion he said Today we proclaim what our heritage has always maintained that all life is sacred The President said that family values rested at the heart of many of his programs Mentions Court Nominations Citing his recent Supreme Court nominations of Justice William H Rehnquist as Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia as Associate Justice Mr Reagan said he was especially delighted about Mr Scalia because he is the first ItalianAmerican to be nominated to the Supreme Court in history Both nominations are under scrutiny in the Senate Judiciary Committee Mr Reagans comments on Nicaragua came amid concern in the White House that Senate opponents of the proposed aid package for the Nicaraguan rebels  70 million in military assistance and 30 million in humanitarian help  would be the thwarted by parliamentary tactics before the summer recess which starts Aug 14 The aid package was approved by the House on June 25
CONSERVATIVE LAW PROFESSOR FADES AS NOMINEE FOR BENCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/07/us/conservative-law-professor-fades-as-nominee-for-bench.html,The Justice Department has dropped plans to propose a highly conservative Texas law professor for a seat on a Federal appeals court in New Orleans Reagan Administration officials said today They said plans to appoint Prof Lino A Graglia of the University of Texas School of Law were abandoned when the department received a special report prepared by Griffin Bell who served as Attorney General under President Carter and is now in private practice In an unusual move Mr Bell was asked to review the nomination after the American Bar Association said it would oppose efforts to appoint Professor Graglia whose views on the Constitution and whose opposition to courtordered school busing had been criticized Although details of the Bell report were not disclosed one official said Mr Bell did not give us a reason to go forward with the nomination The report did not give the nomination enough solid footing the official said His Chance Is Slim at Best This official said there was a very slight chance the department might reconsider its decision But another official said bluntly that Professor Graglia will not get the nomination Among other things Mr Bell had been expected to review Professor Graglias statements in 1979 urging residents of Austin Tex to find ways of frustrating a courtordered busing plan to desegregate schools A decision to abandon the proposed nomination to the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit would no doubt anger many conservatives who have focused on the issue Many have urged the Administration not to give in to pressures from liberal groups like People for the American Way that last month nearly defeated the nomination of another conservative judicial nominee Daniel Manion Mr Manion an Indiana lawyer won confirmation to an Federal appeals seat in Chicago on a Senate vote of 50 to 49 Administration officials denied that the decision on Professor Graglia who has been widely praised as intelligent and a gifted teacher had been influenced by the Manion fight In an interview Professor Graglia said the Justice Department had not given him the results of Mr Bells investigation and knew nothing of the status of his proposed nomination He said he had heard a rumor that the Bell report was unfavorable Im a Combative Guy Professor Graglia said he believed that he had been penalized by the bar association and others for his willingness to speak out on controversial subjects Im a combative type of guy he said As a professor I really try to provoke to take opinions that need taking Professor Graglia 56 years old was educated at City College in New York and received his law degree from Columbia Univerity According to the Directory of American Scholars he has been a professor at the University of Texas since 1966 Last year the bar associations screening panel said that Mr Graglia was unqualified to join the appeals court which hears appeals from Texas Louisiana and Mississippi After this the Justice Department turned to Mr Bell for an independent appraisal officials said Mr Bell who has been a judge but is again practicing law in Atlanta did not return phone calls to his office today In his report Mr Bell had also been expected to review Mr Graglias views on the Constitution In an article in The National Review in 1984 Mr Graglia charged the Supreme Court with usurpation of unlimited power and raised questions about the Constitutions value It is doubtful that the net contribution of the Constitution to our national wellbeing has been positive he said and it is certain that the net contribution of judicial review has been negative In the article he criticized Court decisions that permitted abortion and broadened the rights of criminal defendants Even without judicial review most constitutional issues are just bad ideas he said Professor Graglia said that improper interpretation of the Constitution had at one time permitted slavery Actions in Austin in 1979 Perhaps more controversial were Professor Graglias actions in 1979 when Austin was facing a Federal court order to integrate its schools through busing He acknowledged that he urged parents to consider ways of balking the busing order including court appeals and letterwriting campaigns But he vigorously denied that he had asked people to break the law Professor Graglia also wrote a book on the topic Disaster by Decree The Supreme Court Decisions on Race and the Schools I dont recommend to anybody that they disobey laws he said I said that they should not accept that this is right that they should realize that the courts can be wrong The argument that I made is that there are some court policies that ought not to be permitted to go smoothly Mr Graglia said he had not talked to Mr Bell which he said was surprising He never called me the professor said I thought Id go down and have an interview I understand that he or more accurately one of his assistants talked to some people who know me he said I dont know what they were asked
Foes of Abortion And Death Penalty,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/07/opinion/l-foes-of-abortion-and-death-penalty-226886.html,To the Editor In your July 31 editorial Contradictions you too quickly include prolife activists whom you describe as often in favor of capital punishment This may be true of some prominent political figures but is probably not true of prolife activists or perhaps the general public There are no national survey data comparing opposition to abortion and support for capital punishment It would be interesting to have such data In the meantime fairness requires that you note that prolife organizations either take no position on capital punishment or oppose it The Roman Catholic bishops and their Respect Life offices oppose both legal abortion and capital punishment In the name of consistency they also oppose the use of any nuclear weapons and the arms race The most prominent prolife organization the National Right to Life Committee takes no position on capital punishment but a survey of its leadership has shown that far more than the general public it opposes capital punishment At National Right to Life conventions speakers have given addresses saying that in consistency righttolifers should oppose capital punishment and those who are against capital punishment should oppose terminating the lives of unborn humans An internal poll showed that the membership of ProLifers for Survival almost unanimously opposes the death penalty Sisterhood the publication of Feminists for Life has published many articles promoting alternatives to abortion and opposing the death penalty In other words the available empirical data do not accord well with the stereotype that those who oppose abortion are more likely than others to endorse the death penalty Perhaps your editorial will prompt reflection on the morality of the death penalty and abortion and what consistency requires of us JAMES R KELLY Bronx New York July 31 1986 The writer is a professor of sociology at Fordham University
Dam the Flood of Federal Dollars,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/09/opinion/dam-the-flood-of-federal-dollars.html,Congressmen know that their votes on abortion say or foreign trade are sure to anger somebody back home But they also recognize the calming effect of an extra helping from the Federal pork barrel like a deeper harbor or a new floodcontrol dam Federally financed public works bring good jobs and profits Thats why Congress has bitterly resisted efforts to limit water improvements to those that are economically justifiable And that resistance is all the more reason to celebrate some dramatic policy reforms contained in new water bills that have been passed by the House and Senate The need now is to persuade the HouseSenate conference considering the bills to embrace the tougher antiwaste measures favored by the Senate and the Reagan Administration Environmentalists and fiscal conservatives have occasionally succeeded in blocking exceptionally offensive water projects But the pork barrel system remained Billions were invested each year with little concern for the likely return The first real challenge came from President Carter President Reagan then derailed the system entirely blocking all new construction until Congress accepted fundamental reforms Now a decade of no is about to pay off Federal water projects have traditionally been funded from Federal revenues little or nothing in the way of contributions was asked from local beneficiaries Thats unfair More important it is wasteful encouraging individual Congressmen to push projects in their districts even if the projected returns are meager If Washington is picking up the tab why not order champagne The legislative proposals this year would require substantial sharing of costs The Senate version asks nonFederal interests to pay between 25 and 60 percent of costs depending on the project purpose Some of the money would come from local taxes more would come from fuel taxes on inland waterway traffic and from new port fees Strikingly the prospect of reform is having an effect even before enactment grandiose harbor improvement proposals for Baltimore Norfolk and Mobile have been scaled down by local officials in the expectation that shippers would have to share the tab Unfortunately the costsharing provisions in the House bill are not nearly as strong as the Senates The House version does not include the fuel tax increase for the inland waterways And it exempts a handful of projects from costsharing requirements notably those affecting the Mississippi constituents of Jamie Whitten House Appropriations Committee chairman Such special treatment doesnt make economic sense Nor in view of the sacrifices being demanded from most project beneficiaries does it make much political sense Its up to the conferees to see the light at the end of the barrel
"BUSINESS FORUM: BEYOND THE FAIRNESS DOCTRINE;
A New War on Corporate 'Propaganda'",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/10/business/business-forum-beyond-the-fairness-doctrine-a-new-war-on-corporate.html,SINCE 1980 when the Reagan Administration all but ceased enforcing the Fairness Doctrine advocacy advertising on television by corporations and private organizations has exploded By my conservative estimate these interests spent 18 billion in 1985 to communicate their ideas on various public policy issues That figure is rising by 10 to 15 percent a year However at the same time that it is becoming a major source of television revenue and a significant element in public debate a substantial portion of advocacy advertising is fast degenerating into thinly disguised propaganda bordering on disinformation And now instead of enhancing the Fairness Doctrine the Administration is urging Congress to abolish the measure While many advocacy ad campaigns enrich the publicpolicy debate a growing number do not To abandon public control over the airwaves now is to invite distortion of issues by those wealthy enough to afford the considerable cost Advocacy advertising emerged as a significant phenomenon in the early 1970s when American oil companies led by Mobil resorted to the use of paid commercials to defend themselves against charges of obscene profits and environmental pollution to correct what they saw as the publics misunderstanding of the facts and to counteract an alleged antibusiness bias in the news media Their ads tended to be large often fullpage editorials in newspapers and magazines Television was largely denied a share of this business by the networks fear of the Fairness Doctrine which requires that broadcasters  but not newspapers  provide equal time free of charge to opposing viewpoints The climate has changed a great deal since then opening up vast new opportunities for advocacy advertisers For one thing the Reagan FCC has all but ceased to pursue Fairness Doctrine cases For another public interest advocates lack the resources to monitor effectively the multiplicity of television outlets that have sprung up in recent years Without such monitoring of course there can be no demands for the opportunity to reply Both developments have encouraged independent stations and even network affiliates to accept advocacy ads since the chances are low that they will be forced to run an unpaid response Corporations have gained another significant outlet in cable television which freed of Fairness Doctrine restrictions has actively sought advocacy advertising Thus a sponsor can now reach a nationwide audience through a combination of independent networkaffiliated and cable TV stations without using networkownedandoperated stations Although the television networks themselves continue to restrict advocacy commercials even they are bending the rules For example controversial under the Fairness Doctrine is defined broadly as any major controversy in which there are considerable differences of opinion nuclear power safety smoking and health or abortion Recently however a network ran an advertisement in support of the Long Island Lighting Companys troubled Shoreham nuclear power plant The ad was sponsored by a group supported largely by the utility Formerly the words nuclear power would mark an ad as an advocacy commercial and scare stations off THE commercials themselves have changed as well Rather than relatively lengthy and dispassionate appeals based on at least a version of the facts many of the televised advocacy ads now tend to be symbolically charged emotional appeals crammed into 30 or even 15 seconds This type of ad pops up frequently in referendum voting Vote no on proposition two  keep Big Brother out of your life In this changed atmosphere both broadcasters and the advertising community have demanded a repeal of the Fairness Doctrine which they insist stifles the expression of ideas by requiring equal unpaid time for opposing viewpoints Lately though its critics have argued that the old rationale for the measure  the scarcity of available channels  is a moot point with the addition of new UHF stations and cable television All of these arguments fail on close scrutiny The airwaves are public property which should be used to promote the public interest The Fairness Doctrine has not imposed an onerous burden on broadcasters FCC records show that opponents have rarely won petitions for equal time when the licensee has demonstrated that alternative viewpoints were covered through regular news programming Their refusal to accept advocacy commercials demonstrates that they put their profits ahead of the public interest The increased availability of television outlets cannot be used as an excuse to abdicate ones responsibility If the financially powerful networks are reluctant to air advocacy commercials for fear of giving away free time why should one expect independent stations or cable television to be more responsive to public needs The greater diversity of television outlets will not automatically lead to greater diversity of opinion  you will still need a considerable amount of money to make your message known In an ideal world the Fairness Doctrine would not be necessary But we do not live in one of those Not only must we retain the Fairness Doctrine but we must go beyond it in ways that strengthen the marketplace of ideas and allow the airing of all significant viewpoints on major issues of public policy even where the sponsoring group lacks deep pockets Specifically broadcasters advertising agencies and public interest groups should develop voluntary regulations along the following lines   Broadcast media  both television and radio  should be prohibited from refusing any paid advocacy commercials provided they are consistent with other standards of the station In other words advocacy commercials should be treated like all other commercials   Advocacy commercials of less than 60 seconds should not be allowed Efforts should be made to encourage 2minute commercials This would avoid media clutter and force the sponsors to make substantive arguments in support of their messages   Sponsors of advocacy commercials should be clearly identified not hidden behind innocuous names   Time for the expression of alternative viewpoints must be provided where the group seeking such time is legitimate and represents an identifiable constituency even if the group is unable to pay for it The cost of air time can be offset by a surcharge on the commercial time sold to other sponsors of advocacy ads   Where it is feasible and where the needed funds are available through the surcharge mechanism the stations should invite legitimate groups and even advertising agencies to

selected on the basis of their political ideology not on merit Governor Cuomo warned yesterday that the practice potentially posed a grave danger that could ultimately undermine public confidence in the courts Speaking at Radio City Music Hall to more than 4000 members of the American Bar Association who gave his remarks a standing ovation the Governor addressed his criticism to both President Reagan and the Senate Mr Cuomo said judicial nominees were being screened for their political philosophies and he accused the White House of implicitly trying to shape future court rulings by publicly stating how it expected the nominees to decide in cases involving such matters as abortion and pornography Profoundly Important Labeling such practices a threat to the balance of power among the three branches of government he called instead for basing the selection of judges solely on such criteria as scholarship experience and integrity with no consideration of how they might rule on a specific issue This is a matter of profoundly important substance the Governor said in his 28minute address at the associations national convention Whether its Franklin Roosevelt or Ronald Reagan liberals or conservatives the President and the Senate should not be trying to fix the judicial deal It wasnt meant to be that way and its not good for the country in the long run It comes down to this it seems to me Mr Cuomo said Under our system cases should be decided in the courthouse They should not be decided in the Oval Office or the Senate chamber A National Debate The comments by the Governor who has been frequently mentioned as a possible Presidential candidate in 1988 thrust him into the middle of a national debate sparked by President Reagans nominations for Federal judgeships including two recent Supreme Court nominations The two are still pending before the Senate Mr Cuomo did not challenge the ability of the two nominees Associate Justice William H Rehnquist whom Mr Reagan has proposed as Chief Justice and Judge Antonin Scalia whom Mr Reagan has nominated as an Associate Justice The Governor said questions about whether Justice Rehnquist had told the truth about past events or whether he had ever approved bigotry were relevant But he added that surely a clear and compelling case would have to made against him to justify an assault on the integrity of a man who has served as an Associate Justice for 15 years The only judicial nominee Mr Cuomo specifically criticized was Daniel Manion who was recently confirmed by the Senate for a seat on the United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit in Chicago The Governor said that there was good reason to believe he was nominated because of his ideology In an interview the Governor said his comments were directed not at individual nominees but at the system as a whole which is politicized Sets Off Controversy Mr Cuomos address  which he had worked on for nearly a month and which his advisers had privately hoped would be a boon to his national political prospects  immediately set off a swell of controversy The White House counsel Peter Wallison who was at Radio City for the speech said he was surprised that he chose that forum nonpartisan nonpolitical  to suggest that he disagreed with how the President was conducting his office The Governors statement is fatally wrong Mr Wallison said The President does not ask nor does the Justice Department ask how a nominee will vote on particular cases or issues He said Mr Reagans only criterion was that a nominee believe in judicial restraint in interpreting the law not making the law Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d who also attended the bar associations national convention in New York was not present for the Cuomo speech When told of its contents he said I can only say that Ronald Reagan has prided himself on appointing the best possible judges to the state of California when he was governor and to the Federal bench as President The quality of the judges in both cases proves that he succeeded in that objective A Bad Rap In Washington Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican who was the leading defender of the Administration during the Rehnquist and Scalia confirmation hearings said I think its a bad rap to say President Reagan is trying to stack the judiciary The problem is he added we have too much political screaming by those who suffer from the proverbial case of sour grapes because their party is not in control of who gets appointed Mr Cuomo in the interview made clear that he was also criticizing some lines of questioning by senators during the confirmation hearings as being intended at uncovering the nominees political ideology Mr Cuomo specifically cited questions by Senator Dennis DeConcini an Arizona Democrat Mr DeConcini when told of the Governors statements said yesterday that Governor Cuomo proves he has the biggest mouth on the political scene right now Followers of His Ideology The President who is elected is going to appoint members to the bench that are followers of the ideology he believes in the Senator said That was one of the questions of the election Mondale lost the election Reagan won it Mr Cuomos speech delivered at 10 AM dominated much of the informal talk at the bar associations convention for the rest of the day And most of the response overheard at luncheon tables and in hallways was favorable William W Falsgraf the president of the association who took the microphone at Radio City after the Governors address seemed to endorse Mr Cuomos comments Referring to the standing ovation for Mr Cuomo he said The response of this audience put it more eloquently than I could Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr of the Supreme Court who was present for the speech said last night that I think it made a point that was very very significant It reminds me he continued of what Felix Frankfurter always said that the most important attribute of a good judge is his disinterestedness He has to shake off the politics Two other Supreme Court Justices who were present for the speech Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr  declined to comment Lincoln and Roosevelt In the address and the interview the Governor acknowledged that previous Presidents  he specifically cited Abraham Lincoln and Franklin D Roosevelt among others  had nominated judges that they hoped would carry out their ideological goals But he added that the present effort however is a particularly emphatic one Conceding that its legal conceding that it has been done before conceding that the nation has survived the experience he said I respectfully submit to you that this is not the only practical way to select judges and it certainly is not the best way Anticipating a question Mr Cuomo added Perhaps many will label this as naive Scholarship and Experience But he said that as Governor of New York he had practiced what he was preaching and had named six judges to the states highest court on the basis of their scholarship and experience without knowing where they stood on such issues as the death penalty Of what he sees as the politicization of the Federal judiciary Mr Cuomo said Its become a bad habit Its a habit that ought to be broken All you need is an event and you could change it in Washington the Governor said And that event is 1988 Some candiate can come forward and make it an issue saying Im going to depoliticize it Im going to appoint the best judges  And isnt that exactly what Mr Cuomo is doing Oh no said the Governor who has repeatedly maintained that he is not running for the White House Im trying to do this as nonpresumptuously as possible The bar association asked me to speak as Governor of New York and Im flattered All I can do is share with them my experiences in New York

"CUOMO COURT NOMINATIONS NOT IDEOLOGICAL, EXPERTS SAY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/13/nyregion/cuomo-court-nominations-not-ideological-experts-say.html,In his judicial nominations Governor Cuomo has for the most part met the standards that he has urged President Reagan to apply to Federal nominations legal scholars judges and lawyers say The experts both Democrats and Republicans said in interviews yesterday that the Governor had appointed six of the seven judges on the states highest court the Court of Appeals without any apparent effort to give the court a particular ideological bent or to influence rulings on such matters as abortion or the death penalty Three of his choices have been Republicans But the experts also stressed that it was difficult to make comparisons They pointed out that unlike the President Mr Cuomo was not free to select anyone he wanted for a judicial seat having to choose from a list of prescreened candidates forwarded to him by bipartisan nominating panels And the Governors nominations also unlike those of the President have to be approved by a Senate controlled by the opposition party Spoke of Grave Danger In a speech Monday before the American Bar Associations national convention in Manhattan Mr Cuomo a Democrat said that Federal judges were being chosen on the basis of political ideology not merit and he assailed the practice as potentially a grave danger Does Cuomo practice what he preaches asked James F Simon dean of the New York Law School I think he does I think you could say that he is not determined to put people on the court who he thinks will vote a particular way on a given issue The comments came on a day that debate continued to widen over the Cuomo speech in which he called on the President and the Senate to name judges based solely on such factors as scholarship experience and integrity with no regard for how they might decide a particular issue such as abortion or pornography Issue Seen as Straw Man Although the speech seemed wellreceived by the rankandfile members of the bar association who gave it a standing ovation the associations new president Eugene C Thomas said yesterday that he thought the Governor had raised a straw man Mr Thomas a Republican said he agreed with the Governors call for the merit selection of judges but he added that he also agreed with the Reagan Administrations assertion that it was already doing so In the world of politics Mr Thomas said referring to Mr Cuomo you are allowed to stand up the straw man and knock him down But others at the convention yesterday were less sanguine about the quality of the Administrations nominations I thought the speech was superb said Norman Redlich dean of the New York University Law School I think the Governor articulated a framework within which a chief executive should function At a news conference yesterday Mr Cuomo was pressed on why if he was concerned about the integrity of the judiciary he had not pressed more emphatically as the leader of the state party to curb the influence in this years elections of Stanley Friedman the Bronx Democratic leader who is under indictment in the citys corruption scandal Party leaders wield enormous power in determining candidates for State Supreme Court judgeships Amendment Sought Mr Cuomo said that he had asked Mr Friedman to quit his party post but that he had refused The Governor then renewed a longstanding call for a constitutional amendment changing the way State Supreme Court judges are chosen Mr Cuomo wants them to be appointed by the Governor a move rejected by the Legislature Currently the Governor nominates judges for only three of the states courts  the Court of Appeals the Appellate Division of State Supreme Court and the Court of Claims Judges of other courts are elected Mr Cuomo has made 84 nominations to the three courts and Sol Wachtler the states Chief Judge said yesterday that he knew of no instances in which the Cuomo administration had screened nominees for their political ideology or for how they might rule on specific issues There are absolutely none said Judge Wachtler a Republican and himself a Cuomo nominee Maurice Rosenberg the Howard R Medina Professor of Law at Columbia University Law School agreed that he had seen no ideological screening of state judges But he added I dont think the Governor has always selected the very best nominees available to him on the lists he is given
CATHOLIC SCHOOL EXPELS GIRL OVER ABORTION STAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/16/us/catholic-school-expels-girl-over-abortion-stand.html,An 11yearold girl has been told by her pastor that she cannot return to St Agnes Roman Catholic School in Toledo Ohio because she had publicly supported the right to abortion The pastor the Rev Richard Miller said that the only remedy was for the girl Sarabeth Eason to write a letter to her principal saying she personally does not support abortion If that was done he said I think we could move forward Sarabeth who was supposed to enter the sixth grade at St Agnes in the fall said she would not sign such a letter Her mother said she intends to enroll the child elsewhere Father Millers letter which was dated Sunday was released by Sarabeths family yesterday National activists both for and against abortion said yesterday that this was the first case they had heard of a child being barred from a Catholic school because of taking a position on abortion Advertisement and Interview Sarabeth signed a newspaper advertisement commemorating the 13th anniversary of the Supreme Court decision that made abortion legal She was also interviewed by a television reporter at a demonstration against a bill requiring that parents be notified before birth control counseling could be given to minors She is the daughter of Conception Eason assistant director of a Toledo abortion clinic that was firebombed in May In a letter to the mother Father Miller wrote Because Sarabeth is carried along with your enthusiasm made out of sympathy feelings of mercy and rightness as you understand it and has been so public namely TV appearances and the public press by ad we reach a serious hard spot Father Miller quoted a serious advocate of the prolife position President Ronald Reagan He cited the Presidents book Abortion and the Conscience of the Nation in which Mr Reagan writes that medical and scientific experts agree that the unborn child is alive First Amendment Rights In response yesterday Mrs Eason called the move antiAmerican The Catholic church she said has placed itself above the Constitution of the United States by giving out punishment for the simple exercise of our First Amerndment rights Sarabeth also interviewed yesterday reiterated her position I value what a womans choice should be and they are trying to take that choice away from the women the girl said Telephone calls to Father Miller at the church and his home were not returned yesterday the Feast of the Assumption A spokesman for Bishop James R Hoffman head of the Toledo Diocese said The Bishop stands solidly behind the premise that the church is prolife and that the spirit of prolife extends to all of its schools and institutions The spokesman James D Richards said The Bishop agrees that we must take a courageous position although sometimes painful to witness to the sacredness of human life This is one of those instances No National Policy Russell Shaw secretary for public affairs at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops in Washington said the bishops had no national policy on childrens adherence to Catholic doctrine Particular cases have to be left to the responsible local authorities Mr Shaw said Frances Kissling executive director of Catholics For a Free Choice called the action of the Toledo church a very bad civics lesson This young woman has taken a position on public policy no different than the position taken by Mario Cuomo and Geraldine Ferraro Ms Kissling said We all have a right to hold a position different than the bishops In the 1984 Presidential campaign Mrs Ferraro and Governor Cuomo both Catholics who said they were personally opposed to abortion but supported a womans right to choose repeatedly clashed with the nations bishops who said Catholics had to repudiate abortion rights laws
Wider Use of Medicaid For Abortion Is Backed,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/16/us/wider-use-of-medicaid-for-abortion-is-backed.html,The Senate Appropriations Committee voted today to exempt victims of rape and incest from a ban on the use of Federal Medicaid funds for abortions The 13to12 vote sets up a possible fight on the issue when the Senate considers the 114 billion appropriation bill to which the provision was attached The law prohibits the use of Federal Medicaid funds to finance abortions except to save the life of the mother Until 1981 victims of rape and incest were also allowed to obtain Medicaid payments for abortions But Congress eliminated the exemption The provision adopted today was attached to the appropriation bill to operate the departments of Labor Health and Human Services and Education It was sponsored by Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr Republican of Connecticut
CUOMO'S SEARCHING FOR A ROLE THAT FITS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/17/weekinreview/cuomo-s-searching-for-a-role-that-fits.html,IN trying to find his place in the national political arena Governor Cuomo at times seems unsure which role he wants to assume Should he be an outright contender for the Presidency Or would he rather be the conscience of the Democratic Party Should he directly attack President Reagan many of whose policies he abhors Or is that political suicide given Mr Reagans popularity When is it too soon to begin running for the White House When Ms it too late Variations of these questions have a way of plaguing perceived Presidential candidates before circumstance forces a flat declaration of candidacy or a sweeping denial of ambition So Mr Cuomos struggle is not unprecedented But as he wrestled with those questions last week it seemed of small comfort to the Governor that others had passed this way before And it seemed as well that by trying to keep all his options open he sometimes antagonized liberals and conservatives alike running the risk of occasionally being perceived as disingenuous In an address to 4000 members of the American Bar Association at their annual convention in Manhattan for example Mr Cuomo declared that Federal judges were being selected on the basis of political ideology not merit The speech  delivered at a national forum attended by three Supreme Court justices and the White House counsel  was interpreted by the audience as clear criticism of the Reagan Administration But minutes later at a sidewalk news conference during which he was surrounded by network television crews and reporters from around the country the Governor said he was not criticizing the President If reporters wanted to draw that conclusion he said that was their business Mr Cuomo said the speech had merely offered his thoughts on how judges ought to be selected While that may have appeared contradictory it was in fact part of an intentional political strategy President Reagan is popular and the Governor does not want to appear to be attacking him  his policies yes but not the President himself The speech and the Governors comments before and after sent out other contradictory messages as well  some by design according to his aides and some as a result of Mr Cuomos own uncertainty over what he wants his role to be in the Democratic Party Here was Cuomo the Presidential candidate taking on the White House and demonstrating that he had a reasoned approach to the naming of Supreme Court justices And here was Cuomo the noncandidate saying that he was not campaigning for national office and that had come to deliver a speech only about his experiences as Governor of New York Here was Cuomo the conscience of the Democratic Party including in his criticism Senate Democrats who had questioned Supreme Court nominees about their political ideologies and about how they might vote in specific cases involving such issues as abortion And here was Mr Cuomo seeming to avoid the role of party conscience  refraining in a 28minute address on President Reagans Supreme Court nominees from urging the Senate either to confirm or to reject William H Rehnquist as Chief Justice and Antonin Scalia as an Associate Justice The response to the speech was varied the 4000 members of the audience rose to their feet in applause The White House was angry Senate Democrats said virtually nothing Of all the reaction the Cuomo Administration found that silence most troublesome But while Senate Democrats refused to speak publicly or for attribution three of them were privately critical of the Governor for avoiding the most sensitive aspect of the issue he addressed The question of the week they said was whether Justice Rehnquist and Judge Scalia should be confirmed and the Governor did not address that Avoiding Mondales Mistake In fact in many of his statements on national policy Mr Cuomo discusses broad themes not specifics The Governor knows full well that it is the specifics that can get a candidate into trouble He says often for example that one of Walter F Mondales biggest mistakes in the 1984 Presidential campaign was identifying too soon the taxes he would raise So when Mr Cuomo talks of a need to increase Federal revenues and is pressed to say which taxes he would raise he gives answers like this Me Im not for raising any taxes The Governors aides argue that he is not being disingenuous And they maintain that he has been more than willing to take on controversial issues He opposes the death penalty they point out though public opinion in New York favors it And in a fight to retain on Federal tax returns the deductibility of state and local taxes he has repeatedly shown a willingness to confront the President Mr Cuomos strength his advisers contend is his ability to raise an issue above the political arena and discuss it intellectually They point to the Bar Association speech as an example of that What is important the advisers maintain is not whether the Governor supports or opposes the confirmation of Justice Rehnquist but that he explores the process They also acknowledge that Mr Cuomo works hard at fostering an image of intellectual introspection on the theory that it lends him a distinctive political image In that regard they considered the Bar Association speech a rousing success Its part of the mystique said a close Cuomo adviser Its that highbrow intellectual quality that has promoted him as a very real candidate in 88 It makes him intriguing It makes him different It gets him a lot of ink
ISSUE AND DEBATE; PROPRIETY OF WITHHOLDING FOOD FROM DYING PATIENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/18/us/issue-and-debate-propriety-of-withholding-food-from-dying-patients.html,Many seriously ill or comatose people can survive without a respirator But none could last long without the chemicals vitamins and artificial foods that can be pumped or dripped into the body of someone unable or unwilling to eat Is withholding such sustenance a form of murder to rid a family or society of a burdensome member Or is it a humane act to halt further suffering for the patient in a prolonged fight against the inevitable The issue part of a more general debate over the right to die has long troubled some medical professionals But it is only now emerging into a debate in the broader society through pronouncements by professional and religious associations and through scattered court fights The Supreme Court in its first encounter with the issue this summer struck down Reagan Administration regulations designed to require lifeprolonging medical treatment including feeding for severely handicapped newborns Last year the New Jersey Supreme Court which in 1976 had approved the removal of the respirator that kept alive a comatose woman Karen Ann Quinlan ruled that artificial feeding was no different from artificial breathing and could be removed when it offered the patient no benefit In March the American Medical Associations Judicial Council approved withholding all means of lifeprolonging medical treatment including food and water from patients in irreversible comas even if death does not appear imminent Some groups fear this trend could lead to widespread euthanasia They plan drives in numerous states for legislation that would mandate artificial feeding in virtually every case The Background The ability to feed patients in a coma or against their wishes is a relatively new phenomenon Humans approaching death lose their appetite much as salmon stop eating when they leave the ocean to return to their birthplace to spawn and die Even after rubber tubing was invented in the late 1800s and doctors later were able to insert tubes in veins artificial feeding was not perceived as something to be done At about the time of World War II medicine began to become more interventionist Because more could be done more was done with little thought for whether it should be done One result is that the life span of the average American is now nearing the mid70s People are living long enough to die from chronic diseases for which there is yet no cure cancer emphysema kidney disease diabetes Alzheimers disease and amyotrophic lateral sclerosis or Lou Gehrigs disease One study has estimated that of the 5500 Americans who die every day 87 percent are victims of a chronic disease But while there is no cure for kidney disease a victims blood can be cleansed by machine While there is no cure for Alzheimers or Lou Gehrigs disease their victims failed lungs can be inflated by machine indefinitely in a preprogrammed rhythm that includes mechanical sighs Malfunctioning stomachs or throats can be bypassed by permanent feeding tubes Such devices can buy time and eventual recovery for some patients For others they can prolong dying raising such questions as Should a victim of AIDS be cured of pneumonia today so he can die next year of another infection his ruined immune system cannot resist As a Presidential commission on medical and scientific ethics noted in 1983 Matters once the province of fate have now became a matter of human choice Most experts expect the problem to worsen as the American population ages Today one in nine Americans is over 65 years old by 2030 the figure is expected to be one in five With medical costs for this new technology still rising faster than overall inflation the financial implications are serious for government taxpayers the insurance industry and policy holders Some studies indicate that 25 percent of a typical persons lifelong medical expenses come in the last few months of life Because it ultimately affects everyone the debate over a new form and timing of death is potentially more divisive than even the sometimes violent debate over abortion But medicines advances have outpaced legal reflection on these sensitive issues leaving doctors nurses families and patients in a litigious society to make painful  and final  decisions without precise legal guidelines For Feeding The argument over artificial feeding without limits has almost as many viewpoints as there are patients In general proponents of virtually unconditional feeding such as Dr John Willke of the National Right to Life Committee see food and water as basic human rights and the removal or withholding of these substances as in effect causing the patient to die of starvation instead of the underlying disease or condition There are also strong concerns in many quarters that once it is found acceptable to withhold or withdraw food and water from one category of severely ill or dying patients this first step down the slippery slope will lead inevitably to an everwidening array of victims The Nazi policy of euthanasia is often cited as an example of what can happen Dr Mark Siegler director of the Center for Clinical Medical Ethics at the University of Chicago said I worry about causing such deaths by starvation and dehydration and developing a policy to cause it because that would deprive the most helpless persons in our society of the most basic kinds of human care Others note that the strong symbolism of food makes it psychologically different from a respirator or a dialysis machine They also worry whether a comatose patient suffers in such a death and whether nurses and doctors trained to relieve suffering might be harmed by their involvement either psychologically or through legal liability The coming together of two laudable movements  death with dignity and cost containment  concerns me Dr Siegler added You start with those in a permanent vegetative state Then you move to the mentally retarded the permanently senile seriously ill defective newborns and the physically handicapped Patients have a right to die But do they have a duty to die Against Feeding Proponents are not so much opposed to artificial feeding as they are in favor of giving the patient or his surrogate the choice to stop This argument tends to focus on an individuals right to privacy and to control his medical treatment rights upheld by higher courts although patients in test cases are often officially dead before a final decision emerges The right to be left alone is what its all about said Frank Reardon a Boston attorney representing the family of Paul Brophy in what is expected to become the next precedentsetting court case in the feeding controversy Mr Brophy a 49yearold fireman has been in a vegetative state for three years with no hope of recovery a hopeless twilight in which an estimated 10000 others dwell His family wants a permanent feeding tube removed saying his life actually ended three years ago The hospital has refused A probate court decision upholding the hospital is on appeal to the states highest court The Rev John J Paris an ethics professor at the College of the Holy Cross in Worcester Mass argues that it is acceptable to stop artificial feeding that merely prolongs a hopeless condition In fact he says it is morally wrong to prop up hopelessly ill patients with artificial food leaving them in a state of suspended animation halfway between life and death Dr Joanne Lynn who was assistant director of the Presidential commission on medical ethics acknowledges the emotional symbolism of food Many people find the slurries we pour down patients tubes as somehow similar to Grandmas soup as an expression of tenderness and caring she said Even small amounts of food spooned into the dying she said can be nutrition for the souls of the survivors if nutritionally negligible for the patient She places part of the blame on the modern setting for the sick the hospital jammed with technology and teams of specialists instead of the bedroom at home with the family and its longtime doctor Fifty years ago she says it wasnt considered starvation if a dying patient at home didnt eat for a few days before the end Doctors would never think of requiring a family to forcefeed a patient at home But it is routine in nursing homes Experts note that there are many categories of patients each case requiring careful consideration each treatment with a different ratio of benefit to burden for the patient For Mr Brophy they believe nothing can be done but to honor his wish not to live on machines and chemicals The most difficult cases come when the benefits to the patient of feeding are not identifiable but the benefits to the family of stopping food are considerable Many relatives must decide for instance whether they should spend a familys savings to maintain a hopelessly ill father or possibly live with a sense of guilt over stopping treatment for financial reasons The Outlook With no social agreement yet on when life begins there seems likely to be a continuing series of emotional court cases on when life can end establishing legal precedents from state to state Some state legislatures may address the issue on the political level through debates and laws More likely is the continued gradual development of a social consensus through the combined impact of private experiences news reports court rulings and debates in scholarly and popular journals Polls indicate that a substantial and growing majority of Americans support an individuals right to terminate treatment even if that means death Many however are concerned about the rapid pace of the debate which has already reached a last major barrier food and nutrition Dr Lynn is worried that it may quickly become easier and cheaper to let someone die than to get him or her into an expensive hospice or nursing home Staying alive must be an honest option she said Im an advocate of keeping open the possibility of removing food But being prochoice doesnt mean you think it should happen a lot
ADVANCES IN GENETIC FORECASTS INCREASE CONCERNS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/19/science/advances-in-genetic-forecasts-increase-concerns.html,GENETIC analysis to predict a persons health and life expectancy may soon give society unprecedented influence over peoples choices in areas ranging from life insurance to careers or even mates Ethical questions raised by this new ability have been a concern for some time but as geneticists learn how to discover more and more about human beings some are growing concerned over the possible uses to which society may put this new power Scientists believe that all diseases are influenced by genes Over the years they have learned how to detect in fetuses or infants some wellknown genetic disorders such as Downs syndrome sickle cell anemia and Tay Sachs disease and many other rare ailments Today however advances in genetics research are making it increasingly possible to identify various genetic traits that predispose people to more widespread health problems including diabetes and heart disease the most common of all life threatening diseases among Americans We are going to be predictive of life expectancy Dr Kenneth Paigen of University of California at Berkeley said at a genetics seminar held recently at the Jackson Laboratory in Bar Harbor Me We are going to be able to say that somebody has a much greater or much less than average chance of having a heart attack before age 50 or after age 50 He and other scientists said the ability to predict future disease and probability of death was likely to give government and other institutions increasing power to make decisions affecting individuals And they argued that institutions were likely to be more concerned with their own welfare than with that of the individual The ethics of using information about a persons health prospects has never been a major problem because the predictive power of genetics has been far too limited But that situation is changing dramatically almost month by month Geneticists predict that they will soon be able to estimate an individuals risk of developing serious common diseases that arise from a complex mixture of environment and heredity Predictive tests are being sought for heart disease diabetes and major forms of mental illness Some experts believe they will be a reality within five years But no guidelines exist for their use Dr Paigen noted for example that most medical schools already hesitated to admit older students because the costly training takes years to complete Medical schools want to produce physicians whose careers will last long enough to repay society for their training he said Airline pilots also need long and expensive training that makes economic sense only if the pilots have a long career And no one wants an airline pilot who is likely to have a heart attack What will happen Dr Paigen asked when medical schools and airlines can screen applicants genetically and determine which were likely to have heart attacks in their fifties The opposite would be true he suggested in factory jobs for which training is cheap but pensions are costly Would such jobs he asked be relegated to people likely to die young An important complication of this sort of problem is the evidence that some organizations would probably resort to screening even before the tests were proved reliable For example Dr Neil A Holzman of Johns Hopkins University which sponsored the genetics meeting with the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation said some insurance companies already require applicants for life insurance to submit to a blood test to detect antibodies against the AIDS virus even though presence of the antibodies does not prove the individual will develop the deadly disease Dr Holzman suggested companies that required the testing might also adopt testing for genetic diseases to protect their investments Indeed in the 1970s some companies began denying insurance to people who were healthy carriers of the sickle cell anemia trait While the disease itself can be disabling and sometimes fatal the carrier state involves no known special risks Today rapid advances are being made in the ability to diagnose in a fetus the existence of some diseases that occur because of a flaw in one or another single gene among the roughly 50000 to 100000 that constitute a humans entire genetic archive These advances have been made possible by the fast pace of research involving DNA the active substance of the human genes Dr Holzman said recent advances in the science would result in a tremendous expansion of genetic services such as prenatal diagnosis detection of carriers who may pass a genetic disease trait to their children and genetic screening of population groups Troublesome problems are already arising because the ability to detect harmful genetic traits has far outrun the ability of science to treat the resulting diseases Indeed for most single gene disorders there is neither effective treatment or cure In most cases he said the strategy available to families was limited to prevention of pregnancy abortion or artificial insemination Dr Holzman said that even five years ago about one third of artificial inseminations in this country were already being done for genetic reasons In a few genetic diseases such as PKU or phenylketonuria a metabolic defect detection of the defect shortly after birth usually allows doctors to treat it In PKU for example mental retardation can be prevented by limiting the baby to an extremely strict diet Tests for this disease have been available for more than 20 years but Dr Park S Gerald a Boston geneticist said their very success has recently created a new and unexpected problem Women PKU patients saved from mental retardation by the diet are now having children In some cases the chemical imbalance in the mothers blood characteristic of the disease may endanger the fetus Soon Dr Gerald said there would almost certainly be a good test for detecting carriers of the trait for cystic fibrosis a relatively common genetic disease that occurs only if a child inherits the trait from both parents Dr Holzman said preliminary studies he had done for Johns Hopkins and Congressional Office of Technology Assessment showed that at least 20 biotechnology companies are either developing or planning to develop tests for genetic disorders Often he said the companies interests went beyond the rare single gene defects to include such common serious disorders as diabetes and manic depressive illness Initially this research would probably be aimed at finding genetic markers to detect the likelihood of disease in children born to families in which the disease has already appeared But he said there was also commercial interest in going beyond such family linkage studies and search for tests to be used for screening populations These are not pipe dreams he said There are companies investing money in this He and others at the meeting said problems were likely to arise as genetic testing expanded beyond its present limited scope For example genetic markers that identify risk of a genetic disorder in the DNA of a fetus often play no role in the disease itself Such a marker is useful in detecting the disease because the marker segment of DNA is usually inherited with the disease gene in families in which the disease is common That same marker may not be a sign of disease in a family in which the ailment has not occurred Dr Gerald cited other potential problems Genetic diseases do not always strike with equal severity Some patients are much more severely affected than others This complicates genetic diagnosis and counseling Since there are thousands of different genetic diseases each caused by a defect in a different gene increasing ability to detect them poses formidible problems of education for public and physicians There are also agonizing conflicts between the right to privacy and public responsibility What does one do Dr Gerald asked reporters at a press conference when studies show that a couples newborn baby has a hereditary disease but the parents do not want to tell anyone even family members And how does one feel a year or so later when a brother of one of those parents comes in with another stricken infant in his arms and says They tell me there is something I ought to know This Dr Gerald said is an old problem but one that will need attention even more urgently in the future

VATICAN CURBS U.S. THEOLOGIAN OVER LIBERAL VIEWS ON SEX ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/19/us/vatican-curbs-us-theologian-over-liberal-views-on-sex-issues.html,The Vatican yesterday revoked the authorization of a major liberal theologian to teach theology at the Catholic University of America after a protracted battle over the priests views on sexual issues The priest the Rev Charles E Curran a popular lecturer at the university in Washington has generally argued that the churchs opposition to divorce birth control homosexual acts and abortion should not be absolute It was the first time the unusual censure action had been used against an American Roman Catholic theologian It was last used in 1979 against the Swiss theologian Hans Kung Letter Made Public In a letter to Father Curran made public late yesterday the Vatican said it had acted in light of your repeated refusal to accept what the church teaches The letter said that the Vatican was notifying Catholic University that you will no longer be considered suitable nor eligible to exercise the function of a Professor of Catholic Theology The letter from Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said that the action had been approved by Pope John Paul II The action against Father Curran is consistent with the Popes effort to reassert orthodox Catholic teaching and to discipline those who have been found to have strayed Last year for example the Vatican ordered a period of silence for a Brazilian theologian the Rev Leonardo Boff an exponent of liberation theology which involves social activism in behalf of the poor Father Currans case had deeply divided American Catholics Liberal Catholics said the Vaticans action against Father Curran violated any sense of intellectual freedom within the church something that should be maintained especially in a university they argued Informed by Chancellor In dissenting from the churchs ban on contraception and divorce Father Curran represented the views of what polls have shown to be a substantial body of American Catholic opinion Father Curran was informed of the decision at 4 PM yesterday by Archbishop James A Hickey of Washington Chancellor of Catholic University Afterward Father Curran could not be reached for comment at his home or at the University It was not clear if he would be allowed or would be willing to stay on at Catholic University and teach something other than theology The Vatican action the letter from Cardinal Ratzinger said was based exclusively on your published works and on your personal responses to discussion with Vatican officials In effect the letter said your own works have been your accusers and they alone In his works Father Curran has argued that the church should acknowledge nuances in regard to sexual issues In general he has endorsed the morality of contraception and said that divorce should sometimes be permitted He has said that abortion masturbation premarital sex and homosexual acts are not always immoral In discussing his case last March Father Curran said It should be evident that the positions taken by me are neither radical nor rebellious but are in the mainstream of contemporary Roman Catholic theology I find myself at home in the church and its as much my church as anyone elses More traditionalist Catholics asserted that because his teachings on birth control abortion and divorce so clearly contradicted official doctrine he should not be allowed to teach as a Catholic theologian Archbishop Backs Judgment This position was summarized by Archbishop Hickey yesterday in a statement released together with Cardinal Ratzingers letter I fully support this judgment of the Holy See Archbishop Hickey said The Holy Father and the bishops have the right and the duty to insure that what is taught in the name of the church be completely faithful to its full and authentic teaching The faithful have a right to sound teaching and the churchs officially commissioned teachers have a particular responsibility to honor that right This is not the first time that Father Curran has run into trouble with Catholic University as the result of his views In 1968 he was dismissed after making public statements that birth control was permissible But he was reinstated after students staged a fiveday strike The Vaticans action yesterday was taken during the summer lull at the campus which in full swing has 7000 students Father Curran 52 years old is a priest of the Rochester diocese who has taught at the university with the permission of his Bishop His ability to say mass or perform the other sacraments of the church were in no way affected by the Vatican action Father Currans case was complicated by the fact that Catholic University is a pontifical university that is under official papal charter and thus seen as having a special obligation to the Pope and the Vatican Cardinal Ratzingers statement referred specifically to Catholic Universitys pontifical status suggesting that it was at least possible that Father Curran could end up on the faculty of a Catholic university that did not have pontifical status The decision on Father Curran constituted one of the Vaticans most important statements on sexual ethics and one of its firmest condemnations of a Catholic theologian Writings Long Scrutinized The Vatican has been investigating Father Currans writings since 1979 Earlier this year the Vatican announced that he had to retract his views or face dismissal In turn Father Curran argued that he should be permitted to continue to teach theology because he dissented from church teachings that were noninfallible and had a right to differ with official church positions He said that the churchs position on matters of sexual ethics were less central to the churchs fundamental faith than such questions as the divinity of Jesus or the belief that He rose from the dead However in his letter Cardinal Ratzinger argued that the the church does not build its life upon its infallible magisterium alone but on the teaching of its authentic ordinary magisterium as well The magisterium refers to the churchs teaching authority and the word ordinary refers to doctrines that have not been declared infallible by the Pope a power the Pontiff rarely uses In the strongly worded letter yesterday Cardinal Ratzinger said that the Catholic faithful are to give the religious submission of intellect and will to the teaching which the Supreme Pontiff or the College of Bishops enunciate on faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium even if they do not intend to proclaim it with a definitive act This the Cardinal wrote to Father Curran you have continued to refuse to do
FRIENDS SAY THEOLOGIAN WILL FIGHT FOR REINSTATEMENT AS PROFESSOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/us/friends-say-theologian-will-fight-for-reinstatement-as-professor.html,The Rev Charles E Curran will fight to be reinstated as a professor of moral theology at Catholic University of America according to friends of the Roman Catholic theologian who was stripped of his right to teach theology by the Vatican because of his views on sexual issues Father Curran maintained silence about his plans today but associates said that he would challenge the dismissal through academic channels thereby creating a possible clash between Vatican procedures and those of an American university Meanwhile the president of Catholic University today announced his intention to remove the priest from a tenured position on the faculty of the department of theology where he has served for 20 years The president the Rev William J Byron acted after the Vatican concluding a sixyear investigation told the 52yearold Father Curran that he was considered no longer suitable nor eligible to teach theology in light of your repeated refusal to accept what the church teaches Special License Revoked The action which resulted in the revocation of Father Currans license to teach theology at that university was taken with the approval of Pope John Paul II and was consistent with his effort to reassert orthodoxy an effort that some say has had an effect around the world In Toledo Ohio last week for example an 11yearold girl was expelled from Catholic school after she took a public stand in favor of a womans right to abortion Father Curran has generally argued that the churchs opposition to divorce birth control homosexual acts and abortion should not be absolute His right to express these views has raised the question of the limits of academic freedom at a university chartered by the Vatican I know he will fight the dismissal said Daniel C Maguire professor of moral theology at Marquette University in Milwaukee who is a friend of Father Curran He is not simply going to walk away I know he has had offers to teach theology at other univerities Dr Maguire said But he would defer any of those until he sees this through That has always been his intention and I believe that is still his intention said another friend the Rev Richard P McBrien chairman of the theology department of the University of Notre Dame who spoke with Father Curran today University Grievance Procedure The Catholic University president said that he did not know what Father Currans next step would be adding that a dismissed professor has two weeks in which to indicate if he plans to follow the universitys grievance procedures to challenge a dismissal An official of the American Association of University Professors which represents 52000 faculty members around the nation said that Father Curran consulted with him several months ago about the standard legal process followed when a faculty member is removed The official Jordan E Kurland associate general secretary of the group said that such procedures can take up to three years and involve tens of thousands of dollars in legal costs Once a dismissal is announced by the president of a university the professor can ask for the formation of a faculty committee to review the decision The committee sits as a formal legal group before which both sides are represented by counsel and can interview and crossexamine witnesses Although such procedures have been invoked at Catholic universities around the nation there is no precedent for the Curran case because it represents the first time that the Vatican has reached into an American institution to remove a faculty member In effect the faculty committee will have to decide between a colleague and the dictates of the Vatican Relation to the Vatican The university which operates under a papal charter has a special relationship with and obligation to the Vatican Its Chancellor Archbishop James A Hickey of Washington serves as a representative of the Holy See in conferring upon the faculty a license called a licentia in Latin to teach in three departments canon law theology and philosophy In Mondays action the Archbishop revoked Father Currans license The Vatican does not have such direct control over other Catholic universities where no such licenses are required to teach although it is attempting to assert more control over them in a new set of procedures it is considering It was not clear from the Vatican statement Monday which was issued by Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith whether Father Curran would be permitted to teach at other Catholic institutions or in a department at Catholic University not under Vatican control The last time the Vatican invoked such a power was in 1979 when it silenced the Rev Hans Kung of Switzlerland Father Curran is not regarded by theologians as having the same stature as the Swiss theologian who in such works as The Church undertook a total reevaluation of Catholicism Father Currans works are largely compilations of essays on a variety of topics only one of which has been sexual issues He is a respected thinker in the field of medical ethics and outlined his views on social justice in his 1982 book American Catholic Social Ethics 20th Century Approaches
EXCERPTS FROM MEMO BY THEOLOGIAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/us/excerpts-from-memo-by-theologian.html,Following are excerpts from a memorandum distributed last spring by the Rev Charles Curran a moral theology professor at Catholic University of America describing his positions The Sept 17 letter from Cardinal Ratzinger to me lists the issues on which I dissent from noninfallible church teaching It is true that I dissent on these issues but my positions have always been carefully nuanced and they are often in basic agreement with the noninfallible hierarchical teaching These differences are much narrower than the Sept 17 letter implies and the issues are all matters of ordinary noninfallible teaching not matters of divine and Catholic faith The Sept 17 letter lists four areas of my dissent 1 contraception and sterilization 2 abortion and euthanasia 3 masturbation premarital sexual acts and homosexual acts 4 the indissolubility of marriage 1 On the question of contraception and sterilization I have maintained that these actions are not intrinsically evil but can be good or evil insofar as they are governed by the principles of responsible parenthood and stewardship However I have also pointed out the danger of abuse in connection with both contraception and sterilization 2 On the issues of abortion and euthanasia I have in a number of places developed in an indepth way my position on abortion My position can be succinctly stated Truly individual human life begins at the time of individuation which occurs between the 14th and 21st day after conception One can be justified in taking truly individual life only for the sake of the life of the mother or for a value commensurate with life itself I have never done an indepth study on euthanasia but I have occasionally referred to euthanasia as an illustration of other points I was making Here I tentatively proposed that when the dying process begins there seems to be no difference between the act of omission not using extraordinary means and the positive act of bringing about death I point out that in practice this position would differ only slightly from the official hierarchical teaching and I also recognize possible abuses which may be sufficient reason not to adopt this position in practice 3 On the question of sexuality I have discussed at various times the question of masturbation Again my position is quite nuanced Masturbatory acts are ordinarily not very important or significant and usually do not involve grave matter Such actions are generally symptomatic of other realities and should be treated as such However masturbation falls short of the full meaning of human sexuality and should not generally be seen as entirely good or praiseworthy I have also devoted a number of studies to homosexuality On the basis of a theology of compromise I propose that for an irreversible constitutional or genuine homosexual homosexual acts in the context of a loving relationship striving for permanency can in a certain sense be objectively morally acceptable In general sexuality should be seen in terms of the femalemale relationship so that homosexual relationships fall short of the full meaning of human sexuality I have not devoted separate studies to premarital sexuality but have considered it within the broader context of sexuality in general I insist that the full meaning of human sexuality involves a permanent commitment of love between a woman and a man Pastoral practice here requires prudence in dealing with people who do not accept such an understanding in practice Only in very rare and comparatively few situations would I justify premarital sexuality on the basis of a theology of compromise 4 I have dealt at length with the question of the indissolubility of marriage on a number of different occasions I have argued that the Catholic Church should change its teaching on indissolubility and allow divorce in certain circumstances The pastoral practice proposed by myself and others for dealing with divorced and remarried Catholics at the present time does not necessarily depend upon this more theoretical position
BAN ON PRIEST IS SAID TO DEFINE MORAL TEACHINGS AS INFALLIBLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/20/us/ban-on-priest-is-said-to-define-moral-teachings-as-infallible.html,In censuring an influential American theologian the Vatican significantly expanded the area of Roman Catholic teaching considered beyond debate senior Vatican officials said today The officials who spoke on the condition they not be named said the ban was an effort to eliminate dissent against the churchs positions on sexual morality The theologian the Rev Charles E Curran was forbidden Monday to teach Roman Catholic theology at Catholic University of America in Washington Father Currans friends say he will fight to remain a tenured professor at the university A spokesman for the Archdiocese of Washington said the decision to remove Father Curran was made according to statute by Archbishop James A Hickey of Washington chancellor of the university [ Page A10 ] The action established a modern precedent according to the Vatican officials by using the concept of the churchs infallibility to punish error in moral teachings as opposed to doctrinal issues The judgment can be viewed as opening the way for other efforts to define moral teachings as uncontestable they said Applies Infallibility Undoubtedly the decision included a new presentation of the churchs teaching authority on moral issues in a way that novelly applies the concept of infallibility to them said an official familiar with the Curran case It is reasonable to expect a further clarification of the extent to which moral teaching is considered binding because this is viewed as increasingly necessary The censure of Father Curran was the first time since the Second Vatican Council ended more than 20 years ago that the Vatican has formally and publicly disciplined a theologian for positions on strictly moral or ethical issues Under Pope John Paul II church liberals have increasingly criticized the Vatican for excessive use of its authority to declare certain church teachings uncontestable and Vatican officials said they expected the decision in Father Currans case to fuel the debate In censuring Father Curran the Vatican applied one of its strongest punishments the ban on teaching theology and employed one of the most powerful legal issues infallibility The decision was taken by the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith a kind of judgmental body on matters of Catholic belief An official of the congregation who asked not to be named said the forcefulness of the action was prompted in part by Father Currans popularity at the university and the substantial influence of his writings generally Right to Responsible Dissent Father Curran presented statistics showing that rejection of church teaching on artificial birth control was widespread in America in order to prove that he was in the mainstream the official said But instead of helping his case that only increased the determination to deal with him firmly In a prolonged examination of his views by the congregation Father Curran maintained that he was exercising his right to responsible dissent when he publicly contested official church teachings on divorce abortion premarital sex homosexuality and other issues because these teachings had not been solemnly defined as infallible According to Roman Catholic doctrine infallibility is a privilege awarded by God to the church and specifically to the Pope that instills certain statements with unquestionable truth When a moral or doctrinal teaching is considered to have been put forth with infallibility the Second Vatican Council said in 1964 all believers are required to maintain and be ruled by that position as a fundamental matter of faith The Pope has the power to state that he is speaking infallibly on specific solemn occasions This is a power almost never explicitly invoked Teachings espoused by all the churchs bishops together with the Pope are less formally considered infallible A major element in Father Currans defense of his writings was that none of the churchs formal teachings on personal morality had ever been officially declared infallible Such a declaration was not necessary said Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger head of the doctrinal congregation who issued the ruling against Father Curran with the specific approval of Pope John Paul II Cardinal Ratzinger is widely considered one of the Popes most important lieutenants because he functions as the Vaticans chief enforcer of orthodoxy Powerful Questions Raised An official familiar with Cardinal Ratzingers thinking said This decision shows a deep rejection of Currans distinction between fallible and infallible teaching Ratzinger is stating that infallibility is not a category that can be collapsed simply to solemn declarations and this raises powerful questions about how one identifies infallible teachings in the realm of moral doctrine In the key passage of the decision which was written as a letter from Cardinal Ratzinger to Father Curran Cardinal Ratzinger states In any case the faithful must accept not only the infallible magisterium They are to give the religious submission of intellect and will to the teaching which the Supreme Pontiff or the College of Bishops enunciate on faith or morals when they exercise the authentic magisterium even if they do not proclaim it with a definitive act This you have continued to refuse to do The decision bluntly rejected Father Currans view that he was free to dissent from a variety of teachings because they had never been declared infallible Vatican officials said that to the extent that the priests dissent had provoked severe punishment Cardinal Ratzinger had implicitly applied the cloak of infallibility to such positions as the prohibitions on homosexual acts and artificial birth control even though that status had never been solemnly proclaimed

Selling Sense About Sex,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/21/opinion/selling-sense-about-sex.html,Advertising popular songs and movies attest that sex at the age of say 15 has become as American as apple pie The lives of teenage mothers and their children attest that it is also as dumb as it always was That message is still much harder to get across than the joys of intimacy and thats why New York City has launched a creative cautionary campaign as direct and as alluring as an ad for designer jeans Photographs of young New Yorkers looking sexy are to adorn subways buses public schools and community agencies But these comeons will be accompanied by an admonition to Be smart about sex along with a telephone number for the citys counseling and health services The posters will also be shown on television and a rap artist L L Cool J has recorded Smart Sex Rap for radio There are many reasons that children bear children but their abortion rate is positive proof that thousands didnt intend to get pregnant More than 35000 young New Yorkers got pregnant in 1984 about half of them underwent abortions An antipregnancy media blitz cannot undo the cumulative effects of the sexual sell that suffuses society But it will be welcome if by reducing ignorance it reduces tragedy
CENSURED PRIEST DEFENDS DISSENT AS A THEOLOGIAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/21/us/censured-priest-defends-dissent-as-a-theologian.html,The Rev Charles E Curran said today that he would continue to teach Roman Catholic moral theology including his dissenting views on sexual issues despite the Vaticans ruling that he could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America The theologian has to play the role of the loyal opposition he said in his first public comment since the Vatican action Monday Such dissent he said is consistent with the development of Christianity and with accepted Catholic theological tradition Unresolved however was whether the 52yearold priest would be allowed to continue to remain on the faculty of the university which operates under a papal charter On Tuesday the president of the university the Rev William J Byron moved to oust him from the faculty where he has served for 20 years but Father Curran said today that he was prepared to fight the move through legal and academic channels I am a theological moderate he declared In my judgment and in the judgment of my peers I have been and am suitable and eligible to exercise the function of a professor of Catholic theology Major Issues in the Case Father Curran thus echoed the words that Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger the Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith used to censure him Cardinal Ratzinger acting with the approval of Pope John Paul II said that the priest was neither suitable nor eligible to continue teaching because of his views on sexual matters The two major issues in the Curran case are church authority and sexual morality both of which the Vatican feels strongly about Church observers both in the United States and Rome said that the Vatican in censuring the American priest was moving to quell dissent in both areas in one blow Father Curran said he was a target of the Vatican campaign because he was an American priest representing a country where there is widespread Catholic opposition to the churchs ban on abortion artificial contraception divorce and premarital sex There was a definite connection he said noting that others disciplined by the Vatican in recent years have been from Brazil and the Netherlands where Catholics have also challenged church teachings He mentioned the Rev Leonardo Boff of Brazil and the Rev Edward Schillebeeckx of the Netherlands Public opinion surveys have shown that the majority of American Catholics seem to share Father Currans views on many social matters Church Teaching Challenged According to a New York Times CBS News Poll conducted last November 68 percent of American Catholics favored the use of contraception and 73 percent favored remarriage for divorced people Only 15 percent of those polled agreed with the church that there should be an absolute ban on abortion although 63 percent said that they believed as does their church that abortion was murder Almost four out of five Catholics in the survey said that they felt it was possible to remain a good Catholic while disagreeing with the pope on birth control abortion and divorce On all these issues Father Curran has challenged church teaching He has endorsed the morality of contraception and said that divorce and abortion should sometimes be permitted Father Curran who appeared today at a crowded news conference in a lecture hall at Catholic University challenged the Vatican to alter its teaching on sexual matters I remain convinced that the hierarchical teaching office in the Roman Catholic Church must allow dissent on these issues and ultimately should change its teaching he said According to Catholic theological tradition the word and work of Jesus must always be made present and meaningful in the contemporary historical and cultural circumstances Fudged the Distinction Father Curran said that in preparing a case against him Cardinal Ratzinger had fudged the distinction between infallible and noninfallible  church positions Infallible teaching refers to issues that are fundamental to the faith such as the question of the divinity of Jesus or the virginity of Mary On sexual issues Father Curran said we are dealing with the noninfallible hierarchical teaching that are open to dissent In his letter Cardinal Ratzinger argued that the church does not build its life upon its infallible magisterium alone but on the teaching of its authentic ordinary magisterium as well The magisterium refers to the churchs teaching authority and the word ordinary refers to doctrines that have not been declared infallible by the pope a power he rarely uses In response Father Curran said My positions on the particular issues involved are always carefully nuanced and often in fundamental agreement with the existing hierarchical teaching Yes occasionally I have dissented from the official teaching on some aspects of specific issues but this is within a more general and prevailing context of assent Several times in the news conference which lasted more than an hour Father Curran asserted I remain a loyal and committed Roman Catholic When asked if the action taken against him would encourage Catholics of like mind to leave the church he said I would strongly urge people not to get out but to struggle and try to change the church
"HIRSCHFELD, A PERSISTENT CANDIDATE, PRESSES AHEAD",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/22/nyregion/hirschfeld-a-persistent-candidate-presses-ahead.html,Arthur Mesches was behind the counter at Arts Cleaners on Hertel Avenue in north Buffalo the other day when Abraham Hirschfeld marched in stuck out his freckled hand and introduced himself Its not every day you meet a millionaire said Mr Mesches as he greeted Mr Hirschfeld a New York City developer and frequent political contestant who has enlivened the primary season by challenging Representative Stan Lundine Governor Cuomos handpicked candidate for the Democratic nomination for lieutenant governor So shake my hand Mr Hirschfeld said with the rising inflections and thick vowels of his native Poland Maybe something will rub off Not a Hotbed of Support Even in upstate New York home of Mr Lundine and therefore not a hotbed of support for Mr Hirschfeld the 66yearold maverick candidate finds that people know a handful of things about him  That Mr Hirschfeld is rich very rich rich enough to spend more than 2 million of his own fortune  estimated at 500 million  on a race in which his chances are widely believed to be slim  That he is Jewish was born in Poland and is an American success story bootstraps style with his rise to wealth as a developer of parking garages  That he is sometimes outrageous and unapologetic about it  speaking his mind telling offcolor jokes in public and once literally spitting in the face of a political opponent  That he has been the target of an aggressive effort to remove him from the primary ballot an effort led by Governor Cuomos son and other top Cuomo advisers On Tuesday a state judge disqualified Mr Hirschfeld an appeal is to be heard next week Despite his bitter relationship with Mr Cuomo whose Presidential prospects could turn the lieutenant governor into the states chief executive Mr Hirschfeld argues that the two men would make a fine match A marriage made in heaven he said Hes a talker and Im a doer I will never match his ability to speak and he will never match my ability to implement  and implement in a way where it wont be an abomination like the 63d Street tunnel the Wollman Rink or the Buffalo Metro Mr Hirschfeld takes most insults in stride his skin as thick as his wallet If he is called an eccentric he says all interesting people are crazy If he is accused of using his wealth to buy an election he says a man who needs no contributors cannot be bought If he is teased about his command of the language he warns that if he is elected Albanys bigwigs will have to go back to college to study broken English Even when criticized as having a sketchy knowledge of state issues Mr Hirschfeld is unbowed So what he said if he doesnt know exactly how the save harmless feature works in the school aid formula My greatest asset he said is following the saying that he is smart who knows what he doesnt know Thats why I go to a doctor a lawyer and an architect But beneath the bravado Mr Hirschfeld seems eager to please and wounded by the Cuomo effort to disqualify him He might even have withdrawn from the race he said if only Mr Cuomo had agreed to a facetoface talk to explain his opposition I dont need for myself anything he said Im not a poltician that doesnt have where to go if I dont get the job He asks those around him why Mr Cuomo dislikes him so much why Mr Lundine does not talk to him I only shook hands with him once Mr Hirschfeld said of his opponent Always hes running away from me Mr Hirschfeld is strongest on the economic and development issues and fancies himself another Robert Moses the official who a halfcentury ago transformed the region with new parks highways and housing Mr Hirschfeld sounds knowledgable discussing abolition of the state sales tax or the creation of socalled enterprise zones but flounders on other subjects A case in point is a conversation that Assemblyman Jerrold Nadler a Manhattan Democrat and longtime Hirschfeld critic said he had with him about abortion last spring Mr Nadler said the conversation went like this Im in favor of it Mr Hirschfeld said But Im opposed to Medicaid funding I dont think taxpayers should subsidize Rockefellers daughter Abe do you know what Medicaid is Mr Nadler replied Its only for poor people Really Mr Hirschfeld said So in that case Im for Medicaid funding What Could You Say Mr Nadler recalled I just looked at him What could you say Mr Hirschfelds chief spokesman Lou Gordon blamed language problems for such confusion There are catchwords he said words like workfare and affirmative action that are well understood by those enmeshed in the language of government Abe does not pick them up quickly but when you explain the concept hell say Yeah Im for that  Some of Mr Hirschfelds positions include strict gun control subsidizing prescription drugs for the elderly and stiffening banking laws to discourage money laundering by drug dealers His campaign has had a heavy staff turnover Hes on the third or fourth team already said Jerry Skurnik a former aide to Mayor Koch who spent three months on the Hirschfeld staff Present and former campaign aides said Mr Hirschfeld often spurned advice made intemperate remarks and acted like a bully Several exemployees contend that he failed to pay them Mr Hirschfeld offers extravagant salaries according to the aides One political consultant who asked not to be identified said he was paid 10000 a month to attend weekly meetings and offer advice by telephone Mr Hirschfeld characterizes himself as gullible particularly in regard to established politicians whose campaigns he has supported and whose help he expected but was denied My problem is I trust everybody he said You never go wrong with business people With politicians you shake hands and you better count your fingers Hes like an open book Zipora Hirschfeld his wife said Everybody he thinks is his best friend Over the years Mr Hirschfeld has been spurned by dozens of powerful state Democrats In an incident in 1974 Mr Hirschfeld seeking a United States Senate seat insisted he had a commitment from Stanley Steingut then the Assembly minority leader who failed to support him at the convention The next day Mr Hirschfeld retaliated by spitting in Mr Steinguts face an action he said he does not regret Nor does he regret investing so much in this campaign If I win Ill be making 80000 a year he said If I lose Ill be making 80000 a week
NEW IMAGE IS SOUGHT BY VOTERS' LEAGUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/nyregion/new-image-is-sought-by-voters-league.html,CONCERNED about declining membership the Connecticut League of Women Voters wants to update its image People think were a bunch of old grayhaired ladies with tennis shoes who sit back and tell people who to vote for said Sheila Wartel vice president for communications for the Hamdenbased organization But we do more than that and were not just ladies Were a mixed bag of things and people just dont understand that The league is seeking to shed its old image via aggressive marketing techniques new brochures more emphasis on womens issues attracting men and younger women as members and persuading the media to cover more of its events The League of Women Voters which has local state and national chapters was established in 1920 as an outgrowth of the womens suffrage movement Its workers are volunteers except for executive directors and secretaries Statewide there are 44 groups with a total of 3500 members down from about 4500 over the last few years league officials said The Connecticut chapter inspired by a similar effort by the national organization is moving quickly to amend its ways said its president Jane Garbacz During her six years as a member nothing much has changed in the organization Ms Garbacz acknowledged I watched us do the same things over and over again she said No one was questioning us on why we were doing what we were doing We had to ask ourselves Are there any changes that need to be made  The answer was a unanimous yes So the league asked the Stamford office of Coopers and Lybrand the management consulting company to draw up an action plan The company supplied information on issues the league would face over the next five years and ways to approach them With advice in hand state league leaders are now working out strategies One way the league will try to appeal to younger people is by stressing that it does not just hold debates and tell people how to register said Nancy Beals the vice president for programs Although the league is nonpartisan it is issueoriented and adopts positions she said It has lobbied for affordable day care clean air control of acid rain tax reform marital property rights and takes a prochoice stand on abortion Recently the league worked with Common Cause and the Connecticut Bar Association in the removal of the party lever on voting machines permitting voters to now split their votes between candidates of different parties It also worked with State Senator Richard B Johnston Republican of Wethersfield and cochairman of the Assemblys Judiciary Committee on merit selection of judges Mr Johnston said the league was helpful in providing information on how his constituency felt about the issue Ms Beals said that the league would also like to make it possible for working women and men to participate Some may not be as satisfied with their careers as they thought they would be she said The league can provide fulfillment But Ms Wartel pointed out that unless the league becomes more aggressive  Weve sat back on our laurels too long  it will be difficult to appeal to a wide range of people She cited communication as its biggest weakness and her top priority A new membership flier is one way Ms Wartel hopes to grab the attention of those under 40 Along with a more contemporary looking cover the pamphlet will feature testimonies from younger members male and female on why they joined the league The league is also looking for ways to distribute the fliers to reach a larger population The league is also hoping to sell several thousand copies of a board game called Campaign for Election The game geared to 10yearolds and up was donated to the league by Ronald Morgan Gregory a Wallingford lawyer who created the game to educate people about the election process The game comes complete with press releases campaign money and slogans It sells for 5 and anyone can buy one by contacting league headquarters To increase accessiblity to the leagues headquarters Ms Wartel wants to set up a tollfree number But because of the cost she said she needs to find a corporatate sponsor In some ways our name works to our detriment as we try to recruit more men Ms Garbacz said She would also like to create public service announcements featuring the leagues male members The state and national chapters have a 5 percent male membership she said State Representative Raymond V Collins a Republican of West Haven and a league member said the league is a pretty dynamic group Its because of them that the household hazardous waste program started out He said he joined the league because it is a nonpartisan political group and I wanted access to their issue research He said he reviewsthe research the group does before he attends public hearings and it helps him know public sentiment State Representative Peter M Lerner Republican of Woodbridge said he joined because he was impressed with some of the members The league has a very strong presence in Hartford he said Ms Beals noted that nobody wants to join an organization that just is they want to be involved in one thats doing something
"IDEAS & TRENDS; CATHOLICISM, DEMOCRACY AND THE CASE OF FATHER CURRAN",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/24/weekinreview/ideas-trends-catholicism-democracy-and-the-case-of-father-curran.html,THE Vaticans censure last week of the Rev Charles E Curran was the latest and probably the most dramatic offensive in a long battle by Rome to keep the American Roman Catholic Church in line with Vatican teaching on sexual issues In a letter written with the approval of Pope John Paul II Father Curran was told that he was neither suitable nor eligible to continue teaching theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington The step was taken the letter said because Father Curran has repeatedly challenged the churchs absolute ban on artificial birth control homosexuality abortion premarital sex and divorce Father Curran has maintained that there are times when these acts can be morally justified  views that according to public opinion polls are shared by a majority of American Catholics The Vatican and its representatives have recently taken other steps too to rein in American dissidents in areas of sexual morality and church teaching on the role of women Among these other instances  Two nuns Barbara Ferraro and Patricia Hussey have been warned by the Vatican that they will be thrown out of their order unless they recant their view that there is diversity of Catholic thought on abortion The nuns work with the homeless in Charleston W Va  An 11yearold from Toledo Ohio Sarabeth Eason was told by her pastor this month that she could not return to her Catholic school because she would not renounce public statements in favor of a right to abortion The priest acted with the support of the Bishop of Toledo  The appointment of a Jesuit theologian the Rev Michael J Buckley of Berkeley Calif as a key adviser to the National Conference of Catholic Bishops is being reconsidered The review was ordered this summer after it was revealed that Father Buckley signed a letter nine years ago supporting the ordination of women  Last week another Jesuit the Rev Terrance A Sweeney resigned from the Jesuit order rather than obey his superiors command to destroy the results of a survey he made of United States bishops on the issues of celibacy and women in the priesthood What was also interesting about the Sweeney survey was the results In the replies from 145 of the 312 bishops nearly onequarter said priests should be allowed to marry and 8 percent that women should be ordained If there is budding dissent among the bishops it has already flowered among the laity In a New York TimesCBS News Poll of Catholics conducted last November 63 percent favored allowing priests to marry and 52 percent favored women in the priesthood The survey also showed wide support for the Second Vatican Council which 20 years ago introduced sweeping reforms in Catholic life On issues of sexual conduct 68 percent approved the use of contraceptives and 73 percent approved remarriage for divorced people And while 63 percent agreed with their church that abortion is murder only 15 percent opposed it in all circumstances Father Curran has asserted the right of theologians to dissent on sexual issues According to Catholic theological tradition he said last week the word and work of Jesus must always be made present and meaningful in the contemporary historical and cultural circumstances He pledged to fight his dismissal and continue to speak out as the churchs loyal opposition The model of the church that Father Curran envisions is a particularly American one with scholars bishops and the laity all participating in the forging of the Catholic faith In the view of the Vatican there appears to be little room for the democratic model or even the loyal opposition rather authority and direction flow from the top As Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger Prefect of the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith said in a letter to Father Curran last year It must be recognized that the authorities of the Church cannot allow the present situation to continue in which the inherent contradiction is prolonged that one who is to teach in the name of the Church in fact denies her teaching It was Cardinal Ratzinger who hoping to end that contradiction sent the letter to Father Curran last week With that move a Vatican spokesman said later in the week Rome was leaving the issue to the American bishops That however would be no small task First the Americans faced the possibility of a long divisive battle to remove Father Curran from his tenured position at Catholic University where he has taught for 20 years In addition because the Vatican move has largely been interpreted on Catholic campuses as a challenge to academic freedom American Catholic leaders may have to reassure their faculties and students that theological inquiry has possibilities as well as limits Finally while Rome said it was leaving the matter to the American bishops there was little doubt that the Vatican would be looking over their shoulders ready to intervene if necessary to keep the American church in line THE NEW YORK TIMESCBS NEWS POLL WHAT AMERICAN CATHOLICS THINK in

Nuns Stand Firm In Rejecting Abortion Doctrine,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/25/opinion/l-nuns-stand-firm-in-rejecting-abortion-doctrine-182986.html,To the Editor In a July 27 news article you paraphrased a statement by myself and 10 other Roman Catholic nuns who had been threatened with dismissal from our communities by the Vatican because we signed a fullpage advertisement titled Catholic Statement on Pluralism on Abortion New York Times Oct 7 1984 but whose cases with the Vatican have been closed You quoted us as saying that Jerome Cardinal Hamer had misrepresented our stands on abortion in an attempt to pressure and isolate Patricia Hussey and Barbara Ferraro two sisters of Notre Dame who have displayed unusual courage in refusing to agree to any statement that is not their own What we said was far stronger than that We categorically denied the Cardinals assertion that we had ever made public declarations of adherence to Catholic doctrine on abortion we objected to the misuse of settlements in our cases to pressure and isolate Barbara and Patricia and we declared that we continue to stand in solidarity with them in their ongoing struggle For my part I wish to make clear that I continue to stand behind every word of the Catholic Statement on Pluralism and Abortion just as I did on the day I signed it MAUREEN FIEDLER Mount Rainier Md July 27 1986 The writer is a member of the Sisters of Loretto
WASHINGTON TALK; BRIEFING; An Anniversary,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/26/us/washington-talk-briefing-an-anniversary.html,Today is the 66th anniversary of the ratification of the 19th Amendment granting women the right to vote and the National Organization for Women is using the occasion to organize support for the proposed Civil Rights Restoration Act The bill would make it unlawful for any institution receiving Federal money to discriminate against women or members of minority groups in any of the institutions programs whether or not the Federal money was used specifically for the program at issue NOW and other womens rights groups say the legislation is an antidote to a Supreme Court decision in 1984 that held that the antidiscrimination provisions of the Education Amendments of 1972 did not apply to programs like athletics if those programs did not themselves use Federal money even though the institution administering the programs received Federal money for other purposes When the Civil Rights Restoration Act was first offered just after the Supreme Court decision the House adopted it by a vote of 375 to 34 But it was never voted on in the Senate where Senator Orrin G Hatch of Utah introduced several hundred amendments effectively killing it The bill was reintroduced in the House in 1985 but has languished ever since largely because opponents have managed to attach an antiabortion amendment to it that makes the bill unacceptable to the very groups that backed it originally Today on the anniversary of womens suffrage NOW will put workers on the streets in 81 cities accepting donations and passing out stickers with the themes Give Girls a Chance and Go for the Gold emphasizing women in Olympic competition Organizers concede they have little chance to revive the bill before Congress adjourns in early October but they also note that Congressional approval of the 19th Amendment took seven decades of effort
"WITH EYE TO NOVEMBER, DYSON STRESSES WEALTH",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/26/nyregion/with-eye-to-november-dyson-stresses-wealth.html,John S Dyson has been an unusual candidate He started out the year as a potential DemocraticConservative candidate for State Comptroller He is now the Liberal Party candidate for the United States Senate and is seeking the Democratic nomination in the Sept 9 primary What happened in between is that the Conservatives patched up their differences with State Comptroller Edward V Regan a Republican and Governor Cuomo decided two things according to the Governors aides and Mr Dyson that Mr Dysons personal wealth would make him a stronger candidate than Mark Green against Senator Alfonse M DAmato and that the race for Comptroller would be ideal for a black or Hispanic candidate on the Cuomo ticket The Governor is officially neutral in the DysonGreen primary but the state party establishment endorsed Mr Dyson because the Governor feared his aides acknowledge that Senator DAmato with his 8 million campaign treasury would pull far more votes than the Governor this November hardly an auspicious start if Mr Cuomo decides to run for President in 1988 Issue of Resources The question of Mr Dysons ideology has been seized by Mr Green as a major issue in a primary in which the electorate is generally liberal Mr Dyson has made an asset of his money saying that only he has the resources to beat Mr DAmato His own polls show he is the frontrunner in the primary and even Mr Green agrees that Mr Dyson is ahead Mr Dyson who describes himself as a moderate Democrat in the mold of the states Democratic Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan sees himself in tune with the swing rightward in politics which he believes has occurred even in New York once the bastion of liberalism In a luncheon interview yesterday Mr Dyson talked of Mr Greens aweinspiring arrogance He referred to his opponent as this elitist who sets himself up as the arbiter of who is the real Democrat  how would he know Mr Green has charged that Mr Dyson is a closet Republican and an imitation of Al DAmato who has switched his ideological stripes for the benefit of the Democratic primary constituency He has also accused Mr Dyson of trying to buy the Democratic nomination Mr Dyson is trying to turn to his favor the widespread perception that Mr DAmato is nearly invincible He argues that he not Mr Green is better equipped to defeat Mr DAmato because he has his own wealth to counter the DAmato campaign treasury the Liberal Party endorsement to provide a united antiDAmato front in November and a record in public office He is a former chairman of the State Power Authority a former State Agriculture and State Commerce commissioner Record of Service There is only one Democrat with a record of service in this state only one who has the resources and ability to raise funds and to make a real contest with a very wellfunded opponent and only one with a Liberal Party that would make a united challenge in the fall Mr Dyson said at an often vituperative debate with Mr Green last week at The New York Times The 43yearold Mr Dyson said in an interview that he has set aside 6 million of his 30 million fortune for the Democratic primary and general election  about 4 million in the primary and 2 million in the general election He said that Governor Cuomo has promised to raise 1 million for the general election campaign and that he expected another 1 million from fundraising including money from the Democratic Senatorial campaign committee Mr Dysons wealth comes from his father a businessman who bought and sold small companies The candidate himself also heads a miniconglomerate of five companies that manufacture among other things lollipop sticks cable connectors trailer hitches and bicycle pumps He has a 100acre vineyard at his Dutchess County estate Im an aggie said Mr Dyson who graduated from Cornell with a degree in agricultural economics and from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs at Princeton A Candid Official Money got Mr Dyson into politics and government in the first place When he was first appointed Agriculture Commissioner by Governor Carey in 1975 he was best known as a party contributor He served continuously in state government until he resigned last year as the Power Authority chairman to return to private business and to prepare for the roughandtumble world of elective politics He had run once before  unsuccessfully for the House of Representatives in a Hudson Valley district in 1968 and was also a prospective candidate for governor or lieutenant governor in 1982 He dropped out as other Democratic candidates including Mr Cuomo preempted the field Although his money is a significant factor in his political career Mr Dyson is best known as a frank official candid to the point of acerbic He acknowledges that he does not suffer fools lightly He said however that he has mellowed not because Im wiser but because Im wearier But Mr Dyson cannot resist combat His campaign has been built on ignoring Mr Green and concentrating attacks on Senator DAmato But after initially brushing off Mr Green in interviews Mr Dyson has given way to counterattacks based largely on the contention that Mr Green has no record Two New Commercials Despite the verbal forays Mr Dyson is letting a 3 million television campaign do most of his talking The commercials have been on the air for weeks and will be markedly stepped up this week while Mr Green is still trying to raise funds for commercials in the final week of the campaign Mr Dyson cut two new commercials yesterday at a West Side studio The initial four commercials were largely biographical and credited prominently Mr Dyson for the I H New York campaign that was begun while he was Commerce Commissioner One of the new commercials also concentrates on the Dyson record the other criticizes Mr DAmatos position on abortion and handgun control Mr Green is not mentioned The importance of the Dyson money and presence on television is evidenced in a number of ways He is concentrating less on street campaigning than Mr Green and has given a prominent role to two experienced professionals Philip Friedman and Hank Morris the advertising and political consultants whose Fifth Avenue office is the command center for the campaign Mr Dyson freely admits that he would face an uphill battle in supplanting Mr DAmato If it were not so difficult he said he probably would have considerably more competition for the Democratic nomination It is a view widely shared On Sunday Mr Dyson visited the Brighton Beach Baths and was introduced to Max Sultan a local Democratic captain who was billed as an expert in turning out Democratic voters A few moments after the Dyson entourage had passed Mr Sultan sunning himself in a beach chair near a halfdozen friends said that whoever wins Senate primary will have a tough time defeating Mr DAmato His name is well known to every nationality Mr Sultan said
BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/books/books-of-the-times-758786.html,ROGERS VERSION By John Updike 329 pages Alfred A Knopf 1795 ONE October day in 1984 a young computer hacker named Dale Kohler walks into Roger Lamberts office at the divinity school and makes a noisy announcement God not only exists he insists but He wont be able to hide much longer already scientific evidence points to His existence and soon very soon someone will extract His presence from the statistics of highenergy physics  theyll succeed in pulling the divine rabbit from the cosmic hat Its a proposition that Roger a lapsed minister finds esthetically and ethically repulsive  aesthetically because it describes a God Who lets Himself be intellectually trapped and ethically because it eliminates faith from religion Such a scenario might at first sound like alien territory for Mr Updike and yet one quickly realizes it provides him with a comfortable armature on which to drape some of his favorite preoccupations Questions of faith and existential doubt after all hover along the margins of many of his novels  surfacing explicitly in The Poorhouse Fair A Month of Sundays and most recently in The Witches of Eastwick which featured the Devil in a starring role and his heroes over the years have all suffered from the tension and guilt of being human Torn between vestigial spiritual yearnings and the new imperatives of selffulfillment they hunger for salvation even as they submit to the importunate demands of the flesh In fact as Rogers Version unfolds adultery  as well as the attendant emotions of jealousy guilt and resentment  begins to push the question of religion off center stage giving Mr Updike plenty of room to examine with his usual skill the patternings and shadows of domestic life in the middle class Dale it seems has not only become Rogers intellectual sparring partner but hes also insinuated himself as a sexual rival every afternoon he meets Esther Rogers bored frustrated wife taking her to bed in a musty attic room Roger however doesnt seem particularly upset having become distracted himself by Verna an angry young woman with an illegitimate child who happens to be his niece and a friend of Dales Looking at the book from a distance there seems to be something a little schematic about the geometry between these two adulterous couples Roger and Esthers bourgeois life in a nice shady university neighborhood stands in neat opposition to the grungy makeshift student world inhabited by Dale and Verna and their jaded weariness similarly counterpoints the younger peoples fierceness and passion Esther is petite and brittle while Verna is blowzy and lush Roger has settled into the complacency of middleage while Dale at the beginning at least burns with the idealistic fervor of youth What these people all seem to share is a faint air of desperation they feel trapped in their lives suffocated by circumstance and circumscribed relationships and they seek temporary relief in the release of illicit sex For all their talk about God and theology they end up suffering from a sort of spiritual fatigue a loss of innocence that brings them face to face with the fact of their own mortality and it makes them feel nervous and unsafe Smoking a pipe for instance makes Roger think of lip cancer which makes him think of death and the smell of wine reminds him of fermentation which reminds him of rot which reminds him that life is a form of decay Indeed Roger seems almost irretrievably sunk in the dark chiaroscuro of middle age  he comes across as a sort of academic uppermiddleclass version of Harry Angstrom in Rabbit Is Rich  and as the narrator his sourness tends to permeate the overall book lending it a decidedly depressive air Both Roger and his creator seem to regard human beings as damaged fallen creatures capable of enjoying earthly freedom but doomed all the same to measure their lives by the distance theyve fallen from God The world is mired in sin Roger tells Verna by way of urging her to get an abortion and In this mire we try to determine the lesser of available evils Roger himself isnt a particularly likable fellow  hes described at one point as so gray and broody so evil  and his pompous debating with Dale reveals him to be one of those former believers whose faith has shriveled into manipulative intellectual posturing Dale on his part is somewhat less offensive but he comes across as a nerd a buffoonish seeker of truth who confuses numbers and scientific mumbo jumbo for the real thing As for the women theyre both pretty disagreeable creatures Esther emerges as a bitter housewife who vacillates between whiny complaining and tipsy flirtation and Verna as a loud foulmouthed tart who takes out her frustrations on her own child Such unpleasant characters might make for rather grim reading but by presenting them through the scrim of his narrator Mr Updike diffuses some of their vitriol Further his command of narrative techniques his orchestration of emotional and physical details his modulation of voice his quick lyric facility with language  is so assured in this novel so fluent that even the most hesistant reader is soon drawn irresistibly into Rogers fictional world Not only is Rogers domestic life mapped out in all its banality and capacity for surprise but the larger social matrix he inhabits  the hermetic university community where he lives and teaches as well as the sprawling city around it a city of poverty and random despair  is also delineated with anthropological care Portrayed in much the way that Saul Bellow portrayed Chicago in The Deans December this unnamed city may remind the reader specifically of Boston And yet at the same time it opens out into a window on contemporary America turning Rogers Version into another eloquent chapter in Mr Updikes continuing effort to memorialize the way we live today
"CALIFORNIA REPUBLICAN, A FAST STARTER, MEETS CRANSTON REALITIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/us/california-republican-a-fast-starter-meets-cranston-realities.html,This is one of those places that lay claim to seeing the future first In the bosom of the hightechnology area around San Jose it is the home of many entrepreneurs and technicians the heroes of Ronald Reagans vision of America in the 1980s As a class these voters have been at the center of political plans as both parties look to 1988 And so for many Republicans it seemed unrelieved good fortune when Representative Ed Zschau who lives here won the partys nomination to challenge Senator Alan Cranston this November Not only did this give the Republicans a good shot at a seat they regard as important to their efforts to hold the Senate Mr Zschaus victory also put on display an attractive picture of a new Republican Party Yet Senator Cranston a tireless campaigner and fundraiser with a welldeveloped instinct for the jugular appears to have put Mr Zschau on the defensive He Describes a Fastasy On paper said Mervin Field Californias premier polltaker Mr Zschau was a nearly perfect candidate If you were writing a scenario for a Republican candidate said Mr Field youd say lets take a moderate young guy Well have our tiger not campaign too much We dont care if hes unknown he wont be seen as a threat very early Just raise a lot of money and put him on television And hell win And Mr Field said thats exactly what happened Against a divided primary field heavily weighted to southern California and conservatives Mr Zschau the candidate from up north who supported the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and choice on abortion swept from nowhere to win the nomination with 37 percent of the vote Mr Zschaus handlers even turned his strangelooking name  its pronounced like the first syllable of shower  into an asset They have run millions of dollars in advertisements in which the name whooshes onto the screen materializing almost as from space while an announcer intones the syllable Shhhhoww It Is a Catch Word Youll find little kids on the street looking at each other and suddenly saying Shhhoww  said Sandy Conlan the campaign press secretary Yet something has gone wrong with the candidate who could appeal to the young and particularly the young professionals who like low taxes and social tolerance and who are in the phrase of the Republican polltaker Robert Teeter prochoice on everything The something might be described in two words Alan Cranston Within 24 hours of the primary Mr Cranston took off after Mr Zschau with biting political commercials He took advantage of the fact that few Californians although they had learned how to pronounce Mr Zschaus name knew much about him The Cranston campaign zeroed in on issues where Mr Zschau had modified his stand or in the view of the Cranston campaign contradicted earlier positions These included aid to the rebels in Nicaragua South Africa sanctions Israel the nuclear freeze and the MX missile He Turns the Weapon Around Seeking to turn Mr Zschaus heavy use of television commercials against him one Cranston ad depicted the Congressmans face on a piece of simulated film As images of the 46yearold legislator flicked by wildly an announcer gave the Cranston view of his shifts and concluded heavy with sarcasm Were electing a Senator not a commercial Mr Cranston held an Ed Zschau Memorial FlipFlop Pancake Breakfast and charged Mr Zschau doesnt have the courage of his nonconvictions Darry Sragow Mr Cranstons campaign manager could hardly be more gleeful at the results and he can hardly speak a sentence without the words flipflop Theft of the Advantage Seen Patrick H Caddell Mr Cranstons polltaker a leading strategist said that the Cranston strategy of lavishly produced commercials before the primary and the attack the day after had deprived Mr Zschau of the advantage he might have had as the surprise winner of the nomination Zschau got almost no bounce out of the primary said Mr Caddell His experience was to walk out the next day and to be suddenly knocked as it were on his fanny Mr Fields most recent findings in the California Poll largely confirmed the Cranston assessment The poll had Mr Cranston ahead 51 percent to 38 percent as against 47 to 38 in late May The poll of 747 registered voters conducted by telephone July 24 to Aug 7 was interpreted by the Cranston forces as a sign that Mr Zschaus rise had been halted and that the momentum was now with Mr Cranston The survey which had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points also found Mr Cranston drawing nearly a third of the vote from moderate Republicans a group that has been the base of Mr Zschaus political strength Mr Zschau denied the poll represented bad news He argued that it showed that he had lost none of his own support under the Cranston barrage and that the incumbent Democrat had still not been able to rise above 51 percent in California Polls taken since last November The Zschau campaign in the meantime called in Sig Rogich to produce a new batch of commercials Mr Zschau denied reports of further highlevel changes but Republican officials in Washington are known to be worried So does Mr Zschau turn out to be the future that doesnt work after all Even Democrats say it is too early to conclude this and the personable Mr Zschau his measured tone matching the tranquillity of the yard of his ranch house here insists that the future is alive and well in Los Altos He Dismisses the Ads He dismissed the flipflop ads saying they had been tested by his campaign and found to be completely ineffective He insisted that voters understood that things change laws change bills change facts change Im saving my best punches for when it counts he said Whatever the merits of this view what is clear is that Mr Zschau whose primary campaign focused on new Republicans and younger voters is a different kind of Republican His moderation comes mainly from averaging out his positions His liberalism on womens rights and abortion for example is matched by a fiercely conservative voting record on spending issues Mr Zschau said David Boaz vice president of the Libertarianoriented Cato Institute in Washington is offering a package that is close to the Libertarian Partys wish for as little state intervention as possible in any area of life Mr Zschau acknowledged that a few ardent conservatives taking an actuarial view of politics thought their best bet might lie in reelecting the 72yearold Mr Cranston Under this theory Mr Cranston would not be around forever and his seat could ultimately be taken by a truer believer in the Reagan faith But Mr Zschau with a doctorate in business administration and a belief that even politics can be subjected to rational management said that most conservatives had come around to his cause Im not trying to win over another wing of the Republican Party  Im trying to broaden the base he said This may also be one of the few races in the country where the Republicans will not heavily outspend the Democrats Although he is seen nationally as a strong liberal Mr Cranston has worked closely with the California business community including once upon a time Mr Zschau himself Mr Zschau acknowledged that raising money for the general election had been more difficult though he is expected to match Mr Cranstons 10 million to 11 million campaign
TAINTED CHEESES: HOW DANGEROUS?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/27/style/tainted-cheeses-how-dangerous.html,RECENT weeks have brought dismaying news to cheese lovers  warnings from the Federal Food and Drug Administration that a French cheese Morbier Rippoz is contaminated with the diseasecausing bacterium Listeria monocytogenes The cheese has been recalled by its importer Crystal Food Import of East Boston Mass the FDA said In a similar incident in February several brands of imported Brie were taken off the market after the FDA found Listeria monocytogenes contamination From January to August of 1985 more than 80 people in southern California died in an epidemic of listeriosis that was traced to a manufacturer of Mexicanstyle soft cheese What accounts for the sudden prominence of this hitherto obscure microbe and how concerned should people be Listeria is remarkably widespread in the natural world yet its transmission to humans is imperfectly understood Clearly it is well adapted to the contamination of milk and cheese Indeed some scientists have suggested that it may be related to the bacteria that are intentionally used to convert milk into cheese Listeria monocytogenes was discovered in the early 1920s when it caused an outbreak of disease in laboratory animals at Cambridge University Its name derives from the English physician Joseph Lister who pioneered antiseptic surgical methods and from a symptom of infection an increase in the diseasefighting white blood cells called monocytes Listeria is now known to cause disease in many species of mammals and birds and has also been found in trout crustaceans ticks even in soil dust streams and decaying vegetation The first human cases of listeriosis were described in the early 1930s for two decades it was thought to be a rare condition contracted by contact with infected farm animals Since 1950 however more than 10000 cases have been confirmed worldwide and it has become evident that contact with animals is not required Studies suggest that 1 to 5 percent of the human population carry the bacterium in their intestinal tract Because most carriers show no signs of serious illness some scientists believe Listeria may be a normal inhabitant of the human intestine causing disease only in susceptible people In otherwise healthy people exposure to it usually causes a temporary throat or intestinal tract infection with only mild flulike symptoms However in people whose immune systems are weak because of illness medical treatments or pregnancy fullfledged listeriosis can develop The bacterium invades different tissues and organs and may cause meningitis and encephalitis A mild infection in a pregnant woman may result in abortion stillbirth or lifethreatening illness in the newborn Listeriosis can be treated successfully with antibiotics but the mortality rate is about 30 percent Evidence linking Listeria to food appeared around 1950 when outbreaks of listeriosis in East Germany were associated with raw milk products A 1981 outbreak in the Canadian Maritime Provinces was traced to coleslaw made from cabbage fertilized with contaminated manure A 1983 outbreak in Massachusetts was associated with the consumption of milk from a single dairy In 1985 more than 180 people fell ill after eating Jalisco brand queso fresco a soft cheese Half of the victims were pregnant women or their infants The Jalisco outbreak was serendipitous for us because it was a noticeable increase in listeriosis said Joseph Lovett deputy chief of the FDAs bacterial physiology branch If it hadnt been concentrated in Hispanic motherinfant pairs who used the same general hospital it might not have triggered attention Once investigators implicated the cheese and determined that it had been contaminated with Listeria in the plant the FDA increased its scrutiny of soft cheeses generally In the summer of 1985 Listeria contamination was discovered in Liederkranz Camembert and Brie made in an Ohio plant We found Listeria in French Brie not because we were looking for it our branch works in basic research not inspection  but because we were developing better recovery methods Dr Lovett said Bries were included in the sampling just to cover all the bases to provide experimental controls There is uncertainty about the means by which Listeria contaminates dairy products Infected cows with no obvious signs of disease can shed large numbers of Listeria in their milk for months A cows teats a farm workers hands and farm equipment may be contaminated by contact with infected animals or their wastes and subsequently contaminate milk A recent survey by Dr Lovett and colleagues found that 7 percent of dairy farms tested produced Listeriatainted milk Until last year many believed that Listeria was resistant to heat and could survive proper pasteurization techniques However in 1985 Dr Robert Twedt and colleagues at FDA found that pasteurization effectively eliminates Listeria from tainted milk The different findings have yet to be resolved A more likely source of Listeria is improper handling of milk after pasteurization said Dr James C Feeley former chief of a field investigation unit at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and now consulting microbiologist with Pathogen Control Associates a consulting group in that city The dairy industry today makes a variety of different products with the same milk which is distributed through multiple stages after pasteurizing but before packaging he said This kind of technology allows a greater opportunity for postpasteurization contamination It is generally agreed that for an animal pathogen Listeria can grow at unusually low temperatures which may help explain why soft cheeses are especially hospitable to it Scientists routinely use cold enrichment to obtain cultures of Listeria from infected animals or foods By refrigerating the samples for several weeks at about 40 degrees they encourage the growth of Listeria relative to most other kinds of bacteria present The aging of soft cheeses at similar temperatures and for a similar period may also encourage any Listeria in the cheese to multiply The decreasing acidity of ripening cheeses also favors the bacteriums growth Medical experts are still debating the significance of the recent findings of Listeria in dairy products The incidence may actually be rising perhaps due to changes in dairy technology Dr Feeley said It is definitely not just a matter of detection or awareness But Dr Lovett said Weve been exposed to Listeria in cheese for centuries Recent incidents have drawn our attention to the problem and started us looking for it He noted however that Listeria is an opportunistic pathogen that takes advantage of weakened defenses and that the susceptible population is growing It includes certain cancer patients or patients undergoing chemotherapy those receiving cortisone treatment for transplants and AIDS victims Pregnant women are also vulnerable because their immunity is naturally depressed to prevent rejection of the fetus Because the disease is so dangerous for those at risk listeriosis is a serious public health problem Dr Lovett said adding There are probably other products that would be found to carry it if we concentrated on them Hard cheeses for example whose low water content was thought to render them inhospitable to Listeria We have assumed that aged cheeses are safe but we dont necessarily have the scientific information Dr Lovett said Listeria is pretty hardy and survives well in the natural environment We are now looking at hard cheeses Still compared with the frequency of other foodborne illnesses listeriosis remains rare I would be most concerned about unpasteurized products Dr Feeley said Consuming raw milk sets you up for infection by a variety of organisms Dr Lovett agrees that there is no reason for healthy people to avoid properly made soft cheeses But he expects that physicians may begin advising pregnant women to avoid soft cheeses along with alcohol and caffeine just to be safe
BISHOPS HIRE JESUIT WHO BACKED WOMEN AS PRIESTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/28/us/bishops-hire-jesuit-who-backed-women-as-priests.html,The National Conference of Catholic Bishops will hire a Jesuit theologian as a top doctrinal adviser despite the recent disclosure that he signed a letter nine years ago favoring ordination for Roman Catholic women the bishops conference announced yesterday Msgr Daniel F Hoye general secretary of the conference said the appointment of the theologian the Rev Michael J Buckley should go foward because a threemember panel of bishops affirmed Father Buckleys competence and his loyalty to the church The panel which studied the 1977 letter on womens ordination concluded We do not see that participation in the issuance of this statement constitutes public dissent from church teaching The action was regarded as a victory for liberal forces in the American Roman Catholic Church In recent weeks liberals in the church have been dealt setbacks with the censure of the Rev Charles E Curran and with the threat of action against two nuns who publicly favor the right of women to have abortions Signer Is Publicly Silent Both Father Curran a theologian at the Catholic University of America who has called for flexibility in the churchs ban against abortion homosexuality and other sexual matters and the nuns have been outspoken in their positions despite threats from the Vatican However Father Buckley a 54yearold professor at the Jesuit School of Theology in Berkeley Calif has been publicly silent since the disclosure that he joined 22 others in signing the 1977 letter The disclosure of his involvement which was reported in the conservative National Catholic Register came soon after Father Buckleys appointment May 30 to head the bishops committee on doctine Monsignor Hoye said he took the unusual step of forming a committee to review the appointment after some bishops expressed concern about the appropriateness of this decision and added Reports appeared in the media which seemed to question Father Buckleys loyalty to the Holy See and whether or not his signing of an open letter in 1977 on Inter Insigniores constituted public dissent Inter Insigniores is a document by the Vaticans Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith that puts forward arguments opposing the ordination of women as priests The review committee was headed by Archbishop Daniel Pilarczyk of Cincinnati Panel Draws a Distinction In its review of the issue the Pilarczyk committee made a distinction between differing with the conclusion of the Vatican document and differing with its arugments The committee said the intent of the signers of the 1977 letter was to disagree with the argumentation of Inter Insigniores and with the conclusion insofar as the conclusion is based on that argumentation adding It was not their intent to deny or dissent from the teaching of the church on the matter The committee report also dealt with the churchs magisterium or teaching authority which the church regards as divinely inspired We have no evidence that Father Buckley had ever publicly dissented from the teaching of the magisterium or was in any way disloyal to the church the Holy Father or the Holy See the committee said On the contrary his faithfulness and loyalty have been made clear on more than one occasion In his statement yesterday Monsignor Hoye said he came to his decision after receiving the report and consulting with the executive committee of the bishops conference I am grateful for the affirmation given to Father Buckleys theological competence and his loyalty to the church the monsignor added I have concluded therefore that the appointment should go forward
U.S. WITHHOLDS U.N. POPULATION FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/28/world/us-withholds-un-population-funds.html,The Agency for International Development has withdrawn its contribution to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities this year because of its involvement in Chinas population program officials said today The United Nations group which provides aid to 134 countries will lose 25 million as a result of the decision which was disclosed today to Congressional leaders and others The American action comes after months of intensive lobbying by antiabortion activists who asserted that the Chinese Governments population program involved the widespread use of compulsory abortions Chinese officials have repeatedly denied reports that their program coerces abortions or sterilizations A senior AID official said the money was being withheld because we think there is not an adequate change in the family planning program in China and we conclude that the UNFPA is too involved in that program The AID official emphasized the Reagan Administrations continuing support of family planning assistance abroad The 25 million which had been appropriated this year for the United Nations group will be spent on other family planning programs he said Statement by UN Group Rafael M Salas executive director of the United Nations group said in a statement The fund accepts this withdrawal as a sign that for domestic reasons the United States is no longer willing to assist developing countries in voluntary family planning programs through the United Nations system The decision was hailed by the National Right to Life Committee We think most Americans can think of better things to do with their tax dollars than fund a UNsupported program of compulsory abortion Douglas Johnson the groups legislative director said Advocates of population planning described the action as an American retreat from family planning assistance at a time when the need is most acute It says to the world that we are willing to dismantle our family planning programs abroad to keep happy a small but noisy antifamily planning constituency at home said Sharon L Camp vice president of the Population Crisis Committee Representative Jim Moody incoming chairman of the Congressional Coalition on Population and Development said the decision penalized many countries dependent on aid from the United Nations group Bangladesh Haiti and other similar countries will be the ones to suffer in order to satisfy a purely American domestic political dispute the Wisconsin Democrat said Decision Was Expected The decision had been expected for some time Last year AID announced a partial cutoff of aid to the United Nations group because of the same issue In that instance the agency cited an amendment approved by Congress last year that barred all Federal aid to groups that support or participate in the management of Government programs that coerce abortion or sterilization The decision today affected 25 million that had been appropriated to the group for the current fiscal year but never released It represents a total withdrawal of financing although the senior AID official said assistance could be resumed next year should the circumstances change This doesnt close the door to another year he said We will continue to look at what happens in Chinas program and what happens to UNFPAs involvement there The United States had been a leading donor to the United Nations group since its establishment in 1969 In the last eight years the United States has provided an average of 27 percent of the groups annual budget according to a spokesman for AID Other major donors include Canada West Germany Japan Norway and Sweden according to a spokesman for the United Nations group Because the United States cutoff was expected Mr Salas said today that the group had already managed to raise 20 million from other donors to make up for the lost American funds He said the groups programs would not be disrupted
While the World Grows,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/29/opinion/while-the-world-grows.html,By 2016 there will be twice as many people in the world and most of the growth will take place in the poorest countries That darkens the future for Kenya for instance with the worlds highest birth rate or Bangladesh where 10 million in a work force of 30 million are unemployed and 35 million babies are born every year The enlightened thing for America to do is help such countries conduct humane family planning What it has just done instead is petulantly stamp its foot and close its purse to the two most effective international agencies The dismaying story begins with the acclaimed United Nations Fund for Population Activities It counts on the United States Agency for International Development for about a quarter of its funds But AID has now withdrawn its support Why Because the UN agency also works with China China reputedly coerces abortions and some zealous Americans dont believe China when it denies that The UN agency refuses to stop aiding a nation that so needs population planning Thus the zealots have pressed the Reagan Administration to stop contributing to all the agencys work The loss of American money threatens family planning in 129 other poor nations Last year when AID did the same thing to International Planned Parenthood 18 African countries lost some family planning programs It is true that the United States has substantially increased its investment in international family planning through smaller programs and governmenttogovernment aid in the last six years But that is thanks to Congress which has invariably voted more than President Reagan had in mind In any case no population effort compares to the UN agency or International Planned Parenthood If there are Americans who believe China coerces abortion what better way to discourage it than by facilitating humane family planning In leaving the organization the United States turns its back on millions in poor countries to please a noisy shortsighted minority at home
The Vatican's Ouster of Curran: a Pyrrhic Victory,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/29/opinion/the-vaticans-ouster-of-curran-a-pyrrhic-victory.html,This time Vatican conservatives won but their victory will be Pyrrhic The Vatican bureaucracy has now successfully carried out a threat it originally raised 20 years ago when it first attempted to chop down the Rev Charles E Curran a theologian at Catholic University of America in Washington Last week Americas estimated 50 million Catholics learned that the days of meaningful dissent were over when Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger notified Father Curran that in light of your repeated refusal to accept what the church teaches he was no longer considered suitable nor eligible to continue in the function of Professor of Catholic Theology Father Curran was barred because his teachings on sexual morals varied from the Vaticans official position Cardinal Ratzingers order outlawing the right to an individual conscience snaps back into place the thought control outmoded by the Second Vatican Council It buried Pope John XXIIIs aggiornamento  modernization  and eviscerated the Councils principal goal making the church more responsive to its people and their times Cardinal Ratzinger pursued Father Curran who has asserted theologians right to scholarly dissent with the implacable willtodestroy that condemned heretics when the cardinals Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith was called the Holy Office of the Inquisition and his post was designated Grand Inquisitor The cardinal sidestepped canonical legal processes He made no pretense that Father Currans writings violated specific Catholic laws No transgression against papal pronouncements was charged On no grounds can Father Curran be considered a radical For example he firmly holds to Romes stance against freechoice abortions although in his teachings he leaves open the possibility that abortion may not be immoral when it can save a womans life To the extent that he sides with Rome he appears to lag far behind opinions held by most American Catholics when polled they register majority support for a womans right to decide about abortion based on her own circumstances The body of Father Currans work places him firmly in conservative ranks among late 20th century Americans and Europeans His colleagues consider him a moderate His positions enabled 700 Catholic theologians to sign a petition protesting a sevenyear Vatican trial that denied him access to his accusers Fought to a standstill under existing rules Cardinal Ratzinger won by stretching the doctrine of papal infallibility beyond its original intent to endow the Pontiff as the Vicar of Christ with the power to make divinely inspired pronouncements Cardinal Ratzinger has in effect declared all bishops infallible when they take a stand on faith or morals He made his ruling retroactive  and with the Popes blessing Thus John Paul II comes under further suspicion of wanting to undermine the Second Vatican Council Conservatives have now gotten even with Father Curran who was central to a humiliating loss 20 years ago When that confrontation began it is likely that his name was not even known to Alfredo Cardinal Ottaviani the prelate who then held Cardinal Ratzingers present post who wanted to send a warning to American Catholics he was concerned that they might take literally reforms promised by Vatican II In 1966 Cardinal Ottaviani issued orders to Archbishop Egidio Vagnozzi the Apostolic Delegate to Washington who considered various candidates before selecting Father Curran for the sacrifice Cardinal Vagnozzi told me in 1969 that he set in motion procedures for dismissing Father Curran No difficulty was expected for Catholic University is a pontifical institution directly under the Vatican For centuries throughout the church Curiaordered demotions and transfers occasioned few outcries their object lessons circulated effectively But that was before the Second Vatican Council To save their newfound rights faculty and students rose to Father Currans defense They shut down classes and a media storm resulted  the first that pitted people and priests against bishops The break came when Bostons prestigious Richard Cardinal Cushing abandoned his fellow bishops by affirming That fellow must teach all sides thats scholarship His words saved Father Currans job in 1967 and served to reinforce responsible scholarly inquiry as permitted by the Vatican Council Whats more Cardinal Cushing shattered the myth of a monolithic Catholic establishment he breathed American life into Pope John XXIIIs dreams for a modern church Cardinal Ottaviani and every other conservative prelate received a resounding defeat  one they could not accept as final Father Currans second trial started in 1979 the year Cardinal Ottaviani died In preparing his case Cardinal Ratzinger thinned liberals from the ranks of American bishops Cardinal Cushing is long dead and this time no knight has come to Father Currans rescue Lay Catholics lead their lives according to their own dictates for the most part The good and truly faithful are shrinking as attested by empty seminary classrooms Cardinal Ratzingers message has not been lost it has thrown a chill through faculties in every American Catholic college At least one library worried about a possible ban on Father Currans books Because the dismissal came under newly invented rules no one knows who will be next Cardinal Ratzinger and American church conservatives appear to have won their long fight to oust Father Curran But at what price The cost surely will be higher than understood by anyone behind Vatican walls which still shut out the changing world

CHASING AFTER GOD AND SEX,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/books/chasing-after-god-and-sex.html,ROGERS VERSION By John Updike 329 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 1795 THE language of fiction is a medley The novelist unlike the lyric poet or essayist must command many styles and speak to us through a plurality of borrowed or imitated discourses as well as in what passes for his or her own voice There are at least five distinct discursive strands interwoven in the texture of John Updikes Rogers Version Four of them will be familiar to readers of his previous novels but the fifth is I believe a new development or acquisition and a remarkably interesting one To start with the familiar there is the discourse of theology The central character and narrator pipesmoking 52yearold Roger Lambert is a professor of divinity a former Methodist minister who adopted an academic career after the scandalous breakup of his first marriage and his union with Esther 14 years his junior He teaches the history of the early Christian heresies at a large university in an unnamed Northeastern city that might be Boston He is a somewhat dilettantish disciple of Karl Barth the austere Swiss theologian who fiercely insisted on the utter separateness of the divine and the human and the utter dependence of the latter on the former Roger admits to insulating this hot Barthian nugget in layers of worldly cynicism and situation ethics Mr Updike is well able to evoke the ethos of an academic theology department and to have sly fun with its professional rivalries pretensions and jargon this one has specialists in Ethics and Moral Logistics and holocaustics He has manifested an interest in religion and theology in previous books If there was ever such a species as the Protestant novelist comparable to that much discussed animal the Catholic novelist Mr Updike may be its last surviving example There is the discourse of eroticism or pornography the distinction is not always easy to draw and Mr Updike has taken a leading part in the tendency of contemporary art to blur it incorporating previously taboo matter and diction into serious fiction His Couples was something of a landmark in this respect Roger Lambert never tires of reading theology but confides Lest you take me for a goodygoody I find kindred comfort and inspiration in pornography the muchdeplored detailed depiction of impossibly long and deep rigid and stretchable human parts interlocking pumping oozing His own descriptions of such acts certainly have the sharp focus the closeup detail the glossy sheen and vivid color of pornographic photography  with the added perversity or poignancy that they are mostly imagined rather than reported mental projections of his conviction that he is being cuckolded by a young graduate student Dale Kohler There is the discourse of domesticity  the faithful rendering of small quotidian activities such as cooking a meal fixing a drink changing a baby driving a car or the social dynamics of the nuclear family the Thanksgiving dinner the duty cocktail Continued on page 15 party From his earliest New Yorker stories Mr Updike has shown himself to be a master of domestic realism enhancing our awareness of the way we live A typical insight occurs when Roger contemplates his 12yearold son Why with a living room a library and his own goodsize bedroom at his disposal Richie insisted on doing his homework on the very surface where his mother was trying to arrange place mats and dinner plates while a teninch Sony crackled and chattered not a foot from his face I couldnt imagine Or so I said in repeated admonition Of course I secretly understood the primitive appeal of the hearth Television is  its irresistible charm  a fire Closely related to this discourse of domestic behavior is a discourse of physical description  of streets houses furniture trees clouds and the whole mesh of culture and nature that makes a suburb or a city the irrepressible combinations of the real in Rogers words Again Mr Updike has always been famous for his ability to defamiliarize the commonplace with a nifty trope sometimes jeopardizing the authenticity of his characters by attributing to them metaphors and similes that a professional poet might envy Roger however is cultivated and clever enough to carry off such typically perceptive images as damp flattened leaves covered the sidewalk with a brocaded richness or one of those oldfashioned wooden classroom chairs whose left arm atrophied and whose right has enlarged like a lobsters fighting claw There are several extended  perhaps overextended  topographical passages in the novel that trace Rogers movement from the relatively affluent and commodious residential streets around the university to a rundown housing project where Verna the daughter of his half sister lives precariously on welfare with her baby Paula whose black father has absconded Made aware of Vernas plight through Dale and motivated by family loyalty social guilt and  increasingly  lust for the sexy Verna Roger makes several trips to the housing project and his negotiation of its decaying environs reflects his uneasy consciousness of social and economic divisions in American society as Ronald Reagan wins his second term of office Not that Roger blames Mr Reagan for these problems  unlike most of his peer group he has a soft spot for the President Whether Mr Updike has too remains like much else in this novel ambiguous THE fifth and unfamiliar discourse in Rogers Version is that of science  mathematics physics biology and above all computing Dale Kohler is a graduate in computer studies and a fundamentalist Christian At the beginning of the story he visits Roger not just to tell him about Verna but to ask his assistance in obtaining a grant from the theology department He is convinced that the more science discovers about the mathematical equations underlying the universe the more unavoidable becomes the conclusion that they are not the result of chance God is showing through he assures Roger though the scientific establishment is desperately trying to conceal the fact Everywhere you look Dale says there are these terrifically finely adjusted constants that have to be just what they are or there wouldnt be a world we could recognize and theres no intrinsic reason for those constants to be what they are except to say God made them that way His amibition is to prove this assertion by calculations and model manipulations on the universitys giant computer The project is as repugnant to Roger as its tall gawky virile proponent It offends his Barthian theological principles but it also threatens his cynicism and situation ethics Your God sounds like a nice safe unfindable God Dale shrewdly observes Much is at stake The pair debate the issue in a series of set pieces that cover cosmology evolution and the relation of body to mind These are fascinating and important issues topical too given the rising tide of Christian fundamentalism in America today  and it is heartening to see a literary novelist taking them on board A note on the copyright page gives some indication of the research that all this entailed and one can only salute Mr Updikes energy boldness and sheer brainpower in undertaking it He is not content to give us a mere impressionistic whiff of physics math and biology He makes Dale Kohler speak with the passion and particularity of the true enthusiast Take the strong force which binds the atomic nuclei together Make it five percent weaker and the deuteron couldnt form and there would be no deuterium which means the main nuclear reaction chain used by the sun couldnt function if it were two percent stronger two protons could stick together and the existence of the diprotons would make hydrogen so explosive the present universe would consist entirely of helium There is quite a lot of this sort of talk and the scientifically illiterate reader like myself may find that much of it goes over his head at least on first reading The book seems initially to be shaping up as a rather static novel of ideas but as it proceeds the different discourses within it begin to interact excitingly There is for instance a remarkable chapter in which Rogers wrestling with Tertullians arguments for the resurrection of the body elides into a startlingly explicit account of Esther and Dale making love which in turn gives way to a debate between the two men about the bodymind problem Each strand illuminates the others Admittedly the plot never Mr Updikes strong point ticks on rather slowly The cracks in the Lambert marriage begin to show Verna gets carelessly pregnant again and Roger shoulders both the financial and the moral responsibility of arranging an abortion Will he overcome his fear of catching some stateoftheart venereal diseases and sleep with her Is Esther really sleeping with Dale Since all the discourses in the novel are uttered or mediated by Roger as narrator the question of his reliability becomes crucial The title of the novel suggests that there might be other very different versions of the story and a number of clues seem planted in the text warning us not to trust him Early on he begins to put himself in Dales place and see the world through his eyes with what he himself calls an odd and sinister empathy His detailed narratives of Esthers infidelity appear to be based on pure suspicion and could well be the voyeuristic fantasies at once compensatory and selfpunishing of middleaged impotence As the novel moves toward its narrative climax Verna with Rogers collusion narrowly escapes a charge of child abuse and gratefully invites him into her bed Dales faith and mental equilibrium begin to crack under the stress of his impossible project the novel seems poised for a reversal that will reveal Rogers suspicions as delusory But at the very end they are casually confirmed by Verna Dales been having an affair with some older woman somebody married who I guess is a pretty hot ticket    Somewhere in your neighborhood I got the impression The absence of an expected reversal is itself a reversal This twist is effective in narrative terms but does not entirely solve the problem of authority in the novel Where did all the detail of Rogers erotic imaginings come from How does he know what Dales room looks like down to the Korean crucifix of ambiguous substance that hangs above the bed How is Roger in a tour de force chapter able to give a minutely circumstantial account of the Cube the building that houses the universitys computer services where Dale works all night in a supreme effort to conjure the hand or face of God on his computer terminal when he Roger states at the outset of his narrative that I have never entered it nor do I hope to Firstperson narrators are allowed by poetic license to borrow some of the authors eloquence but not his omniscience ONE is tempted to seek a clue in Rogers comment on the inconsistencies and circularities of early Christian documents Firstcentury people just didnt have the same sense of factuality that we do or of writing either Writing was sympathetic magic    writing something down was to an extent making it so So of course is writing fiction If Mr Updike were a novelist given to metafictional tricks we might suspect him of holding up a mirror to the readers credulity by making his character claim the same freedom to invent that we grant the novelist But everything we know about Mr Updike suggests that he shares the modern sense of factuality and believes that fiction should create the illusion of it Otherwise why take all that trouble to get the scientific discourse right There is then an unresolved enigma or contradiction at the heart of Rogers Version blurring the exact nature and degree of the narrators bad faith For all its richness and virtuosity the novel makes its effect by a somewhat arbitrary suppression of the discourse of objective report Nevertheless one finishes it with gratitude  for it is challenging and educative and with renewed respect for one of the most intelligent and resourceful of contemporary novelists LIFE INTERRUPTS ME OCCASIONALLY John Updike once said When I write I aim in my mind not toward New York but toward a vague spot a little to the east of Kansas On the telephone a few days ago from his home in Massachusetts he was asked if that sentiment applied to his new novel I suppose yes he said Both the men in the novel come from west of the Hudson Im still trying to write about the basic American anxieties and issues in the heartland A note appears on the copyright page of Rogers Version thanking a score of individuals including scientists because Mr Updike derived the ideas in the novel in part from their work Did such an acknowledgment ever appear before in his fiction One had he said at even greater length in The Coup which was set in Africa The note in Rogers Version credits Jacob Neusner for helping with the Hebrew Jack Neusner and I were Harvard freshmen together Mr Updike said He now heads a department of Judaic studies at Brown I wanted to get the Hebrew words right Three experts are thanked for generously sharing their knowledge of computers Did he write the book on a computer Ive written on a word processor thats user friendly for the last three years he said I prefer the silence of pencil on paper to being aware that electricity is awaiting me but the advantages of a word processor are so great for making changes How does he balance writing novels poems and book reviews Life interrupts me occasionally he said but Im an oldfashioned text producer engaged in a oneman operation When Im writing a novel I try to keep my mornings free The book reviews help to keep me hopping and reading and in print about once a month I write the poetry when I travel  Ive probably written too many airplane poems Ideally Id only write poems but theyre a luxury that must be maintained by other means Herbert Mitgang

public means a great deal Depending on the level of animation in the voice and the slouch of the shoulders it can say anything from I dont care to To hell with you The suggestion unspoken is that if you are smart enough to be here you should be able to find whatever it is you want by yourself A lot of New Yorkers appear to be very smart I know this because they tell me it is so From a young age You are a smart kid I tell a friends son I know that replies he in an arentsomepeopledumb voice I hear you are good in your field I mention tentatively to a new acquaintance The best she informs me Such a wealth of selfconfidence can cripple a conversation I am even becoming wary of stating the obvious in a display of manners Its been good having you I tell a young guest visiting my home Thats right says she and I swear had she been a little taller or had I been a little closer to groveling she would have patted my head All this affirmation and selfconfidence is proof that American people believe in themselves The right to be lovable has been added to the list of Free World privileges Up until recently I was quite satisfied with my high degree of ambivalence and insecurity Secretly I thought it reflected an evolved but rather depressed mind Here I am doomed to be last in line in the active search for certainty that goes on around me It is a most genuine quest and not to be scorned The desire to be on top of the pile and to know it all has produced the great obsessions of space technology media coverage of the greatest honesty values all adding up to this becoming my promised land Individually however and at close quarters it can get to be a bit much Recently I attended a dinner party in which an academic in some esoteric field monopolized the evening by talking about his weight loss renewed interest in religion and recent divorce A former beauty queen sat on my right and got in a few words about her work with handicapped children The hostess had written a book on decorating cold cuts Even the maid had the kind of glint in her eye that told me she was planning on getting published somewhere I shake at night wondering what I can sell in the marketplace and why the Perdue chicken man believes more in his achievements than I do in mine I conclude that I cannot produce anything that makes my family whistle as they sit down to dinner The man who unpacks the tomatoes in my local supermarket has more philosophical certainty than I will ever have You gotta believe in yourself he tells the man on cucumbers Take a stand my man Can I help you The latter is addressed to me who is trying to merge into the fresh greens I shake my head and move on Perhaps it is Long Island that has gotten to me A trip to Manhattan is needed to give a taste of the cosmopolitan I am in search of a new rhythm a widening of horizons I soon find myself in a Technicolor highspeed rumba Frozen in cold and terror I revert to Dorothy of Kansas There is hay in my hair as I walk out of step in this strange new land People swarm in all directions and the wind chill bites my celluite Can anyone with a high anxiety level call this home I am circled three times by an oddlooking man at the Museum of Modern Art He is not really that odd but reminds me of my cousin who hates art I am starting to disintegrate People walk fast talk faster Lyrical strains but some harsh realism Color is not the issue My God Maxine an abortion I am adrift in a sea of changing faces double meanings and incomplete sentences On the train traveling back east I start to cry It is unexpected One moment I am reflecting on the magnitude of this society and how much it has to offer The next moment I am weeping I try to console myself that what I have left behind is a closed chapter Suddenly I recall a childhood picnic at the beach I have sand in my shoe and my mother is helping me take it out I sniff noisily My recall is selective I remember only the good and dismiss emotions of guilt and fear Drifting on such memory I am caught up in a whirlpool of loss The birth of my daughter comes into focus All the women in my ward received flowers but my husband gave me three bananas and an orange This prompts a fresh flood of tears The train stops and I continue to sit shivering A man comes over and looks at me with concern He asks if I am well and I nod Have a good day I find myself saying to him He smiles I find surprisingly that I am able to get up and walk off the train out of the station I move on toward something or other
PRIEST TO APPEAL VATICAN MOVE TO DISMISS HIM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/us/priest-to-appeal-vatican-move-to-dismiss-him.html,The Rev Charles Curran saying that he would be a Catholic theologian no matter what happens said today that he was formally appealing the Vaticans attempt to dismiss him from the faculty at Catholic University The priest whose views on sexual issues led to the Vatican action said he had written to the universitys chancellor requesting an appeal Father Curran said previously that the rules of the appeals process should not apply to him since he was granted tenure at the university before they came into effect But in a statement released today he said he was making the formal appeal because he did not want to forfeit any academic or legal rights he might have Deadline Imposed He said the university chancellor Archbishop James Hickey of Washington had unilaterally imposed a Sept 1 deadline for such an appeal As part of my theological enterprise I will continue to work for the legitimacy of theological and practical dissent from some noninfallible church teachings and for the importance of academic freedom for Catholic institutions and for Catholic theology he said I consider myself suitable and eligible to exercise the function of a professor of Catholic theology he continued paraphrasing a July letter from the Vatican that said he was neither suitable nor eligible Vatican officials say their statement approved by Pope John Paul II means the Rev Curran can no longer teach as a Catholic theologian and therefore cannot retain his position as professor of moral theology at the school That stand has been publicly supported by Archbishop Hickey and the universitys president the Rev William Byron Disagreements Were Limited Father Curran has said the Vatican exaggerated his stand on issues such as birth control abortion divorce and homosexuality and that his disagreements have been limited respectful and proper He has also raised the possibility of going to civil court if he cannot win his case within the university and he said he had retained a lawyer He has made no predictions of success for his appeal within the university system But he has said he would welcome the chance it would give him to air the issues in his case No matter what happens in the future I am committed to carrying on my theological endeavors he said

'Roger's Version',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/08/31/books/rogers-version.html,THE language of fiction is a medley The novelist unlike the lyric poet or essayist must command many styles and speak to us through a plurality of borrowed or imitated discourses as well as in what passes for his or her own voice There are at least five distinct discursive strands interwoven in the texture of John Updikes Rogers Version Four of them will be familiar to readers of his previous novels but the fifth is I believe a new development or acquisition and a remarkably interesting one To start with the familiar there is the discourse of theology The central character and narrator pipesmoking 52yearold Roger Lambert is a professor of divinity a former Methodist minister who adopted an academic career after the scandalous breakup of his first marriage and his union with Esther 14 years his junior He teaches the history of the early Christian heresies at a large university in an unnamed Northeastern city that might be Boston He is a somewhat dilettantish disciple of Karl Barth the austere Swiss theologian who fiercely insisted on the utter separateness of the divine and the human and the utter dependence of the latter on the former Roger admits to insulating this hot Barthian nugget in layers of worldly cynicism and situation ethics Mr Updike is well able to evoke the ethos of an academic theology department and to have sly fun with its professional rivalries pretensions and jargon this one has specialists in Ethics and Moral Logistics and holocaustics He has manifested an interest in religion and theology in previous books If there was ever such a species as the Protestant novelist comparable to that much discussed animal the Catholic novelist Mr Updike may be its last surviving example There is the discourse of eroticism or pornography the distinction is not always easy to draw and Mr Updike has taken a leading part in the tendency of contemporary art to blur it incorporating previously taboo matter and diction into serious fiction His Couples was something of a landmark in this respect Roger Lambert never tires of reading theology but confides Lest you take me for a goodygoody I find kindred comfort and inspiration in pornography the muchdeplored detailed depiction of impossibly long and deep rigid and stretchable human parts interlocking pumping oozing His own descriptions of such acts certainly have the sharp focus the closeup detail the glossy sheen and vivid color of pornographic photography  with the added perversity or poignancy that they are mostly imagined rather than reported mental projections of his conviction that he is being cuckolded by a young graduate student Dale Kohler There is the discourse of domesticity  the faithful rendering of small quotidian activities such as cooking a meal fixing a drink changing a baby driving a car or the social dynamics of the nuclear family the Thanksgiving dinner the duty cocktail Continued on page 15 party From his earliest New Yorker stories Mr Updike has shown himself to be a master of domestic realism enhancing our awareness of the way we live A typical insight occurs when Roger contemplates his 12yearold son Why with a living room a library and his own goodsize bedroom at his disposal Richie insisted on doing his homework on the very surface where his mother was trying to arrange place mats and dinner plates while a teninch Sony crackled and chattered not a foot from his face I couldnt imagine Or so I said in repeated admonition Of course I secretly understood the primitive appeal of the hearth Television is  its irresistible charm  a fire Closely related to this discourse of domestic behavior is a discourse of physical description  of streets houses furniture trees clouds and the whole mesh of culture and nature that makes a suburb or a city the irrepressible combinations of the real in Rogers words Again Mr Updike has always been famous for his ability to defamiliarize the commonplace with a nifty trope sometimes jeopardizing the authenticity of his characters by attributing to them metaphors and similes that a professional poet might envy Roger however is cultivated and clever enough to carry off such typically perceptive images as damp flattened leaves covered the sidewalk with a brocaded richness or one of those oldfashioned wooden classroom chairs whose left arm atrophied and whose right has enlarged like a lobsters fighting claw There are several extended  perhaps overextended  topographical passages in the novel that trace Rogers movement from the relatively affluent and commodious residential streets around the university to a rundown housing project where Verna the daughter of his half sister lives precariously on welfare with her baby Paula whose black father has absconded Made aware of Vernas plight through Dale and motivated by family loyalty social guilt and  increasingly  lust for the sexy Verna Roger makes several trips to the housing project and his negotiation of its decaying environs reflects his uneasy consciousness of social and economic divisions in American society as Ronald Reagan wins his second term of office Not that Roger blames Mr Reagan for these problems  unlike most of his peer group he has a soft spot for the President Whether Mr Updike has too remains like much else in this novel ambiguous THE fifth and unfamiliar discourse in Rogers Version is that of science  mathematics physics biology and above all computing Dale Kohler is a graduate in computer studies and a fundamentalist Christian At the beginning of the story he visits Roger not just to tell him about Verna but to ask his assistance in obtaining a grant from the theology department He is convinced that the more science discovers about the mathematical equations underlying the universe the more unavoidable becomes the conclusion that they are not the result of chance God is showing through he assures Roger though the scientific establishment is desperately trying to conceal the fact Everywhere you look Dale says there are these terrifically finely adjusted constants that have to be just what they are or there wouldnt be a world we could recognize and theres no intrinsic reason for those constants to be what they are except to say God made them that way His amibition is to prove this assertion by calculations and model manipulations on the universitys giant computer The project is as repugnant to Roger as its tall gawky virile proponent It offends his Barthian theological principles but it also threatens his cynicism and situation ethics Your God sounds like a nice safe unfindable God Dale shrewdly observes Much is at stake The pair debate the issue in a series of set pieces that cover cosmology evolution and the relation of body to mind These are fascinating and important issues topical too given the rising tide of Christian fundamentalism in America today  and it is heartening to see a literary novelist taking them on board A note on the copyright page gives some indication of the research that all this entailed and one can only salute Mr Updikes energy boldness and sheer brainpower in undertaking it He is not content to give us a mere impressionistic whiff of physics math and biology He makes Dale Kohler speak with the passion and particularity of the true enthusiast Take the strong force which binds the atomic nuclei together Make it five percent weaker and the deuteron couldnt form and there would be no deuterium which means the main nuclear reaction chain used by the sun couldnt function if it were two percent stronger two protons could stick together and the existence of the diprotons would make hydrogen so explosive the present universe would consist entirely of helium There is quite a lot of this sort of talk and the scientifically illiterate reader like myself may find that much of it goes over his head at least on first reading The book seems initially to be shaping up as a rather static novel of ideas but as it proceeds the different discourses within it begin to interact excitingly There is for instance a remarkable chapter in which Rogers wrestling with Tertullians arguments for the resurrection of the body elides into a startlingly explicit account of Esther and Dale making love which in turn gives way to a debate between the two men about the bodymind problem Each strand illuminates the others Admittedly the plot never Mr Updikes strong point ticks on rather slowly The cracks in the Lambert marriage begin to show Verna gets carelessly pregnant again and Roger shoulders both the financial and the moral responsibility of arranging an abortion Will he overcome his fear of catching some stateoftheart venereal diseases and sleep with her Is Esther really sleeping with Dale Since all the discourses in the novel are uttered or mediated by Roger as narrator the question of his reliability becomes crucial The title of the novel suggests that there might be other very different versions of the story and a number of clues seem planted in the text warning us not to trust him Early on he begins to put himself in Dales place and see the world through his eyes with what he himself calls an odd and sinister empathy His detailed narratives of Esthers infidelity appear to be based on pure suspicion and could well be the voyeuristic fantasies at once compensatory and selfpunishing of middleaged impotence As the novel moves toward its narrative climax Verna with Rogers collusion narrowly escapes a charge of child abuse and gratefully invites him into her bed Dales faith and mental equilibrium begin to crack under the stress of his impossible project the novel seems poised for a reversal that will reveal Rogers suspicions as delusory But at the very end they are casually confirmed by Verna Dales been having an affair with some older woman somebody married who I guess is a pretty hot ticket    Somewhere in your neighborhood I got the impression The absence of an expected reversal is itself a reversal This twist is effective in narrative terms but does not entirely solve the problem of authority in the novel Where did all the detail of Rogers erotic imaginings come from How does he know what Dales room looks like down to the Korean crucifix of ambiguous substance that hangs above the bed How is Roger in a tour de force chapter able to give a minutely circumstantial account of the Cube the building that houses the universitys computer services where Dale works all night in a supreme effort to conjure the hand or face of God on his computer terminal when he Roger states at the outset of his narrative that I have never entered it nor do I hope to Firstperson narrators are allowed by poetic license to borrow some of the authors eloquence but not his omniscience ONE is tempted to seek a clue in Rogers comment on the inconsistencies and circularities of early Christian documents Firstcentury people just didnt have the same sense of factuality that we do or of writing either Writing was sympathetic magic    writing something down was to an extent making it so So of course is writing fiction If Mr Updike were a novelist given to metafictional tricks we might suspect him of holding up a mirror to the readers credulity by making his character claim the same freedom to invent that we grant the novelist But everything we know about Mr Updike suggests that he shares the modern sense of factuality and believes that fiction should create the illusion of it Otherwise why take all that trouble to get the scientific discourse right There is then an unresolved enigma or contradiction at the heart of Rogers Version blurring the exact nature and degree of the narrators bad faith For all its richness and virtuosity the novel makes its effect by a somewhat arbitrary suppression of the discourse of objective report Nevertheless one finishes it with gratitude  for it is challenging and educative and with renewed respect for one of the most intelligent and resourceful of contemporary novelists LIFE INTERRUPTS ME OCCASIONALLY John Updike once said When I write I aim in my mind not toward New York but toward a vague spot a little to the east of Kansas On the telephone a few days ago from his home in Massachusetts he was asked if that sentiment applied to his new novel I suppose yes he said Both the men in the novel come from west of the Hudson Im still trying to write about the basic American anxieties and issues in the heartland A note appears on the copyright page of Rogers Version thanking a score of individuals including scientists because Mr Updike derived the ideas in the novel in part from their work Did such an acknowledgment ever appear before in his fiction One had he said at even greater length in The Coup which was set in Africa The note in Rogers Version credits Jacob Neusner for helping with the Hebrew Jack Neusner and I were Harvard freshmen together Mr Updike said He now heads a department of Judaic studies at Brown I wanted to get the Hebrew words right Three experts are thanked for generously sharing their knowledge of computers Did he write the book on a computer Ive written on a word processor thats user friendly for the last three years he said I prefer the silence of pencil on paper to being aware that electricity is awaiting me but the advantages of a word processor are so great for making changes How does he balance writing novels poems and book reviews Life interrupts me occasionally he said but Im an oldfashioned text producer engaged in a oneman operation When Im writing a novel I try to keep my mornings free The book reviews help to keep me hopping and reading and in print about once a month I write the poetry when I travel  Ive probably written too many airplane poems Ideally Id only write poems but theyre a luxury that must be maintained by other means Herbert Mitgang
Coercion Sanctioned By the Conservatives,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/02/opinion/l-coercion-sanctioned-by-the-conservatives-749186.html,To the Editor J Philip Anderegg writes that conservatives although he doesnt use that label dont want to impose the moral harness on Americans referred to in your July 31 editorial Contradictions but rather believe in minimum coercion of man by the state letter Aug 13 Mr Anderegg says that on the basis of federalism conservatives support the Supreme Court decision on a states right to make homosexual sodomy a crime He has however used a sanitized description of the Courts recent decision The Court upheld in its entirety a Georgia statute prohibiting anal or oral sex a statute that makes no distinction between homosexual and heterosexual activity or between married and unmarried couples What the Supreme Court actually ruled in effect is that private sexual conduct including consensual conduct in marital bedrooms is constitutionally subject to government regulation Mr Anderegg also says conservatives believe that the state should punish as crimes invasions    of the physical psychological or economic integrity of other persons including future generations He is of course referring to abortion as an invasion of the rights of the embryoperson The classification of the human embryo as a person is challenged by the majority of religious denominations by the American Medical Association and by the National Academy of Sciences Mr Anderegg is really talking about the enforcement of sectarian religious rules by the American Government These prohibitions are intrusions into our most personal decisions They hardly represent minimum coercion EDGAR VILLCHUR Woodstock NY Aug 14 1986

Liberated Woman Meets Uncommitted Man,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/opinion/l-liberated-woman-meets-uncommitted-man-468186.html,To the Editor In an Aug 25 Stylepage article you repeat the question broached in a recent spate of popular books Why are todays women so unhappy in their relationships with men The experts you cite mostly beg the question by saying that women should not feel this way moreover if only womens liberation had gone far enough they would not need to base their sense of selfworth on a mans opinion of them To pick up where you leave off then why are women in 1986 more unhappy in their love lives than women were in 1956 when presumably the rich rewards of womens liberation were as yet unreaped Other critics might find womens liberation itself to be a major culprit Women are positively reeling under the weight of all the new freedoms conferred upon them the freedom to have a demanding career as well as to raise children to have sex after two dates with a man to undergo multiple abortions to be single mothers While women flail about in the sea of their new freedoms however most of them manage to find an anchor their heady desire to have children Many men on the other hand emancipated from the bonds of marriage and societys mandate to form and support families are now rudderless Such men are emotionally immature selfindulgent and unable to make commitments Without the responsibilities that once shaped them into men they are little more than boys In the light of such dubious progress it is small wonder that an adversarial relationship has sprung up between men and women human nature has not yet caught up with womens lib The womans movement has played a key role in undermining the very qualities in men that made them attractive to women in the first place and accordingly women find todays men wimpy and uninteresting The men who are getting the mixed signals do not know what they are doing wrong and some of them are suffering for it But their suffering is mitigated by the pursuit of their new sexual and financial freedoms Meanwhile the biological time clocks of 32yearold women like myself never married and eager for children keep ticking CARY MCMULLEN New York Aug 26 1986
ARCHDIOCESE TO BAR DISSIDENTS FROM SPEAKING IN ITS PARISHES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/04/nyregion/archdiocese-to-bar-dissidents-from-speaking-in-its-parishes.html,Those who disagree with the official teachings of the Roman Catholic Church should be barred from speaking in parishes in the Archdiocese of New York the Vicar General of the archdiocese said in a directive to all pastors The Vicar General Bishop Joseph T OKeefe is second in command to John Cardinal OConnor The directive was sent in a newsletter to the 410 parishes in the archdiocese Bishop OKeefe wrote It is not only inappropriate it is unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite the individuals to speak at such events whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the church The order comes at a time when the Vatican has been clamping down on dissenting views within the American church and when local dioceses have been following the example of the Vatican Most of the cases involve social and sexual issues particularly abortion Last month for example the Rev Charles E Curran was told by the Vatican that he could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington because of his view that the church should modify its absolute ban on abortion divorce birth control and other issues In another case an 11yearold girl in Toledo Ohio was told by her pastor that she could not return to her Catholic school unless she renounced her support for a womans right to abortion The New York directive states that pastors should exercise great care and prudence in extending invitations to speakers at parish sponsored events  for example communion breakfasts graduations meeting of parish societies etc In an interview last night Bishop OKeefe declined to say whether the guidelines would exclude Governor Cuomo or Geraldine A Ferraro the 1984 Democratic Vice Presidential candidate from speaking in parishes in the archdiocese At first the Vicar General dismissed the question saying that the national public figures would not want to address a small audience at a churchsponsored event But when pressed he said that the decision on their suitability to address a church audience would be left up to the the parish priest Both the Governor and Mrs Ferraro Catholics who say that they are personally opposed to abortion  clashed in 1984 with Cardinal OConnor over their support for a public policy that allowed women to have an abortion The Cardinal said that such a position was inconsistent with church teaching and he challenged Catholics in public office to work to overturn through legislation the 1973 Supreme Court decision that legalized abortion A spokesman for the Governor Matthew G Monahan said last night Mr Cuomo had not seen the newsletter and would not comment until he saw it The spokesman added that the guidelines dont seem to apply to the Governor who he said is totally within the confines of church teaching Circulated Within Parishes Bishop OKeefes newsletter is sent periodically to pastors in the diocese which includes Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and seven upstate counties The newsletter dated Aug 18 came to light yesterday as it was being circulated among parish organizations The item on church speakers was one of more than a dozen in the newsletter which also included a prayer for South Africa and a plea for donations to the New York Blood Program Bishop OKeefe said that the policy was not meant to prohibit the free exercise of opinion Im not saying we shouldnt listen he said Im not afraid to listen to anybodys opinion But when you are bringing together a church society it is inappropriate to invite people who divide your community The Vicar General said that he drew the policy on speakers after repeated requests by certain chapters of the Ancient Order of Hibernians an IrishAmerican fraternal organization who asked for guidelines on inviting speakers The Bishop said that the directive was not related to Mr Cuomos appearance before the national convention of the Hibernians in Buffalo in July Mr Cuomo was the keynote speaker at the convention and according to Mr Monahan was received with warm enthusiasm In drawing up the policy the Bishop said I never even thought of the Governor
CUOMO AT ODDS WITH ARCHDIOCESE OVER POLICY ON DISSIDENT SPEAKERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/05/nyregion/cuomo-at-odds-with-archdiocese-over-policy-on-dissident-speakers.html,Governor Cuomo declaring that we lay people have a right to be heard took issue with the Archdiocese of New York last night over a directive that prohibits those who disagree with the Roman Catholic Churchs teachings from speaking at parish events One of the classic positions against restraint of intellectual activity is to ask How do you define it How do you implement it  the Governor said in an interview adding later Its very difficult to see how this would be implemented From what Im told it applies to church teaching he continued But what is church teaching When are you teaching infallibly and when arent you What people which people will decide who agrees with church teaching Will you have ecclesiastical courts Past Differences The comments by the Governor a Roman Catholic once again put him in potential conflict with the leadership of the archdiocese In the past he has been at odds with John Cardinal OConnor the head of the archdiocese over the Cardinals contention that Catholics in government should apply the teachings of the church to public policy The director of communications for the archdiocese Msgr Peter G Finn responded that Mr Cuomos comments were nonsense as far as Im concerned I hardly think our local synagogue would be about to invite the PLO to their local seder any more than a church in Harlem would invite Mr Botha to their supper he continued referring to P W Botha the President of South Africa So I dont understand Whats the problem Pastors Given Final Say In response to a request from many people about what the guidelines should be for inviting people for speaking a guideline was given Period Monsignor Finn said emphasizing that in each case the final decision was up to the pastor of the parish I think its very clear as far as the church is concerned what it means by differing with the churchs teachings  Mr Cuomos statements were in response to a directive by Bishop Joseph T OKeefe the Vicar General of the archdiocese and the second in command to the Cardinal contained in a newsletter to 410 parishes It is not only inappropriate the Bishop wrote in the directive it is unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite the individuals to speak at such events whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the church The directive states that pastors should exercise great care and prudence in extending invitations to speakers at parish sponsored events  for example communion breakfasts graduations meetings of parish societies etc The order comes after steps by the Vatican to move against dissenting views in the church in the United States Last month the Rev Charles E Curran was told he could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America because of his belief that the church should alter its stand on abortion divorce birth control and other issues In an interview Wednesday Bishop OKeefe said he drafted the policy after repeated requests by certain chapters of the Ancient Order of Hiberians an IrishAmerican fraternal organization for guidelines on speakers Mr Cuomo appeared before the national convention of the Hibernians in Buffalo in July The Bishop maintained that the directive was not related to Mr Cuomo and last night the Governor said he was thankful for that But still he added it leaves a lot of questions as to whom it does apply And when does it apply What events are they referring to Is an appearance at a cemetery such an event The church has the right to make rules for itself theres no doubt about that Mr Cuomo said The church has the right to make rules It can say If you want to belong these are the rules  But depending on what the rule was he continued one can say whether it was wise or whether it was unwise The Catholic Church is not the cardinals the bishops the priests and the nuns The Catholic Church by definition in canon law is the hierarchy the religious and lay members We are the church all of us together I Am Curious About It The way in a congregation for the Jewish people the rabbi is not the congregation  the people and the rabbi together are the congregation  thats the way it is with our church The lay people are part of the church We have a right in some cases to be heard on the rules I am curious  I am curious about it the Governor said of the directive adding that he wanted to study its language more carefully before commenting any further or deciding whether to press his argument more formally with church officials Earlier yesterday Mr Cuomo vigorously defended a womans legal right to have an abortion and the use of Medicaid funds to pay for it Obligation to Secular Law Cited The Governors comments at a gathering of Democratic women in Manhattan were among his strongest to date on the issue They came on the same day as reports were published on the archdioceses directive on parish speakers Mr Cuomo said immediately after the speech that as a Catholic he personally remained opposed to abortion but that when it came to his role as Governor he was obligated to follow secular law He cannot say of me that my belief is different from the teaching of the Catholic Church the Governor said of Bishop OKeefe I believe what the church believes Adding that his beliefs were a personal thing not public policy Mr Cuomo said My position has always been the same Its not a question of whether I believe birth control is proper or not The question is In this society is it legal And the answer is yes
NEW POLITICS EMERGING OUT OF DEMOGRAPHIC CHANGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/05/us/new-politics-emerging-out-of-demographic-changes.html,Republicans say the rapid demographic changes since Ronald Reagan was elected six years ago are working mostly in their favor But Democrats are seeking to reshape their party in a manner that would appeal if in different ways to the same groups forged into a coalition by Mr Reagan traditional and new right Republicans bluecollar workers and adults under the age of 45 from various economic levels For example Democratic officials are seeking to refashion their policy on the national level so that it will better reflect the conservative interests of Southern and Western voters while holding on to constituencies such as minorities labor unions and traditional liberals found in large Northern cities Principal Demographic Changes These were the principal demographic changes  The number of voters 25 to 44 years old has increased sharply  Racial and occupational groups are separating more widely economically and geographically as the population spreads away from the central cities  The economy once based on manufacturing jobs is changing rapidly and is now based on service and information processing This is leading to new commercial and residential development marked by an entrepreneurial spirit and opposition to regulation FastestGrowing Counties All these trends were visible when Mr Reagan was first elected to the White House but they have since become far more pronounced The most recent census estimates published by the Dun  Bradstreet Corporation show that the 15 counties of over 100000 people that grew fastest from 1980 to 1986 were all exurban places near such cities as Atlanta Houston Dallas Denver and Orlando Fla or were new metropolitan areas formed around small cities such as Ocala Fla or Myrtle Beach SC In all regions the greatest growth was in areas removed from the central cities and older suburbs A national conference held in Philadelphia recently by the American Institute of Certified Public Planners was concerned mostly with problems caused by development such as traffic congestion but some common characteristics of the newgrowth areas emerged These areas are populated largely by white welleducated younger adults with incomes higher than average many with children Even the areas that have formed around retirement and recreation communities such as Myrtle Beach have large populations of young people who have moved there to take advantage of job openings or to start small businesses The growing importance of those born in the baby boom after World War II was pointed up in a recent Census Bureau report showing that from April 1980 to July 1985 the population of those 35 to 44 grew nearly a quarter an increase of 61 million nationally And the nextlargest increase almost 5 million came in the group 25 to 34 years old Together they number 74 million and make up more than 40 percent of the population of voting age Many of the baby boomers were of course of voting age in recent elections but demographers and political experts say the significance of their numbers now is that they are reaching the age of prime political and economic influence with more of them voting and challenging their elders in leadership positions There is however disagreement as to what their influence will mean in terms of party affiliation Gordon S Black of Rochester a national consultant and pollster said he believed the staggering change that occurred in 1984 when many voters switched allegiance from the Democratic to the Republican Party would last for some time because it occurred mostly among the young In the past when the young picked a party preference they tended to stay with it said Mr Black noting that while President Reagan had wide support among the young in the 1984 election Walter F Mondale the Democratic candidate kept the loyalty of older people who became Democrats in the 1930s and 1940s The other point of view as expressed by Horace W Busby a Washington political analyist is that a political party is not important to young adults any more They are independent with a strong bias toward conservatism he said Thus Democrats at all levels are seeking to move their party into a more centrist position to appeal both to the rising number of voters under 45 as well as to the historic conservatism of the South and West where most of the population now lives Growth of Exurban Areas Unlike the old suburbs of the past the new exurban areas are little dependent on the cities but have economies of their own usually office parks small businesses service industries educational institutions and shopping centers The Administrations policy favoring reduced Government regulation and domestic social programs has found receptive ground there Richard M Scammon a political analyst and former head of the Census Bureau said the continued spreading of the population away from the cities had had profound effects on politics He said that when people moved out they seldom changed their party affiliation but they supported more conservative issues That is the whole weakness of the trade union movement which has trouble organizing in suburban or exurban settings and which in the past had been a mainstay of the Democratic Party he said Gwinett County Ga near Atlanta and the area around Princeton NJ in the Northeast illustrate how demographic changes of underlying uniformity are unfolding in different regions according to the findings of the public planners national conference Mayor Barbara Boggs Sigmund of Princeton said at the conference that the intense development along 10 miles of Route 1 outside Princeton which she labeled centerless soulless and anticity had not much changed her college town of 12000 people But she said the growth was burdening the town with traffic and squeezing out lowincome people Poorer People Leaving The 1980 Census she said showed that 38 percent of the towns population not counting students had low to moderate income That is not true now she said explaining that higherincome people had been moving there in the last few years And she said in an interview that she feared poor people in the area who belonged to minority groups might be forced into the old central cities such as Philadelphia and Trenton as development spreads In Gwinett County there has been such a movement for several years Although no current census figures are available Paul B Kelman the county planning director said the black population now around 3 percent had historically been low for a Southern community but had undoubtedly been higher in past years While younger whites have moved in younger blacks have moved out mostly to Atlanta now about 66 percent black Census Bureau surveys confirm this tendency of the races and income levels to separate The central cities have lost whites and gained blacks and Hispanic and other minority group members who have usually had lower incomes Although this continues a curve dating from 1951 the new figures show that centercity renewals and the decline or reversal of population losses in the 1970s have not stemmed the loss of white residents Diversity of Issues in Area These trends mean candidates for state and Federal office will find conditions and issues vary perhaps as never before from area to area In Georgia candidates say they have to address the continued concentration of poor minority group members in Atlanta the problems of growth and prosperity in Gwinett County and the depression of agriculture in the rural counties beyond Similar contrasts exist in almost every state Because a change in party allegiance to the Republican Party is most easily achieved in the South where most Democrats are conservatives Republicans have focused there especially in the newgrowth areas such as Gwinett where many northern Republicans have been settling in recent years In 1980 Gwinett County was under the Democratic grassroots control that still exists in most areas of the South All county and municipal offices were occupied by Democrats But since then the county has experienced a 50 percent increase in population from 166903 to 251025 according to the estimates Many newcomers were highly paid professionals from other regions who favored the creation of a new Republican Party rather than the Democrats who while conservative tended to reflect the old rural values of the South according to officials of both parties New Role for the Party In 1984 the Republicans made virtually a clean sweep taking both local offices and legislative seats in Atlanta John D Gibb a businessman and the county Republican chairman said the party had since become a civic institution that sponsors charitable causes and provides meeting rooms for uses not connected with politics mirroring Mr Reagans interest in volunteerism The tier of counties around Atlanta has become increasingly influential and many thousands of Republican residents have settled in the area since 1980 The counties were crucial to the election of Senator Mack Mattingly a Republican who defeated the longtime Democratic Senator Herman Talmadge in 1980 Mr Mattingly is up for reelection this year in a race crucial to control of the Senate The Republican National Committee in a recent strategy paper said the partys longterm prospects in the South are being propelled by powerful demographic and economic forces The GOP benefits from an influx of young professionals and retirees the paper said and from the rapid expansion of the suburbs in the various growth centers such as Charlotte NC or Austin Tex Gain of 10 Seats Projected The paper pointed out that population projections show the Southern states might gain as many as 10 seats in the House of Representatives after the 1990 Census There is no reason the paper said to expect these newcomers to differ from their predecessors young welleducated prosperous and Republican Democrats are also shaping their appeal to young voters but Democrats assert that these voters are not monolithic but spread across the spectrum of income and racial groups Mayor Sigmund a Democrat said she believed that those younger families moving into the Princeton area might turn out to be moderate Democrats The Democrats contend there is division in the 25 to 44yearold age bracket on social issues Many of them especially in the South the Democrats say back Mr Reagan on opposition to abortion renewal of official prayer in the schools and state protection of religion But this group is less enthusiastic about reducing Federal programs Many prospering young professionals also agree with Mr Reagan on reducing Government regulation but are opposed to his stands on abortion school prayer and protection of religion Since 1980 the two groups have largely voted together but Democrats are betting that when Mr Reagan retires no other political figure will be able to keep the coalition together BIGGEST GAINS BIGGEST LOSSES Counties of over 100000 that had

CUOMO AND AIDE TO O'CONNOR CLASH OVER ABORTION DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/06/nyregion/cuomo-and-aide-to-o-connor-clash-over-abortion-dissent.html,Governor Cuomo and the Vicar General of the Archdiocese of New York traded strong words yesterday over the responsibility of a Roman Catholic to adhere to church teaching particularly on the question of abortion The Vicar General Bishop Joseph T OKeefe declared that Mr Cuomo was so smart he would confuse young people and said under no circumstances would I invite him to speak to young people at a graduation Ive known the Bishop for a long time Mr Cuomo responded I respect him now and I always will Regrettably I do not agree with him Their exchange was prompted by a directive issued earlier from the Archdiocese to all pastors that bars those who disagree with church teaching from speaking in parishes In an interview Thursday the Governor warned that the policy could lead to restraint of intellectual activity and said we lay people have a right to be heard Speech at Notre Dame Yesterday the Governor urged the Vicar General to read a speech he delivered in 1984 at the University of Notre Dame in which Mr Cuomo laid out his position as a public official in support of the nations abortion law and his private position as a Catholic against abortion The Vicar General scoffed at the speech saying thats the encyclical by Mario In response to a question the Bishop said that the Governor who is considering a race for the 1988 Democratic Presidential nomination could be acting politically He might be trying to distance himself from the official teaching of the church because his Catholicism will be an issue as it has been in the past The Governor responded What I said in Notre Dame I repeat I would no more distance myself from my Catholicism than the Bishop would The comments yesterday came in three telephone interviews with the Governor in Albany and four with the Vicar General in New York City Mr Cuomo then called Bishop OKeefe directly The directive barring certain speakers was issued by the Vicar General second in command to John Cardinal OConnor and applied to all 410 parishes in the archdiocese which includes Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and seven counties north of New York City The Vicar General warned pastors to exercise great care and prudence in extending invitations to speakers whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the church The exchange between the two men yesterday was more impassioned and more personal  than the debate in 1984 between Mr Cuomo and Archbishop John J OConnor who became a cardinal about a year later The OConnorCuomo debate which also focused on the responsibility of a Catholic public official to enunciate church teaching came during the 1984 Presidential campaign Mr Cuomo emerged as a spokesman not only for himself but also for Geraldine A Ferraro the Democratic Vice Presidential nominee who is also a Catholic In his Notre Dame speech delivered on Sept 13 1984 Mr Cuomo said that Catholics should practice their religion by setting an example for other Americans not by seeking to pass laws that impose their views on the rest of the country Cardinal OConnor responded that such a position was internally inconsistent as well as inconsistent with Catholic teaching and he challenged Catholic lawmakers to overturn through legislation the 1973 Supreme Court decision that permitted abortion The exchange also comes at a time when the Vatican is clamping down on dissent in the American Catholic Church Last month the Vatican said that the Rev Charles E Curran could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington In another action against a church liberal the Vatican recently ordered Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle to turn over authority to his auxiliary bishop in five areas including birth control and homosexuality The actions against the Washington priest and the Seattle archbishop both of them liberals on social and sexual issues were considered unusual but not unprecedented Cardinal OConnor declined to comment yesterday on the exchange between the Vicar General and the Governor beyond saying that he found the Governors remarks surprising When first questioned Wednesday about his directive on who may speak in Catholic churches Bishop OKeefe said he did not have Mr Cuomo in mind I never even thought of the Governor he said Yesterday however after he read newspaper accounts of Mr Cuomos attack on his policy the Vicar General sounded angry He is way out on a limb now he said of the Governor The Bishop said he objected to Mr Cuomos charge that the church did not make efforts to consult with the laity Bishop OKeefe said that through parish councils and committees the church did reach out to the laity There are however certain issues about which the laity may not argue he said Nobody he said not myself or the Cardinal or the Pope himself will take a position against the authentic teaching of the Catholic Church on abortion At that point in the conversation Bishop OKeefe said that he would not allow the Governor to speak before a graduating class at the church that the bishop heads Saint John the Evangelist which is part of the Catholic Center at 1011 First Avenue near 56th Street In the separate conversations Mr Cuomo appeared pained by the confrontation It is not pleasant he said adding I believe in the long run the honest exchange of opinion will eventually produce more enlightenment The Governor noted that the Pope and the United States bishops have long taken a position against capital punishment It is a position that the Governor shares but is opposed by many of his political opponents who favor the death penalty Does that mean that the righttolifers and the Republicans including President Reagan cant be invited to speak in a church he said It wasnt until late yesterday that the Vicar General and the Governor spoke with each other In recounting the conversation to a reporter they emphasized different points The Governor said that the Bishop did not accuse him of violating church teaching The Bishop did not deny that statement but said he told the Governor that he was guilty of confusing the issues by talking about capital punishment birth control and abortion as if they are the same
CLERIC PRAYS FOR DEATH PENALTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/06/nyregion/cleric-prays-for-death-penalty.html,Delegates to the New York City Patrolmens Benevolent Association convention luncheon at the Concord Hotel in the Catskills Thursday applauded when the union endorsed Governor Cuomo for reelection despite his opposition to the death penalty But they cheered louder for a Police Department chaplains invocation before the meal After asking Gods blessing on Mayor Koch the Roman Catholic chaplain Msgr John Kowsky said And for our Governor just one little thing hes gotta do Lord learn to turn the switch The Mayor and the Governor who both spoke at the luncheon were late because fog delayed their helicopters landing and missed the invocation Mr Cuomo learned of it only yesterday a spokesman Gary Fryer said but had no comment Monsignor Kowsky who is assigned to St Josephs Chapel at Gateway Plaza in Battery Park City was making pastoral calls yesterday and could not be reached for comment But a spokesman for the New York archdiocese Msgr Peter G Finn said Monsignor Kowskys support of the death penalty did not violate church teachings The position of the United States bishops as well as the bishops of the State of New York is in opposition to capital punishment as the way to solve the problems of crime he said But that is not the universal position of the church binding against all persons as is the case for instance with Catholic teachings on abortion

"IN QUEENS, CITY SCANDAL IS MINOR ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/nyregion/in-queens-city-scandal-is-minor-issue.html,The citys corruption scandal may have toppled the Queens Borough President and rocked the Queens Democratic organization but it certainly was not the first thing brought up by questioners at the Macedonia AME Church in Flushing on a recent night The occasion was a debate between Claire Shulman and Lois Marbach the candidates in the Democratic primary for Queens Borough President on Tuesday Mrs Shulman was Deputy Borough President under the late Donald R Manes After he resigned last February amid accusations that he was involved in bribery she was chosen by the City Council delegation from Queens to succeed him until Dec 31 and she is now seeking to serve the remaining three years of his term Ms Marbach a Reform Democratic activist who has never held public office is trying to oust Mrs Shulman from Borough Hall Victory in the primary is considered tantamount to election Korean Groups Quiz Candidates Two hundred KoreanAmericans from the ethnically diverse area watched representatives of their civic groups question the candidates in a packed meeting room at the church The session was more than half over before a query finally touched on the municipal scandal Earlier questions had involved such issues as rising rents facing merchants and the need for improved services for the growing KoreanAmerican community in Queens As the boroughs primary races near an end the revelations that led to Mr Maness resignation as Borough President and Queens Democratic leader appear for the most part to be having little effect on the races party officials and other political observers in the borough said One reason some said is that other issues are of more immediate concern to many Queens voters The scandal is one of the concerns but not as much as commercial rent control or other issues said Sook Nam Jenny Choo a lawyer and community activist who was the moderator of the ShulmanMarbach forum Race in Far Rockaway A similar perspective was offered by civic leaders after a debate in Far Rockaway among the four candidates for the Sixth Congressional District seat in southern Queens At the debate which was held at the Gustave Hartman YMYWHA there were inquiries about the candidates stands on matters such as abortion and the problems facing the Rockaways before a questioner finally asked how the four would restore the effectiveness of Democratic congressmen in the wake of the scandal The candidates  Alton R Waldon Jr the Rev Floyd H Flake Simeon Golar and Hulbert James Sr  appeared before about 300 people roughly divided between blacks and whites reflecting the districts racial mix Edward L Sadowsky a former City Councilman from Queens had another explanation for what he called the nondiscernible effect of the scandal on the boroughs primaries Perception of Corruptions Limits I dont believe the popular perception is that the corruption was pervasive he said I believe people are prepared to look at it as limited to Manes Mrs Shulman has not been implicated in illegalities or misconduct but one Councilman from Queens said the reasons she was considered the heavy favorite in the Borough Pesident race go beyond that The Councilman Morton Povman cited the 60yearold Mrs Shulmans appearance  a nice motherly figure  and political luck I think shes fortunate that Lois Marbach doesnt have the money to mount a vociferous campaign he said The 40yearold Ms Marbach a dentaloffice manager acknowledged that insufficient funds had hampered her campaign in which one of her themes is that Mrs Shulman should have known about corruption in Queens But Ms Marbach said the voters she encountered agreed with her and wanted a clean sweep at Borough Hall Mrs Shulman who said she did not know of any wrongdoing because she was concentrating on governmental matters while Deputy Borough President said it doesnt appear at this time that the scandal is a significant issue Issues Dividing Candidates The candidates also disagree on such issues as commercial rent control Ms Marbach favors it and Mrs Shulman opposes it and on the domed stadium planned for northern Queens Ms Marbach opposes it and Mrs Shulman favors it if a professional football team is secured by the end of the year The Republican candidate Estelle Cooper has no primary opponent In the Sixth Congressional District Mr Golar sought to use the scandal issue during the Far Rockaway debate Five years ago I spoke out against the ugliness of the corruption of the Manes machine he said adding that the Queens party machine has endorsed Mr Waldon Mr Waldon in an interview said To characterize me as an extension of the machine Manes ran in Queens is inaccurate That machine ceased existing last winter he said while his endorsement in May was by a county organization which conducted a very democratic and wideopen process Mr Waldon will hold the congressional seat until the end of this year having narrowly defeated Mr Flake in a special election in June held after the death of the districts longtime representative Joseph P Addabbo Mr Waldon and Mr Flake are widely considered the frontrunners in the current race As an exception to the general trend some politicians cite the experience of Alan Gershuny a longtime political associate of Mr Manes and his executive assistant at Borough Hall In July Mr Gershuny dropped his planned primary challenge to Leonard P Stavisky the Democratic incumbent in the 12th State Senate District in northern Queens partly Mr Gershuny said because Mr Stavisky was stressing Mr Gershunys tie to Mr Manes Mr Gershuny has not been implicated in the scandal and has said he was unaware of any improprieties Mr Stavisky who now has no opposition said I never mentioned Maness name But he acknowledged I indicated my opponent was the political operator at Borough Hall
SUBTLE CONTRAST IN CONNECTICUT G.O.P. CANDIDATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/nyregion/subtle-contrast-in-connecticut-gop-candidates.html,In the final days of campaigning before their primary election on Tuesday the three Republican candidates for governor have sharpened some of their differences on issues Except for a few clearcut differences on issues such as abortion and the death penalty many of the disagreements that have emerged among the three Republicans have been more subtle than substantive The three candidates  former State Senators Richard C Bozzuto and Gerald Labriola and State Representative Julie D Belaga  have mostly stressed their differences with the Democratic administration of Gov William A ONeill rather than with one another All have promised to support the primary winner in the general election on Nov 4 While generally avoiding personal attacks on Mr ONeill all three Republicans have promised stronger leadership in the states government As seen by them the ONeill administration is lackluster is dominated by politicians rather than professional managers and reacts to problems rather than planning for them According to the candidates their differences have not always been apparent because of the restrictive formats of the debates in which they have engaged We do have a lot of differences but they dont always come through when you have one minute to give your position on education or drugs Mr Bozzuto said Different Stands Different Issues Dr Labriola a Naugatuck pediatrician has called himself more conservative than Mr Bozzuto who owns an insurance agency in Waterbury or Mrs Belaga a 10year veteran of the Legislature from Westport The Labriola campaign commercials describe him as the only consistent conservative in the race Dr Labriola said he would support a state law making abortions illegal if the states were allowed to regulate abortions Mr Bozzuto and Mrs Belaga said they support a womans right to abortion On capital punishment Dr Labriola said he would expand the states current death penalty law to include murder committed during a rape or arson Mrs Belaga said she supports the death penalty for multiple murders and the murder of a police officer Mr Bozzuto said he opposed the death penalty and favored alternatives such as life imprisonment without parole Most of the candidates recent debates have been dominated by discussions of state taxes and transportation issues All Oppose Income Tax All three Republicans oppose enactment of a state personal income tax as does Mr ONeill With the states current economic prosperity Dr Labriola has called for 175 million in tax cuts including a reduction in the state sales tax to 7 percent from 75 percent Mrs Belaga said she would repeal the states current succession or inheritance tax which she called a hardship on the elderly and would seek to reduce the state tax on interest and dividend income Mr Bozzuto said his priority would be to cut the states current tax of 4 percent on residential utility bills but he cautioned that tax cuts might not be possible with the states recent commitments to increased spending for programs such as state aid to local school districts With Connecticut embarked on a 10year rebuilding of its roads and bridges Mr Bozzuto has called for a suspension of new construction work not directly related to safety needs and a reassessment to better plan the rebuilding program without disrupting traffic Mrs Belaga and Dr Labriola said they disagreed with Mr Bozzutos proposed moratorium Mrs Belaga said she would increase the fines for overweight trucks Dr Labriola proposed mandatory random drug testing of truck drivers
PRIEST AIDS HISPANIC COMMUNITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/nyregion/priest-aids-hispanic-community.html,THE Rev Francis McQuade traveled to the Dominican Republic several years ago when he was in the seminary to improve his Spanish at the request of his bishop Once I was down there I not only learned Spanish I grew to admire and love the Latin culture he said I was sent to live with a very poor family What I saw made me commit myself to working with the Latin community Today Father McQuade known to his largely Hispanic parishioners at St Hugh of Lincoln Roman Catholic Church in Huntington Station as Father Francisco finds himself a middleman between the problems of the Hispanic community of Long Island and the affluent suburban culture in which it is immersed He and others on Long Island struggle particularly to assist the troubled and often troubling undocumented population of aliens who have entered the United States without permission and have not sought permanentresidence status Of the approximately 120000 Hispanic people living on Long Island about a third are illegals according to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties But despite the problems the Hispanic population is rapidly becoming a substantial political and economic force on Long Island Father McQude and others agree The developing Latin community is exciting to see he said It is growing by leaps and bounds and will impact voting patterns marketing social services and educational needs We have to encourage the towns and counties to prepare for the increasing numbers and to defuse the prejudices When the Latins first came here there was a lot of prejudice and its still about the same Hispanic people first came to the Island from Puerto Rico Mexico and the Dominican Republic Many worked in construction during the development of the Route 110 industrial corridor or worked as domestics in wealthy North Shore homes Others went to Riverhead as seasonal laborers on East End farms They came to Port Jefferson Station to fill out maintenance and cleaning crews at the State University of New York at Stony Brook They came to communities such as Brentwood and Holbrook to do piece work in clothing or electronics factories They came to Glen Cove and Rockville Centre to work in hotels and restaurants Today many come from Nicaragua El Salvador and Chile countries torn by revolution sometimes to avoid political persecution Earlier this summer a number of of illegal aliens were arrested at several factories in Suffolk County and transported to a Federal detention center in Louisiana to await hearings on whether they should be deported or permitted to return to Long Island A number of Father McQuades parishioners do not speak English and are unfamiliar with the workings of American society The families with a structure based on the unquestioned authority of the male head of the household are constantly challenged by the new values and institutions around them creating family tensions Probably his toughest job Father McQuade said is to help the Hispanic people retain the parts of their culture that he believes are special while helping them discard those values that have no place here His sermons delivered in Spanish in the Spanish chapel actually the cafeteria of St Hughs exhort those listening to go out in the local community and challenge drug dealers oppose abortion and maintain a strong family Father McQuade also lobbies public agencies and legislative groups including the Suffolk County Legislature to win aid for Long Islands Hispanic population added that the Spanish mass at St Hughs is a very very important part of her life Many of the Hispanic people in Huntington Station are the second generation to live in that area While their parents were often laborers many of the children have become professionals They worked in construction And with the proximity to the estates in the area there was quick work for landscapers and domestics Father McQuade said Now theyre engineers and accountants and they are going to college But large numbers of Hispanic people and many of the 500 Hispanic families in St Hughs 4000family parish have failed to make the transition to the middle class Father McQuade spent three and a half years after he was ordained working in Brentwood with Long Islands largest Hispanic community He came to St Hughs two years ago on a fiveyear assignment I will be working with Spanish parishes probably my whole career he said Im needed and I like it His style seems to suit the Hispanic community in the parish Attendance at the Sunday Spanish mass has grown from 60 to 75 people a week to about 250 including a choir that sings hymns in Spanish accompanied by guitar maracas bongos and the clapping of hands But all is not as positive in Huntington Station and other communities where Hispanic people have settled where those who have trouble finding jobs or getting paid enough to survive struggle to support their families and to keep from being deported They compete for housing with other minority groups They struggle against those Hispanic people who have turned to drugs to make money Father McQuade and members of the Hispanic community have worked with the police in the area to put pressure on drug dealers Last spring he and members of Long Islands Hispanic population took to the streets While he carried a sixfoot cross the group stopped at 14 stations including the local Long Island Rail Road station where Father McQuade made a speech welcoming the illegals The group also stopped outside a local bar that he called a popular hangout for drug dealers where they prayed for the dealers Father McQuade also mobilized parish members to go to Criminal Court every day during the trials of 24 Puerto Ricans arrested in Huntington Station on charges of dealing drugs The Hispanic community pressed for stiff sentences for the accused who received terms of up to three to six years The Puerto Rican community sent letters saying that they were ashamed of these people Father McQuade said We have also indicated that we do not want to see easy paroles granted for them The group also sent letters to those convicted after they started serving their terms offering to pray for them and to help with their rehabilitation Father McQuade said he has received no response to the letters Last year acting with other Long Island Hispanic leaders Father McQuade testified at a public hearing before the Suffolk Legislature in support of a bill to prevent local agencies from asking whether people seeking county services are illegal aliens or not The bill was passed and signed into law The only exception is for illegals who must tell the police of their status when they seek help Father McQuade said he has also struggled with the male and female roles in Latin families and parents frustrated by children who want to live their lives Americanstyle without rigid rules My No 1 agenda item is to shatter the stereotypes that North Americans have of Hispanics and Hispanics have of themselves he said Aldo Bravo a member of St Hughs parish council and a leader in the Hispanic community said that Father McQuade has been instrumental in developing a sense of pride and belonging for the Hispanics in the parish Mr Bravo added that the strong involvement of the Hispanic community is valuable to the church We are used to the church having a greater degree of influence on the lives and politics of our countries he said We live the church rather than just attending church on weekends For Efraina Gonzalez who leads the Latin choir the Spanish mass is more than spiritual direction  we hear an announcement for jobs for voter registration or whatever else is happening she said But to Msgr Alfred Suoave the pastor of St Hughs the issue of a separate Hispanic community is a delicate one We are trying to bring all of our parishoners together to become an integrated unified part of the community he said Father McQuade said that his role at St Hughs has been a major learning experience in his life But he added I wouldnt mind if the time comes when there is no need for a Spanish ministry Until that time according to Mr Bravo Hispanic people need to play a more direct role in the direction of the parish and of Long Island society The next step is to run our own destiny he said As members of the parish we need to contribute not only time and money but ideas Thats the next step
AROUND THE NATION; Miami Archbishop Offers Absolution for Abortions,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/us/around-the-nation-miami-archbishop-offers-absolution-for-abortions.html,Archbishop Edward A McCarthy of Miami has issued a pastoral letter offering absolution to people who have had abortions or assisted in performing them The proposal to give priests the power to absolve or forgive those who have participated in an abortion is part of a wideranging jubilee plan to coincide with a 1987 visit by Pope John Paul II to southern Florida The Archbishop was unavailable for comment on the letter which he issued Friday but his Auxiliary Bishop Augustin A Roman told The Miami Herald that the move was unusual and quite important The Archdiocese of Miami includes Dade Broward and Monroe counties an area with 11 million Roman Catholics The letter said the Archbishop hoped the move would prompt inactive Catholics to return to the church
THE REGION; Cuomo Clashes With Archdiocese,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/07/weekinreview/the-region-cuomo-clashes-with-archdiocese.html,The Vicar General of the Archdiocese of New York named no names recently when he directed parish priests to bar speakers who disagreed with official Roman Catholic teachings But Governor Cuomo a Roman Catholic who has been at odds with leaders of the archdiocese apparently felt compelled last week to try on the shoe If it fit it pinched In a rapidly escalating exchange of increasingly personal comments on the directive and its implications the Governor referred to the order as a restraint of intellectual activity and declared we lay people have a right to be heard The Vicar General Bishop Joseph T OKeefe said the directive was issued in response to a lay groups request for guidelines Bishop OKeefe who is second in command to John Cardinal OConnor said that in writing the guidelines he never even thought of the Governor whose support of legal abortion has led to public disagreements with Cardinal OConnor But within days another archdiocesan spokesman Msgr Peter G Finn said Mr Cuomos comments were nonsense Then Bishop OKeefe ridiculed the Governors stand on abortion as the encyclical by Mario saying Mr Cuomo might be trying to distance himself from the official teaching of the church because his Catholicism will be an issue if he decides to run for President The Governor responded I would no more distance myself from Catholicism than the Bishop would The directive that started it all sent Aug 18 to the pastors the 410 parishes in the archdiocese came amid a wider Vatican clampdown on dissenting views in the American church In the directive Bishop OKeefe wrote that it was inappropriate unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite the individuals to speak whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the church Cardinal OConnor did not comment on the exchange except to say that he found the Governors comments surprising

O'CONNER BACKS A CURB ON DISSENTING SPEAKERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/08/nyregion/o-conner-backs-a-curb-on-dissenting-speakers.html,John Cardinal OConnor defended yesterday a directive by his Vicar General that parish speakers be screened according to their beliefs saying it was common sense not to invite people who would attack the church to appear before Roman Catholic audiences The Cardinal in his first comments on the directive joined a discussion with Governor Cuomo that began when the Vicar General Bishop Joseph T OKeefe instructed parish priests that people who disagree with the clear unambiguous teaching of the church not be invited to speak at parish events People get confused Cardinal OConnor said when someone whos well known for disagreeing with the church in a substantive matter not in an insignificant matter is given a platform Later yesterday Governor Cuomo who had sent an aide to record the Cardinals news conference which followed a 10 AM mass at St Patricks Cathedral said the directive would be confusing to put into effect because of the murky question of what constitutes church teaching Cuomo Cites Death Penalty Views In remarks after his appearance on the WCBSTV program Newsmakers and in a subsequent telephone interview from the Governors Mansion in Albany Mr Cuomo argued that the directive could be applied to those who favored the death penalty as well as those who support the availability of abortions or the use of birth control With the Pope and the American bishops opposed to the death penalty the Governor argued unwelcome speakers at parish events could include President Reagan Mayor Koch and Andrew P ORourke the Republican candidate for governor They will say abortion is more grave the Governor said referring to church leaders particularly Bishop OKeefe But all three are church teachings No Reference to Cuomo The directive did not refer specifically to Mr Cuomo a Roman Catholic who personally opposes abortion and birth control but who insists that it is his task as governor to enforce existing laws Governor Cuomo also opposes capital punishment and has consistently vetoed legislation that would restore the death penalty in New York State Mr ORourke has made a campaign issue of the Governors opposition The directive does not spell out what elements of church teaching must be supported by parish speakers Cardinal OConnor pointed to the directives latitude but also to its implied focus on abortion The Cardinal said It would be a matter of judgment whether an individual in a given set of circumstances expressed views which were so contradictory to the church on abortion or any other matter that it would create scandal The churchs support or seeming support perceived support of a speaker who was explicitly supporting abortion  that would be a scandal I think It wouldnt matter who it would be  a political figure or anyone else Gravity of Issues Last week Bishop OKeefe said the Governor was confusing the issues by talking about capital punishment birth control and abortion as if they were the same Mr Cuomo yesterday agreed that in the eyes of the church the three were not exactly the same in terms of gravity Nevertheless the Governor said he had consulted over the weekend with theologians including the Rev Richard McBrien at the University of Notre Dame and been assured that all involved church teaching Bishop OKeefes directive comes at a time when the Vatican is clamping down on dissent in the American Catholic Church Last month the Vatican said that the Rev Charles E Curran could no longer teach theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington because of his stands on birth control abortion and other issues Similarly the Vatican has limited the authority of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle Yesterday the Governor and the Cardinal were asked if the directive and other recent actions by the church improperly curtailed freedom of speech Both said it did not Distinction Acknowledged Mr Cuomo made a clear distinction between a democratic society where free speech is a cherished right and the Catholic Church where there is no presumption of shared authority The Catholic Church is not a democracy the way society is Mr Cuomo said and I have no objection to that The Cardinal made an analogy to a television reporter who criticized the management of his station during a broadcast The reporter would probably lose his job the Cardinal said but nobody would consider it a violation of free speech it would be considered a violation of common sense Mr Cuomo described his latest contretemps with the archdiocese as kind of overblown but nevertheless seemed to encourage its continuation Noting that he receives hundreds of letters every time he speaks out on religious issues the Governor said The whole society is sensitive to this People are afraid of churchstate involvement and people are right Its a dangerous business
A PARISH BANS ASSEMBLYMAN FROM SPEAKING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/09/nyregion/a-parish-bans-assemblyman-from-speaking.html,Since his birth 46 years ago Assemblyman John C Dearie has been a member of St Raymonds Roman Catholic parish in the Bronx attending its school before going off to the University of Notre Dame and eventually watching his two children baptized in the parish But this summer the Assemblyman said in an interview yesterday he was taken aside by the pastor and told that on orders from John Cardinal OConnor he would not be permitted to speak at parishsponsored events because although he opposes abortions he had voted this year and in previous years to allow Medicaid funds to be used for them Mr Dearie said that the ban had been in effect since June but that he was talking about it now because of comments by Governor Cuomo in recent days critical of church policy that prohibits those who oppose church teaching from speaking at parishsponsored events Describing himself as a seriously practicing Catholic the Assemblyman said he was upset that his parish  I used to play basketball there as a kid  no longer considered him eligible to do all he would like to do there The archdiocese he added was acting in anticipation of the elections to try to defeat candidates who do not vote the way the church would like Cardinal OConnor said through a spokesman yesterday that he had not ordered the parish to bar Mr Dearie from speaking and that he was sorry if an overzealous aide had done so But the Cardinal fell short of saying that the Assemblyman should be allowed to speak at the parish The spokesman Msgr Peter G Finn said it was for individual parish pastors to make that decision by drawing on the archdioceses guidelines adding that the guidelines speak for themselves The guidelines say it is unacceptable for those who disagree with the churchs teachings to speak at parishsponsored events They were not formally promulgated until last month but since earlier in the year the Vatican has been clamping down on dissent in the American church The ban on Mr Dearie came in June when he was invited to speak before a communion breakfast I was told the pastor of St Raymonds Msgr Henry J Vier said yesterday that the Cardinal thought it was out of order for us to have invited him to our communion breakfast Mr Dearie was eventually allowed to speak at the breakfast But Monsignor Vier said he had been instructed by an aide to the Cardinal the Rev Christopher Maloney to make a statement afterward and to make clear that the Assemblyman would not be allowed to speak again Monsignor Finn yesterday declined to make Father Maloney available for comment It Was Required of Me I got up at the end of the breakfast said Monsignor Vier who baptized the Dearie children and told the audience that I had instructions from the Cardinals house to say that the Cardinal did not want any public official to speak before a Catholic gathering if that official favored public funding of abortions I accepted the decision and agreed with it he said It wasnt a pleasant duty I didnt like the idea of having to do it But it was required of me This is a difficult issue for me the Assemblyman said of abortion and allowing Medicaid funds to be used for it I have two young children a 3 12 and a 2yearold I went to Catholic school Catholic high school Notre Dame The positions of the church are very very important to me But if I dont keep an open mind and evaluate my own positions he continued I wouldnt be a very good legislator Mr Dearie said he had received notes and phone calls from parishioners including those who oppose abortion In varying degrees he added they said they were offended by the message that if you disagree with the church on this particular issue they slam the door in your face Doing His Job Monsignor Vier said he too had received reaction from parishioners I think they were surprised he said But I dont think anybody said the Cardinal was wrong Assemblyman Dearie who spoke softly and sounded deflated said he bore no grudge toward the Monsignor He said in fact he felt simpatico with him He was doing his job I have no problem with the Cardinal the Bishops he continued I have no problem with them strongly reinforcing at every opportunity their position on this issue Thats their job But there are so many other issues  the homeless housing senior citizens  that to simply close the door as a result of one vote  To lock the door  in effect cut off the communication and the honest evaluation of a legislator trying to make a decision on this very difficult issue it seems to me in the long and short run is not good policy Mr Dearie an Assemblyman since 1973 said if he had been a member of the Legislature when it legalized abortion in the state  an action taken before the United States Supreme Court made it legal nationwide  he might have voted against it And he said that in general he voted conservatively on abortion matters For example he voted this year in favor of requiring parents to be notified when a minor had an abortion As for his vote in favor of using Medicaid funds for abortions Mr Dearie said that because abortions were legal the poor were entitled to money to pay for them In the final analysis its my feeling that it aint my decision to make he said If there are females who feel that it is what under their overall circumstances they want to do and should do and the law permits them to do well   
O'ROURKE FAULTS CUOMO FOR ATTACKS ON CHURCH BAN AGAINST DISSENTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/09/nyregion/o-rourke-faults-cuomo-for-attacks-on-church-ban-against-dissenters.html,Andrew P ORourke the Republican gubernatorial candidate yesterday criticized Governor Cuomo for taking issue with the policy of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York on dissident speakers saying If he doesnt want to be a Catholic he shouldnt be one Mr ORourke  who as with Mr Cuomo is Roman Catholic  accused the Governor of picking fights with the church because his polls tell him to do so to distance himself from the church Mr ORourke made his comments amid a series of interviews with officials who are Roman Catholic and who were asked for their thoughts on the policy Mr Cuomo is taking issue with an archdiocese directive that prohibits those who disagree with the churchs teachings particularly on abortion from speaking at parishsponsored events Raising a question of restraint of intellectual activity Mr Cuomo  who says that he is personally against abortion but that as Governor he has to adhere to its legality  doubted the directive could be enforced What you have Mr ORourke said referring to Mr Cuomos position on abortion is another attempt by Cuomo to weasel around all the time Hes wearing sackcloth and ashes to Sunday church then goes off and declares hes pro choice In fact Mr ORourkes position on abortion is the same as Mr Cuomos in that he says he personally opposes it but that as Governor he would uphold its legality Asked how he could make such an attack on Mr Cuomo Mr ORourke said he was specifically referring to the use of Medicaid funds for abortions which he opposes and the Governor supports Asked whether as Governor he would apply the teachings of the church to government policy Mr ORourke said You dont consult the church on issues In response a spokesman for the Cuomo campaign Gary Fryer said only that Mr ORourkes remarks are typically tasteless and typically unworthy of response Among the other officials commenting yesterday was Representative Guy V Molinari Republican of Staten Island who said he had no problem with the churchs policy a view echoed by State Senator John J Marchi another Staten Island Republican A Clever Move My initial reaction Mr Molinari said was why would the Governor want to get into yet another confrontation with the Catholic church and its hierarchy But after giving it some thought I see it as a clever move to distance himself from the Catholic church and set himself up for national office Distancing himself from the church might help him in other parts of the nation The Representative said that in travels around the country he had encountered similar policies to the one by the New York Archdiocese The president of the Board of Education Robert F Wagner Jr said he certainly thought the Cardinal and the Vicar General have the right to set church policy But in my view he added the new policy is a mistake There should be more open dialogue in the church A host of key Catholic officeholders declined to talk on the record about the policy including Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts Representative Charles B Rangel of Manhattan and Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan of New York all Democrats Mr Moynihan told the story of a parish priest who with the slip of a pen once called him a practical rather than a practicing Catholic As a practical Catholic the Senator said with a sly grin I have made it my business not to know so much about Catholic doctrine that I know when I am in error A host of current and former officeholders who are Catholics did not return messages yesterday seeking their comments on the issue They included Senator Alfonse M DAmato a Republican former Gov Hugh L Carey a Democrat Geraldine A Ferraro the 1984 Democratic candidate for Vice President and Representative Mario Biaggi Democrat of the Bronx In Brooklyn a spokesman for the diocese Frank DeRosa said no thought had been given to withdrawing an invitation to Governor Cuomo to deliver a major lecture at St James Cathedral the seat of the Brooklyn Diocese on Oct 2 The diocese is not part of the Archdiocese of New York Mr Cuomo will inaugurate the Peter Turner Forum a lecture series by distinguished Catholic laymen at the church in the Fort Greene section His topic is Those Who Love the World Catholics and the Commonweal Neither the Brooklyn Diocese nor the Rockville Centre Diocese on Long Island which covers Nassau and Suffolk Counties have written policies similar to the one that sparked the debate between Mr Cuomo and the archdiocese
CAREY SUPPORTS BAN BY CHURCH AGAINST DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/nyregion/carey-supports-ban-by-church-against-dissent.html,Saying this is not a time to separate from the church former Gov Hugh L Carey yesterday expressed support for a directive by the Roman Catholic archdiocese of New York that prohibits those who disagree with church teaching from speaking at parishsupported events He added Theres a clear responsibility of Catholics in public office to find alternatives to abortion The comments came in an interview in which Mr Carey was asked his reaction to the directive which Governor Cuomo has criticized Mr Carey along with several other Catholic officeholders and former officeholders had been telephoned for comment Monday but he did not return the call until yesterday Youve got to realize that youre talking about speeches on church premises said Mr Carey who picked Mr Cuomo as his secretary of state and later as lieutenant governor It seems to me its appropriate for the church to say that speakers should be in accord with our teaching He said the churchs efforts were clearly aimed at speakers who do not follow its teachings against abortion adding The church is becoming more stringent for church people on the issue of abortion and Im entirely in accord with the church Questions on Death Penalty The archdiocese has argued that Catholic officials should apply the teachings of the church to public policy But Governor Cuomo a Roman Catholic has spoken out against that He has said that he opposes abortion but that as Governor he must uphold the law which allows it Mr Cuomo argues that if the church is going to ban speakers who do not follow its abortion teachings it should also ban those who support the death penalty which is also contrary to the church position Mr Carey without mentioning the Governor said yesterday that to try to draw a comparison between the teaching of the Catholic Church on capital punishment and abortion is out of proportion He said fewer than a thousand executions were carried out each year while were talking about millions of abortions Mr Carey said he thought the latest Supreme Court ruling on abortion which upheld a womans right to have one was confusing He noted that Chief Justice Warren E Burger said the court was going too far in liberalizing abortion laws If I see confusion in the court Mr Carey said I am right to turn to the church and say Mother Church what do you say How do you guide me today  As Governor Mr Carey did not oppose the use of Medicaid funds for abortions and he did not seek a constitutional amendment to outlaw abortions Asked about that he said I now find a very different legal tangle Once again he cited the comments by Chief Justice Burger
LIFE IN THE 30'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/10/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,MY favorite news story so far this year was the one saying that in England scientists are working on a way to allow men to have babies Id buy tickets to that Id be happy to stand next to any man I know in one of those labor rooms the size of a Volkswagen trunk and whisper No dear you dont really need the Demerol just relax and do your secondstage breathing It puts me in mind of an old angry feminist slogan If men got pregnant abortion would be a sacrament I think this is specious If men got pregnant there would be safe reliable methods of birth control Theyd be inexpensive too I can almost hear some of you out there thinking that I do not like men This isnt true I have been married for some years to a man and I hope that someday our two sons will grow up to be men All three of my brothers are men as is my father Some of my best friends are men It is simply that I think women are superior to men There Ive said it This is my dirty little secret Were not supposed to say it because in the old days men used to say that women were superior What they meant was that we were too wonderful to enter courtrooms enjoy sex or worry our minds about money Obviously this is not what I mean at all The other day a very wise friend of mine asked Have you ever noticed that what passes as a terrific man would only be an adequate woman A Roman candle went off in my head she was absolutely right What I expect from my male friends is that they are polite and clean What I expect from my female friends is unconditional love the ability to finish my sentences for me when I am sobbing a complete and total willingness to pour their hearts out to me as well as the ability to tell me why the meat thermometer isnt supposed to touch the bone The inherent superiority of women came to mind just the other day when I was reading about sanitation workers New York City has finally hired women to pick up the garbage which makes sense to me since as Ive discovered a good bit of being a woman consists of picking up garbage There was a story about the hiring of these female sanitation workers and I was struck by the fact that I could have written that story without ever leaving my living room  a reflection not upon the quality of the reporting but the predictability of the male sanitation workers responses The story started by describing the event and then the two women who were just your average working women trying to make a buck and get by There was something about all the maneuvering that had to take place before they could be hired and then there were the obligatory quotes from male sanitation workers about how women were incapable of doing the job They were similiar to quotes I have read over the years suggesting that women are not fit to be rabbis combat soldiers astronauts firefighters judges ironworkers and President of the United States Chief among them was a comment from one sanitation worker who said that it just wasnt our kind of job that women were cut out to do dishes and men were cut out to do yard work As a woman who has done dishes yard work and tossed a fair number of Hefty bags I was peeved more so because I would fight for the right of any laidoff sanitation man to work for example at the giftwrap counter at Macys even though any woman knows that men are hormonally incapable of wrapping packages or tying bows I simply cant think of any jobs any more that women cant do Come to think of it I cant think of any job women dont do I know lots of men who are fulltime lawyers doctors editors and the like And I know lots of women who are fulltime lawyers and parttime interior decorators pastry chefs algebra teachers and garbage slingers Women are the glue that holds our daytoday world together Maybe the sanitation workers who talk about the sex division of duties are talking about girls just like the girls that married dear old dad Their day is done Now lots of women know that if they dont carry the garbage bag to the curb its not going to get carried out either because theyre single or their husband is working a second job or hes staying at the office until midnight or he just left them I keep hearing that theres a new breed of men out there who dont talk about helping a woman as though theyre doing you a favor and who do seriously consider leaving the office if a child comes down with a fever at school rather than assuming that you will leave yours But from what Ive seen there arent enough of these men to qualify as a breed only as a subgroup This all sounds angry it is After a lifetime spent with winds of sexual change buffeting me this way and that it still makes me angry to read the same dumb quotes with the same dumb stereotypes that I was reading when I was 18 It makes me angry to realize that after so much change very little is different It makes me angry to think that these two female sanitation workers will spend their days doing a job most of their coworkers think they cant handle and then they will go home and do another job most of their coworkers dont want

CUOMO AND THE CHURCH: SOME VEXING QUESTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/11/nyregion/cuomo-and-the-church-some-vexing-questions.html,It is accepted political wisdom that there is little advantage for a public official to get into a fight with the church particularly the Archdiocese of New York It is not surprising then that Governor Cuomo has found preciously few allies among fellow Roman Catholic politicians in his confrontation with the archdiocese over a new church policy on parish speakers The vexing question is why the Governor engaged the archdiocese in the debate The churchs policy on speakers was initially not directed at him so why did he challenge it And why did the archdiocese respond to his criticism in such an angry manner It is probably easier to understand the position of the archdiocese than what is behind the Governors thinking Under the leadership of Pope John Paul II the church  from the Vatican to the local parish has made putting an end to abortion its No 1 priority As Auxiliary Bishop Joseph T OKeefe of the New York Archdiocese sees it Mr Cuomos nuanced view on abortion would tend to confuse the faithful rather than help clarify the issue for them Governor Cuomo is against abortion Personally as a Catholic he regards it as does his church as murder But he argues that in a pluralistic society it is wrong to try to impose Catholic teaching on others As a result the Governor supports the 1973 Supreme Court decision that granted women the right to abortion He also supports the New York State legislation that provides Medicaid funds for abortion on the ground that the right must be available equitably to both the rich and the poor Those who know Mr Cuomo as a Catholic say his position is not one of political convenience but a wellthoughtout theological stand arrived at after much soulsearching The Governor is as serious about his Catholic faith as any Catholic politician I know said the Rev Richard P McBrien head of the theology department at the University of Notre Dame It is for this reason he suggested that the Governor criticized the archdiocese on the issue of outside speakers He finds it hard to pass over because he has a real stake in his church he said The directive that is at the center of the controversy was sent last month by Bishop OKeefe to all 410 parishes in the archdiocese It warned pastors not to invite as speakers those whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the church A Right to Be Heard Governor Cuomo immediately criticized the policy saying that it could lead to restraint of intellectual activity He declared We lay people have a right to be heard A different explanation for the Governors position came from Bishop OKeefe who is second in command to John Cardinal OConnor Mr Cuomo who has been frequently mentioned as a contender for the White House might be distancing himself from the official teaching of the church out of fear that his Catholicism will be an issue the bishop said in an interview But Peter Steinfels editor of Commonweal an independent journal published by Catholic laity asserted that there was little political advantage for anyone in the dispute Everybody is going to be a loser he said The church is going to lose because there is a growing antagonism between it and educated Catholics And from Cuomos point of view while there might be some gains in the short run in the long run it gives him an aura of being at odds with ones own church which is not politically reassuring What is interesting about the debate is that the substance of Mr Cuomos position is not at all unusual Virtually every Catholic politician has the same position  they are opposed to abortion but they uphold the law But many of them  including former Gov Hugh L Carey and Andrew P ORourke the Republican candidate for governor have distanced themselves from Governor Cuomo Others including New Yorks two Senators Daniel Patrick Moynihan and Alfonse M DAmato have been silent on the issue A Theological Framework What is unusual about Mr Cuomos position  and what irks church officials  is that he has articulated it in a theological framework What the archdiocese is really saying is Cuomo we dont want you to talk about the church with any authority  said Eugene Kennedy a writer who follows Catholic affairs What Cuomo is saying is I am an adult Catholic and I have the right to reflect on theology I was taught to do that  Mr Cuomo learned those lessons Mr Kennedy added from a Catholic education that included a parochial high school and St Johns University as well as from later being a student of the Second Vatican Council The council which 20 years ago greatly liberalized the Catholic Church expanded the idea of the church from a heirarchy of bishops to a community of bishops priests and lay people It is this perception of the church that Mr Cuomo emphasizes in thinking through his position on abortion We are the church all of us together he said in a recent interview It is unfair he continued to make abortion the one and only test of Catholic orthodoxy He noted for example that the Pope and the United States bishops have spoken out time and again against capital punishment Yet those who favor the death penalty are not treated like pariahs Not Comparable Issues It on this point that Bishop OKeefe in a separate interview expressed anger accusing the Governor of confusing the issues of capital punishment and abortion They are not comparable he maintained Opposition to abortion has a special place in Catholic teaching Abortion is one of the few sins for which a Roman Catholic is automatically excommunicated even murder does not carry this penalty If the problem then is with Mr Cuomos theological integrity the attack on him follows logically on the heels of recent Vatican actions taken against church officials who in the opinion of the Vatican have strayed Among these have been the Rev Charles E Curran who was told by the Vatican that he could no longer teach theology at Catholic University in Washington and Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle whose powers as archbishop were significantly curtailed by the Vatican Both are liberals whose views on sexual matters particularly abortion came under fire Father McBrien of Notre Dame added another factor to explain why the New York Archdiocese responded sharply to Mr Cuomo although Father McBriens reasoning was quickly attacked by the spokesman for the archdiocese Msgr Peter G Finn who labeled it nonsense People have a right to ask why it is Cuomo and not someone with an Irish name said Father McBrien who says that because his father is Irish and his mother is Italian he is an impartial observer of the longtime ethnic tensions between the two groups Why he said are the searchlights on Governor Cuomo who happens to be Italian and were never put on Governor Carey who not only had the same agenda but married outside the church
LETTERS ON BAN BY PARISH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/nyregion/letters-on-ban-by-parish.html,Assemblyman John C Dearie a Bronx Democrat said yesterday that he had received 610 letters and telephone calls in response to his being banned by his Roman Catholic parish St Raymonds from speaking at parish functions because he voted to allow Medicaid funds to be used for abortions Here is a sampling from some of the letters 1986 or 1686 Have politician hunts replaced witch hunts Whats next at the stake  From a woman in Westchester If the church is looking to increase its support why has it adopted such a polarizing and alienating policy  From a man on Staten Island Is Cardinal OConnor wrong because he wishes to keep his parishes free from the Dearies of the world The Bronx Assemblyman should be forbidden at any religious function until he reconsiders his views on Medicaid funding for abortion If a child of mine was to seek an abortion the first thing I would give her is a oneway bus ticket to Sodom  From a woman in Manhattan Cardinal OConnor vs Assemblyman Dearie My spiritual leader will always get my vote God bless you Cardinal OConnor Ill pray for you John  From a man in Westchester If we allow the church to lobby the government on a slew of different social issues and yet disallow those same government representatives with mildly dissenting views to address a churchrelated function on those same social issues then we have reached a very dangerous state censorhip and persecution by the church Under such circumstances how far is the church from trying Dearie under canon law  From a man in the Bronx
CARDINAL ASSAILS CRITICS ON LIMITS FOR SPEAKERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/12/nyregion/cardinal-assails-critics-on-limits-for-speakers.html,John Cardinal OConnor asking how much further are the nonsensical allegations going to go on yesterday condemned critics of an archiocesan policy that probibits those who disagree with church teachings from speaking at parishsponsored events Criticizing those who are making an indoor sport out of attacks on the Pope and the church the Cardinal in a statement added that a great number of opponents of the guidelines know very little about the church and have never lifted a finger to support the church The Cardinal has also written to Assemblyman John C Dearie Democrat of the Bronx calling deeply insulting his comments that the church was trying to influence the outcome of this years election by barring speakers I really dont have the stomach to take on here and now what I see as a gross exploitation of the churchs acting within her province the Cardinal said in his broader statement his first extensive and written comments on the matter Column in Church Newspaper He did not cite any critic by name But his comments published yesterday in his weekly column in the archdiocesan newspaper Catholic New York came after a week in which several Catholic officeholders  in particular Governor Cuomo  took issue with the guidelines They were promulgated last month by the Vicar General of the archdiocese Bishop Joseph T OKeefe Asked for comment the Governor issued a brief statement last night The Cardinal has allowed me to speak at St Patricks Cathedral He has not sought to stifle me and has made clear Bishop OKeefes guideline is not intended to either I am grateful The guidelines leave it to individual parish pastors to decide who should be invited to speak at an event But they make clear that it is unacceptable to invite someone who differs with church teaching and archdiocese officials said they were especially aimed at opponents of the churchs positions on abortion In an unusually long and strongly worded column the Cardinal wrote What is all the furor about What is the nonsense I read about squelching free speech Where is the deep dark sinister political motivation that some choose to see When did common sense or a sense of appropriateness become unconstitutional or unAmerican Where are those who demand free speech in our Catholic schools when it comes to paying for those schools In my experience some of the strongest proponents of what they consider to be free speech are the strongest opponents of any kind of tax breaks or governmental support for parents who choose their own version of free speech when they pay to send their children to Catholic schools At another point the Cardinal wrote Would the selfappointed champions of free speech care to sue those TV networks that refused to run paid commercials for our archdiocesan Come Home at Christmas and Come Home at Easter campaigns In defending the guidelines on speakers he asked Are we to have a church in which everyones judgment is equal to everyone elses Thats not a church its chaos Saying that it would send a confusing signal to Catholics to allow dissident speakers at parish events the Cardinal added Common sense dictates that you keep the fox out of the chicken coop He asserted that the policy of the archdiocese did not prevent Catholics from being exposed to dissenting views because such views were routinely made available through television and other media Letter to Dearie In another development yesterday it was learned that the Cardinal had written to Assemblyman Dearie who has been banned from speaking at his Bronx parish St Raymonds because he voted to allow Medicaid funds to be used for abortions Mr Dearie said earlier this week that he had been banned at the direction of the Cardinal and he accused the archdiocese of cracking down on speakers in an effort to influence the outcome of this years elections In a terse threeparagraph letter dated Sept 9 a copy of which was obtained yesterday by The New York Times the Cardinal wrote to Mr Dearie that his statement is grossly untrue deeply insulting and morally libelous Msgr Henry J Vier the pastor of St Raymonds said earlier this week that he had been asked by the Rev Christopher Maloney an aide to the Cardinal to issue the ban on Mr Dearie At the time the Cardinal responded through a spokesman that he was sorry if an overzealous aide had ordered Mr Dearie banned from speaking at parish events But the letter contained no similar indication of contrition The Cardinal said only that it was categorically untrue that he personally had ordered the ban The 46yearold Mr Dearie who has been an active member of St Raymonds parish virtually all his life said that in the past week his office received 610 letters and phone calls 85 percent of them favorable to him expressing outrage and shock at the ban On Wednesday Mr Cuomo said I feel sorry about John Dearie  its a touching touching story

Who May Speak to Catholics,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/13/opinion/who-may-speak-to-catholics.html,Once again New Yorks Governor Cuomo and John Cardinal OConnor are locked in dubious battle Ostensibly it concerns a directive that the parishes of the New York Archdiocese not invite speakers who disagree with church teachings Actually it is a renewal of their argument about how fervently Catholics in public office must oppose abortion The directive issued last month by Vicar General Bishop Joseph OKeefe advises pastors that it is unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to give a church forum to someone whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the Church Bishop OKeefe says he wasnt thinking of Mr Cuomo who accepts the churchs teaching on abortion for himself but feels bound as Governor to defend the legal right of women to choose abortion Mr Cuomo felt himself a target nonetheless Many Catholic politicians have similarly distinguished their personal acceptance of church teaching on abortion from their public obligation to respect and defend the rights of Americans to decide on abortion for themselves The Cardinal may believe that this distinction trivializes religious belief turning into a merely advisory opinion what should be a strongly felt imperative to guide action Mr Cuomo has been particularly vocal in addressing this dilemma of Catholic politicians How can they swear to uphold the law and the rights of others when as with abortion those rights contradict Catholic teaching In his jousts with the Cardinal he asks in effect Does the Cardinal know a better way to bridge this dilemma than by distinguishing between personal conviction and official duty The archdiocese has every right to invite the speakers it wants Mr Cuomos protest that lay Catholics have a right to be heard in church forums is a question for canon not civil law The Cardinal also has every democratic right to try to influence politicians politically But that invites a democratic and negative effect Voters may well reject Catholic candidates rather than risk electing someone who puts religious conviction ahead of political tolerance And some Catholic politicians may rebel in resentment The first to be sanctioned under the directive seems to be John Dearie a Democratic Assemblyman from the Bronx He says he was told by the pastor of the parish he has belonged to all his life that he could no longer speak at parish events The reason he has voted to permit the use of Medicaid funds to pay for abortions Im a very close vote on this Mr Dearie says He personally opposes abortion and finds it difficult to disagree with church leaders he respects And then for them to slam the door put up the wall    its so counterproductive totally counterproductive Whether it is counterproductive for the church is for the church to decide Whether it is wise politics the voters will decide
RABBIS INVITE BISHOP TO ADDRESS CONGREGATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/13/nyregion/rabbis-invite-bishop-to-address-congregation.html,Three Orthodox rabbis praising Bishop Joseph T OKeefe for his criticism of Governor Cuomos stand on abortion invited the bishop yesterday to speak before an Orthodox congregation on the subject of family values including abortion The unusual invitation  and the Bishops acceptance  came at a news conference at the Catholic Center at 1011 First Avenue at 55th Street after the rabbis met privately with John Cardinal OConnor The delegation was led by Rabbi Yehuda Levin who ran for mayor last year on the Right to Life ticket An official of the Union of Orthodox Jewish Congregations which represents 1200 synagogues across the country said that the three rabbis do not speak for the Orthodox community but for a small Brooklyn congregation that is quite activist on this question Sympathy for Cuomos Stand The official Rabbi Pinchas Stolper said that most Orthodox Jews were closer to Governor Cuomos position than to that of the Archdiocese The Governor has drawn a distinction between his personal belief as a Catholic against abortion and his responsibility as Governor to equitably enforce the law that permits abortion We are not necessarily committed to imposing our views on American society Rabbi Stolper said We do not feel obligated to impose our view on abortion on others any more than we demand nonJews to observe the Sabbath Rabbi Stolper said he did not oppose inviting a Roman Catholic leader to speak in a synagogue although such an invitation is unusual As a rule the Orthodox do not engage in theological dialogue with Christians although they do meet on political and social issues Moreover it is rare for any Christian clergyman to be invited to address an Orthodox congregation Governor Criticized The three rabbis at the news conference used the opportunity to attack Mr Cuomo for his support for Medicaid funding of abortions Last week Bishop OKeefe who as Vicar General of the Archdiocese is second in command to the Cardinal criticized the Governor for confusing people on abortion The Bishop also said that he would not allow the Governor to speak to a group of young people at his parish St John the Evangelist which is part of the Catholic Center The Bishop expanded his ban yesterday saying the Governor would not be allowed to speak to anyone in his church because the Governor was operating outside church teaching The rabbis who joined Rabbi Levin were Rabbi William Handler who said he was from a Brooklynbased organization called Jews for Morality and Rabbi Yoseph Friedman who said he represented Congregation Bais Yisroel in the Flatbush section of Brooklyn All three responded no when asked if Governor Cuomo would be welcome to address their congregation The rabbis said they hoped Bishop OKeefe would speak at Congregation Bais Yisroel  a synagogue in the ground floor of a private home at 1821 Ocean Parkway  between now and Rosh haShanah the Jewish New Year which this year is on Oct 4 and 5
IDEAS & TRENDS; O'Connor Defends Order on Speakers,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-o-connor-defends-order-on-speakers.html,The debate between Governor Cuomo and the Archdiocese of New York continued last week as John Cardinal OConnor supported an order barring from parish events speakers who disagree with Catholic teachings Shielding parishioners from those who verbally attack the church is common sense Cardinal OConnor said People get confused when someone whos well known for disagreeing with the church   is given a platform Earlier this summer Bishop Joseph T OKeefe directed parish priests to ban speakers who oppose the clear unambiguous teaching of the church Mr Cuomo a Catholic referred to the order as a restraint of intellectual activity While the Governor personally supports Catholic opposition to abortion he believes he must uphold laws on such matters The Archdiocesan order came at a time when the church is brooking little dissent Recently the Vatican told the Rev Charles E Curran to stop teaching theology at Catholic University in Washington and curtailed the powers of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle Both men hold liberal views on abortion In New York Assemblyman John C Dearie whose position on abortion is similar to Mr Cuomos said last week that his priest had told him he would no longer be allowed to address his own parish in the Bronx Meanwhile Andrew P ORourke the Republican gubernatorial candidate accused the Governor of picking fights with the church because his polls tell him to do so Bishop OKeefe has accused Mr Cuomo of distancing himself from the church in case he decides to run for President But the Governor argues that in a pluralistic society it is wrong to try to impose Catholic teaching on others
"NEW JERSEY OPINION;
CLEAR DRUG-TESTING POLICY IS NEEDED",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-clear-drugtesting-policy-is-needed.html,UNDER what conditions if any should your employer be permitted to test you for drug abuse Sooner or later most of us in New Jersey will directly confront this question In the last two years the sale of drugtesting equipment and technical support has increased dramatically in our state Some of our largest private and public employers have already begun drugtesting programs for their employees and experts say the number of employers will continue to increase in the next few years This proliferation is occurring without any uniform statewide policy and without any real protections for employers or employees Our state courts have reached inconsistent conclusions about the constitutionality of certain types of employee drug testing our statutes provide no guidance to employers about their rights or obligations when they test employees our departmental regulations offer no standards of accuracy or fairness for employee drug tests Not surprisingly there is a great deal of confusion about who can test and how tests can be conducted Mayors department heads store owners and plant managers want to know if they can require drug tests of their workers and on what basis We need a policy to end this uncertainty and provide equal treatment for all workers The realities of the drugtesting issue were vividly illustrated last month by two distant but related events In southern New Jersey local law enforcement officials broke a drugtrafficking ring that allegedly involved workers and contractors at a chemical plant The bust resulted partly from information provided by the employer who was concerned about the possibility of drug use at the plant At the same time a Federal district judge ordered the city of Plainfield to reinstate public employees who had been released following a surprise drug test last May The judge declared that no matter how important the war against crime and drugs constitutional rights must not be sacrificed to win those battles These two incidents illustrate the paradox of drug testing On the one hand employee drug tests could significantly reduce drug problems in our workforce Through testing we could curb the flow of illegal drugs in our state limit the damage of drug abuse to our economy protect the safety of the public and begin rehabilitating people who need help On the other hand employee drug tests could violate our basic notions of individual rights and fairness On any basis they will not mesh easily with our deeply held convictions about personal privacy and community trust Testing that treats people unfairly will also create more problems than it solves In drug testing then we face both an opportunity and a threat How then can we strike the right balance between the need to stop drug abuse and the need to protect individual rights The first step is recognition of the problems we face One problem posed by the drug test itself is the possibility of false positives when innocent individuals are falsely accused of illegal drug abuse because of shortcomings in the test procedure False positives are more than an inconvenience they jeopardize the careers and reputations of workers and lead to lawsuits against employers Both management and labor will lose if tests and labs continue to develop an unacceptable number of erroneous test results Thus standards should be set to prevent inaccurate tests from being used Another problem is that drug testing can disrupt employeremployee relations Testing particularly when done with unreliable methods or in an unfair way creates tensions between labor and management Many employers are determined to impose random and routine testing on employees while many workers are willing to bring production or service to a halt over testing on that basis All of us will be hurt if such confrontations occur too frequently A basis for fair testing therefore should be defined as soon as possible Finally there is the problem of drug abuse in the workplace Drug abuse by employees can no longer be ignored It reduces efficiency and productivity lessens the quality of goods and services and increases risks to the public posed by unsafe operating procedures and poor workmanship Crack and other especially dangerous drugs are ruining individual lives and the lives of families Fortunately the public recognizes the complexity of these problems and the need for action Most of us perceive that drug abuse in the workplace endangers our businesses our neighborhoods our schools and our roadways Most of us do not want a universal ban on testing Yet many of us also recognize the need to protect individuals from the misuse of tests We do not want to see drug tests used as weapons against workers We are not prepared to give employers public or private an unrestricted license to test There appears to be a consensus that will support a policy that allows accurate fair and effective testing when testing is genuinely needed This month the Legislature began considering legislation that attempts to meet these criteria Asssembly Bill 2850 which we sponsor jointly would authorize statewide drug testing standards and define the conditions under which tests may be conducted Under this legislation the Department of Labor could regulate tests within the public and private sectors by setting standards for the acquisition of samples the handling of samples the methodology of the test the margins of error associated with the test and the type of personnel conducting the tests It would also permit random or routine tests on job applicants but would limit tests for employees to cases where the employer had reasonable suspicion of drug use Finally it would allow the collective bargaining process to set higher standards for testing or to prohibit testing altogether for employees covered by the collective bargaining agreement This legislation would give New Jersey the basic outline of a policy that could be further developed by experts in the executive branch in business and in labor And by bringing the key questions of the issue before the Legislature now the courts will be given legislative guidance about drugtesting in New Jerseys workplace Without a uniform statewide policy employers and employees will continue to be confused about their rights and responsibilities Without a legislative statement the courts will continue to reach inconsistent if not contradictory decisions about the use of employee drug tests Enactment of A2850 would not of course resolve every dispute about drug testing Once the executive branch and the courts began imposing a uniform policy in the workplace the losers in the early battles would bring their appeals to higher courts and the Legislature just as they have on such other issues as abortion busing school prayer and housing Nevertheless it is no longer too early for the Legislature to address this issue In conjunction with officials in the executive and judicial branches and representatives of business and labor our elected officials can make a choice about what kind of policy is needed to make New Jersey a better place in which to work and live
MURDER ON LONG ISLAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/magazine/murder-on-long-island.html,THERE ARE THOSE WHO BELIEVE Cheryl Pierson and those who do not those who contend she is a helpless victim and those who say she belongs in jail Less than a year ago Cheryl was a popular cheerleader at Newfield High School in Selden LI She was studying to become a beautician Today at 17 a demure brunette she is out on bail awaiting trial for murder  charged with having hired someone to kill her father James Pierson because she says he sexually abused her Though reported instances of the abuse of children by their parents have risen in this decade for many in our society incest remains the unspeakable often inarticulable taboo The Pierson case juxtaposes Cheryls word against the silence of her father and Cheryls allegation has polarized the townspeople of Selden as well as what remains of her small family Of course I believe her says James Pierson Jr Cheryls 20yearold brother How could she make something like that up Nobody can tell me that my son did this to his daughter says Virginia Pierson Cheryls grandmother Nobody If Mother Mary came and told me he did this Id say Mother Mary I cant believe you  When Cheryls case goes to court tomorrow in Riverhead it is expected to provide an important test of what constitutes grounds for justifiable homicide Paul Gianelli Cheryls attorney will argue that because Cheryl was a victim of incest and rape her plot to have her father killed was an act of selfdefense The success of his argument will hinge on the jurys accepting that Cheryls emotional stress prevented her from seeing any other way out an approach to the legal theory of selfdefense that feminists have lobbied for successfully in recent years but that in July was called into question by a decision in New Yorks highest court People ask me why I didnt ask for help says Cheryl I didnt because no one would have believed me And even if they had what could they have done My brother does not belong in the ground says Marilyn Adams Cheryls aunt who would like to see her niece in jail She could have told someone Who does she think she is    God THE MORNING OF LAST FEB 5 WAS ICY IN Selden a middleclass town in central Long Island 50 miles from New York Shortly after 6 AM James Pierson a burly 42yearold electrician put on his jeans and redandblack hunting jacket and walked down the hall of his woodshingled home His daughter Cheryl had been late to school the day before so he checked to make sure she was awake His other daughter JoAnn 8 was still asleep He opened the door off the kitchen the way he always did before work Apparently no one heard the shots but seconds later on this quiet stretch of modest singlefamily homes with frostcovered swing sets and aboveground pools Mr Pierson lay dead A week later Sean Pica who sat next to Cheryl in their high school homeroom because their last names both begin with P was arrested for murder Police say Sean now 17 the son of a former New York City policeman agreed to kill Cheryls father for a fee after the teenagers became intrigued with a newspaper article about a woman who had hired someone to kill her husband According to police Sean hid behind a tree and shot James Pierson five times with a 22caliber rifle he had bought in Queens Cheryl never told Sean why she wanted him to kill her father Police say she had never told them her family her friends her neighbors or anyone else who might have helped The only person in whom she had confided was her boyfriend Robert Cuccio an 18yearold college freshman He too is the son of a former New York City policeman At Cheryls request police say Rob paid Sean 400 Last month in a threehour interview conducted around the kitchen table in the home of a neighbor with whom she currently lives Cheryl spoke about her relationship with her father and the events leading to the murder Dressed in a white cotton jumpsuit she alternately wept looked down at the table and laughed nervously as she spoke Sean who along with Cheryl faces a seconddegree murder charge was interviewed as well however at his lawyers request he did not answer questions about his alleged involvement in the crime Previously published reports of Seans confession to detectives parallel the account given by Cheryl but Martin I Efman Seans attorney will seek to have the confession suppressed on the grounds that it was coerced At trial Mr Efman says he will contend that Sean is innocent and that there is no direct evidence linking Sean to the killing The murder weapon has never been found Robs parents Tina and Robert Cuccio did not permit their son to be questioned While Rob has not been officially indicted he has retained an attorney George Hughes and a charge of conspiracy to commit murder is pending against him Cheryls sister JoAnn now 9 who currently lives with her aunt and grandmother also was not permitted to be interviewed JAMES PIERSON HAD lived in Selden since he was a teenager He graduated from Newfield High School in 1962 and three years later married Cathleen Adams a petite brunette from the neighboring town of Northport He was a union electrician and had a side business installing cable television boxes in private homes He had a knack for making money according to many of those who knew him and providing for his family seemed the focus of his entire life James and Cathleen Pierson lived in a wellkept comfortable home and eventually had three children James Jr who is three years older than Cheryl who is eight years older than JoAnn Mr Pierson was a strict disciplinarian His children were trained at an early age to be silent when adults walked into the room to help with housework and always to say thank you He never beat his children according to those interviewed but if he disliked the way they spoke or worse what they said he would threaten to smack them across the face When they obeyed him he rewarded them with gifts That he was a gruff foulmouthed man with an aggressive macho style no one would dispute nor that he was also generous and loyal He was the kind of man whose bark was worse than his bite says Arthur Giove who owns the funeral home in Selden and knew Mr Pierson well He would raise his voice and the next minute he had his arm around you To the outside world there was little to distinguish the Piersons from many other bluecollar families Mr Pierson coached the local Little League where his son played He and his wife went bowling Thursday nights at the lanes in Centereach His children rode dirt bikes around the neighborhood They ate dinners at home and argued about whether to watch sports or soap operas on television Then in 1979 Cathleen Pierson was diagnosed as having a rare and terminal kidney disease and abruptly the rhythm of family life changed Suddenly there were biweekly trips to the hospital for dialysis repeated visits to doctors and agonizing waits for two kidney transplants Increasingly Cheryl  who was 10 when her mother fell ill  was called upon to help with household chores and care for her infant sister She also increasingly spent more time with her father Cheryl says the sexual abuse began when she was about 11 Initially during the lonely period when her mother was in the hospital she welcomed her fathers attentions as a sign of affection When my mother got sick I felt no one was paying attention to me Cheryl says My father started paying attention to me At first I was really happy because until then I didnt think he knew I existed The two of them would fall asleep together in his bedroom watching television under the covers There was a point  she does not remember exactly when when she realized her fathers advances were wrong but she permitted him to continue in part because she was afraid in part because she did not want to burden her mother with additional pain in part because her father had told her no one would believe her Cheryl says that for the last two years of his life her father had forced her to engage in sexual intercourse with him When she finally threatened to tell someone she says her father told her she would regret it I thought Id just live through it I guess Cheryl says If Id say no and start to cry hed get very nasty toward the whole house So a lot of times I did it to make everyone else happy To keep peace in the house Cheryl says she loved her father and could not understand how he could be at once so generous to her and yet so cruel Hed come back from visiting my mother she says He used to be so upset sitting there at the hospital Then hed come home and do that to me I didnt understand if he loved my mother so much how he was just    I dont know    what Cathleen Pierson died on Feb 13 1985 It was a sad and difficult time Mr Pierson confided in friends that however much he loved his wife in his grief he also felt anger at her for having abandoned him with the children Their son who by this time had graduated from high school and moved out of the house was distraught The little girl was confused and Cheryl who says there had long been tension between herself and her mother was perpetually wracked with guilt I loved my mother more than I think she knew she says Cheryls 16th birthday came three months after Mrs Piersons death As he had long planned with his wife Mr Pierson threw his daughter a lavish party at a nearby catering hall She wore a white offtheshoulder jumpsuit and there was a big pinkandwhite cake which the two of them cut together The disk jockey put on the 50s classic Sixteen Candles and silence fell over the dance floor as Cheryl and her father circled the room When they were done there was a round of applause But at the end of the evening when the band played the song again Cheryl danced with Robert Cuccio then a senior at Newfield Continued on Page 62 High School whom Cheryl had met some months before at a square dance in gym class Robert was Cheryls first serious boyfriend She says he helped her come to terms with the death of her mother They talked all the time on the telephone They gave each other presents at their lockers in school Initially Mr Pierson had not allowed the two of them to go out alone He had wanted to get to know the boy first Rob was permitted only to stop by the house after school Occasionally he accompanied the family bowling But eventually Mr Pierson gave in and let Cheryl go out on weekend dates with Rob provided she was home by 11 PM I thought he went overboard says Robert Cucciothe young mans father who was a police officer and detective for 12 years in the 43d Precinct in the Bronx But my impression was the guy had just lost his wife and he was protecting his two little girls According to Cheryl the more time she spent with Rob the more she was concerned about what might be happening to her younger sister at home She would come home and find JoAnn watching television under the covers with her father or wrestling with him on the couch I worried about it all the time Cheryl says I remembered how it started like that with me In the weeks prior to the murder Cheryl considered telling someone about her father Every day in school she would pass the Time Out Room a lounge set aside at Newfield High for students to confer with faculty advisers about problems that cannot be discussed at home Sometimes Cheryl would look inside and see a teacher there she did not like Looking in at other times she says she would simply feel hopeless She was both embarrassed to come forward and convinced no one would believe her But what she feared most was that the school would contact her father She would think back to movies she had seen on television about incest and how every one ended the same way  with the father leaving home for a period of time but always coming back She would remember what her father had said If she told anyone she would regret it In early November Cheryl arrived at school to find a number of students Sean Pica among them talking about a murder that had been reported in the newspapers A woman in nearby Mastic had paid 4000 to have her husband killed because she said he had physically abused her In her confession Cheryl said I asked Sean Who would be crazy enough to do that He said he could kill someone if the money was right I asked him how much money and he said 1000 I told him I knew someone who might be interested A couple of days later I told him it was me Until then Cheryl says the thought of hiring someone to kill her father hadnt occurred to her Why Sean who was an aspiring Eagle Scout who had a steady girlfriend who was planning to represent his high school at a carpentry competition upstate would have become entangled in an alleged murder plot remains a mystery His parents were divorced in 1979 Sebastian Pica Seans father says that he is totally at a loss Seans mother Joanne DelVecchio with whom he was living at the time of his arrest declined to be questioned Sometime between Thanksgiving and Christmas Cheryl recalls Sean called to tell her that he had thrown a brick through the window of the house that Mr Pierson owned across the street from the Pierson house He had hoped to set off a burglar alarm he said and attack Mr Pierson when he came out to investigate He told Cheryl the alarm had not gone off but that he wanted to try again I told him just to forget about it Cheryl says He kept saying he was going to do it But like he didnt do it right and I didnt want to be bothered She told him her brother was going to help her On Christmas Eve Cheryl her father and her sister were invited to the Cuccios home for dinner It was the first time Mr Pierson and the Cuccios had met and according to Mr and Mrs Cuccio it was a festive occasion Mrs Cuccio says she was surprised by Mr Piersons gruff language but Mr Cuccio says he respected the mans take me as I am style Except for the fact that Cheryl was quieter than usual  which Mr and Mrs Cuccio attributed to nerves  they detected nothing wrong The next day  Christmas  Mr Pierson his daughters and son were invited to the home of Marilyn Adams Mr Piersons sister It was the first Christmas since Mr Piersons wife had died and the first since Mrs Adams had been divorced from her husband John who was Cathleen Piersons brother Emotions ran high and according to Mrs Adams Mr Pierson got into an argument with her and threatened to leave At one point Cheryl says while her father and her aunt reconciled in the kitchen she found herself alone in the living room with her brother  Whats the matter You dont look right  Cheryl recalls his having said She complained then about her fathers interference in her relationship with Rob but she said nothing about her fathers alleged sexual advances I like wanted to tell him but I just didnt she says She did however tell her brother about Sean and asked him to help Jim Pierson says that he did not take his sister seriously and thought her anger would pass Everyone feels like killing their parents sometimes says Jim an aspiring rock musician I thought she was mad because he wouldnt let her out on New Years Eve When he finally let her out I said See it all worked out  He dismissed what his sister told him about Sean So according to Cheryl did Rob Cuccio  Like someone who you dont even know in your high school is going to do it  Cheryl says paraphrasing Robs reaction to the news that she had hired someone to kill her father Previously Cheryl says she had told Rob of her molestation and the police have charged that Rob too approached Cheryls brother for help in hiring a killer January 4 was James Piersons 42d birthday and Cheryl gave her father a bottle of cologne some razor blades and a razor She baked a cake and that morning called WBLI to have the disk jockey wish Mr Pierson a happy birthday on the air as he drove to work She was the lucky caller and Mr Pierson won two free dinners to El Toritos a Mexican restaurant nearby He never used them The days preceding Mr Piersons murder blur in Cheryls mind What is sure she says is that she did not get her period on schedule and that her father was concerned Its all your fault she says she told him She says that her father panicked at the thought of her pregnancy and began frantically looking into where she could get an abortion Cheryl does not know whom he called or whether he ever scheduled an appointment At this point Cheryl says she had told no one else about the possibility of her pregnancy The night of Feb 4 Newfield High School competed in basketball at another school As a cheerleader Cheryl was supposed to attend the game but according to her confession she spoke to Sean beforehand and he told her he was going to kill her father the next day She says she did not believe him Nervous however she called Rob  You know he says it all the time  Cheryl quotes Rob as having said  You havent talked about it with him in over a month Just blow it off Just go and cheer  That is what she did After the game her father came to pick her up and drove her home Mrs Adams says she was waiting for the two of them that night because she had stopped by to deliver two stuffed animals that Mr Pierson was planning to surprise his daughters with on Valentines Day Cheryl was attentive to her father Mrs Adams says the way she always was When they walked in the door she recalls Cheryl went to the icebox and got her father a soda A PROFESSIONAL HIT was how police at first viewed the crime Their initial investigation turned up no obvious suspects James Piersons funeral was held on Feb 8 a cold and snowy Saturday About 150 people attended A priest read a eulogy that Cheryl had prepared with her brother Our dad    was strongwilled but softhearted it said in part He treated some people like a brother or sister and some people like a daughter or son    He was our best friend Witnesses say Cheryl kissed her fathers coffin and was inconsolable at his grave The next day according to Cheryl Sean called and asked her to meet him at Genoveses pizza place in town She and Rob drove over She says Sean told them he was not happy with the 400 she had removed from her fathers safe and given to him the day after the murder through Rob Sean asked for more money a motorcycle and permission to live in the house at which he had thrown the brick Cheryl says she told him she could not give him those things A few days later the police say they received a call from an unidentified student who told them that Cheryl had been looking for a hit man to kill her father She was brought to police headquarters in Yaphank where she confessed Medical tests while she was in custody revealed she was pregnant It was then for the first time that young Jim Pierson who had also been called in for questioning heard about his fathers alleged abuse of his sister It enraged him He has since taken an active role in his sisters defense Of the murder he says Im only sorry I didnt do it myself I MISS THE PART OF him that was a father says Cheryl The part of him that took me on his motorcycle Who did things with me that a father is supposed to do with a daughter That was the part of him I loved Whether Cheryl was or was not sexually abused by her father is a question that is expected to be a major issue at her trial There are those who say they suspected it all along but either were not certain or did not think it any of their business to pry Alberta Kosser the neighbor with whom Cheryl now lives remembers the day Cheryls sister rushed over and announced Cheryl slept with Daddy last night John Adams Cheryls uncle recalls the day at the 7Eleven when Mr Pierson put his arm around his daughter and grabbed her breast Diana Erbentraut a classmate says she was so convinced something was wrong at Cheryls home she told a guidance counselor at school but was told that Cheryl would have to come in herself But Mr Piersons mother his sister and many of his friends see things from a totally different perspective They believe Cheryl is lying and have other theories about why she might have wanted her father killed Money is one His estate is valued at 500000 His strict discipline at a time when she wanted to see more of her boyfriend is another A third is the pregnancy Five weeks after her arrest Cheryl had a miscarriage and laboratory tests revealed that the child was not her fathers Its impossible says Kenny Zimlinghaus Mr Piersons partner of the alleged abuse All I see is one girls allegation and no proof says William Praetorius Jr an insurance broker who also knew Mr Pierson well In a trial that is expected to attract national attention from womens groups the legal profession and others Edward C Jablonski chief of the Major Offense Bureau of the Suffolk County district attorneys office who will be prosecuting the case is expected to argue that there is no direct evidence that Cheryl was sexually abused by her father and that even if such evidence existed the real issue is that she should be punished for taking her fathers life Whether she was or wasnt abused has nothing to do with the fact that all she had to do was go to the police says Mr Jablonski Thats what theyre there for Cheryls attorney Mr Gianelli is expected to contend that Cheryl suffered the kind of trauma experienced by battered wives and others who undergo violence on a sustained basis Because of this she was in an extreme emotional state and could not see reasonable alternatives In New York defendants who claim to have killed in selfdefense must demonstrate that they believed the dangers they faced were lethal and imminent and that a reasonable man would have acted similarly Feminists have long argued that what a man may not perceive as lethal might in fact be seen that way by a woman and that the existing legal standard is geared more to a barroom brawl than the more sustained kind of violence to which women are more frequently subjected They argue that the test a jury should be asked to use is not what a reasonable man would do in a given situation but rather what would be reasonable from the unique perspective of the accused This position has been successfully argued in a number of cases in recent years involving battered women abused children victims of rape and other individuals The premise however was recently challenged in the celebrated case of Bernhard H Goetz who on a New York subway train in December 1984 shot four youths paralyzing one of them from the waist down because he said he feared he was about to be mugged On July 8 the New York State Court of Appeals in reinstating charges against Mr Goetz of attempted murder and assault declared that the standard for selfdefense remains that of what a reasonable man would do and not as had been argued by Mr Goetzs defense what had been reasonable specifically for Mr Goetz To completely exonerate such an individual the states Chief Judge Sol Wachtler wrote in the unanimous decision would allow citizens to set their own standards for the permissible use of force It would also allow a legally competent defendant suffering from delusions to kill or perform acts of violence with impunity contrary to fundamental principles of justice and criminal law The court however acknowledged that though the reasonable man rule should be the primary standard subjective considerations could not be wholly ruled out thus leaving room for Cheryls attorneys defense If Cheryl is convicted of seconddegree murder she faces a maximum prison term of 25 years to life Should the jury rule however that her act was precipitated by her beleaguered emotional state the charge could be reduced to manslaughter and in that case even if the verdict is guilty because Cheryl is under 18 Judge Harvey W Sherman would have the option to let her off with probation Youth credibility will also be at issue during Cheryls trial Social workers lawyers and psychologists often claim that society habitually presumes that children who claim they are abused are lying This presumption they argue often inhibits young people who need help from seeking it The problem is the system is unable to deal with abused adolescents says Dr Vincent J Fontana chairman of the Suffolk County and New York City commissions on child abuse When we deal with an adolescent who asks for help we always question whether it is a disciplinary matter or one of legitimate abuse Our history is not believing children says Meg ORegan executive director of the Center for Womens Rights in Mineola LI A lot of kids dont think the system will help them and theyre right Battered children are supposed to call the police but they know they will either not be believed or their lives will be completely disrupted T HESE ARE TROUbling times for many in Selden Some are wracked with guilt that they did not speak up sooner about their suspicions Some are so griefstricken they can only speak of revenge Still others do not speak at all The subject is too ugly too painful too raw I asked Cheryl why if her father was doing these horrible things to her she didnt kill him herself says Mrs Adams And do you know what she said She said How could I do that Aunt Marilyn I loved him  Whats so frightening is that we are all so normal said Karenanne Pica Seans stepmother There must be a reason this is happening to us But I dont know yet what it is I look at my own kids says Leonard Rosen a friend of Mr Piersons for many years If you cant trust them who can you trust And if it was going on    Its not for me to decide if its justified or not Its just very sad For everyone This is a tragedy It defies logic
THE QUESTION OF MARIO CUOMO,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/magazine/the-question-of-mario-cuomo.html,IN A SECONDFLOOR CORRIDOR of the pompous old gray granite statehouse in Albany hang the portraits of New Yorks Governors There are many men up there on the walls of course whose fingers wrote only faintly on the pages of history but what strikes the visitor who lingers for a moment is how many of the names remain familiar to this day Charles S Whitman Charles Poletti Nathan L Miller and even Herbert H Lehman may have been forgotten by most but they are the exceptions Because in the last century alone Grover Cleveland and Theodore Roosevelt and his cousin Franklin all moved from Albany to the White House and at least five others Charles Evans Hughes and Alfred E Smith and Thomas E Dewey and Averell Harriman and Nelson Rockefeller  waged serious campaigns for the Presidency So it is not surprising that Mario Matthew Cuomo the man who sits where they sat and where De Witt Clinton and Martin Van Buren sat too spends a lot of time answering questions about his Presidential aspirations  answering them much of the time with scarcely concealed impatience because he isnt sure he says whether he has any Last May when Mr Cuomo announced that he would seek another term this year he tried to head off the political chatter linking him with the White House by stating baldly I have decided to run for Governor I have no plans to run for the Presidency But when reporters pressed him as they have done ever since his emotional call to arms at the 1984 Democratic National Convention Mr Cuomo wouldnt be goaded into saying categorically that he wouldnt run Into his voice there crept a characteristic note of exasperated impatience verging on arrogant dismissal I dont want to lock the door against eventualities that I dont even understand or imagine Im not God If you have a crystal ball if you can tell me whats going to happen fine But I cant do it Coming from most politicians those comments and the hundreds of similar ones he has made before and since would have been taken as candidates code easily translated Something like this Of course Im interested in the Presidency but first I have to get reelected I cant get people to vote for me for Governor if they think Im going to spend all my time out of the state running for President Besides the best strategy may be to hang back for a while let the other candidates cut each other up then make my move a bit later Some politicians and pundits have in fact put exactly that construction on the Governors words They like to say that he is running for President by not running But that is not the view of those closest to him it is not the picture that emerges from the actions of his political backers and it is not the impression that I took away from 10 hours of intense conversation with him  he brooks no other kind  in Albany late this summer Mr Cuomo said in another context that no one knows what Im really thinking so perhaps he has fooled the members of his own entourage But they believe as one of them said that he hasnt really made his peace with the idea of running yet Mario Cuomo is after all a tortoise not a hare He tends to delay decisions weighing all the consequences as long as he can Now 54 years old he shied away from politics until he was 40 and never held public office until he was 43 And he is a man of conflicts and contradictions forever wrestling with himself attempting to reconcile the impulses of heart and mind always conscious of a sense of guilt that he describes as the legacy of my Catholic education Watch him leading a parade down the streets of North Tonawanda NY and you would conclude that he is a man of action through and through born for politics He bounds athletically along a stocky figure in a blue suit that somehow emphasizes rather than conceals a powerful build The eyes deep set sparkle as he spots a friend a gaptoothed grin splits his broad fleshy Italianate face He waves a stubby hand a hand made for physical labor a hand on which his St Johns University ring seems out of place He looks like a cop on the beat or maybe a parish priest from Queens or Brooklyn the kind who enjoys his red wine and tells jokes with the best of them A few hours later relaxing in his office his coat off but his tie still anchored in place his shoes highly polished his trousers still sharply creased at the end of the day Mr Cuomo is a different man The ideas flow out of him in perfectly parsed sentences you wonder who was the last American politician you talked to who used words like eschatology and discussed the perils of Social Darwinism and quoted William Carlos Williams and Teilhard de Chardin Eugene McCarthy Adlai Stevenson Now he seems not a man of action but a man of reflection and speculation A priest perhaps but one whose natural habitat is the classroom and the library hearty enough but deeply serious maybe a little too serious for his own good with his penchant for selfexamination and his preoccupation with worthiness Asked why he dislikes campaigning so much when he is obviously very good at it the Governor replies You know that you should be reading or working in the office instead of out selling yourself to people by means that are superficial or trite or selfdemeaning It is easy to believe that this man has taken two vacations of five and a half days each since his marriage in 1954 One was his honeymoon It is easy to believe that for 15 years this man has arisen every day at 5 AM to pour his thoughts his hopes and especially his doubts into a diary The diaries provide some of the best evidence we have of Cuomo the man for he has never made friends easily outside his family His son Andrew 28 who is managing his reelection campaign may be his closest male friend and his slim animated wife Matilda is without question his closest friend of all He writes about people about books he is reading about political battles but most of all he writes about himself restlessly seeking to define his goals and his motivation What does God want of me he wrote one day Reacting to the seeming contradiction between his aggressiveness and his love of contemplation he put down this selfanalysis of his response to criticism The first phase is the defensive one For a short time there is regret distaste a desire to return to solitude separation the back of the store with the partitioned quiet But only briefly Time to fight back Then the desire for separation turns into an eagerness even a combativeness I become almost comfortable with the idea I am under siege On another day the guilt and the doubt showed even more clearly Always the nagging truth is that I should be something else  a person who gives only to give who works only to provide who speaks only to soothe or persuade for the good who strives only for others And always there is the depressing reality that I fail utterly at that truth that my emotions are at war with it  or at least are too strong to surrender to it It may be as Stanley Fink the retiring Speaker of the State Assembly once suggested that Mr Cuomo keeps the diaries in looseleaf notebooks so he can do plenty of judicious editing and rewriting But he leaves in far more to judge from the two volumes that have been published by Random House than most politicians would consider prudent PRUDENT OR NOT MR CUOMO looks like a shooin this fall His Republican opponent Andrew P ORourke the Westchester County Executive is littleknown The Governor has put together a 10million campaign fund and he has apparently insured that he will have the running mate he wants an able if rather bland member of Congress named Stanley Lundine from upstate Jamestown Abraham Hirschfeld the perennial candidate who had hoped to challenge Mr Lundine and hence Mr Cuomo was ruled off the ballot by a State Supreme Court judge because of irregularities in his nominating petitions turned up by Cuomo staff members Stung by the Governors hardball tactics Mr Hirschfeld suggested that the CuomoLundine campaign was trying to annex New York State to Russia He should not have been surprised Almost 34 years ago a baseball scout wrote of Mario Cuomo then a 20yearold center fielder for the Class D Brunswick Ga Pirates He is aggressive and plays hard    will run over you if you get in his way A friend who has played pool and basketball with him says that he doesnt exactly cheat but sometimes he adjusts the score a bit What makes the man so formidable a candidate a proven winner in a swing state in the age of Ronald Reagan Probably his greatest asset is his ability to defy ideological classification He hates labels like conservative and liberal so much that he will hold up a conversation to give a professorial discourse on their imprecision But he must know too that they are bad news for him politically He wants the votes of the liberals in Manhattan but he also wants the votes of the Democratic traditionalists in his native Queens and in Buffalo To the liberals he offers support on such issues as gay rights a nuclear freeze aid to the destitute he opposes the death penalty and while he personally supports the Roman Catholic position on abortion he refuses to try to write it into law To the man in the tavern in Brooklyn to the woman in the typing pool in Rochester who might find such positions too trendy or too soft he offers the unselfconscious patriotism of the immigrants son a rhetorical emphasis on compromise and on fiscal caution and above all constant references to God and the family as the twin anchors of life His ideas are not that radically different from Fritz Mondales says one Democratic campaign strategist but his personality makes them sound different Italians are very different from Norwegians Adds another The thing I like about him is that the intellect is softened by the personality Hes not an optimist like Reagan but they both come across especially on television as regular guys Unlike Stevenson Cuomo can walk into a bar and seem right at home The family is the Governors metaphor of choice at the moment He uses it to describe a city as he did in a talk at a ceremony marking the 300th anniversary of Albany he uses it to describe his state his country the world The message is that all of society is interdependent as he told a black medical society meeting recently Were not well as a nation unless were all well And he is even willing to apply it in a gingerly way to Presidential politics Flying back to Albany from Buffalo one night in July  he tries to sleep in Albany every night even if it means a postmidnight flight in bad weather he asked one of his aides to play a tape on the planes cassette deck It was the Simon and Garfunkel standard of 1968 Mrs Robinson and this is the part he wanted me to listen to Sitting on a sofa On a Sunday afternoon Going to the candidates debate Laugh about it Shout about it When youve got to choose Every way you look at it you lose Where have you gone Joe DiMaggio A nation turns its lonely eyes to you Ooo ooo ooo Whats that you say Mrs Robinson Joltin Joe has left and gone away Hey hey hey hey hey hey  COPYRIGHT BY PAUL SIMON They said it all Mr Cuomo declared suddenly intense again Thats the best description Ive ever heard of what the country longs for grace character style an inspirational quality if you like Reagan doesnt have exactly that but he has filled the void with patriotism warmth and especially a lack of negativism Thats why I think building a sense of community will be so important in 1988 I dont know whether family is a good enough notion but somehow you have to get across the notion of synergy of working together Id like to write a Declaration of Interdependence about the relationships between all the parts of a disparate world John Donne was right Look at Chernobyl a reactor blows up and people thousands of miles away cant drink the milk Now how do you say that You cant say synergy and hope to score with people but everyone understands family Much has been written about Mr Cuomos heroes Thomas More Lincoln FDR But even on that subject he can be contradictory He told me that he didnt really have idols You have to beware of heroes because no one knows it all or ever knew it all much better to take from each flower as you can But he also said he hadnt liked a Lincoln biography that he had read because the author showed me the warts and who wants a hero with warts Lincoln isnt a man with ingrown toenails hes an idea I dont want to know the sordid details about someone I admire Martin J Steadman the Governors press secretary who shares with him a passion for baseball says that his real idol is the man in the song Joe DiMaggio Mr Cuomo keeps an autographed DiMaggio photo in his office in Manhattan and a bronze cast of Lincolns hands in his study at the Governors Mansion in Albany But he has two portraits of More whom he reveres because he is the patron saint of lawyers and because the Governor says he was a combination of noble hopes and goals and personal weakness All in their ways were loners private men who lived public lives So is Mario Cuomo perhaps because more than most men he has made his own way in life He was the fourth child of parents who came to the United States from the province of Salerno south of Naples Neither Immaculata nor Andrea Cuomo had any money any English any friends or family waiting here or any education to speak of They settled after an interlude in Jersey City in a poor polyglot section of South Jamaica Queens and Andrea started a small grocery store that he kept open 24 hours a day seven days a week Somehow young Mario climbed out of his native neighborhood of struggling Italians Poles Irish and blacks to St Johns University and its law school But he never lost the feeling common to many in the outer boroughs that surround Manhattan  a certain discomfort in the presence of if not downright resentment of the rich and powerful especially the patricians who came to their positions of eminence by inheritance He used to tell a selfrevealing joke about meeting with a group of wealthy influential people assembled by David Rockefeller I told them he would say that I had something in common with many of them I told them that my grandfather had died in the Great Crash of 1929  a stockbroker jumped out of a window and crushed him and his pushcart down below CELEBRITY HAS HAD LITTLE IMPACT upon him He doesnt hang out at Elaines or the 21 Club He doesnt wear flashy clothes And he still likes to eat downhome ItalianAmerican dishes like sauteed escarole Some of those who work for and who formerly worked for Governor Cuomo say his early poverty in Queens and especially his failure after law school to win a place in a Wall Street firm despite finishing joint first in his class gave him the mentality of an outsider ever suspicious of elites Even in his present position of eminence one former associate said Mario Cuomo trusts no one completely who isnt a member of his own family The Governor himself dismisses this line of thought describing it as predictable analysis but not true He said that he has never had a chip on his shoulder never felt that he had to show them that he was as good as they He added I feel no resentment toward the establishment But my early life taught me that for every person in the castle at the top of the hill there are a lot of people down in the gutter where the glitter doesnt show All the same he admits that he prefers people who have made their own money and there was a hint of insecurity perhaps even envy in the way that he mocked one cabinet colleague at a recent senior staff meeting for attending Caroline Kennedys wedding and needled another for having studied at Harvard the quintessential insiders university Whatever the explanation he is a wary man often thinskinned who has had trouble getting along with the press After initially promising to cooperate in the preparation of this article he suddenly balked and said he would not be interviewed He was reluctant he explained to involve himself in any project that had Presidential politics as even a subsidiary topic But staff members and friends suggested that the real reason for his sudden change of heart was a New York Times editorial expressing less than total satisfaction with his accomplishments during the recent legislative session After 10 days he relented granted not one but a series of interviews and answered in detail and with good humor every question including those about Presidential politics Mr Cuomo is deeply preoccupied  his critics might say obsessed  with what is written about him and his administration and tends to complain that journalists dont do their homework He once commented to a startled Albany reporter Its amazing how bad a press Lincoln got for the Gettysburg Address Early in his term he used to call editors and reporters himself to complain when he was displeased he no longer does that but he orders staff members to do it and report back One old Albany hand no friend of the Governor calls him a prima donna who would find it difficult to take the heat of a Presidential campaign Another who likes Mr Cuomo well enough that he says he would go to work for him if asked says that he has a disconcerting tendency to make enemies in the press corps He is contentious challenging demanding impatient with his staff and not one iota less so with the press Probably no incident did more shortterm damage to Governor Cuomos reputation than his clash last year with a group of reporters who were questioning him about the Mafia Youre telling me that the Mafia is an organization he said hotly and Im telling you thats a lot of baloney That translated easily into headlines suggesting that the Governor had denied the existence of the Mafia He now regrets reacting in quite that way but he remains sensitive to any slur on ItalianAmericans Im very alert to the implication that organized crime is the exclusive province of ItalianAmericans People start by thinking that all crime is ItalianAmerican and slide into the reciprocal that all ItalianAmericans are in crime Sometimes they tell me that my father must have had to pay protection money to the Mafia to keep his grocery store open Well he did not pay it In the same way he bridled when a newspaper article suggested that a candidate with a name like Mario couldnt win in the South Not surprisingly Mr Cuomo resents whispers that because he is a Democratic politician from Queens where much of the current New York City corruption scandal has been focused he must also be somehow tainted No one has made such a suggestion publicly but a few people do so privately and the Governor knows it Although he has no background in the clubhouse political milieu that has been known to breed the payoff and the fix his ties to the borough might dog him if he decides to run for President If the Governors identification as an ItalianAmerican and his pride in his ethnicity have sometimes caused him trouble his Catholicism has been central to his success It led him in fact into a political career  first into the defense of a group of bluecollar ItalianAmerican families in Corona Queens who were trying to keep the city from tearing down their houses for a school and then at the behest of Mayor John V Lindsay into mediating a dispute in Forest Hills Queens where middleclass Jewish families were trying to block the construction of public housing for lowincome black families He plunged into these activities Mr Cuomo said because of the change in church teaching represented by the Second Vatican Council which encouraged Catholics to involve themselves as he says in the concerns of this world rather than feeling that you had failed because you had not gone into a monastery to weave baskets to fill the uncomfortable interval between birth and eternity There followed unsuccessful campaigns for Lieutenant Governor 1974 and Mayor of New York City 1977 Finally in 1978 he was elected Lieutenant Governor running with Hugh Carey Four years later he defeated Mayor Koch for the Democratic gubernatorial nomination and then nosed out Republican Lewis Lehrman in the general election even though he was heavily outspent Mr Cuomo works hard to avoid seeming holier than thou He tries to avoid being photographed going to mass every Sunday morning at 7 he says that religion is for sinners not for saints But when he describes the new toxic waste cleanup measure as being about as close to a purely good moral act as this society gets a faint cloud of sanctimony clings to the words even though the Governor as is his wont praises Republican legislators for their part in passing it That is probably inevitable for a man so steeped in Mores Utopia with its vision of an island where ethical norms are jointly upheld by politics and religion and where everyone acts for the commonweal The fullest statement of his view of the way in which a Catholic politician should conduct himself in a pluralistic society came in his celebrated speech at Notre Dame University in September 1984 Almost a quartercentury after John F Kennedys speech to the Baptist clergy in Houston the Governor argued as had his fellow Catholic that a Catholic public official should not attempt through legislation to force his personal views on those he governs The test case of course was abortion In a closely reasoned eloquently phrased address Mr Cuomo declared To assure our freedom we must allow others the same freedom even if it occasionally produces conduct by them which we would hold to be sinful That said he challenged Catholics to obey what they considered Gods law rather than trying to turn it into Caesars The hard truth is that abortion isnt a failure of government No agency or department of government forces women to have abortions but abortion goes on Are we asking government to make criminal what we believe to be sinful because we ourselves cant stop committing the sin The speech was widely acclaimed in the secular press and polls showed Mr Cuomo picking up strength among Protestants and Jews But it widened the rift between the Governor and the Catholic hierarchy notably John Cardinal OConnor the Archbishop of New York G OVERNOR CUOMOS tenure in Albany has in fact been punctuated with major speeches on which he has worked for weeks and in which he has tried to set out what seem to him major ideas about governing He considers them he says the most important work he does After his energy his eloquence  the sonorous voice the logic humor the gift for apposite allusion  is his greatest political asset Most recently he risked being described as naive when he criticized not only President Reagan but such past Presidents as Jackson Lincoln and Franklin Roosevelt  for attempting to stack the Federal courts with ideologically sympathetic judges Speaking to more than 4000 members of the American Bar Association the Governor insisted that the proper criteria for selection were scholarship experience and integrity not partisanship or ideology Nor were those the correct criteria for senators challenging Presidential appointments he said Some people hated the speech Senator Dennis DeConcini an Arizona Democrat said it proved that Mr Cuomo has the biggest mouth on the political scene right now But some loved it Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr who is generally considered a member of the Supreme Courts liberal bloc said it made a point that was very very significant In any event it demonstrated yet again Mario Cuomos willingness to take the hard road Defining a statesman as a retired politician who urges his successor to do all the noble things he never had the courage to do the columnist Charles Krauthammer sees the Governor as a premature statesman who urges difficult things before he gets in office and then once in sticks by them The death penalty which Mr Cuomo has repeatedly vetoed despite its demonstrated popularity is an obvious instance In the case of the bar association he chose to address a serious subject when an anodyne welcoming address would have sufficed The speech was typical as well in its reverence for the law and in its bipartisan tone which is a Cuomo trademark His own choice for Chief Judge of New York State Sol Wachtler is a Republican and the Governor has demonstrated considerable skill in his relations with the majority Republicans in the State Senate often using them to block what he considered overly radical measures proposed by the Democratic leadership in the State Assembly Even in his attacks on the President which can be as tough as any brasscollar Democrat could ask for he often praises Mr Reagan for his courage and for the strength of his convictions He says he dislikes playing the demon avenger in politics and this approach so surprising in a man as willing as he to play tough on occasion is one explanation of the broad electoral appeal that he has managed to develop in just four years But dont cross him Democrats of the prominence of Robert S Strauss the former national chairman and Stephen Solarz the Brooklyn Congressman have found themselves frozen out because of some real or imagined slight People around the Governor talk disparagingly of politicians whose only sin seems to have been that they supported Mr Koch and not Mr Cuomo in the Democratic primary four years ago Like all successful politicians the Governor has been lucky talent without luck in politics is as useless as inside Continued on Page 87 information without capital in the stock market The Reagan boom enabled him to eliminate a projected deficit and to enact with Republican help the largest tax reduction in the states history while building more prison cells and reforming Medicaid Critics on the right like his onetime finance chairman William Stern complain that Mr Cuomo remains a big spender who wants to involve government in everything They note that the states generalfund spending has risen by 40 percent over the last four years twice the rate of inflation partly because of rising labor costs but also because of big jumps in aid to schools and local government New York still collects more taxes and borrows more than any other large industrial state Critics on the left complain in the words of Walter Hang of the New York Public Interest Research Group that he talks about programs but he doesnt fight for them Indeed some of the Governors own advisers concede that his soaring political rhetoric  his passionate declarations of his hopes and dreams raises expectations that are incapable of realization in the more pragmatic arena of daytoday politics in the age of Ronald Reagan Which leads back to the question Will he seek to end that era by asking the country to elect him President by asking it to choose his rather austere vision of moral virtue over a continuation of the hearty selfcongratulatory patriotism of Mr Reagan Sitting in his smallish office off the grand ceremonial room where bills are signed in front of an enormous window swathed in gold cloth this is what the Governor says I have for so long resisted focusing on it that Ive developed a kind of habit of abstention You get an instinct that this isnt something you should be rushing toward Its something to be very circumspect about because this is the most powerful position in the most powerful country in the only world we know Its not easy for me to believe that there isnt a better qualified person than me with a reasonable chance of winning I have no plans and no plans to plan But why should I rule it out even if Im struck by lightning like Saul Do I think things will change No But of course they might A former aide now in private life but still close to Mr Cuomo says there is astonishingly little talk about the Presidency even in the inner circle Its like a nohitter You dont talk about that until the last man is out We dont talk about Washington until the future in Albany is secure Unless you count a few travels around the country  very few by the standards of men thinking about running for President  or a few briefings by foreignpolicy experts there are no detectable signs of a candidacy in waiting No committees no subtle sounding out of fellow governors no Washington operation no media specialists studying possible strategies no trips abroad It is not too late but it is quickly becoming too late the Iowa caucuses and the New Hampshire primary are less than 18 months away And not since Hubert H Humphrey won the Democratic nomination in 1968 has either major party turned to a candidate who did not plunge wholeheartedly into the nominating process with all of its attendant frenzy Suppose the Governor is fooling us with his air of reluctance or suppose that something happens to change his mind If he ran what would his chances be In most polls he runs second to Gary Hart among the Democrats one taken in July gave Mr Hart 30 percent and Mr Cuomo 14 percent That suggests as one would expect a lot of indecision in the public mind A big victory in November  say 60 percent to 40  would certainly add to the Governors appeal Many Democratic professionals think he combines better than any potential Presidential candidate traditional Democratic compassion and the fiscal responsibility they think they need to win But others have doubts one New York fundraiser says she will back Mr Cuomo to the hilt this November but prays he will wait until 1992 to try for the White House because he needs the intervening years to learn more especially about foreign policy He has never visited Israel northern Europe or Japan he has turned down opportunities to meet such foreign leaders as President Francois Mitterrand of France when they have been in New York City and he told one friend not long ago that he knew Buffalo but not Beirut and worried about that Perhaps he will wait until 1992 or perhaps as Bill Stern his former finance chairman suggests he will go for Vice President in 1988 If it comes a national campaign would test the Governors skills as an organizer he has been criticized in the past as a poor delegator but gets better marks these days from those who know Albany It would test his ability to hold his tongue lest a few outbursts like the Mafia incident do to him what tears shed publicly in the snows of New Hampshire did to Edmund S Muskie in 1972 It would test whether the appeal of this passionate immigrants son would work as well in the Sunbelt and the Great Plains as it does in the older more heterogeneous Northeast And ultimately it would test the Governors ability to convince the electorate that he really is a new kind of Democrat that he has a fresh coherent vision that he is not just a New Dealer dressed up in a sharp new rhetorical suit
The Theology He Teaches Is No Longer Catholic,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/opinion/l-the-theology-he-teaches-is-no-longer-catholic-072586.html,To the Editor To me as a secondyear seminarian at St Josephs Seminary in Yonkers Roy Meachums analysis of the decision by the Vatican to revoke the Rev Charles E Currans license to teach theology at the Catholic University of America OpEd Aug 29 seems as misinformed on points of fact as it is confused on matters of interpretation Specifically the assertion that Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger sidestepped canonical legal processes in the investigation of Father Curran and denied him access to his accusers is patently false As your newspaper and others have reported Father Curran and Cardinal Ratzinger have been involved in a sevenyear exchange of ideas a dialogue during which they have met to discuss the theological points made by Father Curran Then Mr Meachums conception of the doctrine of papal infallibility as endowing the Pope with the power to make divinely inspired pronouncements is likewise inadequate Rather papal infallibility means that the Holy Father under the charism of the Holy Spirit and solely on matters of faith and morals is able to define without possibility of error truths held by the Roman Catholic Church To suggest as Mr Meachum does that the decision to revoke Father Currans status as a Catholic theologian in good standing extends this notion and somehow declares all bishops infallible when they take a stand on faith or morals is simply nonsensical The issue in the case of Father Curran is far simpler than Mr Meachum has argued It is this Father Curran can no longer consider himself a teacher of Catholic theology because the theology he teaches is no longer Catholic In no way does this decision run counter to either the spirit or the letter of the Second Vatican Council a council that condemned abortion as well as unlawful contraceptive practices and that required from every Catholic a loyal submission of will and intellect to the official teaching of the church Gaudium et Spes 47 51 and see Lumen Gentium 25 Finally Mr Meachums opinion that Cardinal Ratzinger is outlawing the right to an individual conscience is mistaken In the spirit of Vatican II the Cardinal is concerned that Catholics receive guidance from those appointed to teach and investigate Christian doctrine guidance necessary for the formation of the individual conscience For almost 20 years Father Curran has neglected to do this and so has failed those whom he was meant to serve It is necessary and it is also truly unfortunate that he has lost his status as a teacher of Catholic theology CHARLES J BROWN Yonkers Sept 1 1986

takes care of his people He likes them and they like him So when an abortion clinic is firebombed Flannery is outraged Such things should not happen in his district And something personal is involved One of the victims was a friend  a Jewish woman a neighbor in his building who donated her time to the clinic Flannery looks for the perpetrators He has a good idea who was behind the attack  a demagogic religious fanatic who acts like a junior Hitler As Flannery proceeds his investigation gets to the upper political echelons and he is warned off Abortion is a touchy issue and some important people may be tangentially or even actively involved The more he is told to hold back the more strenuous his activities become He is not a man who can be pushed around He has some resources He has been a precinct captain for a long time and his friends in politics and on the police force owe him a favor or two In Chicago politics apparently favors are like gambling debts and have to be repaid Here and there Mr Campbell indulges in a bit of humor but for the most part the book is grimly realistic The writing style is equally realistic The story is told in the first person singular present tense Mr Campbell has tried to recreate the speech patterns of some notsowelleducated members of the working class My father and me have dinner together every Wednesday night  Who gives out permits on

plotting becomes extremely complicated At the end there is a long detailed explanation that might well try the readers patience On the other hand the writing is expert the characterizations are well realized and Boyes himself is an interesting man with some deep inner problems to overcome In a way Dead Ringer is a book about a mans rediscovery of himself Heres another book about selfdiscovery

expects to practice law with his brother He even runs for office But there are slimy politics in the town and his brother is part of the slime A woman is murdered and the police chief asks the former FBI man for help More dirt is uncovered before the murderer is nailed The question implicit in this wellwritten book is an ethical one Can a man these days really pursue an idealistic path through life Or must he adapt to certain realities In addition the man has an adolescent son who cannot understand him and it takes a long time and a crisis before they can approach each other A good part of

mostly to the authors plodding and clicheridden style Mr Langley also likes to make his characters hiss including such unhissable expressions as My God And when they are not hissing My God they are

DEMOCRATS PIN MUCH HOPE FOR SENATE CONTROL ON UPHILL RACE IN IDAHO,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/us/democrats-pin-much-hope-for-senate-control-on-uphill-race-in-idaho.html,Ah Idaho said Peter D Hart a leading Washington pollster who works mostly for Democratic candidates There isnt a state anywhere where its any harder for the likes of us to win His point is well taken The Republicans have carried Idaho in the last five Presidential elections and in 1984 Ronald Reagan won more easily here than anywhere except the indefatigably Republican state of Utah Yet this is one of the handful of states on which the Democrats are counting this fall to return them to power in the Senate They need a net gain of four seats and given the lay of the political land elsewhere it is not easy to see how they can do it if they do not win in Idaho which they have considered a prime target for the last six years Why one might ask would they even dream of triumph in this bastion of conservatism Flip back through history and it is hard to come up with more than two great radical names here William E Borah the Republican iconoclast of the 20s comes to mind as does Frank Church the Democrat who all through the 60s helped lead the fight against the war in Vietnam But even Senator Church failed to hold his seat in 1980 going down to defeat amid a storm of charges that he was too liberal and worse too cosmopolitan for the people of Idaho Democrats 2 Main Hopes The main reasons the Democrats entertain hopes of winning here are two first the style of the man who beat Senator Church six years ago Sen Steven D Symms and second the perilous condition of almost every economic activity in the state from farming and ranching to mining and construction Mr Symms is a 48yearold applegrower and wineproducer whose Ste Chapelle chardonnays are much esteemed by connoisseurs His politics is conservative but his style is flamboyant Not for him is the straitlaced probity of some of his ideological brethren including his Idaho colleague Senator James A McClure Mr Symms boldly allied himself with the Hunt family of Texas when the Hunts were trying to corner the silver market he set out vainly to soften the Clean Air Act in a state whose clean air is one of its prime resources and in a typically unconventional comment he suggested after the nuclear disaster at Chernobyl that it was a pity that it had not happened much closer to the Kremlin Mr Symmss opponent is Gov John V Evans heir to a curious Democratic subtradition in this state Beginning with the victory of Cecil D Andrus in 1970 the Democrats have controlled the governorship for 16 years Issue of the Economy Governor Evans a somber 61yearold former rancher who has won 14 consecutive elections thinks he can win again by blaming Mr Symms for the states economic troubles He notes that in Shoshone County a silvermining region in the Panhandle not far from the Canadian border 43 percent of the work force is unemployed and he argues that Mr Symms has to share in the blame because he either voted for the policies and programs that brought this about or failed to find solutions Many business executives in Boise  a city despite its rustic reputation where such major enterprises as Boise Cascade lumber and paper MorrisonKnudsen heavy construction and Albertsons supermarkets have headquarters  disagree with the Governors diagnosis One of them said the other day that unlike most of the country Idaho never really recovered from the Carter recession so theres no point blaming President Reagan for this mess In that sense the Senate race here is typical of many in states where the general prosperity of recent years has not penetrated Some Republican incumbents like Senator Charles E Grassley of Iowa have so skillfully distanced themsleves from the Reagan Administration and its policies that they seem invulnerable some like Senator James Abdnor of South Dakota seem likely to lose their seats because of local economic unrest and others like Mr Symms find themselves staring into the chasm of uncertainty when they would otherwise be assured of reelection Mr Evans is a man of unthreatening style all rimless glasses and dark suits and probusiness utterances so totally different as he said in an interview this week from the kind of behavior you people in the East associate with Democratic governors The polls show Mr Evans narrowly ahead still the professional politicians here not surprisingly considering recent political events expect Mr Symms to eke out a victory Public Seems Indifferent Here as in other states that constitute the focus of so much tactical endeavor in Washington this fall there is a sense of vast public indifference The weather the fortunes of the local football teams the decision of a Hollywood producer not to film part of his next movie in Craters of the Moon National Monument  all of those things attracted more television time and more headlines this week than the local Senate race that could have big national consequences Maybe that is because almost everyone has made up his or her mind in this little state where most voters know the candidates personally or at least know someone who knows them personally All the polls and canvasses show only a tiny fraction of the electorate undecided So few people remain on the fence one local political worker said that we ought to forget about media campaigns and take all four of the undecideds out to dinner every night He was joshing of course Mr Evans intends to spend about 2 million Mr Symms about 3 million Those are boggling sums in a state where only about 400000 people vote in a Presidential election and where fewer than that can be expected to vote this year despite hotly contested races for Senator for Governor and for United States Representative in the Second District to say nothing of a bitterly fought referendum on labor laws Little Political Upheaval Curiously there seems to be no real stirring of the political waters even though everyone is trying The Democrats talked a lot early this summer about an allegation in a book by an aide to former Senator Howard H Baker Jr Republican of Tennessee to the effect that Mr Symms had been drunk during a debate on a farm labor bill in 1983 The Republicans have been whispering that Mr Evans a Mormon is insufficiently rigorous in his opposition to drinking smoking and abortion The governor has raised money from outofstate Jewish groups  there are only 1000 Jews in Idaho  by suggesting that Mr Symms supports Col Muammar elQaddafi of Libya Blake Hall the Republican state chairman characterizes Mr Evans as a Calvin Coolidge lookalike a man who forever says nothing and does nothing It all seems a very long way from Washington from the debates on taxes and the Nicaraguan guerrillas and sanctions against South Africa They talk little about such questions here in Idaho
RELATIVES OF A PRIEST FIGHT PROVIDENCE DIOCESE OVER PLAN TO MOVE REMAINS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/us/relatives-of-a-priest-fight-providence-diocese-over-plan-to-move-remains.html,Near the top of a broad gently sloping lawn overlooking the sparkle of Narragansett Bay here is the lonely grave of a Roman Catholic priest It is surrounded by a freshly seeded area from which the bodies of 38 fellow priests and a bishop have in recent weeks been exhumed The grave of the remaining priest the Rev Thomas P Gilfillan who died in 1972 after 50 years in several parishes in the Providence area is now the center of a sharp argument between the Diocese of Providence which wants to consolidate its cemeteries by moving his grave and Father Gilfillans nieces and nephews who have gone to court to keep the grave where it is The dispute arises from the shrinking clergy and changing attitudes of Catholic lay people toward the church In large part it focuses on how to interpret the wishes of the dead in changing times Depending on who is to be believed it also involves money and sex Father Gilfillans grave is the last in the Regina Cleri Cemetery established at Our Lady of Providence Seminary as a way to help unite diocesan priests who belong to no order According to his relatives Father Gilfillan used to joke that he could not count on his family to remember him and so he had arranged to be buried at the seminary where students regularly prayed the rosary for those buried on the grounds The Stone Was Engraved Father Gilfillan paid 200 for the right representing several months salary according to his family The stone a granite cross was one of 100 that were placed in advance with name date of birth and date of ordination inscribed He had the funeral arranged five years in advance said James F Martin a nephew But with a shrinking number of recruits for the seminary the building proved too big A mostly open 70acre waterfront parcel near the center of a metropolitan area of a million people the site has been renamed Our Lady of Providence Center The facilities are now used for conferences and youth activities The center is advertised for rent for executive conferences According to the nieces and nephews the diocese wants the cemetery closed because it would increase the marketability of the land This is a contradiction to what weve been taught Mr Martin We cant let this happen for a capital gain I Cant See Why They Did This A niece Helen Grimshaw said I cant see why they did this to this man after he gave 50 years to the church The diocese says there are no plans to sell the parcel which it received as a donation in 1939 although it acknowledges the land is listed in its records as an investment property Local real estate experts call estimates difficult citing the view down the bay all the way to the Newport Bridge and the imposing stone mansion with mansard roof The land alone could be worth 6 million to 7 million according to the head of a real estate office here In the last few weeks church officials have given several reasons for moving the cemetery The cochancellor of the diocese Msgr Salvatore R Matano said the main reason was that the seminary was gone We want these priests to be interred in a place where it is most conducive for their family and friends to visit them he said No Plans to Sell He Says The term investment property he said means it is a valuable piece of property There are absolutely no plans to sell this piece of property he said The diocese said in court papers that vandalism was a problem In addition another official of the diocese Msgr Galliano J Cavallaro director of cemeteries was quoted in The Providence Journal as saying that vandals were also involved in sexual behavior there The Warwick Police Chief John J Mulhearn said that over the years there may have been a couple of calls about vandalism at the cemetery The family is also objecting to the way the dead were moved They were assured in a meeting with Bishop Louis E Gelineau of Providence that the transfer would be done with dignity and prayer according to Mrs Grimshaw She said she watched from a distance as a two workers and a supervisor used a backhoe with a chain to lift the other coffins unto a flatbed truck Monsignor Matano said that a prayer ceremony was planned at one of the eight cemeteries to which the dead were moved with the consent of heirs or under a court order for those priests whose heirs could not be found Diocese Having Difficulties The diocese has been having a difficult time lately In recent months two priests have been found guilty of sexual misconduct with children while a third was acquitted of sexually assaulting a retarded teenager Bishop Gelineau earlier this year publicly denied rumors that he had been arrested on such charges In January a priest disclosed on television that the director of Planned Parenthood of Rhode Island was deemed to have excommunicated herself by acting as an accomplice in abortions and this draw criticism from some quarters Father Gilfillans survivors are proud of the family background and unhappy at developments A dozen Catholics in their 50s and 60s all graduates of Catholic schools they find it strange to be challenging the diocese Mr Martin for example proudly shows a photo of Father Gilfillan standing on the steps of a church school with 72 relatives from siblings to grandnephews and grandnieces Thats so youll know where were coming from he said Years ago said Mrs Grimshaw she and others would have gone along with the wishes of the church But the church was accommodating the people she said Its not accommodating the people today The church has given up its leadership to the laity said Mr Martin
"REVERENCE, IGNORANCE AND BLAZING APATHY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/14/books/reverence-ignorance-and-blazing-apathy.html,A MACHINE THAT WOULD GO OF ITSELF The Constitution in American Culture By Michael Kammen Illustrated 532 pp New York Alfred A Knopf 2995 WHEN Chief Justice Warren E Burger recently announced that he would step down from the Supreme Court to head the bicentennial celebration of the Constitution beginning next year irreverent critics assumed that his new position amounted to little more than a sinecure and that his resignation from the Court was deftly timed to enable President Reagan to appoint additional Justices But sympathy will flow out to Mr Burger from readers of Michael Kammens book A Machine That Would Go of Itself They will understand that Mr Burgers assignment to play schoolmaster to the American people about the significance of their Constitution is a task that will make his oftcomplainedof workload crisis on the Court seem trivial Mr Kammen who teaches history at Cornell University and who won a Pulitzer Prize for his book People of Paradox An Inquiry Concerning the Origin of American Civilization in 1973 has found in the Constitution his natural subject It is our most fundamental political document reverenced by all the supposed cement of our society yet it is read by few and understood by fewer still Whether despite or because of unfamiliarity with its actual provisions it has also been endlessly passionately disputed It has been invoked by statesright advocates and federalists by slaveowners and abolitionists by laissezfaire capitalists and economic regulationists by segregationists and integrationists Scarcely 6000 words long it has caused the outpouring of barrels of blood in the Civil War which from one perspective was simply the submission of incompatible interpretations of the Constitution to the arbitrament of arms and oceans of ink in judicial opinions and learned commentaries Yet epic constitutional conflict and erudite legal discourse are not Mr Kammens principal concerns here He focuses rather on popular constitutionalism by which he means the perceptions and misperceptions uses and abuses knowledge and ignorance of ordinary Americans Along the way he offers capsule histories of the formal commemorations of the Constitution in 1837 1887 and 1937  reading that will depress Chief Justice Burger  and authoritatively explores the long tradition of literature comparing the United States Constitution with Britains unwritten one From all this a central thesis emerges that there has been an enormous disjunction between Americans sacral regard for their Constitution and their bottomless ignorance of it Americans have taken too much pride and proportionately too little interest in their frame of government Mr Kammen writes This disparity between reverence and knowledge goes back a long way Even Thomas Jefferson who proclaimed in his first inaugural address in 1801 that the Constitution should be the text of civil instruction conspicuously failed to include the Constitution in a proposed syllabus he devised in 1824 for the law faculty at the University of Virginia Mr Kammen attributes Americans persistent ignorance of the founding document to several causes Among them are the Constitutions inherent ambiguities concerning forms of taxation for example and deliberate evasions most notably about slavery which inevitably repelled or confounded interested inquirers The framers agreement not to publicize the proceedings of the Constitutional Convention for 50 years  a silence broken only in 1840 with the appearance of James Madisons journals  guaranteed that the crucial earliest discussions of their handiwork would be handicapped by the inaccessibility of the context and intention of the Philadelphia debates The Supreme Court which might have been expected to play the role of constitutional educator deliberated for a century or more in darkest obscurity It discouraged press coverage of its proceedings and public attendance at its sessions For generations the Court was housed in a remote basement room in the north wing of the Capitol moving to the old Senate chamber in 1860 when the Capitol was remodeled Only in 1935 did the third great branch of the Government acquire a separate home of its own atop Capitol Hill This remoteness sometimes had baleful consequences The Dred Scott case in which the Court ruled among other things that slaves and their descendants were not entitled to the rights of Federal citizens was central to the constitutional history of the antebellum period but the case moved virtually unnoticed for a decade through the court system before it exploded over an unprepared Republic in 1857 The Constitution itself was hidden from public view  the historian John Franklin Jameson found it folded up in a little tin box in the lower part of a closet in the State Department in 1882  until President Warren G Harding at last ordered it displayed like a eucharistic monstrance meant to command popular adoration in 1921 It is hardly surprising therefore that the constitutional jubilee of 1837 the centennial of 1887 and the sesquicentennial of 1937 uniformly sparked blazes of apathy in the American public Reinforcing this indifference Mr Kammen insists was the deeply imbedded cultural belief as James Russell Lowell put it in 1888 that the Constitution has been a machine that would go of itself a perpetualmotion device so perfectly crafted that it needed no further attention  despite the fact that it has been amended 26 times and that thousands of other amendments have been proposed over the years in Congress To be sure toward the end of the 19th century a countertradition developed that regarded the nation  as represented by its Constitution  as a living thing and not a machine as Woodrow Wilson expressed it but the view that Lowell described has had an awesome durability as Attorney General Edwin Meese 3ds recent pronouncements on original intent remind us For whatever reasons ignorance of the Constitution has been vast The surreal answers to questions about constitutional knowledge that Mr Kammen has unearthed in naturalization records would be funny if the condition they bespoke were not so grave Q In case the President dies during his term of office who becomes President A George Washington Nativeborn citizens have done scarcely better From 1789 to 1860 no state save California required that the Constitution be taught in schools In the midst of World War II nearly 60 percent of respondents to an opinion poll either had never heard of the Bill of Rights or could not identify it correctly In recent years Mr Kammen suggests popular attention to the Constitution has grown somewhat as questions of constitutional interpretation have touched on sensitive issues like school prayer busing abortion and sexual behavior Constitutional debate has in fact evolved through three great phases in the course of American history It focused on Federalstate relations for the first threequarters of a century of national existence until that question was essentially settled by the Civil War In the ensuing threequarters of a century controversy centered on the relation of the Government to the economy until the 1930s when the notorious switch in time that saved nine ending Franklin D Roosevelts Courtpacking plan but legitimizing the New Deal effectively established the Governments right to regulate economic activity Since World War II the issues that have preoccupied constitutional discussion have largely involved individual rights BUT readers curious about the underlying political economic and social reasons for these shifts will find little explanation here nor will they find much instruction about the historical background of the current debate over original intent A Machine That Would Go of Itself is purposely committed to a survey of sentiments at the grass roots which may be basic but are not sunk deep The book therefore unavoidably lacks texture and bite It is more comprehensive than profound more anecdotal than analytic Mr Kammens characteristically prodigious research seems often to overwhelm him and threatens to stifle the reader who must track a meandering rivulet of commentary through acres of quotations Yet as the constitutional bicentennial approaches A Machine That Would Go of Itself provides a timely review of past such exercises and a cogently argued reminder that as Theodore Roosevelt put it popular knowledge of the Constitution is the best safeguard against the advances of any theory that would make of the Constitution a means of thwarting instead of securing the absolute right of the people to rule themselves and to provide for their own social and industrial wellbeing GETTING IT WRONG The Constitution is too often neglected or poorly taught    Textbooks have tended to be unclear superficial inconsistent and inaccurate Take as an example The Childs History of the United States From the Earliest Time to the Present Day by one Charles Morris Philadelphia 1900 The author devoted a little over four pages out of 254 to the Constitutional Convention and system of government that it created Looking only at sins of commission    we find John Adams and Thomas Jefferson active at the Convention when in fact they were serving in 1787 as our ministers to Great Britain and France respectively We also learn that the famous rising sun utilized by Benjamin Franklin on the Conventions final day as a symbol of the new nation was painted on a wall rather than in fact above the splat on George Washingtons Chippendale chair And strangest of all we get a picture of Carpenters Hall where we are told the Convention met Most people have at least heard of Independence Hall but not Mr Morris His editor and publisher didnt blink an eye apparently One wonders whether they read the text One hopes that few American schoolchildren did From A Machine That Would Go of Itself
POLL IN BOSTON PUTS KENNEDY AHEAD OF RIVALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/16/us/poll-in-boston-puts-kennedy-ahead-of-rivals.html,With support from the elderly women and bluecollar voters Joseph P Kennedy 2d appears to hold a narrow lead over his closest opponent in Tuesdays primary for the Democratic nomination for the House of Representatives The latest poll published last week by The Boston Globe showed the 33yearold Mr Kennedy with 39 percent of the vote to 34 percent for his closest rival George Bachrach a State Senator The poll of 605 adults likely to vote in the primary which was conducted Sept 26 had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points Closely Watched Contest The battle for the seat being vacated by Thomas P ONeill Jr the retiring Speaker of the House has become the most closely watched in Massachusetts this fall and since the poll was conducted Mr Kennedy is widely believed to have built a more solid lead because he was endorsed by Mr ONeill Mayor Raymond L Flynn and The Globe Nine other Democrats are vying for the seat including James Roosevelt a grandson of Franklin D Roosevelt Five other Democrats quit the race for the Eighth Congressional District seat earlier It was once held by John F Kennedy who was Mr Kennedys uncle and before that by James Michael Curley The race has also emerged as one of national importance as a clash between the Democratic Partys longtime base among the working class and its liberal component In another Massachusetts contest one that aroused more confusion than interest the primary for the Republican gubernatorial nomination the two names on the ballot belong to candidates who quit after questions were raised about their integrity but missed the deadline for getting off the ballot had passed The name of the Republican candidate who is in fact running for the nomination George S Kariotis a wealthy executive in the high technology industry is not on the ballot If Mr Kariotiss lowkey writein campaign is unsuccessful he must wait for the winner of the Republican primary to formally withdraw before he can be selected by the Republican State Committee Both of the other candidates Gregory S Hyatt and State Representative Royall Switzler have said they would withdraw if victorious Mr Kariotis who has raised only 55000 according to his campaign manager must then face Gov Michael S Dukakis the twoterm Democratic incumbent With unemployment in Massachusetts under 4 percent and the states economy booming Mr Dukakis has drawn favorability ratings of 70 percent in some polls The race for Mr ONeills district has already become the most expensive for any office in Massachusetts history with the candidates spending a total of more than 32 million and one of the most costly ever in the country for a House seat Mr Kennedy the son of the late Senator Robert F Kennedy has spent over 1 million more than twice as much as Mr Bachrach Democratic Split in Boston The Eighth Congressional District is one of the most heavily Democratic in the country with 62 percent of its 522000 registered voters enrolled as Democrats But reflecting the split in the Democratic Party nationally they include both voters in workingclass neighborhoods such as East Boston and Somerville and affluent liberal professionals in Cambridge and Bostons Back Bay Mr Kennedy has relied heavily on his family name while stressing that with his connections in Washington he could do a better job for constituents than Mr Bachrach 34 a maverick liberal who has clashed often with leaders of the State Senate Ive always been a Kennedy voter  I like the way the family help each other said Gladys Yont 75 of Waltham Mrs Yont who was attending a Kennedy rally for the Waltham Golden Age Club in the basement of St Josephs Church said she was particularly moved by a letter from Ethel Kennedy the candidates mother It was in her own handwriting and she was telling that all the stories about Joe being irresponsible were untrue Mrs Yont related She said that after Bobby was shot Joe looked after his brothers and sisters Mr Kennedy president of Citizens Energy which provides lowcost heating oil had academic troubles when he was younger In 1973 he was convicted of reckless driving and fined 100 after a vehicular accident on Nantucket left a girl near death and permanently paralyzed below the waist In campaign appearances perhaps in a concession to his workingclass supporters Mr Kennedy has said he favors the death penalty because of the assassination of his father and reluctantly favors a womans right to choose abortion Mr Bachrach has criticized Mr Kennedy as talking too much about bringing home the bacon and not enough about the morality of such issues as arms control and aid for the rebels in Nicaragua Last week Mr Bachrach charged that Mr Kennedys oil company has done business with Libyan banks Mr Kennedy said he would never do business with Libya Libya offered asylum to Sirhan

elected the top Ku Klux Klansman in the nation James Farrands a toolanddie machinist has been bustling about recruiting prospective members ordering his new imperial wizards robe handling mail requests for Klan Tshirts and granting interviews to reporters from all over the world From the new national Klan headquarters in his garage the imperial wizard must carry on the Klans whitesupremacist philosophy as well as sell Klan knickknacks to raise money Say a member wants a pair of Klan earrings Mr Farrands explained Who do you think has to put in the order with the manufacturer The imperial wizard For the first time in its 120year history the leader of the Klan is a Northerner The new imperial wizard lives in a wellmaintained brickandshingle house along a quiet attractive middleclass street in this northeastern Fairfield County suburb He conducts Klan business out of a room about the size of a walkin closet Wherever the imperial wizard lives thats the national headquarters Mr Farrands said Visitors to the imperial wizard are frisked During interviews an assistant holding a shotgun sits behind a reporter Its a royal pain sometimes the imperial wizard said Im the one who has to do the cross lightings and everything I have to edit the newspaper Theres a lot to it You know imperial wizard is an unpaid job he said But if theres anything legal I have to show up in court Granted the Civil Liberties Union helps us but I have to be there And the paperwork I hate getting these handwritten letters from Klansmen Mr Farrands said I cant read their writing Im an advocate of Klansmen typing everything On top of this his new blue imperial wizards robe has yet to arrive I sent a signed blank check to the robe manufacturer he said I wrote I dont know what the imperial wizards robe costs you fill it in  In the meantime Mr Farrands has been wearing dress whites Is this straight he asked putting on his white cone hat His assistant who would not give his name felt the cone looked droopy so Mr Farrands adjusted the muslin lining that holds the point up As wizard Im going to change the lining this muslin is uncomfortable on your head he said putting the cone hat on again Much better his assistant said Mr Farrands is the first Roman Catholic imperial wizard He said that since John F Kennedys Presidency Catholics have been admitted to the Klan If a Catholic could be President then he could join the Klan Mr Farrands said He was asked if this meant that if a Jew became President Jews could join A ticklish question Mr Farrands said A very ticklish question We dont take Jews Theyre not Christians And if a black Christian became President Come on the imperial wizard said rolling his eyes Therell never be a black President To people who say the Klan spreads hate the new imperial wizard had this answer Hate Were trying to spread love Love for Christians Love for white people Love for the Holy Bible Oh heck I love the colored people I love the ones in the South more than the North Why Because theyre farther away Haha Mr Farrands was elected imperial wizard at a recent national convention described in a Klan newsletter as one of the most glorious and entertaining in the history of the Invisible Empire The Connecticut state police say 40 Klansmen attended Mr Farrands says it was more like 75 The police estimate there are 5000 in the Klan nationally and 15 in Connecticut Most of the Klan in Connecticut are members of Jim Farrandss family said a state police spokesman Edward Dailey The imperial wizard refused to discuss membership figures How many he said I have no idea The state police say they have not had trouble from Klan members here Neighbors say Mr Farrands has lived quietly among them attracting little notice except once a few years back when he was dismissed as leader of Shelton Boy Scout Troop 88 because of his Klan membership Mr Farrands said his wife and five children have always been supportive His children sell hot dogs at Klan rallies and his wife is pleased about his election despite all the demands on an imperial wizards time This sort of elevates her to imperial status too he said Mr Farrands said that as imperial wizard he would improve the screening of new members and this afternoon he spent considerable time on the phone talking to a man from Minnesota interested in joining The imperial wizard explained a little about the Klan  We want the white man to run this country he said  and promised to put the caller in touch with a nearby Klansman Are you at all near Indiana he asked Illinois OK Lets see we have a good grand dragon in Kentucky He questioned the caller about his beliefs Well give you temporary status Mr Farrands said finally Would you help us organize that area You understand thats not exactly Klan territory After hanging up Mr Farrands seemed pleased He was against drugs abortion and queers the imperial wizard said He seemed to be quite normal
2 WOMEN IN A CLOSE NEBRASKA RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/16/us/2-women-in-a-close-nebraska-race.html,Midway through a speech to rally the troops Kay Orr the Republican candidate for Governor paused to acknowledge her spouse And now Id like to introduce a very important partner in all of this  Mr Kay Orr she said William Orr an insurance executive took his place with the smiling forbearance perfected by generations of political wives Nebraskans have grown accustomed to such goodnatured role reversals in recent weeks as the nations first gubernatorial contest between two women has gathered steam The race pits Mrs Orr the State Treasurer against Helen Boosalis a Democrat who is the former Mayor of Lincoln It is considered one of the closest gubernatorial races in the country For some analysts and activists the Nebraska election has become a symbol of womens political progress in a year when women who are candidates could make significant gains in races for governor United States Senator and other major offices The change came quietly here in the heartland indeed many Nebraskans seem somewhat bemused by the sudden national attention Political leaders say voters made history by happenstance in the May 13th primary which was wide open in both parties after Gov Robert Kerrey a Democrat chose not to seek reelection Strong Capable Women It just so happened that both parties had strong capable women said Brian Coyne executive director of the Nebraska Democratic Party They did not come out of a feminist tradition They both could be considered party regulars who worked their way up the ladder Indeed while the race may be making feminist history it has not become a feminist crusade The National Organization for Women the National Womens Political Caucus and the Womens Campaign Fund are staying out of the race because both candidates oppose abortion Most of the debate here concerns problems endemic in the Middle West chiefly the troubled farming sector and the need for jobs and economic development What are often considered womens issues such as abortion have stayed largely in the background Both candidates are wellknown players on the states political scene who first entered politics as volunteers Mrs Boosalis a diminutive highenergy woman who can politick a parade route at lightning speed was active in the League of Women Voters when she decided to run for the Lincoln City Council in the late 1950s She thus launched a political career serving 16 years on the council then two terms as Mayor of Lincoln a position she held from 1975 to 1983 In that period she became president of the United States Conference of Mayors Most recently she was director of the Nebraska Department of Aging Critic of Federal Farm Policy Mrs Boosalis who is 67 years old is a harsh critic of Federal farm policy If Washington had planned to destroy agriculture it couldnt have been doing a better job here in the Midwest she says She argues that her long experience in government has left her well equipped to tackle such challenges I dont just talk economic development Ive done it she says Mrs Orr 47 was a longtime Republican activist who became chief of staff under former Gov Charles Thone and was elected State Treasurer in 1982 She has long supported President Reagan leading his campaign effort in Nebraska in 1976 Unlike other farm state Republicans running for office this year she has not attempted to distance herself from the President Later this month in fact the President will come to Nebraska to campaign on her behalf People in this state have some real concerns about the 85 farm bill Mrs Orr said But they want to find answers Theyre not looking for someone to blame In recent weeks Mrs Orr has portrayed Mrs Boosalis as a Democrat committed to increased taxing and spending charges that Mrs Boosalis has angrily denied An Omaha WorldHerald poll this weekend indicated that Mrs Orr was moving ahead in the race which was deadeven in earlier polls The Republicans have the edge in voter registration in Nebraska and President Reagan carried the state by 71 percent in 1984 but the Democrats currently hold the governorship and both Senate seats Mrs Orr gives credit to the feminist movement for awakening her and other women to new roles and possibilities She does not however support an equal rights amendment to the Federal Constitution a top goal of feminist groups and she is opposed to legalized abortion in all instances Stand on Abortion Mrs Boosalis supported the amendment but said she was personally opposed to abortion except in the case of rape incest or to save a mothers life She said she had hoped to get the support of some of the womens groups simply because I have been such a strong advocate on womens issues But she said she recognized that abortion had become a litmus test for some of those organizations Irene Natividad head of the National Womens Political Caucus said Much as we take pride in the race we are not endorsing either one of them In Nebraska meanwhile the political evolution evidenced by the race between the two women seems as natural as the change of season Mrs Boosalis marched Sunday night in the Cass County corn carnival parade held in the town of Plattsmouth With its Victorian facades and its redbrick courthouse Plattsmouth seemed the epitome of the enduring small town of the Middle West Evelyn Morris a retired librarian watched Mrs Boosalis campaign her way up the street And Mrs Morris said she thought that a gubernatorial contest between two women was grand As a woman I think its just wonderful said Mrs Morris who is 70 years old Im a womens libber from way back
Senate Rejects a House Plan To Limit Abortions in Capital,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/17/us/senate-rejects-a-house-plan-to-limit-abortions-in-capital.html,The Senate today rejected sharp restrictions on government payment for abortions in the District of Columbia despite charges that the city has become the abortion capital of the world The Senate voted 48 to 42 against language in a bill passed by the House that would have allowed such payments only for women whose lives would be endangered by their pregnancies The House language would have prevented the district from using its own money or Federal funds to pay for abortions for any other reason Left standing in the Senate bill was the current law which permits the District to pay for abortions in cases of rape or incest as well as in pregnancies endangering the life of the mother Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina led the fight for the restrictive antiabortion language
"MADONNA'S NEW BEAT IS A HIT, BUT SONG'S MESSAGE RANKLES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/18/nyregion/madonna-s-new-beat-is-a-hit-but-song-s-message-rankles.html,Madonnas new song Papa Dont Preach hit the top of the pop charts a few weeks ago and all around the city her voice is heard singing of adolescent pregnancy It drifted through Kathie Peterss headphones on a recent afternoon as she made her way to a pizza parlor in Queens and the 18yearold broke into a sidewalk boogie Papa dont preach Im in trouble deep Papa dont preach Ive been losing sleep But I made up my mind Im keeping my baby   Later that day she took part in a sexuality rap session at an adolescent services center in Manhattan The Door at 618 Avenue of the Americas at 18th Street When a social worker leading the group mentioned Papa Dont Preach Kathie Peters shook her head and said Too many kids are getting pregnant They dont know what theyre getting into I dont like the message But she added with a sheepish smile I do like the beat Many young people like the beat The song is the second single from Madonnas third album True Blue currently one of the bestselling records in the United States In the popular video the rock star portrays a pregnant teenager who begs her father to bless her decision to keep the baby Song Gets Criticism and Support As its popularity has increased so has the criticism and support the song has received from groups concerned with pregnancy and abortion The message said the executive director of Planned Parenthood of New York City Alfred Moran is that getting pregnant is cool and having the baby is the right thing and a good thing and dont listen to your parents the school anybody who tells you otherwise dont preach to me Papa The reality is that what Madonna is suggesting to teenagers is a path to permanent poverty However groups opposed to abortion see Papa Dont Preach as a positive prolife song Abortion is readily available on every street corner for young women said the president of the California chapter of Feminists for Life in America Susan CarpenterMcMillan Now what Madonna is telling them is hey theres an alternative Lace Gloves and Rosaries Mr Moran remembers how his agencys clinics were filled last year with girls wearing fingerless lace gloves and rosaries around their necks in imitation of Madonnas fashion style Everybody Ive talked to believes she has more impact on young teenagers than any other single entertainer since the Beatles Mr Moran said Thats what makes this particular song so destructive Mr Moran and others in the family planning field fear that the song will undermine their efforts to promote birth control among adolescents and that it will encourage teenage pregnancy More than a million American teenagers become pregnant each year according to the Alan Guttmacher Institute a New Yorkbased national research organization A campaign to discourage teenage pregnancy began earlier this week from the Mayors Office of Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting Services Subway posters television and radio spots will carry the slogan Be Smart About Sex and LL Cool J a rap artist has recorded a Smart Sex Rap for radio Were using the same medium to put across a very different message about being smart and avoiding teenaged pregnancy said Alice Radosh the offices coordinator The timing of the Madonna song concerns us Mr Moran said his Planned Parenthood chapter is sending a critical memo to radio and television stations in the metropolitan area urging them to think carefully about playing this song to young audiences He added that his chapter is asking Warner Brothers Records the parent company of Madonnas label to donate at least 25 percent of earnings from the song to programs that promote responsible sexual behavior TeenAgers React Positively Teenagers do react positively to the song said Ms CarpenterMcMillan who recently took a television crew to a Los Angeles maternity home where she played the music video for an audience of teenagers These were young girls 14 15 16 living through tough times going against parents and boyfriends she said Knowing someone like Madonna is in their corner saying All right Go for it was so uplifting For the most part Madonna has avoided the debate The singer will not comment on the songs use as an antiabortion statement according to a spokesman Liz Rosenberg Shes singing a song not taking a stand Ms Rosenberg said Her philosophy is people can think what they want to think Shortly before the records release however in an interview with a New York Times music critic Stephen Holden Madonna described it as a message song that everyone is going to take the wrong way and predicted she would be accused of advising every young girl to go out and get pregnant The song written by Brian Elliot with minor lyrical revisions by the singer tells of a girl who is making a major decision in her life Madonna said in the interview To me its a celebration of life In Washington Tipper Gore a founder of the Parents Music Resource Center  a group that a year ago spurred Congressional hearings on the issue of sex and violence in rock music lyrics and has criticized Madonnas songs in the past  has spoken out in favor of Papa Dont Preach To me Mrs Gore said the song speaks to a serious subject with a sense of urgency and sensitivity in both the lyrics and Madonnas rendition It also speaks to the fact that theres got to be more support and more communication in familiies about this problem and anything that fosters that I applaud Papa Dont Preach Papa I know youre going to be upset Cause I was always your little girl But you should know by now Im not a baby You always taught me right from wrong I need your help daddy please be strong I may be young at heart But I know what Im saying The one you warned me all about The one you said I could do without Were in an awful mess And I dont mean maybe  please Chorus Papa dont preach Im in trouble deep Papa dont preach Ive been losing sleep But I made up my mind Im keeping my baby Im gonna keep my baby mmm He says that hes going to marry me We can raise a little family Maybe well be all right Its a sacrifice But my friends keep telling me to give it up Saying Im too young I ought to live it up What I need right now is some good advice please Chorus Daddy daddy if you could only see Just how good hes been treating me Youd give us your blessing right now Cause we are in love We are in love so please Chorus
"STEVENSON, WORN BY HIS TROUBLED CAMPAIGN, PREDICTS A SURPRISE: VICTORY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/19/us/stevenson-worn-by-his-troubled-campaign-predicts-a-surprise-victory.html,Adlai E Stevenson 3d says that he is going to make it that he is going to surprise the big metro newspapers he accuses of pounding him that his campaign for political rehabilitation will pay off and he will be elected Governor in November He looks wan and sounds a bit spiritless as he makes his predictions seated in his little law office in the Loop one leg propped on his desk a large portrait of the young Lincoln on the wall behind him and a smaller picture of his father the twotime Democratic Presidential nominee at his elbow It has been a long cruel summer and it has clearly taken a toll We were really soaring going into that primary he said recalling his mood before the voting last March We were going to have a dream ticket set records for victory margins Then we got bushwhacked Oh did we ever A wry introspective man never given to gladhanding Mr Stevenson ignored the candidates challenging his handpicked choices for Lieutenant Governor and Secretary of State The voters did not and in a thin turnout two followers of Lyndon H LaRouche Jr were selected as his running mates Mr Stevenson would not have it would not run on a ticket with people who consider the Queen of England a drug pusher and talk about the colonization of Mars Which is how a politician whose greatgrandfather was a Democratic Vice President of the United States whose father stirred the nation with his eloquence even as it twice rejected him and chose Dwight D Eisenhower how such a man comes to be running for Governor of Illinois not as a Democrat but as the candidate of the Solidarity Party which he was forced to invent on the spur of the moment Senate Career Not for Him What one might ask is Adlai Stevenson doing running for Governor anyway He spent 10 years in the Senate and he probably could have added a dozen more without much trouble when he quit in 1980 a littleknown state official Alan J Dixon held the seat for the Democrats with ease The answer is that Mr Stevenson never much wanted to be a Senator He ran because he could not get the state Democratic Party then controlled by Mayor Richard J Daley of Chicago to nominate him for Governor in 1968 He did not like Washington much although he said he might have stayed had I seen any opportunity to work with a President with whom I was comfortable But he didnt He decided that he still wanted as he says the reins in my hands so he ran for Governor in 1982 losing by 5000 votes out of more than 35 million cast to James R Thompson a Republican who has now served 10 years in Springfield It was the closest contest for the Illinois governorship in a century and a half Mr Thompson whose victory last time owed much to his picturing of Mr Stevenson as a wimp  the word was used constantly  is again the Republican nominee The polls and the conventional wisdom among Chicagos hyperactive politicians say the same thing he is vulnerable after so many years in office and he just might be beaten But a poll taken for The Chicago SunTimes early this month showed the Governor 26 points ahead and another taken for several Democratic candidates late last month showed him 15 points ahead It is not easy to generate much enthusiasm or raise much money with deficits like that staring out at you from newspaper headlines day after day Mr Stevenson is enraged by the polls not least because they make it even harder to raise money Rummaging furiously through piles of paper on his desk he denounced polls and especially that of The SunTimes as a plague and after a minute or two held up in triumph Exhibit A in his case against opinion surveys It was the final SunTimes poll of 1982 published less than a week before Election Day showing Mr Thompson 15 points ahead Mr Stevenson thinks it may have cost him victory But the former Senator has not made things easy for himself He fell off a horse while campaigning breaking some bones in his foot and taking himself out of circulation for a time In a state whose manufacturing base has been hit hard by imports he left himself open to criticism by driving a Japanese truck on his farm then defended himself by saying he bought it to save money but would not have done so had he known he would run for Governor Colorful but Not Sexist And then this week he said in an interview with a Chicago business magazine that Governor Thompson was so incapable of saying no that if he were a female hed be pregnant constantly Women in politics including feminists and others howled in protest Given the chance Mr Stevenson refused to apologize asserting in a television interview The statement is colorful but its not sexist He said he was proud of his record on abortion and other womens issues Mr Stevenson has been hammering away at the Governor for huge excess costs on the State of Illinois Center in Chicago accusing him of failing to arrest the states economic decline and of wheeling and dealing He said the other day Jim Thompson is everything that has gone wrong in this state Leaner than he was in the Senate almost hawklike in profile now Mr Stevenson who will be 67 years old on Sept 27 knows this is his last chance in politics He has worked hard to unite behind his effort a fractious Democratic party that has no candidate for Governor of its own and he now has the support at least theoretically of both Mayor Harold Washington and his archrival Edward Vrdolyak the Cook County party leader as well as both Senators and the chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee Representative Dan Rostenkowski Problem at the Voting Booths Mr Stevenson is widely believed at least by the professionals to have bested the Governor in the first of several debates His television commercials are snappier than in 1982 One shows the legs of a tapdancer in front of a door labeled Office of the Governor with an announcer saying When it comes to song and dance nobodys better than Jim Thompson But the commercials are off the air for the moment and it is not certain when they will come back on Mr Stevenson has raised and spent only 900000 not enough in a state of this size he needs at least that much again to do well I pay a high price for my virtue he said with only a trace of irony Even if he does raise the money he may find it difficult to mobilize all his potential support In a political culture where straightticket voting is a way of life he must persuade hundreds of thousands of people to vote Democratic for most offices then punch their ballots again to chose the Solidarity candidate for Governor
TRAVAILS OF THE LONG ISLAND MAID,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/nyregion/travails-of-the-long-island-maid.html,INEZ who is from Ecuador Yvonne from Jamaica and Martes from Barbados wait for the same 4 oclock train on Friday afternoons at the Syosset railroad station They are three of the thousands of livein housekeepers who are dropped off at stations throughout Long Island every week to spend the weekend with their families in New York City Although Inez who is 34 years old misses her four children in Ecuador she says she is grateful for the 150 she earns each week A housekeeper in Ecuador earns 50 a month Inez already has a green card which means she has permanentresidence status in the United States She likes the people she works for and says they treat her like a sister Yvonne 26 and Martes 29 on the other hand are not so happy about their work They are undocumented illegal aliens who came on sixmonth visitors visas and simply stayed when the visas ran out Although each of them has been here for more than three years neither has become a permanent resident The process takes about two and a half years during which time the sponsor may withdraw from the process for any reason Without sponsors they are subject to arrest and deportation Im sorry I came here and if I dont get it I dont care Yvonne said of the green card I refuse to iron a mans underwear and Im not allowed to eat with the rest of the family When they have company Im not allowed to walk through the house Is that any way to live Martes none of the womens names are real talks about the 170 check a former employer in Old Westbury gave her that bounced and tells the story of a friend who became pregnant with a fifth child when she was almost two years into her sponsorship with the people she was working for They told her to get an abortion Martes said otherwise she couldnt work for them anymore Her friend refused had the baby and is looking for another sponsor to work for Robert and Luba Schuster owners of the Windsor Employment Agency in Great Neck for 30 years estimate that more than half of the livein housekeepers working on Long Island are illegal aliens like Yvonne and Martes Most of them are women from Jamaica Trinidad and Barbados  who are in demand because they speak English  and El Salvadorans Nicaraguans and Ecuadorans who are increasing in numbers because of the turmoil in their countries The Schusters estimate that there are about 2000 livein housekeepers working in Great Neck and as many as 25000 or more on Long Island mostly in the affluent North Shore communities between Great Neck and Woodbury and on the South Shore in Hewlett Woodmere Cedarhurst Lawrence and Hewlett Harbor The Windsor agency receives about 300 requests for livein help a week but it is able to fill only about 60 of them because of the shortage of housekeepers One out of three that the Schusters find jobs for either quit or are dismissed within the first two weeks of employment The employers are generally middle to highincome couples where the husband is the sole source of income or where the husband and wife are both working professionals or oneparent households with children While the first group still constitutes a majority of those employing livein help the other two have become more prevalent in recent years The demand for livein help is much greater than the supply said Robert Schuster especially with so many couples both working Americans find these jobs distasteful which makes it hard to fill the demand for more livein help Since there is no law prohibiting an American from hiring an illegal alien the Schusters and other agents say many illegal aliens find work as housekeepers The usual hiring scenario goes like this A woman whose visitor visa has expired gets hired through an agency by a family willing to sponsor her Although the housekeeper continues to work for the employer during the entire process she must obtain a laborcertification certificate from the United States Department of Labor before she can apply to the Immigration and Naturalization Service for permanent residence The Labor Department asks for proof that the employer has advertised in a newspaper for the position at least three times in six months prior to the date of the application If no American citizen wants the job the certificate is issued Housekeepers constitute the single largest group of applicants for certification according to Bette Roy the director of the Labor Department certification division in Manhattan which covers New York New Jersey Puerto Rico and the Virgin Islands Immigration attorneys usually handle the application process for about 2000 Some employers offer to pay the legal fees for their housekeepers in exchange for future services while others pay part of it or none at all According to Charles A Grutman a Long Island lawyer who has handled hundreds of these applications and is chairman of the Nassau County Bar Associations committee on immigration law the labor certification is then filed when the Immigration Service along with a petition for permanent residence called an I140 form The petitioner  the employer has to show that they can afford to hire an alien and that they have a business necessity for having the livein requirement Mr Grutman said so its not enough that Mrs Jones in the suburbs wants to have a livein housekeeper Because lets say what she does all day is sit around the pool and she has two minor children he went on INS will say thats very nice Mrs Jones Thats a good reason for having a housekeeper during the day but not a good reason for having a livein housekeeper at night The usual reason and there are many Mr Grutman added is that both husband and wife work and their hours are such that they cannot know when they will be home on a regular basis And there must be someone home to take care of the children Otherwise the wife or husband would not be able to work Once the employers ability to pay and the need for livein help is established the Immigration Service issues written approval to the employer to hire the housekeeper who now according to the Immigration Act of 1978 must return to her country of origin to pick up her green card Although the return trip home to get the card goes swiftly for most Mr Grutman said that the process is sometimes complicated by rivalry between American counsels  who work for the State Department and who must approve the application in the applicants country of origin  and the Immigration Service  part of the Department of Justice  which issues the green card when the applicant returns to the United States The State Department has their own requirements for permanent residence Mr Grutman said and until they are convinced of the bona fides of the job the applicant may be held there for days weeks months and in some cases even years As the system now operates it has become impossible for employment agencies and attorneys to supply enough housekeepers to meet the needs of Long Islands affluent households The Government seems unconvinced that speeding up the naturalization process and permitting more foreigners to enter would solve the problem If you let in more said Bette Roy what are they going to do once they get here Once they get their permanent residence are they going to stay as domestics And if not what have you solved Owners of employment agencies like the Schusters and other members of the Household Agencies and Nurses Registries Association an organization of agencies based in New York have been asking why temporary working visas for housekeepers should not be issued by the Government to ease the shortage But while the Government seems to approve the lawyers for the housekeepers are vehemently against such a proposal because they say it would create a slave caste system What would you do with a person who lived and worked here for five years and had a child here Mr Grutman said Would you say Sorry you have to go home Theres no place in America for you Ms Roy sees no solution in the near future We need the domestics she said but I dont know that its a longrun solution bringing in aliens for the job Caught in the crossfire the housekeepers have opinions of the system that vary according to the way the families they work for treat them Those who are treated fairly usually move on to permanent residence and better jobs Those who are not jump from job to job enter a different field or return home
A DISCUSSION: THE CONSTITUTION AND THE NEW CHIEF JUSTICE; THE REHNQUIST COURT STILL SEEMS AN APPOINTMENT AWAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/weekinreview/discussion-constitution-new-chief-justice-rehnquist-court-still-seems.html,THE Constitution turned 199 Wednesday the same day the Rehnquist Court became a certainty How the latter will treat the former has been of course a matter of intense speculation Last weekend just before the Senate confirmed Justice William H Rehnquist as Chief Justice of the United States and Antonin Scalia as an Associate Justice three leading constitutional scholars discussed the Supreme Courts last term under Chief Justice Warren E Burger then turned to forecasting Dean Jesse Choper of the University of California at Berkeley Law School Prof Yale Kamisar of the University of Michigan Law School and Prof Laurence H Tribe of Harvard Law School spoke at a conference sponsored by the Bureau of National Affairs which publishes legal and business periodicals Their discussion was moderated by Fred Graham law correspondent for CBS News Excerpts follow Question This after all is going to be the Rehnquist Court So I ask Professor Choper why have you said that it doesnt really make any difference Dean Choper Well what you have is really a ScaliaforBurger substitution Lets forget about Justice Rehnquist because he has one vote whether or not he is Chief Justice If one wanted to make a scientific inquiry one would take every 5to4 decision of any significance since lets say Justice OConnor came on and say where would a vote to the right of Chief Justice Burgers  and I think that is if theres going to be any difference where Judge Scalia is going to be  where would such a vote make a difference And I just dont think that there are any significant constitutional decisions in which youd get a different result Professor Tribe Jesse Choper puts it in terms of how a scientist would look at it Maybe thats how a botanist would look at it  you count the branches of the tree But I think the whole is very much more than and different from the sum of its parts These are not robots who are being sent into a room preprogrammed with clear answers By and large especially in the difficult areas of federalism and individual rights the Justices dont know entirely what they think They are open to reason and to persuasion both from the podium in front of the Court and even more important within the conference room and the chemistry of the Court makes a far greater difference than a nose count alone would indicate Now without meaning to be disrespectful to the former Chief Justice it seems very unlikely that he would have persuaded many people in recent years within the conference I do not think the same could be said of Judge Scalia He is a persuasive thoughtful intriguing interesting advocate In many of the areas where the Court appears not to be closely divided it would not seem unlikely that Judge Scalia especially once he has found his footing will make a bigger difference than Jesse Choper suggests I think the intellectually dynamic RehnquistScalia duo will make differences dramatically beyond those that some have predicted Those differences will begin to be felt this year but they will be dramatically felt the moment there is another opening on the Court Professor Kamisar I guess if youre being paid enormous fees to argue cases in the Supreme Court youd like to think the Justices are open to reason I couldnt resist that I agree with Larry that the impact of Rehnquist and Scalia will be much greater on the next Justice I have a hard time thinking Scalia can tell Justice Blackmun much about abortion or Justice White much about anything On the other hand theres something about fresh troops coming on Just as John Paul Stevens made Brennan and Marshall feel a little younger a little less isolated perhaps OConnor did the same for Rehnquist One More Conservative Q I think its your view that if President Reagan gets one more appointment the abortion decision will swing around If so to what extent and what other cases might swing around Professor Kamisar I think if he had one more solid Rehnquisttype vote the exclusionary rule  the rule barring evidence obtained in violation of the Fourth Amendment  would be in deep trouble and so would Miranda Keep in mind that the socalled Warren Court didnt really take off until Justice Goldberg went on the Court in 62  he was replaced by Fortas in 65 Until then for years and years Warren Black Douglas and Brennan were one vote short They were dissenting most of the time and suddenly they got that fifth vote and took off I think now we may be about one vote away Dean Choper I think if you do get another very conservative appointment it is going to make a big difference wholly apart from the power of persuasion that Justice Scalia would have But I think it is not clear that the abortion decision  Roe v Wade  would be overturned with a substitution for Powell Brennan Blackmun Stevens or Marshall Justice OConnor continues to say or at least suggests very strongly that she would stand behind the core of Roe v Wade Professor Tribe Shes been enigmatic about that I think its wrong to count her as a clear vote to overrule Roe but I also think she never clearly put herself behind Roe Those who think it would be easy to overrule Roe v Wade havent thought very hard about how deeply that decision is woven into the fabric of related areas of law  family privacy contraception and the like Q One of the points that has been made is that whether or not the Court really changes there will be as Senator Bill Bradley said a cloud on the Court because a perception will be created among the public that it no longer stands for the protection of individual rights To what extent do you think that will be true Professor Tribe Justice Rehnquist is a pleasant enough fellow that most of his fellow Justices wouldnt think of his movement to the center seat as casting a shadow on the Court even when they disagree with him I think that whether his movement to the center seat operates to alienate and threaten oppressed dispossessed disadvantaged and dissenting groups depends very much on whether he is large enough to fill the shoes that hes being required to fill I do think there is the possibility that Justice Rehnquist will recognize that on some areas  where as Senator Biden has put it so eloquently though Justice Rehnquist has made elegant arguments they have been deeply insensitive to the rights of individuals and minorities  in some areas growing up a little and broadening his vision a little will enable him to leave a more enduring mark Professor Kamisar The Washington Post said in an editorial that a vote to confirm Rehnquist in a higher office seems to us to be a vote of confidence in his approach to the law and the Constitution I think thats completely wrong I think the vote was in many cases despite the fact people dont like his approach to the law and simply because they think the President has that much leeway But I agree that he will probably become or seem more moderate You know his clerks called him the Lone Ranger and for years he really was quite isolated and he took positions that were incredible I just think that he no longer will do that and that the responsibility of being Chief Justice will make him seem at least a good deal more reasonable than he has in the past Professor Tribe We may even have gotten a glimpse of that last term It was not long prior to his nomination that he authored the Courts opinion in the Meritor Bank case  a landmark sex harassment case in which Judge Scalia in the DC Circuit had gone the other way I dont know for sure that three years ago Justice Rehnquist would have authored a long dissent in a case like that but I think its likely Dean Choper I would be very doubtful that he is going to change his basic point of view Rather I think that it is possible that we will see fewer lone dissents Beyond that there is a certain irony in charging that Rehnquist does not represent the views of the country when it was essentially those views that Ronald Reagan campaigned on I dont want to take a second seat to anyone when it comes to the question of the independence of the judiciary but I do think that to the extent that politics and philosophy have a role to play so far as the judiciary is concerned the role it has to play is in the appointments process I was somewhat disappointed in the senatorial confirmation process for both Chief Justicedesignate Rehnquist and Judge Scalia There was an awful lot of embroidery around the edges of what the central issue really was and that was Justice Rehnquists philosophy President Reagan plainly nominated him on the basis of his philosophy and I think theres a much greater opening for straightforward honestly stated philosophical views on the part of the Senate The Next President Q What is the potential for change in the Supreme Court after the election of the next President what can that do to the future of our constitutional law and what new directions might be just over the horizon Professor Tribe I do need before answering that very narrow technical question to ask one question Whos the next President going to be I could imagine two very different futures being written One will be The Warren Court authored a major revolution the Burger Court engaged in no counterrevolution but consolidated the Rehnquist Court paused briefly and then began to reassert some of the initiatives of the Warren years The other very different scenario is revolution consolidation and then counterrevolution It depends very much on the direction of political change something on which I dont regard myself as an expert Dean Choper Whats clear to me is that Justices Brennan Marshall and Blackmun  Stevens is a relatively young man  are not going to step down while Reagan is President But if he gets one of those appointments theres a good chance of a clear shift So far as after 1988 it depends not exclusively on whether a Democrat or a Republican is in the White House but how determined that President is about shaping the Court You could get a Republican such as Gerald Ford who didnt pay much attention to it at all or a Democrat like John Kennedy who didnt pay much attention to it at all in terms of ideology The thing about Judge Scalia is that at least in my professional lifetime theres never been a nominee one could count on with greater assurance as to where hes going to be Its not a guarantee but heres a guy with a record and an expression of views The last point I want to make is that there is this doctrine of stare decisis which a truly conservative justice might be greatly influenced by while disagreeing with the exclusionary rule or Roe v Wade I do not believe that a properly constituted conservative court wants simply to be able to overturn results that have now become deeply ingrained in the constitutional and political fabric of the country simply because one Justice is gone and another is appointed Professor Kamisar I think youre a little too optimistic The old days are gone forever  the days when Presidents didnt take Supreme Court appointments very seriously when they viewed them like somebody becoming postmaster general Look at FDR He picked guys because he owed them he liked them they worked for him Truman picked the guys he played poker with With Reagan weve got a President who systematically bears down on ideology who takes the Supreme Court much more seriously than other presidents have I think the conventional wisdom that nominees have surprised Presidents before is not worth very much However there are new issues which no one can perceive We know how Scalia will be only on certain issues He may surprise a lot of people on issues we havent even contemplated yet
"SEEKING KEY ROLE FOR PARTY, RIGHT TO LIFE CANDIDATE TRIES TO MAKE ABORTION AN ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/nyregion/seeking-key-role-for-party-right-life-candidate-tries-make-abortion-issue.html,Virtually unnoticed so far District Attorney Denis E Dillon of Nassau County the Right to Life candidate for governor of New York is trying to make abortion an issue in the campaign and at the same time win enough votes to assure a line for the party on future ballots Mr Dillon who was reelected prosecutor last year with a rare fiveparty endorsement is running against Governor Cuomo a fellow Democrat and Andrew ORourke the Republican candidate and a onetime Fordham College and Law School classmate All three are products of Catholic educations but disagree on the role of the abortion issue in campaigns and government The 52yearold Mr Dillon a career lawenforcement official is critical of the Governor for his positions on abortion He is also unhappy with Mr ORourke who has similar views as Mr Dillon on abortion for failing to emphasize the issue in the campaign Indeed Mr Dillon said the ORourke position was the prime reason he decided to heed the requests of Right to Life Party leaders  most of them Nassau residents  that he run despite the objections of Nassau Democratic leaders Mr Dillon said he disagrees with Mr Cuomo over the Governors support of Medicaid funding of abortions which must be authorized by the state and his failure to support a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion He Is Not the Candidate In speeches to Catholic Orthodox Jewish and Pentecostal groups Mr Dillon also charges that Mr Cuomos encouragement of homosexual lobbyists indicates that he is not the candidate who represents traditional family values Mr Dillon said that he and Mr ORourke basically agree on the abortion issue including support of a constitutional amendment banning it Mr ORourke was approached by Right to Life Party leaders who endorsed two of his running mates Senator Alfonse M DAmato and Nassau Comptroller Peter T King who are the Republican Conservative and Right to Life candidates for the senate and for attorney general respectively But Mr ORourke said he had taken the position throughout his elective career that the Right to Life line would cost him more votes than it would gain That theory will be put to the test on Election Day When he is not talking about the Governor in his stock speeches Mr Dillon argues that Mr ORourke is going down the tubes in a Cuomo landslide and thus a vote for the Republican is a wasted vote He argues that a Dillon vote at least sends a message on abortion Last week Mayor Koch presumably being facetious said that Mr Dillon might poll more votes than Mr ORourke but other politicians say that more realistically Mr Dillon will siphon more votes from Mr ORourke than from Mr Cuomo Governors Row Publicizes Issue Mr Dillon added that the Governors public argument with John Cardinal OConnor the Archbishop of New York over an archdiocesan directive urging pastors not to invite proabortion speakers to parish meetings had helped publicize the issue It injects the issue into the campaign he said In addition Mr Dillon hopes to recapture fourth place for the Right to Life Party  behind the Democratic Republican and Conservative Parties  over the striferidden Liberal Party which has nominated the Governor The party position on the voting machine and its official status is determined for the next four years by the gubernatorial vote A partys gubernatorial candidate must poll at least 50000 votes to maintain its line on the ballot in future elections Otherwise it would be required to obtain independent nominating petitions each year Mr Dillon who was born and raised in the Bronx was first elected Nassau Countys district attorney in 1974 Before that he was head of the Organized Crime Strike Force and an assistant United States attorney in the Eastern District which includes Long Island He was briefly a New York City policeman before and while attending law school
DEMOCRATS FASHION CENTRIST IMAGE IN NEW STATEMENT OF PARTY POLICY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/21/us/democrats-fashion-centrist-image-in-new-statement-of-party-policy.html,The Democratic Policy Commission seeking to create a new image of the party has produced a statement of principles that includes strikingly tough criticism of the Soviet Union and strongly asserts the importance Democrats accord family life Democrats harbor no illusions about the Soviet Union the document declares Theirs is a totalitarian society that remains an empire in the classical sense The 71page statement which was prepared under the auspices of the Democratic National Committee and is to be issued officially next week criticizes aspects of President Reagans military buildup as a wild spending spree with no strategic rationale and no overall defense plan Stronger Defense Needed But it effectively endorses the principles behind the buildup and says a desire for a stronger military is widespread among the American people After the brutal Soviet invasion of Afghanistan the Iranian hostage crisis and the signs of unrest in Central America they knew Americas defenses had to be repaired the statement says The document lists a commitment to stronger families as a top Democratic goal While reaffirming a governmental role in promoting educational opportunities job training and economic growth its statements on domestic policy are generally moderate and lay heavy stress on private investment and entrepreneurship Panel Set Up After 84 Vote Entitled New Choices in a Changing America the document is designed in part to fashion a more centrist image for the party and to make it more acceptable to voters especially in the South and West who have strayed to the Republicans in recent elections It is certain to run into criticism from some Democratic liberals Paul G Kirk Jr chairman of the Democratic National Committee who set up the Policy Commission after the landslide loss in the 1984 Presidential race said in an interview that the statement was not a platform and it is in no way binding on Democratic officials Rather Mr Kirk said it is meant to help forge a consensus acceptable to broad segments of the party and to assist candidates running in this years elections The document avoids such divisive social issues as abortion and homosexual rights and one Democratic Party official who asked not to be named said it should be seen as an effort by the party to get out from under the false image that Democrats are weak on defense have weird life styles and are big taxers and spenders Mr Kirk noted that the panel led by former Gov Scott M Matheson of Utah was made up of politicians who had won elections instead of representatives of think tanks and interest groups and he said its report had therefore avoided narrow agendas Broad Themes With Few Specifics Party leaders noted that the document clearly bore Mr Mathesons centrist stamp and to some degree reflected the distance between the partys liberal wing and its elected officials in the South and West The document contains few specific proposals and is revealing mainly in its selection of themes many of which have already become keynotes of Democratic campaigns and have been cited by polltakers as appealing For example the commissions profamily policy lays heavy stress on the growth in the number of families in which both parents work Where will the initiatives come to relieve some of the pressure on the two wageearner family the report asks and it proposes flexible working hours and better day care as part of the answer The paper warns that changes in the economy have led to a shrinking middle class with young families finding it more and more difficult to buy homes and send children to college It uses the term Swiss cheese to describe an American economy in which some sectors and regions enjoy prosperity while others suffer from recession and it sharply attacks the trade surrender policies of the Republican Administration Mr Kirk said the themes were chosen in part to appeal to younger voters particularly a group that he and others have referred to as new collar workers 25to45yearolds with jobs in the service field who earn less than either professionals and managers or workers in heavy industry Effectively acknowledging that the statement included few bold policy proposals Mr Kirk said It is not designed as a legislative item checklist Effort to Alter Image He said the document was seeking to dismantle a scarecrow image of the Democratic Party that Republicans had put forward It repeatedly seeks to cast Republicans as ideologues tied to the past and Democrats as pragmatists who look to the future Democrats have always been at their best the report declares in a typical passage when moving forward dealing with conditions as they find them not forcefitting circumstances to outmoded theories Mr Kirk said he hoped the document would help make the national party more an asset than a burden to local Democrats The document earlier drafts of which were criticized by liberals hews close to policy lines associated with what has come to be known as the partys neoliberal wing represented by such figures as Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Senator Bill Bradley of New Jersey One Democratic Party official said it resembled in many ways the statements that have been issued by the moderatetoconservative Democratic Leadership Council a group led by Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia and Charles S Robb a former Governor of Virginia Criticism From the Left Michael Harrington a leader of Democratic Alternatives a coalition of liberal and labor groups said his group would offer a critique of the report Mr Harrington was especially critical of the papers economic proposals which he called either vague or vacuous and which he said avoided proposals for full employment It doesnt even support the Great Society programs that actually worked he said Responding in advance to expected liberal criticism Mr Kirk denied that the statement took stands to the right of the partys mainstream He said the paper was true to traditional Democratic beliefs and was seeking to serve as a bridge between those principles and the new issues the party confronts Mr Kirk said a debate over foreign policy essentially a continuation of a battle that has racked the party since the Vietnam War over military spending levels and American intervention abroad delayed the document for months An early proposal by Representative Stephen J Solarz a Brooklyn Democrat sought to bridge the gap by strongly condemning the Soviet system and supporting a strong military while also sharply criticizing Administration policy in Nicaragua and other areas No Criticism on Nicaragua But more conservative Democrats criticized that draft as still insufficiently outspoken in supporting the use of American power and the final documents chapter on foreign policy closely reflecting the thinking of Representative Les Aspin of Wisconsin the chairman of the House Armed Services Committee  contains no criticism of the Administrations Nicaragua policy The document does strongly endorse arms control and criticizes the Reagan Administration for saying that the United States intends to abandon the limits on weapons set in the neverratified second strategic arms limitation treaty But it also declares Democrats harbor no illusions about arms control It criticizes Mr Reagans arms buildup as appearing more and more like a bureaucratic spendup and supports alternatives to weapons systems the Adminstration backs On domestic policy the statement defends spending on education job training health care and scientific research and argues that the government need not be just a coercive force but also an instrument for expanding opportunity The essence of freedom is not just freedom to choose it says at one point but to widen the circle of choices
Repression Is Undoing Work of Vatican II,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/22/opinion/l-repression-is-undoing-work-of-vatican-ii-972586.html,To the Editor As a Roman Catholic woman theologian I dissent in anger and sorrow from three recent actions of the Catholic hierarchy  The firing of the Rev Charles E Curran as theology professor at Catholic University for his more thoughtful stance on contraception divorce and homosexuality  The proclaimed policy of the New York Roman Catholic Archdiocese barring all who publicly disagree with church teaching from speaking in parishes of the archdiocese  The almost unheardof curb by the Vatican on the authority of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle who was directed to give over control to his auxiliary bishop in five major areas Moral theology is specifically mentioned which includes birth control divorce and other sexrelated matters These actions are at bottom connected and can be linked to such earlier actions as the harassment of the 24 sister signers of a statement in The New York Times on pluralism and abortion Oct 7 1984 the demand that Sister Agnes Mansour choose between a job that entailed giving Medicaid funds to poor women in need of an abortion and her order the forbidding of tubal ligation surgery in all hospitals of the Sisters of Mercy even when women wish this surgery after several pregnancies The issues connected with procreation affect women especially Women are the ones who bear nurse and in great measure socialize children They are most immediately affected by all pronouncements on sexuality yet they have nothing to say about decisions in this immense field have no sacramental jurisdiction and no contribution to doctrinal development I dissent from the actions by members of the Catholic hierarchy because I see arrogance and tyranny in their approach They claim an almost infallible approach to church teaching for themselves as if lay people were not also part of the church Should such repressive actions continue the new spirit of openness and freedom that marked the Second Vatican Council 196265 will be reversed This would be I believe a tragedy for the church and harm society as a whole MARY I BUCKLEY Associate Professor of Theology St Johns University Jamaica NY Sept 9 1986

SCHOOL CHIEF TO ASK MANDATORY SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/24/nyregion/school-chief-to-ask-mandatory-sex-education.html,Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones said yesterday that he would ask the Board of Education to mandate a sexeducation curriculum in all elementary and junior high schools But Mr Quinones said in a statement that the decision is of course the boards to make The new chairman of the board Robert F Wagner Jr said it was his instinct to vote in favor of compulsory sexeducation courses in the early grades and junior high schools About a third of the school districts do not offer the courses while all high schools which are controlled by the central Board of Education already offer them But Mr Wagner said he was newer to the issue than a lot of people and he wanted to examine the curriculum and an impending report from the division of curriculum and instruction on putting it into place before considering Mr Quinoness recommendation A More Aggressive Stand Another board member Edward L Sadowsky said he was also inclined to vote for the proposal but predicted the matter would get bogged down in the specifics  what do you say about contraception abortion abstinence rhythm Mr Quinones said he believed a number of the 32 community school districts that control the citys elementary and junior high schools had ignored a curriculum devised by the board two years ago It was time he said to deal with the issue more aggressively A curriculum called Family Living and Sex Education issued by the central board for distribution to the districts two years ago came under fire at the time from the Archdiocese of New York and a coalition of churches for being devoid of values A spokesman for the Archdiocese Msgr Peter G Finn said that if the sevenmember board approved Mr Quinoness recommendation it would be a betrayal of commitments made two years ago He said that an Oct 24 1984 memorandum circulated to the 32 boards under the signature of Mr Quinones made it clear that the curriculum was to be introduced at the discretion of the boards He added that there was also an agreement that advisory councils would be established in each district composed of parents church officials and community people to advise on the introduction of the curriculum Several school district officials said yesterday that church members had served on advisory committees in their districts and despite the stated opposition of the archdiocese the advisory committees had approved the course Marylen Daly the chairman of Community School Board 26 in Queens said a rabbi and a Roman Catholic priest had served on the local boards advisory committee She said that the priest the Rev Michael McCormack of Our Lady of the Snows had sent a letter to a public hearing saying he understood the need for the curriculum In Community School District 31 on Staten Island Josephine Ceiling the special assistant to the superintendant said the board there had voted to introduce the course in 1984 after it had been approved by an advisory council that included a rabbi and a Roman Catholic priest She said that parents had been advised they could have their children removed from the classroom when the course was given but very very few had done so Charlotte Frank the head of the division of curriculum and instruction who is to deliver the report on putting the program into effect in two weeks said that neither birth control nor abortion was discussed in the curriculum for elementary schools For the junior high schools she said the curriculum recommended that the schools ask a physician or health counselor to explain the various methods of birth control She said that in a discussion of human reproduction in the junior high school curriculum abortion was one of many topics to be discussed in the case of an unwanted pregnancy
"WASHINGTON TALK: SUPREME COURT; The Morning Line on the Bench, as Revised",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/25/us/washington-talk-supreme-court-the-morning-line-on-the-bench-as-revised.html,The Supreme Courts internal chemistry will doubtless be affected by the changes in membership that the Senate has approved scholars agree but its ideological balance is unlikely to shift dramatically unless another aging member steps down While public attention has focused on the elevation of Associate Justice William H Rehnquist to become the 16th Chief Justice the more important new ingredient in the Courts chemistry many experts agree is the appointment of Judge Antonin Scalia as Associate Justice Im told and I dont know this from experience that he is most dangerous when he is most ingratiating and that he has a great ability to persuade one to his point of view Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun said of Judge Scalia in an informal talk in July to a group of Federal judges Well well see By all accounts Judge Scalia will bring to the Court both an uncommonly potent intellect and a winning personality making him a formidable ally for Justice Rehnquist Both men who will be sworn in Friday are fervent conservatives who share the Reagan Administrations views of almost all politically charged issues from affirmative action and abortion to prayer in schools Creation Science an Issue Among the issues that the reconstituted Court will face in the term beginning Oct 6 are statemandated teaching of creation science as a counterweight to the teaching of evolution racial disparities in death sentencing and once again affirmative action in the workplace The reason no immediate shift in the Courts direction is expected is that except for Justice Rehnquist Chief Justice Warren E Burger who is retiring has long been the Courts most consistent conservative In the vast bulk of the ideologically charged cases Judge Scalias vote will be a functional substitute for Chief Justice Burgers vote so the outcomes of cases should not be affected said Prof Burt Neuborne of New York University Law School But theres more to the Supreme Court than shortterm voting patterns added Professor Neuborne who recently stepped down as the American Civil Liberties Unions legal director When you add a judge of Scalias intellect and vigor to the Court you add a powerful voice for his convictions and I suspect that over time he may influence the votes of the middle of the Court The Justices in the Courts middle especially Lewis F Powell Jr and Sandra Day OConnor have held the balance of power on many issues sometimes siding with Justice Rehnquist and sometimes with the Courts liberal wing Pragmatism Seen in Decisions In recent years these shifting coalitions have produced decisions notable less for theoretical consistency than for pragmatism moderation and continuity Conservatives hope this will change now with the new injection of intellectual vigor and youth from Judge Scalia 50 years old and the elevation of Justice Rehnquist 61 who is widely considered a more consistent persuasive and determined advocate of conservative views than the 79yearold Chief Justice Burger Justice Rehnquists new powers will include the right to preside at the Courts conferences to assign opinions when he is in the majority and in subtle ways to reward his allies and punish his adversaries among the eight Associate Justices But he will still have only one vote and his fiercely independent colleagues are unlikely to abandon the positions they have staked out on major issues They Are Prima Donnas They are prima donnas theres no question about that Justice Harry A Blackmun said of the Courts members in a speech in July to a group of Federal appellate judges according to a report in the National Law Journal You remember Holmes described them as nine scorpions in a bottle Thats a pretty good description Justice Blackmun added I think the center held generally this year But it bled a lot And it needs more troops Where its going to get them I dont know The Courts direction could shift dramatically to the right if President Reagan got a chance to replace with another conservative any of the Courts four oldest members Justice Blackmun is 77 Justice Powell 79 and Justices William J Brennan Jr and Thurgood Marshall who hold down the Courts liberal wing are 80 and 78 respectively Together with Justice John Paul Stevens 66 they have been the five supporters of broad abortion rights for example If any was replaced by an opponent of legal abortion it might open the way for the Court to restrict or even possibly to abandon its protection of abortion Illinois Case Is Pending The Court has not yet agreed to review any abortion cases in the coming term But it has before it an appeal of a lower Federal court decision that struck down an Illinois law that required minors seeking abortions to wait 24 hours after informing their parents The whole question of separation of church and state is one area in which Judge Scalia may have a chance to nudge the Courts current members in a new direction according to Mr Neuborne and other experts Many scholars agree that the Courts decisions interpreting the prohibition of establishment of religion have been so confusing and difficult to reconcile that its whole approach built upon a threepart test enunciated in 1971 by Chief Justice Burger may be ripe for reevaluation Some members of the Court have suggested the same This is an area where we have not done well Justice Blackmun said in his speech in July Justice Rehnquist has argued forcefully that the Constitution does not require a wall of separation between church and state or governmental neutrality toward religion as the majority has sometimes held More Leeway Is a Possibility Judge Scalias writings as a law professor before President Reagan named him to the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit suggest he will join with Justice Rehnquist in seeking more leeway for governments to assist parochial schools and other religious organizations That is not necessarily to say that either of them would go so far as to uphold for example Louisianas pending appeal of a lower Federal court ruling that struck down a law requiring that creation science be taught in any public school that teaches the theory of evolution The lower court ruled the law an unconstitutional effort to promote a religious belief in the Biblical account of creation misleadingly disguised by its drafters and the state as a scientific theory However the case comes out it will be closely watched for any signs of a move away from the strict neutrality toward religion that a narrow majority of the Court has previously enforced

REHNQUIST AND SCALIA TAKE THEIR PLACES ON COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/27/us/rehnquist-and-scalia-take-their-places-on-court.html,Turning a page of history William Hubbs Rehnquist took his oath today as the 16th Chief Justice of the United States and Antonin Scalia took his as the newest Associate Justice President Reagan praised both men at a White House ceremony this morning as brilliant jurists who understood that government by the people requires judicial restraint He said I nominated William Rehnquist because I believe he will be a Chief Justice of historic stature Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia formally assumed their new offices at another ceremony at the Supreme Court this afternoon which the President did not attend Commitment Underscored The inspirational speeches at todays two ceremonies made no reference to the bitter debate recently concluded in the Senate over Chief Justice Rehnquists character and his conservative judicial philosophy But Mr Reagans remarks underscored the Presidents commitment to change the direction of the Federal courts by appointing judges who share his views of the Constitution Warren E Burger whose retirement as Chief Justice took effect today gave one oath to his successor at the White House and a second at the Court The Courts other members top Administration officials family friends and a large crowd of others attended both ceremonies At the Court Mr Burger minutes before relinquishing his office told the 400 people jamming the courtroom that while Justices would always disagree about the meaning of the Constitution changes in the Courts membership did not affect its commitment to continuity and to the Constitution as a living document Oath Administered to Scalia In the judicial oath administered at the Court this afternoon both Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia swore among other things that I will administer justice without respect to persons and do equal right to the poor and to the rich Chief Justice Rehnquist gave the oath to Justice Scalia In the constitutional oath administered by Chief Justice Burger at the White House this morning both men swore to support and defend the Constitution of the United States against all enemies foreign and domestic The constitutional oath is authorized by Article 6 of the Constitution and is required of all Federal employees The judicial oath is required by an Act of Congress and administered to all Federal judges They can be administered together or as today at separate ceremonies The Courts public information office said in a news release that all new members of the Court and new Chief Justices took both the constitutional oath and the judicial oath The public information office said that at least one Chief Justice and three other Associate Justices had previously taken both oaths at the White House and that in 1940 Associate Justice Frank Murphy took one oath at the White House and the other at the Court as was done today At the ceremony this afternoon Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d delivered to the Supreme Courts clerk Joseph Spaniol the formal commissions of Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia signed by the President This morning Mr Reagan proclaimed Today we mark one of those moments of passage and renewal that has kept our republic alive and strong He stressed what he said was the agreement among the framers of the Constitution that judges should interpret laws not make them Principle of Judicial Restraint For them the question involved in judicial restraint was not  as it is not will we have liberal or conservative courts he said They knew that the courts like the Constitution itself must not be liberal or conservative The question was and is will we have government by the people And this is why the principle of judicial restraint has had an honored place in our tradition Mr Reagan avoided direct criticism of the Supreme Courts past decisions on issues such as abortion and school prayer some of which he has previously denounced as departures from judicial restraint But his remarks came at a time when the Attorney General and other officials have been assailing some of the Courts decisions more forcefully than any Administration in more than 40 years Two weeks ago Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds denounced directly what he called the radical egalitarianism of Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr who he said has allowed his liberal orthodoxy to shape his jurisprudence At the ceremony today Mr Reagan stuck to praising those he considers adherents of judicial restraint including Mr Burger whose 17 years in office he called a monument of integrity and of dedication to principle and especially to the judiciary itself The President noted that Mr Burgers service isnt ending today and that he would continue as chairman of a Presidential commission to celebrate the bicentennial of the Constitution which will coincide with his 80th birthday on Sept 17 1987 A Prayer for Patience Chief Justice Rehnquist said in brief remarks at the White House this morning Mr President Im grateful beyond measure to you for affording me the opportunity to serve the court and to serve my country as Chief Justice of the United States And I pray that God will grant me the patience the wisdom and the fortitude to worthily follow in the footsteps of my illustrious predecessors in discharging the responsibilities of this high office Justice Scalia thanked Mr Reagan for appointing him saying I am very grateful and will do my best to live up to his confidence I have to thank my wife Maureen whos an extraordinary woman and without whom I wouldnt be here or if I were here it wouldnt have been as much fun along the way he added amid laughter And I have to thank a lot of other people going way back to teachers in public school 13 in Queens He said that he had enormous personal regard for all the current Justices and that I look forward to working with them in our common enterprise for many years to come Both ceremonies today were attended by the families of the outgoing and incoming Chief Justices and of Justice Scalia whose wife and nine children occupied almost the entire front row on one side of the courtroom this afternoon as he sat in front of them before taking the oath Justice Scalia who is 50 years old is a former law professor He has been a judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit since 1982 Like Chief Justice Rehnquist 61 he is considered one of the nations leading conservative legal scholars and his record indicates agreement with Mr Reagan and Chief Justice Rehnquist on almost all politically charged issues Because Chief Justice Burger 79 sided with Justice Rehnquist in the vast majority of controversial cases the changes in the Courts membership are not expected to have any major immediate effect on the deeply divided Courts voting patterns
Don't Punish Aliens With Death by Illness,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/27/opinion/l-don-t-punish-aliens-with-death-by-illness-488386.html,To the Editor Its ironic to debate Medicaid coverage for illegal aliens while silence blankets the fate of Medicaid coverage for pregnant teenagers in New York State The efforts of the Commissioner of Social Services to revise New Yorks Medicaid policy to bar some 4000 pregnant teenagers from getting prenatal care  or in a handful of cases abortions  have commanded little media attention and no editorial comment from you In New York State this year 59000 teens will get pregnant Of those 26000 will have children 33000 will have abortions Many will manage without help and others are already members of families receiving Medicaid But several thousand pregnant teenagers who cannot turn to their families and have no resources are about to be abandoned by the state when they urgently need essential medical services While I concur with the courts decision to make illegal aliens eligible for Medicaid I have to say  first things first ALFRED F MORAN Executive Director Planned Parenthood of New York City New York Sept 18 1986
A FAMILIAR ISSUE: ADULTS IN TRANSITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/nyregion/a-familiar-issue-adults-in-transition.html,THE new director of the Sarah Lawrence Center for Continuing Education Alice K Olson understands a lot about the centers major constituency  adults in transition In her own background she has been  in addition to wife and mother  at various times teacher lawyer political candidate feminist activist community worker student and business manager She also understands firsthand the kind of unconventional college education that many adults pursue these days Married after a year of college she continued her studies after her two children were born and both she and her husband took a long time to complete their undergraduate education I took seven years Ms Olson said We were both employed and we were in class part time one semester full time another and not at all the next The Sarah Lawrence Center which started in 1962 began as a degree program targeted to adult women returning to school It was the first such program in the country Over the years its student body has changed The center now includes male students has more postbachelor of arts students who are making career transitions or want to enter the work force for the first time and also enrolls some students who have no undergraduate education Ms Olson now 40 years old has experienced career changes that reflect a progression largely based on her own need for new and different challenges After graduating from college she attended North Dakota State University and did a year of graduate work in English She left graduate school when she realized she wasnt a scholar and took a job teaching fifth and sixthgrade language arts During that time she became involved in North Dakota politics originally with the antiwar movement She also became involved in the feminist movement In politics her activities included organizing a successful effort to elect a convention delegate for Shirley Chisholms early bid for national office leading a successful challenge to 17 delegations to the North Dakota state convention based on inadequate representation of women and helping to win ratification of an equal rights amendment in the North Dakota State Legislature North Dakota Democrats regarded her with raised eyebrows she recalled She had been arrested in 1968 at the Democratic Convention in a peaceful demonstration for the Eugene McCarthy campaign She had also helped organize a major political demonstration at the construction site for an antiballistic missile system in northeastern North Dakota All of these factors led her to think about law school she said I had this arrest record and I had the credentials challenge about women being represented I realized if I was really going to be effective in Nortk Dakota politics I needed credibility Ms Olson said Law school seemed the path to that end I paid attention to who got the last word in at the political caucuses and conventions and it was always the lawyers I decided I didnt know what it was they had  whether it was a mystique or something more but whatever it was I wanted it Ms Olson said She attended law school at the University of North Dakota graduated in 1976 and joined a wellrespected firm in Fargo It worked she said There was a significant difference in the way I was received and heard and listened to Her law practice led to several state appointments  one by the Governor to the State Social Service Board a body with responsibility for policy making and administration of the state socialservice system another by the North Dakota Chief Justice to serve on a committee that advises the court on the use of its rulingmaking power In 1980 Ms Olson ran as the Democratic candidate for Attorney General in North Dakota which she narrowly lost with 48 percent of the vote In her law practice she developed a reputation as an advocate for women Over the six years I practiced I attracted a lot of domestic work which is basically where women come into contact with the law My practice became more and more heavily concentrated in divorce childcustody and childsupport cases  not always in representation of women but always involved in trying to help resolve the problems that arise when marriages fail Ms Olson felt that while the work was rewarding it was also frustrating and difficult I really got tired of feeling that I was always either in combat or trying to work with rules and tools that were not designed for resolving these problems The American adversarial system of justice seems to be the wrong way to approach domestic dissolution Ms Olson said She also found almost daily the sexism thats inherent in our system of justice she said adding It became just too painful to constantly be confronted with injustice against women At about this time she also began to write off a political future in North Dakota In 1982 because of her strong public position in support of abortion rights she was denied the Democratic Partys endorsement for State Labor Commissioner She and her husband began to discuss leaving the state for the East While formulating their plans she took what she regarded as a temporary position as associate director of the FargoMoorhead Heart Health Program a research project of the University of Minnesotas School of Public Health which focused on heartdisease prevention After two years in the program she was awarded a Leadership Fellowship from the Busch Foundation in Minnesota to attend the John F Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University There she took part in a midcareer mastersdegree program in public administration It was a great experience to be there she said noting that the presence in the program of a large international community particularly from underdeveloped countries opened up new areas of interest to her The program also gave her the opportunity to study leadership and analyze what it means to be a leader she said adding I got a whole new way of thinking about and seeing what had happened to me in the past and what lessons there were to learn from my experiences While she attended school in Cambridge Mass her husband a tax accountant remained in Fargo Shortly after completion of the Kennedy school program the two decided to come East Her husbands company fortuitously offered him a transfer to Manhattan Before coming to Sarah Lawrence Ms Olson did a short stint in a management position with a New York City printing company While she expresses pride in the work she did there she realized it was not appropriate for her interests and began again on a job search which resulted in her current position I think basically what recommended me to the college was my own experience both as a returning student and as someone who had made major transitions in adult life  which is really what a lot of our students are going through Ms Olson said She said she was particularly enthusiastic about the motivation and diversity of the 50 students at the center who range in age from 25 to 70 They are people with a variety of different backgrounds who want to test themselves before they make a commitment to a graduate or other program Ms Olson said In her new role as director she said she thinks most of her time and energy will be spent with adults returning to complete undergraduate education that was interrupted But I know were going to be looking at what other constituencies there are out there who have educational interests that are appropriate to Sarah Lawrence College There are senior citizens for example whose lives we could really enrich she said She added that the center was also exploring the development of some special summer programs which might include a managementtraining institute for artists writers and performers In her role as the centers director Ms Olson emphasized the need for a different approach to careers and to those who wish to change them Were living a lot longer she said Life expectancy for a woman born in 1900 was 42 years just enough time to raise children and see them gone Our life expectancy is 72  weve got about 30 more years to work with We have a culture and job market thats changing too Now we really cant educate our sons and daughters with the sense that theyre going to be holding the same job all their lives

POLITICS; RIGHT TO LIFE SLATE: ALL L.I.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/nyregion/politics-right-to-life-slate-all-li.html,THE State Right to Life Party has often been criticized as a oneissue party concentrating only on abortion But now it also has a narrow geographic base  Long Island  in a year when the party is fighting for its survival In fact all of the partys state candidates this year are from Nassau County Nassau District Attorney Denis E Dillon of Rockville Centre a Democrat is the partys candidate for governor and Senator Alfonse M DAmato of Island Park a Republican seeking reelection is also on the ticket Thomas A Droleskey of Hempstead who is running for lieutenant governor is a political science professor The party is also backing Nassau County Comptroller Peter T King of Seaford a Republican and a candidate for attorney general and Mary Jane Tobin of Merrick a cofounder of the party and a candidate for state comptroller Senator DAmato and Comptroller King are the nominees of the Republican and Conservative Parties Four years ago the Right to Life candidate for governor Robert Bohner polled 52356 votes just above the 50000vote minimum needed in a gubernatorial election to continue its officialparty status for four years Otherwise the party would have had to circulate independent nominating petitions for its state candidates every year rather than nominating them by convention The gubernatorial vote also determines the position on the ballot for the next four years The Right to Life Party dropped to fifth place in 1982 after briefly running ahead of the Liberal Party for four years It was against this backdrop that Mr Dillon after twice rejecting offers of the gubernatorial nomination changed his mind and accepted despite the advice of his closest political associates that he risked alienating his own Democratic Party by opposing a Democratic Governor Right to Life Party leaders had come to him because he had been active in the antiabortion cause including picketing abortion clinics and because he has been a formidable votegetter at least in Nassau County He had unprecedented fiveparty endorsement the last two elections as District Attorney His running mate Mr Droleskey is a 34yearold former seminarian and politicalscience professor at Illinois State University during the week and an adjunct professor at St Johns University on Saturdays He said that he had alternated in the past between Republican and Right to Life Party membership He is a graduate of Oyster Bay High School and St Johns College and has advance degrees from the University of Notre Dame and a doctorate from the State University of New York at Albany He said he had made a 50page rebuttal speech at Hofstra University to Governor Cuomos speech on abortion at the University of Notre Dame Brevity is not my long suit he said The party endorsed Senator DAmato as it did six years ago because of his antiabortion position and his support for a constitutional amendment that would overturn the Supreme Court decision permitting virtually unrestricted abortion Mr King has been active in the antiabortion movement and with Mr Dillon has been very active in behalf of civil rights for Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland He has appeared with Mr Dillon at several meetings Senator DAmato though keeps his distance from his Right to Life running mates Mrs Tobin the candidate for comptroller is a nurse when she is not working in politics She was state chairman of the Right to Life Party until last week when after four years she was replaced by Lena Harknett of Greenlawn the first state chairman of the party not from Nassasu County She has been party secretary for the last two years Ellen McCormack was the Right to Life Partys first state chairman and cofounder She ran for President on the Right to Life Party line in New York in 1980 Mrs Harknett said Mrs McCormack was withdrawing from the party leadership The Long Island cast of the party is also reflected in the enrollment figures Of 21606 enrollees statewide 2452 are from Suffolk and 2048 from Nassau  the two counties with the most Rightto Life members in the state Between them the counties account for just under 21 percent of the total statewide membership The party has slowly increased its enrollees despite its slip at the polls in 1982 In that year there were 15739 members Four years before that there were 90  29 of them in Nassau and none in Suffolk  when the party first started Other counties with relatively large enrollments are Erie 1936 Kings Brooklyn 1694 Queens 1389 and Westchester 1357 Mr Dillon said he had done some traveling upstate although raising money to support such campaigning is a major problem The District Attorney whose wife Anne staffs the campaign headquarters in Oceanside said that about 33000 had been raised toward a goal of 100000 Mr Dillon said that such a sum would allow a statewide radio advertising campaign just before the election The thrust of the campaign is that there are 150000 abortions a year in the state with about 45000 of them paid for by public funds through Medicaid Acknowledging that he might be vulnerable in a future Democratic primary for district attorney the 52yearold Mr Dillon a career lawenforcement official said he was considering switching to the Republican Party But most political abservers say they believe he is more likely to hurt the Republicans than the Democrats in November by siphoning votes from the Westchester County Executive Andrew P ORourke the Republican candidate for Governor and a Fordham College and law school classmate of Mr Dillon Mr ORourke takes the same position on abortion as Mr Dillon but is not emphasizing it in his campaign It was that decision by Mr ORourke that spurred Mr Dillon to run in order to keep abortion before the voters Mr Dillon describes himself as a progressive Democrat who agrees with Governor Cuomo on almost every issue except abortion and what he says is Mr Cuomos going along with homosexual activists who want the law to specifically include them as potential victims of discrimination They have the same constitutional rights as we all have Mr Dillon said arguing that there should be no special treatment for homosexuals On another emotional issue the death penalty Mr Dillon said that he basically agrees with Governor Cuomos position in favor of life sentences without parole for premeditated murder He said that from his practical experience as a prosecutor rather than as a moral conviction he has opposed the death penalty because of the possibility of error and the difficulty of obtaining convictions when life is at stake He said though that if the Legislature passed the deathpenalty bill if he were Governor he would sign it because the lifewithoutparole position has failed to pass the Legislature He said that with the Governor and the Legislature at loggerheads on both the death penalty and life without parole we wind up with a weak law He said that we have to have a more severe penalty than 15 years for murder Mr Dillon said he considered Mr Cuomo the outstanding guy in public life until I saw how he handled the abortion issue Mr Cuomo while noting that he is personally opposed to abortion has said that it is the law of the land because of the Supreme Court decision He also supports Medicaid financing of abortion on the ground that the poor should be entitled to abortions as long as they are legal
AMERICA'S PROFILE SHIFTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/magazine/america-s-profile-shifts.html,AT THE TIME of the 1980 census the center of population in the United States was in a forest a mile west of the small town of De Soto Mo and 40 miles southwest of the Gateway Arch in downtown St Louis The center has been moving westward since the first census in 1790 when it was 23 miles east of Baltimore During most of this century it proceeded slowly through rural areas in southern Indiana and Illinois But between 1970 and 1980 it took a leap westward and a plunge southward across the Mississippi River signifying that the typical American was no longer a Northerner The Northeast and the Middle West together had 108 million people the South and West 118 million The trend has continued into the 1980s with the center of population moving toward Oklahoma But the 1980 center is a fitting place to stop and observe how people and commerce in every region have broken through the suburbs of large cities and are establishing new settlements of low density independent of the urban centers that once held outlying areas within their orbits The new growth is occurring so far out from the cities  60 miles in all directions from New York for example  and is accompanied by so much economic development that traditional ties to cities and suburban rings are no longer so evident The oncemighty cities have come apart and in effect pieces of them are marching out across the countryside without a center or direction There is no indication that the march will stop soon if at all This scattering of population  which is also occurring around small towns in retirement communities and along seashores and lake shores  is having an important impact on the way Americans view their nation and the world beyond on the kind of governments Americans elect on the use of resources on the development of transportation systems on the way time and money are spent The new lowdensity development neither suburban nor rural but a mixture of the two is in essence a new form of American community Mohave County Ariz a stretch of desert divided from California by the Colorado River is one case in point In 1960 the county had a population of 7736 By 1986 it had an estimated total of 76700 21000 of them having arrived since the 1980 census The countys growth started as a retirement and recreation community with people from the East settling in Lake Havasu City The young survived at first on services provided for retirees but many of them soon developed light industries such as HydroDynamics which manufactures fitted sheets for water beds In politics Mohave County seems to outdo the rest of the state in pursuit of conservatism When Ronald Reagan won Arizona in 1984 with twothirds of the vote Mohave County gave him 71 percent But party affiliation does not mean much with Republicans and Democrats voting pretty much alike Jefferson County south of St Louis is even more of a paradigm for the trend The county was the center of that April 1980 census and is in the path of a population march from a oncegreat urban center St Louis has in recent years had an unusual attraction for people interested in cities and where people choose to live perhaps because it provides a vivid example of what is happening across the nation As its arch celebrates St Louis was for many years a gateway from East to West the jumpingoff place for settlers of the western wilds It was also a place between regions never quite becoming eastern northern southern or western As an industrial city it was like the North with belching factories strong labor unions and high density As a cultural center it was like the East with families of great wealth wellendowed private universities and a strong emphasis on the arts As a city conservative in both life style and political outlook  and surrounded by the rural farm belt  it was like the South In its need for space to break the binds of an Old World city it was like the West With all of these characteristics it was vulnerable to social and economic currents In the 1960s it became a laboratory for urbanologists trying to discover why the United States could not make its cities work In 1950 its population had reached a peak of 857000 but the decline had already begun Displaced blacks and whites from southern farms and plantations poorly educated and unaccustomed to city life found housing in the old central city already on the way to decay Middleclass whites aided by governmentsubsidized mortgages for new housing in the suburbs moved out in great numbers Layer after layer of small suburban municipalities spread out into St Louis County and beyond choking the old city in its 19thcentury boundaries St Louis became a case study in failed social programs and the inability of cities to absorb the concentrated pathology imposed on them of chronic crime and poverty The black middle class joined whites in the suburbs within the confined corridors that would accept them By 1980 the population of St Louis had declined to 453000 almost exactly what it had been in 1890 and has dropped even further since then St Louis like many other cities has settled into an uneasy but quiet stalemate accepting a subordinate role within the metropolitan area Like other cities there has been restoration of old neighborhoods by white professionals and new construction downtown and along the riverfront to serve as the financial legal entertainment and tourist center for the metropolitan area But the great majority of those who use these facilities live outside the city boundaries Fifteen miles northwest of St Louis in St Charles County a different kind of development is taking place so rich in industry and commerce that it is largely independent of the city and its suburbs The countys growth has occurred chiefly around the little city of St Charles population 41000 which for years was known as a quaint town beyond the St Louis municipal airport But after the 1980 census St Charles persuaded the Federal Government to classify it as another central city within the metropolitan area which aside from making it eligible for certain Federal aid served as recognition that it was no longer a satellite but the center of an area with its own economic and population base The Federal Government has created a number of these socalled consolidated metropolitan areas which encompass more than one central city And in the case of St Charles at least the reclassification seemed in line with reality Economic development has followed an interstate highway corridor that runs westward through farms towns and villages Homes are in small municipalities townships and subdivisions scattered for miles on either side of the corridor In the 1970s half of all newcomers to the area settled outside municipalities The pattern is similar in such metropolitan areas as Atlanta and Phoenix where development has reached so far out from the center that employers frequently have trouble finding people to fill parttime service jobs that the unemployed in the central cities would gladly fill if they could Public transportation is seldom available in these areas where the trademark is the freeway cutting through scenic areas and land more profitable for development than agriculture The Nashville metropolitan area with a population of less than a million is spread over eight counties and 4000 square miles Even the Grand Ole Opry has moved out of the central city It seems fitting that the nations countrymusic center should reach out into the nooks and hollows But more important than the culture according to city officials are the three interstate highways that intersect in the city sending out spokes in six directions and the terrain  the meandering Cumberland River lakes state parks wildlife areas and wooded hills W HEN DAWN breaks over Nash County on the North Carolina coastal plain the rustic landscape at first seems remote and hushed On a winters day the gray sky blends with the wet slatecolored soil and the umber woods and meadows Old tobacco barns made of logs and clay dot the fields and gently rolling hills By sunup however the network of new blacktop roads that lace the countys 552 square miles are alive with vehicles They come from the hills and hollows from the towns and villages from old farmhouses from rural subdivisions and mobilehome parks They have destinations that are as scattered as the dwellings they leave each morning  textile mills small factories that make furniture hospital equipment safety locks or automobile parts retail stores fastfood outlets and offices in the towns in shopping malls and along the highways This scene is duplicated from Cape Hatteras to the Smoky Mountains 500 miles away More than any other state North Carolina pioneered scattered growth away from cities and suburbs and no other state has retained as much of its older landscape in the process of industrialization and economic growth By the time lowdensity growth outside the urban areas began to be noticeable elsewhere it was an established way l life inororth Carolina and is still growing and spreading With a population of six million North Carolina is now the 10thlargest state in the nation A larger percentage of its work force about 35 percent is engaged in manufacturing than any other state yet it has no cities of the size found in other industrial states Charlotte at 350000 is the largest but no other is above 200000 There are of course many square miles of suburbs that have as elsewhere in the nation obliterated everything in their path Yet these too are less massive than in other states and a traveler notices that they soon give way to scattered development that has left many farms forests villages and old buildings intact This is the essence of North Carolina and some authorities such as John D Kasarda an urban sociologist at the University of North Carolina believe that much of the nation will look like this by the 21st century There is much evidence to support his views A dozen years ago a group of reporters probing the burgeoning suburbs of America found that a suburban dweller in say Orange County Calif was in effect a resident of a vast suburban complex rather than a particular municipality One would have a home in Garden Grove go to school in Irvine work in Santa Ana belong to a country club in Fullerton and go to Laguna Beach on weekends all without ever identifying with one community over the other Identity was with the larger complex the seemingly unending expanse of subdivisions shopping centers and freeways This of course was in sharp contrast to life in the old cities where people identified with particular neighborhoods even if much of their time was spent elsewhere In North Carolina something of that mentality has always been in evidence though there is more diversity and more space there than in the endless suburbs A North Carolinian is likely to call himself a resident of the Piedmont that stretch of plateau that extends for more than 100 miles from Raleigh to Charlotte I T HAPPENED FIRST IN North Carolina both by accident and design In the 19th century when agriculture was predominant in the economy North Carolina more than most states was made up of small individually owned farms and small towns To take advantage of a scattered labor force manufacturers of furniture apparel and textiles strung out their plants along the railroad lines that traversed the Piedmont crescent and people took jobs in these factories without giving up their farms Later under state policy industrialization followed the same pattern Under a succession of progressive governors including Terry Sanford and James B Hunt Jr the state worked to keep the new growth scattered building hardtop roads into the most remote communities decentralizing the state university system over 16 campuses and offering vocational education geared to the needs of local industries The purpose was to avoid displacement of people to large cities and the problems associated with massive urban complexes State policy consciously sought to keep the state a place where as one commentator put it every resident could always find a quiet corner When I visited Nash County in 1980 to investigate the new growth taking place beyond the suburbs Robert L Bridwell then the young planning director for the county showed me a map with red pins designating new subdivisions His map looked as if it had measles Bridwell took me on a tour of the county and it was a good thing he was along I would never have found some of the subdivisions on my own There was very little new housing in the towns which maintained their 19th century appearance with little downtowns struggling to stay alive For lowincome families there were small houses on small lots a hundred or so bunched together in typical suburban density but surrounded by forests and farms and miles from the closest shopping center For those with higher incomes there were larger houses on lots of five to 10 acres equally remote from commercial development Mobile homes and houses of all sizes stood along the roads or tucked away in wooded pockets Although Interstate 95 the main highway between New York and Florida cuts through Nash County travelers never see these new developments hidden as they are behind the dark forests on either side of the highway In the late afternoon we arrived at an intersection to watch the homewardbound traffic Observing the lines of cars and pickups disappear into the byways Bridwell said Its the land It gives them a sense of security A welltodo woman of the Piedmont told me Nobody lives in town anymore They all live in the country By that she meant the bankers lawyers merchants and many other middleclass people At the same time many poor people especially blacks have left the land to live in town The switch has not been that simple or complete of course Stately old homes in town still appeal to many with higher incomes and many of the poor remain on the land Yet in North Carolina as elsewhere those moving into newly developing areas of low density tend to be more affluent and bettereducated than the native population whether they are retirees from cities and suburbs or young adults seeking new opportunities and life styles In the process they are changing the politics making those areas more conservative in the sense of spurning government regulation and subsidies President Reagans call for a return to volunteerism and less government finds friendly audiences there In recent years North Carolina has been growing increasingly conservative politically Much of this of course can be attributed to economic and social factors that are larger than one states boundaries The conservatism that has blossomed in North Carolina is akin to that found in virtually all of the newgrowth areas of low density whether in New England the Middle West the South or the West In North Carolina this conservatism is more pervasive only because it is not offset by the large urban centers found in most other states which tend to foster a more liberal political stance The ideology of the new outlying areas is first that of indifference to urban problems whether they be in Charlotte Los Angeles or New Jerseys old suburbs This is the result in part of the fact that such problems as the concentration of poor minorities in old decayed neighborhoods seem very remote to those who live and work in these outlying places It is also due to an individual independence that accompanies the scattered new growth A factory worker with five acres of soybeans and a vegetable garden growing behind his home feels less need for government assistance whether for himself or others nor is he easily recruited into a labor union that tells him his wages are too low No matter that people like himself once joined with the bigcity political machines in support of Federal programs for lowincome people That kind of ruralurban coalition born of desperation for a better life no longer exists in this country The new ideology in an era of general prosperity especially for those who are young and able is a form of selfreliance  a selfreliance that nevertheless accepts price supports for tobacco as acceptable and different from welfare handouts In the new American heartland the underground economy flourishes with the barter of goods and services among neighbors enriching the economy without ever being reported to the Government or entering economic statistics The social issues of the new right  opposition to abortion homosexuality and the proposed equalrights amendment for women and advocacy of prayer in public schools  also have taken root in most of the areas of scattered growth Those areas particularly in the South have many fundamentalist churches that support traditional family values and they make up a particularly fertile field for the array of television evangelists who address themselves to the same causes and can be seen on the screen at all hours in the most remote places The new heartland was tailormade for President Reagans vision of America of a return to an earlier day of private initiative reduced government services patriotism optimism closeknit families volunteerism and elevation of religion in public affairs A few weeks before the 1984 Presidential election Geraldine A Ferraro the Democratic VicePresidential candidate from Queens spoke on the treelined downtown mall at Raleigh She electrified an audience of several thousand with a slashing attack on Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina as an extremist and with a call for renewed assistance to the poor strong enforcement of civil rights for minority groups and women a renewal of pluralism and separation of church and state In the audience were blacks labor unionists feminists social activists for causes ranging from a nuclear freeze to job programs for the central cities  the interests that have made up traditional liberal coalitions for the last two decades But the excitement she created did not travel far beyond the downtown streets Across the state her message was anathema to many Supporters of Senator Helms found that the worst epithet they could hurl at the popular Governor Hunt was that he was a supporter of the causes advanced by the MondaleFerraro ticket It was a kind of conservatism not envisioned by leaders who wanted to keep North Carolina as a place where everyone could find a quiet corner Under different circumstances it could have taken another form perhaps the kind of conservatism embraced by the late Senator Sam J Ervin Jr a proponent of civil liberties for citizens against government intrusion whether that intrusion took the form of questionable restraints on business or imposing the teachings of one religion on all as with abortion and school prayer But there could be no mistaking that the kind of lowdensity growth pioneered by North Carolina encouraged a movement away from the kind of liberal Democratic politics that had been on the rise for half a century S O STRONG ARE THE forces that have brought about the dispersal of people and commerce throughout the country in recent years that there is little reason to believe Americans any time soon will go back to the more traditional settlement patterns The advance of technology the change from a manufacturing to a service and informationbased economy and the accumulation of private wealth have made it possible for people and commerce to settle pretty much where they please Continuing dispersal has both negative and positive implications aside from the political and economic effects On the negative side it raises questions as to whether the nation already faced with deteriorated public facilities can afford to build and repair enough pipes roads and buildings to serve an increasingly dispersed population to say nothing of the encroachment on the natural environment On the other hand to stop the development would frustrate one of the deepest yearnings of the American soul  to strike out in search of a new life in new places to own a piece of land and have easy access to nature Probably the major challenge that the new growth presents is to find ways to avoid the mistakes of the past which resulted in seemingly unending urban ugliness over much of our landscape from Maine to California Whether that challenge can be met is an open question
FAMILY AND ETHICS ARE BYWORDS IN '86 RACES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/28/us/family-and-ethics-are-bywords-in-86-races.html,Candidates around the country and national strategists of both parties appealing to the personal concerns of voters this fall are putting a greater stress on moral issues and family values In 1980 family work and neighborhood were the bywords of Ronald Reagans plea for a return to traditional values Today many Democrats as well as Republicans are following a similar path as they discuss issues that are in many ways new to American politics As the two parties try to refine their approach to these questions the debate focuses on exactly what the government role ought to be in encouraging citizens to live by certain norms and what if anything government can do to strengthen families For Republicans the profamily approach for more than a decade has been central to their effort to build support among former Democrats and voters who are less well off Here in Oklahoma the support of conservative religious activists with strong concerns about such issues was a key factor in the surprise victory of Don Nickles in his 1980 race for the Senate He is making similar appeals as he seeks reelection this year against Representative Jim Jones a Tulsa Democrat Democrats Follow Suit Now Democrats are also paying more attention to such issues aiming in part at improving their image in states like this where many voters have come to see the party as ignoring the everyday concerns of basically conservative middleclass families This month for example a new policy paper drawn up by the Democratic Policy Commission under the auspices of the partys national committee puts strengthening the family at the top of its list of priorities At the same time Democratic candidates and the panels policy statement challenge the Republicans to support concrete programs to assist families and children They also argue that the Republicans are not willing to adopt policies to cope with the fact that women are not likely to leave the work force While many political candidates are wary of the politics of values since it could alienate significant minorities in the electorate the signs of its existence are many and include these  The rise of drugs as an issue has led to calls for a crackdown not only on sellers but on users The joint address on drugs by the President and Nancy Reagan this month which called for creating a climate of intolerance toward drug use was a sign of a sharp change from past approaches which generally laid heavy stress on compassion toward users and was wary of moral condemnation as a way of combating addiction  Liberals have shown an increased interest in policies to strengthen family life and some like Governor Cuomo of New York have endorsed teaching values in public schools For at least a decade liberals have feared that such approaches might encroach on individual rights now such fears coexist with a desire to appear more mainstream on family questions  Some conservative thinkers have shown interest in what they call a conservative welfare state which would use public funds to strengthen families and promote traditional values Some proposals like a major increase in the tax exemption for children would significantly help the less welloff  The growth of fundamentalist Protestant involvement in politics has bred a complex discussion over what role religion should play in public life Some Fear a Move Away From Tolerance Talk of a return to traditional values is often associated with the religious right And some civil libertarians and defenders of minority rights worry that the new mood may help undo what they regard as genuine progress in recent decades toward greater tolerance David Kusnet vice president of People for the American Way a group that battles the religious right says he and his allies are sympathetic with the search for ways to inject values in the public debate without being intolerant of the ideas of others The key question he said is whether its possible for schools to inculcate students with values that all Americans share regardless of religion without indoctrinating children with ideas that some groups share and others do not Some of the proposals being made in the name of strengthening families are consistent with the longstanding goals of feminists and other advocates of equal rights says Representative Patricia Schroeder of Colorado The Democratic Congresswoman is cosponsoring a bill that would require employers to give parents 18 weeks of unpaid leave to take care of a newborn baby a newly adopted baby or a seriously ill child or parent She calls the proposal the kind of profamily worker protection we need and says the legislation is a challenge to Republicans For all their talk the rhetoric of this Administration has not yet brought about a turnaround in the divorce rate she said You havent seen any of the things that you were supposed to see if you talked about traditional values Ms Schroeder said her proposals reflected the enormous growth in the number of women in the work force and that government must consider the needs of women who are working because their their families cannot make ends meet without two incomes Shifts in Population Underlie New Emphasis There is little question that demographic changes account for a good part of the new interest in child care and family issues Besides the increasing proportion of women who work there is also the sheer growth in the number of new parents in the baby boom generation  the very group that fueled so much of the revolt against traditional norms Martin T OConnell the chief of the fertility statistics branch at the Census Bureau said that according to 1985 statistics 782 percent of women now 30 to 39 years old had at least one child In 1976 only 583 percent of the same women  they were then 21 to 30 years old  had children There has been a 40 percent increase in the number of parents in that cohort in a nineyear period Mr OConnell said Ethel Klein a professor of political science at Columbia University and the author of Gender Politics argues that the demographic shift has led many feminists to a greater interest in child care and family issues Women are looking for day care and other benefits because they will not accept the idea that they have to cease being women and mothers in order to pursue careers Ms Klein said Alan Carlson the president of the Rockford Institute a think tank oriented to social conservatism said that this demographic shift was also changing the social climate As members of the baby boom have children of their own he argued their values on such issues as drug use and sexuality were likely to become more conservative The definition of a social conservative he said is a liberal with a daughter in high school The Right and Left Take Different Tacks Many conservatives welcome the new interest shown by liberals in the issues of family and values Paul Weyrich the president of the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation and a figure at the forefront of the New Right is actively seeking the cooperation of Democrats in his new project on social conservatism Were seeking a paradigm shift a fundamental change in peoples attitudes he said For that to happen it has to be bipartisan But conservatives for whom social values are central differ from both traditional Republicans and Democrats Unlike some Republicans Mr Weyrich said his allies are not afraid to use government social and welfare policy to promote families and traditional values We say that there are government policies which affect the individual the family the society he said It is recognizing that government may have a role in this  providing that role does not get out of hand But unlike many liberals the strong social conservatives fundamentally oppose most of the changes in family life that took place in the 1960s and 1970s They oppose the new tolerance shown toward homosexuality and abortion for example and think permissiveness and a lack of personal discipline are root causes of what they see as the current crisis of values Mr Carlson worries that liberals who are increasingly aware of the importance of family issues may outflank conservatives We really have to get our act together our analyses together he said adding that liberals by linking profamily concerns with feminist concerns may achieve some goals that are precisely opposed to the conservative agenda At the same time the rush to embrace such issues is worrisome to Ann F Lewis the executive director of the liberal Americans for Democratic Action She says she fears that the Democratic Party might water down its commitment to equal rights for women choice on abortion and concern for single mothers and homosexuals But she added that the party did have to deal with the perception that we were straying too far from the common experiences of most people Were consciously using the language of values she said We are reestablishing a connection with the electorate that we allowed to get frayed A shared concern is the issue of urban poverty Among liberals and conservatives alike discussions of poverty now focus much more heavily on the structure of the family than they did a decade ago Issues Could Pose Risk To Reagan Coalition Politically the debate over values may pose a threat to the new Republican coalition built by President Reagan politicians and analysts say Mr Reagans coalition brings together socially liberal and often secular young professionals who liked the Presidents economic policies and less well off and often deeply religious social conservatives who admired his defense of traditional values William Schneider a fellow at the American Enterprise Institute argues that in its potential for instability the Reagan coalition is akin to the New Deal coalition in the 1930s and 1940s which brought together blacks in the North and segregationists in the South The word you could not mention in the New Deal coalition was race  Mr Schneider said The word you cannot mention in the Reagan coalition is religion  Many Republicans fear that the more attention that is focused on values and religious issues the harder it will be to keep the Reagan alliance intact You have to be a social conservative but a tolerant social conservative said an influential Republican Congressional aide Its a hard thing to pull off From the Democrats perspective said Edward H Crane president of the libertarianoriented Cato Institute the worst mistake the Democrats could make would be to abandon social tolerance and embrace values politics too closely Mr Crane argues that for younger babyboom voters social liberalism is the most appealing part of the Democrats agenda But politicians like Mr Cuomo who has been a leader in the invocation of traditional values in the defense of the welfare state see the politics of values as the wave of the future partly because so many Americans believe the country is staring into a moral vacuum You begin sounding religious moralistic unctious and thats why people stay away from discussing this the Governor said But weve got to give it a try
WASHINGTON TALK; POLITICS; GETTING THE YOUNG WHERE THEY LIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/29/us/washington-talk-politics-getting-the-young-where-they-live.html,Later this fall rock music radio stations in about a dozen states will start running some unusual commercials Instead of promoting a certain brand of beer or blue jeans these commercials will be pushing a particular brand of politician Republican to be exact These spots plus others planned for television will form the centerpiece of a major Republican effort this year to appeal to voters still in their 20s Many of these young voters cast their first ballots in 1984 for Ronald Reagan and the Republicans think these voters can help swing some of the closer races that will determine control of the Senate this year The problem is that younger people usually vote in notoriously low numbers So the main purpose of the Republican campaign will be motivating them to get involved in the political process We believe that this voting group  if they vote  will vote for us said Terry Wade spokesman for the Republican National Committee Benefits in Years to Come Moreover Republican strategists see possible dividends in the future As Haley Barbour director of political affairs in the White House said People who get attached to your party in their 20s are much more likely to to vote for your party in years to come Through the 1960s and early 1970s when liberal ideas were more popular with the young the Democrats made similar efforts to energize the youth vote Today they are dispatching speakers to colleges but the Republicans are applying more resources to the appeal for young voters The fact that this is being done by Republicans and not Democrats is the big news said Joseph Gaylord executive director of the National Republican Congressional Committee Democrats acknowledge that a disturbing number of young people like the President as Senator George J Mitchell of Maine put it But he insists that this personal popularity cannot be transferred to other Republican candidates particularly when President Reagan is not on the ballot himself Mr Mitchell who heads the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee adds that on many social or personal issues such as abortion young voters tend to disagree with Mr Reagan and the conservative Republican agenda An Unmistakable Drift Nevertheless the drift of young people into Republican ranks is unmistakable Sixtyone percent of all firsttime voters backed Mr Reagan in 1984 according to the New York TimesCBS News Poll of voters and a survey by the Republican Party last winter showed that 51 percent of voters 18 to 24 years old intended to support Republican candidates for Congress while only 38 percent preferred Democrats A TimesCBS News Poll last month found that when young voters were pushed to express a party preference they favored the Republicans over the Democrats by a margin of 49 percent to 37 percent One reason for this trend is what Mr Gaylord calls the optimism and opportunity thing the belief among the young that Republicans are more likely to produce prosperity while reducing taxes For instance Stephanie Johnigan a psychology student in Chicago who has two children describes herself as a Democrat but said in a followup interview to the TimesCBS News Poll Theres more movement theres more money around when the Republicans are in office My Pocketbook Is Only So Big Deeann Hale a nurse in Minnetonka Minn said While I believe in a lot of what the Democrats stand for I think its really the Republicans that are looking out for our future financially My pocketbook is only so big and I come first The second major factor in the Republicans success says Mr Gaylord is the pride factor the feeling that America is not getting kicked around anymore Accordingly one theme of the radio and television commercials will be to stress the contrast between Ronald Reagan and Jimmy Carter the only other President most young voters are familiar with The message is remember what things were like said Barbara Pardue communications director of the Republican Congressional Committee The spots will also stress that voting is a patriotic responsible thing to do said Mr Wade the Republican National Committee spokesman Young people will be told that voting is important to you personally and important to your country he said The commercials will probably run in about a dozen states mainly in the South the Southwest and the West where there are close Senate races The survey data we have Mr Wade said is that the Republican message is strong in these areas The advertisements which could cost several million dollars are only one example of how the huge financial advantage enjoyed by Republicans could sway key Senate contests this fall But the campaign for young voters has other elements as well Leaflets and Hoopla College Republicans are distributing leaflets at football games this fall urging students to register to vote and if necessary obtain absentee ballots Local campaigns will be staging what Mr Gaylord calls hoopla activity public events to convince the young that the campaign is alive A memorandum from the Republican Congressional Committee urges candidates to court the youth vote by speaking at high schools participating at career planning fairs and printing fliers about job opportunities that carry an underlying message about the importance of voting Mr Reagan is using his campaign speeches to talk about issues such as overhauling the tax code that could appeal to new voters And some settings for his talks from a college campus to a marine base are also aimed at the young There is even talk of producing music videos with a getoutthevote theme But even the Republicans are not sure the political world is ready for that
"IN OIL-POOR OKLAHOMA, ANGRY VOTERS LOOK FOR SCAPEGOATS AND FOR SAVIORS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/30/us/in-oil-poor-oklahoma-angry-voters-look-for-scapegoats-and-for-saviors.html,Alexander Holmes an economist at the University of Oklahoma invokes the words of the country singer Kris Kristofferson to sum up the attitude here these days The goin up the ballad proclaims werent worth the comin down In this election year that just about says it all for a state that once claimed the worlds largest RollsRoyce dealership a place where the lobbyists and legislators and oilmen used to feast in the red splendor of Juniors restaurant here and savor the days of 80abarrel oil to come But oil is at 15 a barrel the farmers are in trouble and unemployment in some counties is running at 15 to 25 percent Statewide it is 93 percent This has made 1986 an unusual political year for Oklahomans who are angry and looking for someone to blame and someone to save them The election calendar has dealt them an unusual opportunity to do both They will be voting in a closely watched Senate race and they will be electing a new governor In both races the voters used the primaries to deal themselves a remarkable range of choices for both saviors and scapegoats The man who best fits the role of Cincinnatus coming off his farm to put things in order is 65yearold Henry Bellmon A twoterm United States Senator the stocky bluntspoken Republican quit in 1980 because he really did not like life in the most exclusive club in the world He preferred his previous job in 1962 he became the first Republican elected governor of this state with a Dixiecrat heritage Now hes back he says because he would like to help his state out The states in a jam right now he said I believe we cant afford right now to elect a greenhorn governor who needs onthejob training Politicians Had Their Chance The man Mr Bellmon refers to as a greenhorn is 34yearold David Walters Though he has worked in state government and is backed by some supporters of the current Democratic Governor George Nigh Mr Walters has never held elective office This year that turned out to be a prime qualification The politicians have had their chance he declared in advertising before the primary Now its our turn to lead Oklahoma Mr Walters who made much of the fact that he had been in business came in first in a bitter race outpolling the Attorney General and favorite Mike Turpen After an even more bitter runoff Mr Walters emerged victorious by about 4000 votes out of 467000 That same runoff showed just how angry voters were since they threw out four incumbent State Senators and forced the State Treasurer Leo Winters into a runoff Mr Winters with more than two decades in his job withdrew Governor Nigh was probably lucky that he could not run for a third term Once exceedingly popular  he was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1958 and has with one fouryear rest held that job or the governorship ever since  Mr Nigh now finds himself sharing the blame for the bad times The Senate race is something else While Mr Bellmon is a moderate conservative who has supported school busing and choice on abortion his ticketmate Senator Don Nickles is a prototype of the Republican New Right Mr Nickles was only 31 years old in 1980 when he was swept in with President Reagan supported by church activists who admired his firm conservatism on just about every issue And if the Democrats have a selfstyled outsider as their gubernatorial candidate they have one of Washingtons most adept insiders running against Mr Nickles Jim Jones the Congressman from Tulsa got his start as a top aide to President Johnson and as head of the House Budget Committee in 1981 he was the point man for Democrats in President Reagans year of triumph on budget and tax matters That experience is not helping Mr Jones this year because it ties him to the national Democratic leadership A man who has spent much of his political life being criticized by liberal Democrats he finds himself accused of being of all things a liberal One effective Nickles television advertisement speaks of some of Mr Joness votes and concludes with a man who looks like a farmer saying You know Jim if you talk like a liberal and act like a liberal and vote like a liberal youre a liberal Bellmon Sees a Centrist State The campaign infuriates Mr Jones who is rated in the center or somewhat to the right of center by the ideological groups who study Congressional voting records Its the same way the Nazis did it he said in an interview You take a big lie and repeat it Clinton Key Mr Nickless campaign manager defended the attack saying that Mr Jones had to carry the water for the Democrats in Congress and was now paying for it Besides he said conservative in Washington may not be conservative enough for Oklahoma But Mr Bellmon does not see his state as being as conservative as Mr Key does  its basically a centrist state he said  which is why he is not worried about conservatives defecting to Mr Walters In a curious role reversal it is Mr Walters who is firmly for a right to work law that unions hate because it would ban the closed shop Mr Bellmon wants a referendum And Mr Bellmon has been more unequivocal in his promises not to cut education budgets That is why the Republican is expected to get the backing of the teacher unions The imponderable in both races is how Oklahomans decide to vent their outrage The element of placing the blame at home has made the governors race the center of voters attention so far even though the Senate candidates have been spending far more on television Mr Walterss best hope is that voters will continue to see him as the youthful outsider against a toofamiliar Mr Bellmon But questions raised in the primary over 162000 in loans Mr Walters took for his campaign tarnished Walterss shining star said Tom Cole the Republican state chairman Less Brilliance More Wisdom And Mr Bellmon He tells a story whose moral is that government needs a little less brilliance and a little more wisdom Widely respected here for personal integrity Mr Bellmon is presenting himself as the safest bet for a state in trouble In the Senate race Mr Nickles who has proven more popular than Washington political experts expected is clearly ahead Democrats say private Republican polls show that the race is tightening substantially but Republicans say those polls do not exist and that Mr Nickles has a lead of 25 to 30 percentage points One incumbent still popular in the state the Democratic Senator David Boren is now campaigning for Mr Jones after a public  and for Mr Jones embarassing  disagreement over a Jones campaign commercial But the key question here as elsewhere is whether Oklahomans turn some of their ample anger toward Washington and the Republicans I see it coming said Mr Jones whose chances depend on just that
DISMISSED STUDENT IS SUING STANFORD FOR LIBEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/09/30/us/dismissed-student-is-suing-stanford-for-libel.html,A former student who was expelled from a Stanford University doctoral program on grounds of illegal and unethical conduct in a research project filed a civil lawsuit today charging the university with seriously damaging his professional reputation The former student Steven W Mosher who was expelled from the anthropology program in 1983 in connection with research in a villaqe in China accused the university and officials there of breach of contract libel slander and violation of his First Amendment right of free speech The lawsuit filed in Superior Court here asks that Mr Mosher who was recently named director of the Asian Studies Center at the Claremont Institute in southern California be reinstated in the doctoral program The suit which seeks an unspecified amount of money in damages also asks that the defendants publicly retract any negative statements about Mr Moshers professional conduct Stanford Denies Allegations In a statement issued by Stanford University in response to the suit Iris Brest a staff attorney for the university said Stanfords investigation of charges against Mr Mosher had been fair Mr Mosher 38 years old maintains that the real reason he was expelled was because of pressure brought to bear on the university by the Chinese Government because of an article he had published in a Taiwan news magazine He contends that the article disclosed excesses in Chinas birth control program including forced abortions on women who were in their seventh and eighth months of pregnancy The Chinese cut off access to rural areas to other scholars after the article was published Members of the universitys anthropology department voted to drop Mr Mosher from the doctoral program in February 1983 The decision was upheld after reviews by a special faculty committee and later by the dean of the graduate school Appeal Is Rejected An appeal by Mr Mosher was rejected by Stanfords president Donald Kennedy in 1985 In a 76page letter Mr Kennedy said that while it was very likely true that Mr Moshers article had angered the Chinese he was expelled because he had destroyed the confidence of Stanford officials that he could objectively and fairly report events and behave professionally in the field You persist in adopting a manipulative and strategic mode of interaction never acknowledging error however clear it may be Mr Kennedy wrote Mr Kennedy a defendant in the suit along with the university and members of the anthropology department cited several instances of what he called unprofessional or deceptive conduct by Mr Mosher For example he said Mr Mosher conducted research near Canton when he was supposed to be writing his dissertation about a fishing village in Taiwan He said Mr Mosher then submitted a popular ethnography of China instead of a scholarly demographic study of Taiwan as his dissertation Mr Kennedy also accused Mr Mosher of deliberately lying about his fabrication of a sales receipt for expensive camera equipment that he said he had bought with research grant funds He said Mr Mosher refused to return the equipment to the university as required by school policy An investigation by the university concluded that grant funds may have been used to buy a truck for the village Mr Mosher was studying At a news conference today Mr Mosher maintained that he did not have to return the camera equipment to Stanford and admitted buying the truck with grant and stipend funds amounting to 4000 He said he left the truck with the village when he left in 1980 and it was construed as a bribe by Peking In an interview with The New York Times in 1985 Mr Mosher said his former wife and her clan who lived in the village actually purchased the truck
Questions Raised by the New Reproductive Biology,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/01/opinion/l-questions-raised-by-the-new-reproductive-biology-197786.html,To the Editor If King Solomon were alive today he would be sorely vexed As the case of Baby M the child born last March to a surrogate mother who did not want to give her up so clearly demonstrates the new technology of reproduction has far outstripped the capacity of the legal system to deal with it Advances in medical technology over the last decade have given us three new techniques of conception artificial insemination where a male donors sperm is used to impregnate a woman in vitro fertilizationembryo transplant where a womans ova are removed fertilized outside her body and then transferred back into her or into another woman and surrogate motherhood where a woman impregnated through artificial insemination or an embryo transplant will bear a child on the understanding that she will give it up to another at birth The new biology a blessing to the one couple in six in this country unable to conceive raises profound legal and ethical issues with which courts and legislatures are just beginning to grapple Can a couple who contracted with a surrogate mother order her to stop drinking and smoking during pregnancy Can a father by artificial insemination demand visitation rights Or can he be sued for child support Does a single woman have the same right as a married woman to be artificially inseminated Should eggs fertilized by invitro procedures but not transplanted be destroyed If they are saved to whom do they belong What happens if nobody wants a baby born to a surrogate mother What happens as with Baby M when a surrogate mother refuses to give up the baby With more than 10000 births a year attributable to artificial insemination more than 1000 children by invitro fertilization since the worlds first testtube baby in 1978 and an increasing number of surrogate maternities exact numbers are hard to come by these complex questions will be raised more and more There is a clamor for legislation to make the answers standardized and more predictable But the new reproductive biology is an area legislators should hesitate to enter at this time First the cases that arise are often unique and sometimes bizarre They are better left to courts to settle individually by applying general principles to particular circumstances Like the technology the law should be permitted to evolve Second history has demonstrated that government should keep out of reproductive matters The controversy about birth control and abortion clearly shows the negative effects of governmental intrusions Some regulation is desirable for example screening of sperm donors for inheritable diseases or for acquired immune deficiency syndrome but it should be kept to a minimum Two general principles should guide cases involving the new reproductive biology The first is the paramount importance of the right of privacy ie the constitutional right of individuals to make their own decisions about fundamental personal matters such as having a baby or not It would follow that the new reproductive technologies should be considered legal including surrogate motherhood which has been banned in some states as baby selling The second principle is the importance of informed consent and honoring the intentions of the parties Where for example a sperm donor intended to remain anonymous and not be responsible for the expenses of child rearing he should not be made to do so Similarly where it is the intention of the parties that a surrogate mother will bear a child for an infertile couple and all the parties give their informed consent to the arrangement that intent should be honored even if one of the parties has a change of heart These principles will not resolve all the issues raised by the new reproductive biology However applied with an understanding that technological advances create new human problems they can help create a climate where law will be able to catch up with science STEPHEN L ISAACS New York Sept 17 1986 The writer is a professor of clinical public health at Columbia Universitys Center for Population and Family Health
Required Reading; Religion in Politics,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/02/us/required-reading-religion-in-politics.html,In a speech at the University of Missouri on Sept 17 Education Secretary William J Bennett criticized those who contend religious faith gives them a monopoly on political truth as engaging in invidious sectarianism He cited the case of a public figure who recently said that Christians feel more strongly about love of country love of God and support for the traditional family than do nonChristians Such sectarianism should be renounced in the strongest terms Mr Bennett said The unidentified public figure was the Rev Pat Robertson the television evangelist who on that day announced he might seek the Republican nomination for President Here are excerpts from their recent exchange of letters provided by Mr Bennetts office Robertson to Bennett Sept 19 Although we have been personal friends and you have access to me at anytime you wish you made no effort to clarify whether or not I said the things attributed to me or whether indeed in the middle of a heated press conference I had been guilty of a slip of the tongue The truth is as you must know only too well by now is that what I said was distorted What in heavens name provoked you to lash out at a simple statement by a fellow Reagan supporter who merely said that maybe Evangelical Christian people supported Ronald Reagans issues more strongly than others Do you really feel that the Democratic platform which advocated abortion on demand special rights for gays and lesbians a reduced role for Americas defense and the elimination of prayer and the Bible from our schools was as fervent in its support for God country and traditional family values as was the Republican platform of 1984 In short on this issue it seems that you may not have done your homework as well as I have on the attitudes of the American people You shot from the hip and in doing so you have done me and the Republilcan Party a disservice Speaking as a friend in all candor I think a statement of clarification Lord willing an apology  would certainly be in order Bennett to Robertson Sept 23 As I believe you know two researchers from my office had checked the accuracy of the statement with your office so I had no reason to think that the newspapers had misrepresented your views Nor had we learned of any correction or clarification on your part So I used your statement as an example of the kind of sectarianism that should I think be rejected If the statements I cited do not correctly characterize your view then I would suggest that by all means you should clarify it I for one would welcome such a clarification The heart of my view is this On the one hand religion should never be excluded from public debate But on the other it should never be used as a kind of divine trump card to foreclose further debate Let me add Pat that I am troubled by anyone who celebrates electoral success by writing The Christians have won or What a breakthrough for the Kingdom This is just the sort of statement that I think should be avoided I am not alone in sensing some ambiguity in your position on the role of religion in politics And I think that not only I but many Americans would welcome some elaboration on your part
AT THE MOVIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/movies/at-the-movies.html,IN Menage the new film by Bertrand Blier Michel Blanc plays a downonhisluck Frenchman  in love with a wife who despises him  who is slowly seduced by a burly energetic thief who sets out to teach him how to enjoy life Mr Blanc won the best actor prize at Cannes for his portrayal of Antoine the downtrodden little man who fights to hold on to his heterosexuality with the nervous tenacity of a fox terrier and is finally overwhelmed by a homosexual passion that transforms his idea of who he is By the end when Antoine dresses as a woman to go dancing the audience sees something more than the usual scene in which a man dons a womans clothing Nor is Mr Blanc playing a transvestite He actually took it upon himself to attempt to play a woman I think that at the beginning Antoine tries to fight against what seems to be happening to him he said He feels guilty But when he suddenly puts on those clothes I think hes just happy being a woman Suddenly he wants to be loved so much he really psychologically becomes a woman The guilt disappears In my acting I played this consciously I thought there was no use to have pain in his eyes The womans clothes are liberating The technical problem was to try to act not as a homosexual or a transvestite but as a woman The only thing I had in mind was not to make a judgment on what was happening I think women are more dedicated to life than men are  they know better how to deal with desperate ideas and love is the most desperate idea The actor said he asked his girlfriend to help him with the part practicing how to sit and walk He said he found the role exciting and difficult Its painful for a man to be dressed for 8 to 10 hours a day as a woman You cant relax between shots Even if you take off those terrible shoes you feel very uncomfortable troubled confused and people dont react the same way to you Even people on the set felt threatened All the crew acted totally differently when I arrived on the set with my dress Mr Blanc said that he was nervous when he accepted the part because he was afraid of failing and looking ridiculous It was like a dream to have this part to play he said but it could have turned into a nightmare He said he thinks that the evolution in the characters development is crucial to the success of the film which was shown this week at the New York Film Festival and is opening commercially today at the Cinema Studio 1 At the beginning hes always dominated first by a woman and then by a man Mr Blanc said Hes like a man who cant swim and sinks to the bottom and pushes with his feet He has new energy when he comes up as a woman He can dominate this huge man He finds a new power The Way It Was In 1960s Denmark Twist and Shout a Danish film about two youths who come of age in 1964 is a major boxoffice success in Denmark Americans watching the film  aside from seeing a story about growing up taking responsibility and maintaining hope even in bleak surroundings  might also notice that it contradicts the stereotype of Scandinavian society thought of here as sexually liberated classless and paternalistic Instead the movie shows a troubled environment with large class differences illegal and primitive abortion methods individual isolation and regressive and neglectful treatment of mental illness Is this a true vision of Denmark in the early 1960s I think that the idea of real social democracy in Denmark was more a dream than a reality in those days said the films director Bille August We were so much dependent then and are still on the rest of Europe The politicians are trying to build up more of a social democracy but they didnt really succeed After 1968 many of the changes most people associate with Scandinavia came to Denmark but now we have a rightwing party in power which is trying to change things back again People dont feel safe economically anymore They are scared They look to the old days as a time when things were better In part I was trying to show these people that the 60s were not so fantastic  that they are looking back to a romantic rather than a real picture of what went before Independent Film Makers Sell Their Wares at Market The American Independent Feature Film Market began an 11day run of 41 featurefilm screenings this week as well as shorts documentaries and works in progress all aimed at finding both foreign and American distributors for independent films The purpose of the market according to Sam Kitt director of the Independent Feature Project  the nonprofit organization that sponsors the event  is to be a bridge These directors usually labor outside of conventional industry channels Mr Kitt said We were created to give them a point of ingress to the marketplace because after all distribution and marketing is the final step in the communication process The market is attracting additional interest this year as independent films  those movies that are not produced by Hollywood studios have been earning awards ranging from Oscars Kiss of the Spider Woman The Trip to Bountiful to prizes at Cannes and showings at the New York Film Festival which opened this year with Down by Law an independent film Down by Law will be shown again in the market to try to pick up additional foreign distribution Last year such films as Shermans March We Were So Beloved and The Partisans of Vilna were shown and picked up for distribution The screenings are not open to the public but there will be several seminars that are On Sunday the market will offer a seminar at the Fashion Institute of Technology entitled Directing Be Prepared at which Frank Perry and other independent directors will speak Information 4960909 This year we see a trend of noted actors being more and more open to independent work said Mr Kitt Robin Williams James Earl Jones Geraldine Page and Linda Hunt will all appear in new independent films Dead End Kids Alchemy to Nuclear Science One of the highlights of the Independent Feature Film Market is Dead End Kids directed by JoAnne Akalaitis already scheduled for a twoweek run at the Film Forum 1 starting Nov 5 The film is based on Ms Akalaitiss play that was produced at the Public Theater in 1980 The avantgarde directorwriter has in collaboration with her Mabou Mines company created a comedy about nuclear destruction On a budget of 500000 but achieving a more expensive look the director has translated her play to the screen The film follows the development of science from the 15th century to the 20th century from alchemy to the Manhattan Project and finally to the bombing of Hiroshima It involves human beings in a search for knowledge that implies accumulating power Ms Akalaitis said And because were human the power gets out of control and the knowledge doesnt stay pure Ms Akalaitis said the biggest challenge was trying to make a movie that did not have a linear psychological story where the story was history in this case of nuclear power One change from the play is a scene that features teenage girls at a highschool science fair shot in the style of a 1950s science information film In the play the same point was made by an exhibition of high school science projects in the theaters lobby There was also a certain element of a cinema homage to certain styles in film Ms Akalaitis said In the Faust scene I was thinking of Cocteau and I tried to make the look of the press conference be reminiscent of Fassbinder for example Cinerama May Get A Second Chance Remember Cinerama Developed by Fred Waller this descendant of such processes as Cineorama Polyvision and Vitarama celebrated its birthday on Sept 30 Thirtyfour years ago an audience sat in New Yorks Broadway Theater and watched Lowell Thomas the producer of Cineramas first three features on a traditional screen talking about the development of the moving picture Then the curtains opened and a vast threesection curved screen 75 feet across and 55 feet high emerged Reporters who covered the story said that the audience was stunned This Is Cinerama with its famous rollercoaster ride that made the viewer feel the thrill of sitting in its front seat was an overnight sensation For many reasons Cinerama did not have the spectacular future its opening seemed to augur After the early 60s it largely disappeared leaving in its wake the singlelens widescreen process that movies have used ever since George Condon who worked for Lowell Thomas 30 years ago and is an impassioned devotee of the Cinerama process is determined to bring it back Mr Condon said it took him four years to find the engineers he needed to redesign the Cinerama cameras and projectors He hired them to design one projector and one camera instead of the three each required before They are also working on perfecting closeups  a goal that Mr Condon says is two to three years away When its done Mr Condon intends to remake This Is Cinerama and install it in a Broadway theater We can show vast America he said We can put a space camera on the shuttle we can do ballet and opera and it would give an exact vision of what you see onstage Will the process fare any better this time Mr Condon says he thinks so He is looking for more financial backers who agree with him
The Wrong Way to Pick Judges,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/opinion/the-wrong-way-to-pick-judges.html,It is sometimes said that a Federal judge is a lawyer who knew a senator The cynical adage contains more than a grain of truth since it describes the traditional mechanism for selecting candidates for the Federal bench sponsorship by a senator of the incumbent Presidents political party As a Republican conservative I am personally distressed that the Reagan Administration is well on the way to compounding the worst features of a partisan spoils system The Administration is going beyond mere political affiliation and is applying an ideological strain of such narrow gauge that it filters out the vast majority of American lawyers There is no doubt that other Presidents have searched for judicial candidates who shared their vision of the Constitution or used political affiliation as a criterion for judicial selection But there are several flaws in that claimed defense for this Administrations behavior First it distorts the historical record While many Presidents from George Washington forward have considered a lawyers overall constitutional philosophy in deciding whether to nominate him or occasionally her there are only rare instances in which a President focused on how a candidate would vote on a particular issue or type of issue The Administrations repeated refrain that we won the elections is particularly misguided The Constitution gives life tenure to Federal judges in order to assure that they are above the political fray They are not supposed to be responsive to a particular quadrennial election Elections are not referendums on the administration of justice Nor do they license any President to reshape the constitutional system by creating a monolithic Federal judiciary Second most Presidents have sought prominent experienced lawyers for judicial appointment either through their own search processes or through senatorial proposals Political affiliation has provided a source of recognition not a litmus test for philosophical orthodoxy Over time this pattern has created a Federal judiciary rich in diversity and perspective Today the message is quite different ideology is the primary qualification and it is a candidates demonstrated orthodoxy that brings his name before the President and ultimately before the Senate Unique in our nations history the current Justice Department has been processing any judicial candidate through a series of officials whose primary duty is to assess the candidates ideological purity One major reason why this Administration has chosen an unusually high percentage of law professors to serve on major appellate courts is that they are more likely than practicing lawyers to have committed themselves to a set of sharply defined doctrines Thus the Administration finds it easier to predict how they will vote Although the President has promoted a number of judges of high quality by anyones standards the bitter fight over Daniel Manions nomination vividly illustrated that the President now has to dip down further down into the barrel of ideologically screened lawyers Mr Reagan mobilized all of his prestige in order to force through the nomination of a lawyer whom only a bare majority of the ABA evaluation committee considered minimally qualified Yet the Manion nomination is simply the most glaring example of a distressing trend Most of the Presidents early choices were  apart from their philosophy  mature experienced wellregarded lawyers That supply apparently has been virtually exhausted and Mr Reagan is turning increasingly to marginal candidates with little seasoning or experience in the world of law practice but full of ideological zeal Third after a succession of political scandals linked by the common defense that everybody does it the President should offer a better excuse for his standards for choosing judges The American people have a right to insist that a President who has the unique privilege of appointing fully half of the nations Federal judges should strive for candidates of the highest quality and should be encouraging senators and the Justice Department to offer him people who have the capaciousness of mind and the breadth of experience to equip them to administer justice into the 21st century Instead the President accepts and indeed appears to prefer candidates who fit the most rigid and stagnant stereotype of conservatism The experience in Washington highlights this myopia Although there are more than 45000 members of the District of Columbia Bar Administration officials have declared both privately and publicly that they are finding it virtually impossible to locate even minimally qualified Washington lawyers who are also ideologically acceptable for appointment to the United States Court of Appeals All of this has a special sting for me I was once a participant in the Administrations judicial selection process and now have been disqualified by it I have always considered myself a conservative Republican at least by traditional standards In 1964 I cochaired the Columbia University Students for Goldwater a small group as the election showed During the Nixon Administration I served in the Justice Department as the law and order Deputy Solicitor General responsible for handling the Governments criminal cases in the Supreme Court As one of a handful of registered Republicans living in Washington I supported Ronald Reagans election in 1980 and his reelection in 1984 I even think the Supreme Courts abortion decisions are bad law Indeed in 1981 Mr Reagan appointed me as his representative on a panel that screens candidates for the President to name to District of Columbia local courts Yet I have experienced firsthand the Justice Departments version of a jurisprudential Holy Office From time to time when vacancies have opened on the Federal appellate court in Washington my name has been floated as a candidate Key Justice Department officials however regularly have passed the word that they view me as too liberal and not politically reliable They have indicated that my involvement in two civil rights groups the Washington Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law and the ABA Section of Individual Rights and Responsibilities perhaps compounded by my service as the senior Republican in the Watergate Special Prosecutors office a dozen years ago disqualifies me from consideration If I am a dangerous and subversive radical I wonder what kind of lawyer is adequately safe by current standards Of course with a handful of exceptions within which I do not number myself no lawyer deserves to be appointed a Federal judge I worry though when the people advising the President view concern about human rights as somehow inconsistent with true conservatism Both the President and the country are badly served by a judicial selection policy that avowedly focuses solely on the narrowest and most extreme slice of the American bar
Dearie and O'Connor To Discuss Church Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/nyregion/dearie-and-o-connor-to-discuss-church-ban.html,Assemblyman John C Dearie is to meet with John Cardinal OConnor today in an effort to reverse a ban on the Assemblymans speaking at events sponsored by his local Roman Catholic parish Mr Dearie requested the meeting after the pastor of his Bronx parish St Raymonds said that he had been instructed by the Cardinals house to bar the Assemblyman from speaking because he had voted in favor of using Medicaid funds to pay for abortions Cardinal OConnor has since denied taking any personal role in barring Mr Dearie But he has left open the possibility that an aide might have done so Mr Dearie said that under one proposal he wanted the Cardinal to consider he would be allowed to speak in the parish on issues other than abortion and Medicaid Mr Dearie who is 46 years old has been an active member of the parish all his life Msgr Peter Finn a spokesman for the Cardinal confirmed that a meeting was planned for today but he had no other comment Im a little upset that hes advertising the meeting he said Its private and we dont discuss private meetings
CUOMO REAFFIRMS HIS ADHERENCE TO TEACHINGS OF CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/03/nyregion/cuomo-reaffirms-his-adherence-to-teachings-of-church.html,Governor Cuomo sought last night to separate himself from theological dissidents in the Roman Catholic Church and reaffirmed his own adherence to church teachings After a recent weeklong debate in the press with John Cardinal OConnor of the New York Archdiocese the Governor went last night to St James Cathedral the seat of the Brooklyn Diocese to distinguish between two kinds of dissent  the theological and the political I do not come here as a theologian  I do not have that competence Mr Cuomo said at a forum at the cathedral adding later I am here as a politician and public official who has found that trying to be both as a Catholic has raised some questions The Governor said his dispute with church leaders was a political one over the extent that Roman Catholics in public office were obligated to apply church teaching to government policy He said that argument was far different from the current theological debate between the church hierarchy and liberal theologians and made clear that he was not qualified to participate in that debate Nevertheless without endorsing the views of the theological dissenters the Governor went out of his way to say that he did not think that dissent itself was harmful to the church How after all he asked has the church changed and developed through the centuries except through discussion and argument We ought not to be afraid of that he said later because in the long run we will be stronger for it if we manage it well The Governors comments  in a 25minute speech and in an hourlong questionandanswer session that followed  were the latest in what has been a running twoyear series of comments by him on the problems faced by a Roman Catholic in balancing his religion with his responsibilities in public office Mr Cuomo much to the annoyance of the Cardinal has argued that a Catholic is not obligated to follow church teachings in executing public policy And he strongly reaffirmed that stand last night In his most recent debate with the Cardinal the Governor took issue with an archdiocesan policy issued in August that prohibits those who are opposed to church teaching from speaking at parishsponsoredevents But Mr Cuomo said the policy of the Cardinal who was referred to by one questioner as the big boy across the river did not apply to him because he personally followed church teachings Referring to those teachings Mr Cuomo said I agree with the bishops and the Cardinal  well Im not sure about the Cardinal  but with the Pope certainly The archdiocesan policy on speakers was issued as the Vatican has been cracking down on dissent in the American church Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle was recently ordered to relinquish much of his authority because he tolerated liberal practices involving marriage annulment and liturgy And the Rev Charles E Curran who holds liberal views on birth control and other sexual matters was stripped of his license to teach theology at the Catholic University of America in Washington We are living through a time of turbulence in the churchs history the Governor said adding later But I think that we should be neither surprised nor feel seriously threatened by disagreement among bishops and theologians or bishops and politicians in areas that dont touch the vital central core of our belief It is not uncommon he continued for people who share a great deal people even part of the same family to find themselves sometimes at odds their closeness sometimes marred by suspicion or distrust Emphasis on Agreement Mr Cuomo did not back down from his comments last month taking issue with the archdiocesan policy on speakers But the overall tone of his speech stressed how much he agreed with not disagreed with  the church hierarchy and he declared that any disputes within the church were overshadowed by Catholics shared faith At one point the Governor vigorously defended the Cardinal against allegations by one questioner that the archdiocese was not doing enough to help the poor But when being pressed by a priest Msgr Michael Wrenn that he was not using his position as Governor to block abortion Mr Cuomo grew agitated suggesting that the church was selectively enforcing its teachings on some matters but not on ones that were widely unpopular among Catholics in general Why isnt the church calling on the Governor of New York to strike all the familyplanning money Mr Cuomo asked Why arent you coming to the microphone Father to ask about that He drew sustained applause from the audience of 500 spectators hundreds of whom sat fanning themselves with programs in the stifling auditorium adjacent to the sanctuary Mr Cuomo was invited to speak at the forum  the first in what the parish hopes will be an annual speech by a prominent member of the Catholic laity  last April before his most recent dispute with Cardinal OConnor A spokesman for the Brooklyn diocese Frank DeRosa said yesterday that Bishop Francis J Mugavero the head of the diocese regretted that Mr Cuomo had been invited
"SENATE APPROVES $557.6 BILLION IN SPENDING, EXCEEDING '87 TARGET",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/04/us/senate-approves-557.6-billion-in-spending-exceeding-87-target.html,A weary Senate today approved a 5576 billion bill to finance Government programs for 1987 including 154 billion to fight drugs a measure that pushed spending above a limit approved earlier in the budget resolution for the year The Senate approved the money for the drug program on a voice vote The overall bill which combines 13 appropriation bills was then approved 82 to 13 The Senate action today if agreed to by the House would allow the deficit for the fiscal year 1987 which began Wednesday to increase to pay for the program The House has approved a 21 billion drug program that makes cuts in military and nonmilitary programs to pay for the increase Differs From House Bill The Senate appropriation bill now goes to what is expected to be difficult conference with the House of Representatives which has approved a 562 billion version There is the strong possibility of a Presidential veto of an eventual compromise which could interrupt the drive to adjourn Congress next week While the Senate was concerned about fiscal restraint the electionyear drive for an antidrug program and the Senates unwillingness to approve other spending reductions to offset the increase swept these concerns aside On Tuesday when the Senate voted 97 to 2 to approve details of the program to control illicit drugs it also adopted a resolution saying it would find new sources of money for it rather than cutting existing programs The drug program would increase penalties for dealers and step up enforcement efforts The chairman of the Senate Budget Committee Pete V Domenici Republican of New Mexico told his colleagues that the increase would not be enough to break the 154 billion deficit ceiling for 1987 set by the budgetbalancing law The Reagan Administration generally supports the Senate version of the bill which covers the fiscal year that began Wednesday Since then the Government has been running on an eightday stopgap spending bill Provisions on Arms Control But the House version includes many provisions that if incorporated in a HouseSenate compromise would force the President Reagan to veto the bill the Administration says Among these are five arms control proposals the President opposes a move to gradually close down the Civil Rights Commission and the possible rehiring of air traffic controllers dismissed by the Admistration in 1981 after an illegal strike The House included in its version of the bill a oneyear freeze on spending for all but the smallest underground nuclear tests a prohibition on the production of weapons that would violate the unratified 1979 treaty on strategic arms a freeze on the program for a defense against missiles a ban on tests of antisatellite weapons in space and a ban on production of new chemical weapons In addition the Administration wants the higher figures of 292 billion for the military and 13 billion in foreign assistance that are in the Senate bill Issues May Be Put Off Congressional sources said that House and Senate negotiators on arms control were discussing putting off a resolution of the issues until January This would be done by reaching an agreement that would guarantee the HouseSenate negotiators would resume work on a compromise package at the beginning of the new year and the new Congress One way to do this is to terminate financing for a program like the antimissile research program the Presidents Strategic Defense Initiative in January and tie the arms control issues to the legislation to resume financing However reaching a compromise on the omnibus appropriation bill and the arms control provisions just as the President prepares to meet in Iceland with the Soviet leader Mikhail S Gorbachev is just one of the many obstacles the Congress faces before adjournment HouseSenate negotiators working on a separate package of 13 billion to 15 billion to reduce the deficit were still at odds The Administration which initially supported the Senateapproved version was indicating a veto of a possible compromise was likely A third bill now in conference between the House and Senate must be approved to raise the debt ceiling so the Government can continue to borrow to pay its bills Hours Take Their Toll Today the final Senate vote on the comprehensive appropriation bill came after a week of debate and after the Senate drove itself to near exhaustion in 21 hours of debate from 830 AM Thursday to 527 AM today then returning at 930 this morning Senator Robert C Bryd of West Virginia the Democratic leader demanded on the Senate floor early this morning that the Republican leader Bob Dole of Kansas let the weary senators go home It doesnt do any good if a Senator dies on this floor Mr Byrd said Were going to look silly Ive had enough of it Mr Byrd said he would hold the floor for eight hours preventing any action and tell his Democrats to go home if Mr Dole did not Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon who is chairman of the Senate Appropriations Committee had insisted just as adamantly that the Senate continue working But Mr Dole recessed the Senate This morning when debate resumed Mr Hatfield showed the effects of the prolonged debate He spoke with a barely audible croak as he guided the bill to approval Hundreds of Amendments More than 100 amendments were considered most of them electionyear proposals unrelated to the approriation bill And the Republican leadership defeated most of them on the procedural challenge that were not germaine Among the proposals defeated were the repeal of taxexempt status for institutions that provide abortions two amendments to reduce or withhold the United States contribution to the United Nations a ban on Federal funds for programs that do not require parental consent for use of contraceptives by minors and deletion of 18 million for the National Endowment for Democracy But while these broad amendments were set aside the Senate approved a host of proposals many of them of special interest to their sponsors Among these are the naming of courthouses a ban on further construction of the new United States embassy in Moscow until a study is done of defects in construction approval of use of surplus Polish currency held by the Government to support churchsponsored programs in Poland reimbursement of moving expenses that the Navy said it should have paid to a Virginia woman for a move from Hawaii and the cutoff of funds for a pilot preinspection program by the Customs Service in Shannon Ireland which was taking work away from a facility in Bangor Me Also approved was 1 million for a study of ways to stop the influx of killer bees into the United States an amendment by Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr the retiring Maryland Republican
Cardinal and Dearie Meet on Ban,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/04/nyregion/cardinal-and-dearie-meet-on-ban.html,John Cardinal OConnor and Assemblyman John C Dearie met for an hour and 15 minutes yesterday to discuss a ban on the Assemblymans speaking at events sponsored by his local Roman Catholic parish The meeting at the Cardinals midtown office ended with no apparent decision on Mr Dearies request that the ban be lifted But the Assemblyman said that both he and the Cardinal had agreed to keep communications open Mr Dearie was banned from speaking at the parish St Raymonds in the Bronx because he had voted in favor of using Medicaid funds to pay for abortions The Assemblyman a Democrat declined to give details of the meeting calling it private He said only that it was enormously frank and very warm A spokesman for the Archdiocese of New York Joseph Zwilling said the Cardinal had no comment on the meeting

A LIFE ON THE COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/magazine/a-life-on-the-court.html,SHORTLY BEFORE 10 tomorrow morning as the United States Supreme Court begins its 1986 October term Justice William J Brennan Jr will leave his chambers turn right then left toward the small lockerlined robing room There he will slip his black judicial robe over his suit before crossing the corridor to await along with his colleagues for 10 oclock precisely to arrive At that time a short electronic beep will sound followed immediately by the sound of the marshals gavel Brennan will pass through the red velvet curtain that divides the anteroom from the courtroom to take his place on the mahogany bench just to the right of the Chief Justice the seat traditionally occupied by the Associate Justice with the greatest seniority Tomorrow will mark the beginning of Justice Brennans 30th year on the Court He is 80 years old and very fit in part as a result of daily sessions on his exercise bicycle Only two Justices appointed in this century William O Douglas and Hugo L Black have sat on the High Court longer than Brennan During his tenure he has written not only leading but landmark cases And yet despite his colorful personality his long tenure and the enormous impact he has made on American life Brennan remains like all of the Justices relatively unknown to most people This is not because the public or the press has lacked curiosity It is the result of the traditions of the Court With the exception of the intelligence agencies no institution in American political life operates with such secrecy The Courts decisionmaking meetings known as conferences are closed not only to the public but to the staff Arguments before the Court are not televised nor broadcast on radio Internal rules and procedures are unpublished and are unknown even to those who appear regularly before the Court Appointed for life Justices do not attend political meetings make speeches on behalf of candidates nor appear on Sunday morning newsmaker shows Moreover even when Justices are publicly criticized their practice is to remain silent The public is rarely given a glimpse of why they think the way they do Three weeks ago for instance an official of the Justice Department attacked Brennan In a speech at the University of Missouri School of Law William Bradford Reynolds the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights said that the Justice has allowed his liberal orthodoxy to shape his jurisprudence and described Brennans radical egalitarianism as a major threat to individual liberty Not surprisingly Justice Brennan declined to answer the charges or comment on this particular attack But to judge from his more general comments below he finds remarks such as Reynoldss puzzling He takes a long view of these matters and says that in time he might even be thought of as Brennan the rightwinger From July 1985 through July 1986 I served as one of four law clerks to Justice Brennan The clerkships are oneyear appointments made by the Justice to recent law school graduates In addition to his secretary and messenger the four of us comprised the Justices entire staff Our job involved being research assistants sounding boards writers of memos and drafters of opinions as well as staplers collaters brewers and bringers of coffee Justice Brennans law clerks are especially fortunate because of the mans command of the Courts history and the access he affords to his younger colleagues He is also easily the warmest member of the Court famous for his charm always linking arms with his colleagues or reaching out for a hand or a shoulder The Brennan clerks are given a much greener light than the clerks of some other Justices to talk about cases He told us we were free to discuss his views with other law clerks We were also in a good position to tell him what we thought the views of the other Justices might turn out to be He said to us I take help from wherever and from whomever I can get it When I first met him the Justice noted that I was born in 1956 the year he was appointed to the Court by President Dwight D Eisenhower Brennan has participated in more than a quarter of the cases decided by the Court in this century Including dissents and concurrences he has written more opinions than any other Justice in the history of the United States with the exception of Douglas His footprints are everywhere says Judge Abner J Mikva a judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit and a friend of Brennan His influence can be felt in nearly every area of the law Everything I am the Justice told us I am because of my father William J Brennan Sr had emigrated from County Roscommon Ireland in 1893 and settled in Newark He stoked fires at the Ballantine brewery there and later became a labor leader and an elected public official in Newark William Jr was born in Newark in 1906 the second of eight children As Justice Brennan tells it his father became particularly friendly with some very prominent lawyers and asked them often to his house He watched them and decided he was going to make a lawyer of me by golly the son says Brennan Jr was an honor student at the University of Pennsylvanias Wharton School He completed Harvard Law School on scholarship after his father died graduating in the top 10 percent of his class In 1928 while at law school he married Marjorie Leonard with whom he eventually had three children She died in 1982 The following year Brennan married the former Mary Fowler a woman then in her 60s and his secretary for more than 26 years Brennan has eight grandchildren Upon receiving his law degree in 1931 he began practicing with a Newark law firm becoming a partner in 1937 Five years later he resigned to accept a commission in the Army and served until 1945 He then returned to his firm as a name partner In 1949 Brennan again resigned from private practice this time to accept the nomination of Gov Alfred E Driscoll a Republican to a judgeship on the New Jersey Superior Court One year later he was elevated to the Appellate Division of the Superior Court then in 1952 to the New Jersey Supreme Court where he remained until President Eisenhower appointed him to the Supreme Court of the United States I asked Justice Brennan if his father would have been surprised to see him as a Justice No he answered he would have expected it Justice Brennan perhaps better than any living person understands the workings of the Court Accordingly in recent years his law clerks have sought  and generally failed  to persuade him to share his views by giving interviews to the press I write them I dont explain them has been his standard response to these requests echoing almost every judges conviction that written judicial opinions need no embellishment But as the Justices 80th birthday and his 30th anniversary on the Court approached and the requests from the press mounted we law clerks sensed he was beginning to change his mind In late June as the work of the Court tapered off I asked him to discuss with me on the record his work as a Justice and his life on and off the Court He agreed stipulating that the interviews would appear in a questionandanswer format Shortly before we began the first of our summer conversations President Reagan nominated William H Rehnquist to be the next Chief Justice and Antonin Scalia to be a new Associate Justice the first since Sandra Day OConnor was appointed in 1981 Would this lead to a dramatic shift in the direction of the Court To what degree do a Justices personal views inevitably determine his or her vote on a particular case What finally is it like to live a life on the court QUESTION You are often described in the press and have been attacked by members of the current Administration as the Justice on the extreme left Are you at all surprised to find yourself labeled that way ANSWER Quite honestly I dont understand it Anyone familiar with what I have done here the opinions and anyone with historical perspective would have to know that I am not on the extreme left It does make me chuckle I have never gone as far as the extreme left on the Court let alone the country How would you characterize Justices Black and Douglas We didnt see eye to eye in so many things They were I suppose far to the left of me Q It doesnt bother you A No People have short memories and times change Maybe one day someone will talk about Brennan the rightwinger Q When you sat in the Oval Office with President Eisenhower back in 1956 and heard him offer you the job of an Associate Justice on the Supreme Court did you think This man doesnt know what he is letting himself in for A Never gave it a thought Very frankly the difference between the responsibility of this Court and the responsibility of a state supreme court particularly in those days when we hadnt yet extended the Bill of Rights to the states  is just vast Enormous There is nothing that you do that prepares you for this job Even Felix Frankfurter used to say that his lifelong study of the Court never really prepared him for this job You simply cannot study it from afar and expect to know it You simply cannot know how you will respond to the legal issues as a Justice as opposed to a law professor or a judge on a court of appeals or even a state supreme court I know that was certainly true of me Q Burger is gone Rehnquist is Chief Justice Scalia is an Associate Justice Is the Court  and the country  about to experience momentous change A Thats a hard perhaps even impossible question Its been observed that in terms of personnel a conservative has been replaced by another conservative and that for that reason there may be no change in terms of votes in individual cases assuming of course that Chief Justice Rehnquist votes in the future as he has in the past However in an institution this small personalities play an important role Its inevitable when you have just nine people How those people get along how they relate what ideas they have how flexible or intractable they are are all of enormous significance Q What kind of a Chief Justice do you expect Justice Rehnquist to make A Im not sure what value predictions have and of course we will know soon enough But I do think that Bill is not going to be a loner to the extent that he has been one I think the figure that appeared in the press was that he had dissented by himself in 54 cases I think you will see less of that This means he may have to moderate some of his positions My guess is that he is going to do it Also with the extra work that goes with being Chief Justice he may have to stop writing books and give fewer speeches Didnt I see that he was in a play this year His acting career may also be in jeopardy Q What about Antonin Scalia Do you know him A Weve met Hes delightful If what they say about him is true he will be great fun to have as a colleague But I would rather not speculateLike everybody else I will wait to read his opinions Q In addition to being thought of as a great liberal you seem to have the reputation of being the playmaker of the Court the consensus builder who somehow manages in case after case to get five votes for very liberal opinions Do you think that is accurate A I have always had an uneasy feeling about that I dont know if it is completely accurate I dont think I do anything differently What do we do in these chambers We have an opinion to write We think about it and then we talk about it and then write it and we circulate it and we get suggestions and perhaps we make some changes and then we end up with five votes What is so special about that Q I suppose the success rate has been special A Perhaps Doesnt that mean only that we are doing our work well Writing sound opinions that are persuasive to at least four others It really isnt very mysterious or complex what we do Just look at how we work in these chambers We debate the issues the merits and when it comes time to write we discuss the various possible approaches We ask about some of the approaches Will this be rejected by Lewis Powell or Harry Blackmun Will Thurgood agree with this Has John Stevens written any cases which may suggest how he is thinking and about which we should be aware What does Sandra think You try to get in advance of circulation a sense of what will sell what the others can accept And you write it that way and when it works out  and maybe you have suggestions that come in and perhaps you make substantial revisions  but when it works out and you have a Court you are delighted I dont think what I did when Earl Warren was here is any different than what I did when Warren Burger was Chief or what I intend to do now that Bill Rehnquist is Chief That is the job as I see it The implication about the playmaker phrase that I reject is that you go running around the building talking shaking hands putting your arm around everyone Only once did I go around and talk to everybody and that was on the Nixon tapes case I thought that case in the context of the times called for the kind of opinion we had in 1958 with Cooper v Aaron a critically important desegregation case with everybody signing the opinion to emphasize the fact that we were unanimous And I went around to see everyone and tried to sell that idea and of course it was a complete failure Nobody agreed Not one So I suppose it is a good thing I have not tried to do business that way over the years If I have been successful it is because of the advance preparation the hard work the careful thinking that we try to do in here Q The playmaker reputation generally seems to go hand in hand with accounts of your relationship with Earl Warren Do you remember your first impressions of him A Oh yes My first impression was that he and I werent going to have any difficulty in getting along Q Isnt that something of an understatement A As things developed yes But not as a first impression Q Where and when did the first meeting take place A The very day I learned that I was to be named to the Court Herbert Brownell who was the Attorney General at the time had shuttled me from the White House to the Department of Justice and then back to the White House to be introduced to the press After the press conference Brownell said we ought to get down to the Supreme Court and meet the Chief Justice And so Brownell Bill Rogers and I came here We had a lovely lunch and that was that The Chief and I made a date for me to come back to meet the others That was a famous day when Warren took me upstairs to Room 317 He opened the door and it was pitch dark and then he turned on the light and there were all my new colleagues huddled around a television watching the opening game of the 1956 World Series The Chief introduced me to each of my new colleagues and they each shook my hand and then someone said Put out the lights and they did And that was my introduction to the Brethren Q When did you realize that you and Chief Justice Warren were going to have a special relationship A Our relationship just developed just grew from the outset From the very beginning we did a lot of things together particularly in sports We were both very sportsminded especially about football and baseball and we often went to games Then with some frequency we would dine at one anothers homes but generally little was said about the Court As far as Court work was concerned we began to compare notes on cases and that finally led to a weekly meeting on Thursdays here in chambers before the conferences He would sit just where you are sitting now Q Why did he come in here to your chambers After all he was the Chief Justice A He believed in the old adage that he was Chief among equals He fought like the devil against increasing the disparity between what he got paid as Chief and what the Associate Justices received Q Was your relationship off the Court an intimate one A We were very close personally but I think probably the closeness was largely judicial Black always was further from us and Douglas was even further Its funny I suppose we just gravitated together We had more of the same approaches to the cases than the others Their analyses were not quite the same as ours they were a little bit more extreme as we were just saying than ours We were just kindred spirits on many of the issues that came to the Court Q Give me an example of how Black and Douglas were extreme A Well we were all for the same results And more often than not we did agree on the analysis but as for the First Amendment area for example Blacks and Douglass position was that when the Constitution directs that Congress shall make no law abridging freedom of speech that means no law and this was something that neither the Chief nor I could accept In our view there were limits And this extreme view of Black and Douglas carried into the libel area and obscenity area and religious area Very often we could all agree on a case but sometimes we couldnt In the New York Times case for example neither Black nor Douglas could join because it didnt go far enough for them Q If someone had asked you in 1963 or 1964 who your best friend was would it have been Earl Warren A Well that is interesting Somehow he was always the Chief Justice In that sense it might not have been something that he would have wanted but it was there anyway There has to be a distance between yourself and the Chief Justice He was always the Chief the Super Chief Q Did you call him the Super Chief A Yes but not to his face I think I first used it in an appreciation of him in the Harvard Law Review I just called him Chief Q Not Earl A Never That is just not the way it ever is Once Bill Rehnquist is confirmed he will never be anything but Chief to me Q What made Earl Warren so great a Chief Justice A He had everything He was hardworking he knew how to work with people He was marvelous with people He would take approaches that would often escape my eye He was just extraordinary Q Should the Chief Justice be a leader with respect to jurisprudence A I think the old expression is the massing of a point of view of a Court  of ensuring at least five votes for an opinion and on those cases that require it of seeking and getting nine votes a unanimous Court Of course John Marshall was the great master of that technique Earl Warren was also I suppose in a sense it is less doctrinal than it is institutional Q How did Warren do that Did he go to the other chambers to sound out the others A Oh yes he did it all the time Of course some Justices are more receptive to visits than others You know that my door is always open but that is not true throughout the building And of course Bill Douglas was often not even in the building  or in Washington for that matter Q What was Douglas like to work with A Well his great mistake Bills was his insistence and he repeated it time and time again  I have no soul to worry about but my own This was always his justification for his conduct as a Justice He was not a team player ordinarily Q Was that something he would actually say  about his soul A Oh yes a good number of times he said that when walking down the hall or talking oneonone in his chambers or mine Q And you would argue with him and tell him that he was wrong to take that view A Yes and I wasnt the only one that would do that I am sure Q What else does it take to be an effective Chief A A conviction that you have to be fair in the assignment of opinions  this ensures good feelings all around  and an extraordinary capacity for persuading others to a point of view Q What do you think the historical assessment will be of Chief Justice Burgers performance as a Chief Justice Many people feel that he lacked some of the qualities you describe as important A Yes I am afraid that is the contemporaneous assessment and will be the historical assessment as well Q Many have observed that Rehnquist is very personable Will this be to his advantage as Chief Justice A Its to all of the Justices advantage Q But not to Rehnquist especially A Its hard to know what that would mean Its not as simple as there being two sides on the Court or even a case I think people are very wrong who think that is the way it is Q Certainly thats the way the Burger Court was often characterized A I think if you look at a lot of important cases and areas abortion free speech the religion cases  the votes did not align the way a simple approach would expect Q Still didnt the Burger Court depart from the Warren Court A Perhaps in terms of direction and momentum yes But the times changed also Of course there have been some erosions in some areas for example the Fourth Amendment right not to be subject to unreasonable searches or seizures but I dont think its very accurate to speak of the Burger Court having unraveled the work of the Warren Court Some important decisions affirming personal liberties came down during Burgers years The abortion decision was not a legacy of the Warren Court but the Burger Court The first case to strike down the dealth penalty in a number of states came out of the Burger Court Also important cases involving the separation of church and state  prayer in school in particular  and the affirmativeaction cases this past term Q In 1967 when Warren was Chief Justice you did not write a single dissent and you averaged roughly four a term during his tenure This last term alone you wrote 26 dissents Was the changeover to the Burger Court very dramatic in terms of your role as a Justice A No I feel so strongly about that This Court is final on constitutional matters Outside of overruling itself only constitutional amendments can change the constitutional interpretations that the Court renders and because of that fact I have always felt that a member of this Court is dutybound to continue stating the constitutional principles that have governed his decisions even if they are in dissent against the day when they may no longer be in dissent It has happened so often in the history of the Court and must continue to happen that views that represent the minority position come to be understood as correct That is why I continue to dissent on the death penalty and in other areas and I am going to continue to do so because I am dutybound So the job hasnt changed I still work hard to interpret the Constitution as I believe it must be read The Court has of course changed and the results in some cases have changed They will change again Q Was the changeover personally disruptive A It was an inevitable change It had to be In a sense it became a bigger challenge and it made the occasions when you managed to have the majority of your colleagues agree with you sweeter than it had been We have certainly continued to prevail in many important areas In other words there is room for the old dog Q You were the first Democrat appointed to the Supreme Court by a Republican since Benjamin Cardozo was appointed by Herbert Hoover Did anybody in the Eisenhower Administration grill you about your politics or your judicial philosophy before you were offered the position A Oh there was no grilling at all Not a single question was asked Q No one asked you any questions about politics or policy A No although the press did ask When Jim Hagerty picked me up to take me to the press conference where my nomination was to be announced I was asked Did you vote for Eisenhower in 1952 I was able to say that I wasnt eligible to vote in 1952 since we had moved to a new county in 1952 and under New Jersey law you had to be a resident of the county where you wanted to vote for six months before you could vote Well I was then asked If you had been eligible to vote would you have voted for Eisenhower I said I really cant answer that  I dont know Q Do you believe the period we are going through now is different in the sense that the Administration really does have a specific agenda in terms of judicial appointments A I think it was different then My experience as far as I know was also the experience of those who followed  Stewart and Whittaker in the Eisenhower days And Justice Harlan who had preceded me never suggested to me that there had ever been any question of any kind Of course this isnt to say that the only concern was with the quality of the mind or the legal training But probably there was less concern with specific results in specific areas Q How does a new Justice learn the ropes and develop a style I know that Felix Frankfurter was your professor at Harvard When you first came to the Court was there any effort on his part or anyone elses to win you as an ideological ally A Well the interesting thing about Felix specifically is that he was absolutely superb in doing this without your being conscious of it His chambers were next to mine and he used to come in with some frequency and he would tell me much about the great giants that he had known and worked with and what brilliant contributions they had made He made conversation he flattered you he made you feel that it would be an honor to be associated with him and his crowd of giants Felix also worked socially I recall he had a dinner at his home for me and the guests were Dean Acheson and John Lord OBrian and I heard much in the discussion after dinner over brandy about the role of the Court and the role of the Justices I recall particularly the story that Acheson told of how Justice Brandeis for whom he had clerked on one occasion asked him to footnote an opinion which was to come down on Monday And Acheson footnoted the opinion and Monday came and Brandeis did not announce the opinion Acheson was amazed of course and asked the Justice afterward what had happened Brandeis took the opinion and pointed to a footnote that cited two cases state cases that Acheson had discovered and cited in the footnote Brandeis said I looked at those cases and they wont stand for the proposition for which they were cited And Acheson said he was grateful he wasnt fired The main reason for telling this story I realized later was to communicate that you had to be that meticulous about what you produced sitting on this Court Felix wanted me to understand that Q Did he finally give up on you A I suppose we reached an understanding We always were good friends He never stopped or gave up trying to persuade me in individual cases but he knew that I would not could not accept his approach across the board Q Were you aware of a change in yourself sometime after you arrived A I must say I wasnt conscious of the change although I suppose I did change It is hard to say why it happens All I can attribute it to is what I suggested that when you have actually to discharge the responsibility  not just think about it or talk about it  things go a lot differently Everyone thought Felix Frankfurter would be a flaming liberal when he came and there was a lot of reason to think he would And yet when he got here his conscience wouldnt let him because of his conviction that the judiciary should not be resolving many issues that in his view should be decided by the legislative or executive branch Talk about disappointing a President certainly Felix disillusioned FDR Q Do you think Justice OConnor is changing jurisprudentially A I think she has but I dont think it is a satisfactory answer to say she has moved to the left which I read or heard somewhere A change in a new Justice is so often a product of the significance of this responsibility  of being a Justice  and it is something that you simply have no idea of until you get it And when you get it  I dont care who has appointed you  there come issues that no matter what may be the popular or the Administrations or anyone elses view in conscience you find that you cant resolve the issue in that way The Constitution requires a different resolution and that is pretty obvious to you It is just so important that all Federal judges are independent not the voice of any Administration As a Justice feels more comfortable here the judicial independence tends to put some distance between the political people who were so excited initially about the appointment It is very interesting Sandra fitted in so quickly more quickly than I had expected She ceased immediately to be the first woman Justice and became just another Justice and quite a fine one Moreover she is delightful Q The Administration aside Justice OConnor may have disappointed some women who were hoping for more unequivocal support for the abortion right A Even so but the fact that there is a woman makes women generally feel a little more comfortable I think everyone is better off ultimately when a Justice is truly independentthinking Q There has for many years been a socalled Catholic seat on the Supreme Court and the same used to be said about a Jewish seat Since Abe Fortas left the Court in 1969 there has not been a Jewish Justice Do you think it is beyond the symbolic value important to have ethnic and cultural diversity on the Court A I do indeed I think there ought to be although I think it has got to be done very carefully There ought to be diversity in many respects localitywise for example Not everyone should come from the East or the West There ought to be diversity in political persuasions There ought to be a black a woman and of course religious diversity These are all segments of our pluralistic society and I think people are a little more comfortable when they see a broadly representative group It is more than a symbol People bring different experiences and insights to their work I believe that when President Reagan nominated Justice Scalia there was an express acknowledgment that his Italian heritage was a factor in the appointment Of course it is also true that individuals turn out to be disappointments to an ethnic group I have been a disappointment to some Roman Catholics Father Andrew Greeley wrote a piece in which he said that if the Roman Catholics who played a role in the Brennan selection had had any idea he would turn out the way he did he would have never been appointed Q How important was your religion to your appointment A It has been reported that Eisenhower was looking for a Catholic and even more important in order to emphasize the nonpartisanship of his Administration a Democrat from the Northeast You have to remember that the 1956 elections were coming up Eisenhower was also asked directly how he came to appoint me and he said  well we asked everybody who would be the best man for the job We asked our friends in California and they said Bill Brennan of New Jersey We asked our friends in the South and they said Bill Brennan this fellow up in New Jersey We asked Senators Governors business leaders and union men and they all recommended this Brennan fellow Q Have you ever had difficulty dealing with your own religious beliefs in terms of cases A No That is very interesting I really crossed that bridge in my confirmation hearing when initially the committee unanimously said it was most inappropriate to ask me whether as a Catholic I would follow the Constitution But then they did ask me And I had settled in my mind that I had an obligation under the Constitution which could not be influenced by any of my religious principles As a Roman Catholic I might do as a private citizen what a Roman Catholic does and that is one thing but to the extent that that conflicts with what I think the Constitution means or requires then my religious beliefs have to give way And as I say I settled that in my mind and that took care of it Q If the Constitution were being rewritten now and you were given the responsibility to decide whether there would be a right to abortion what would you do A I would say that in this society nobody can dictate for everyone else what m
st be done with respect to the most intimate choices private choices family decisions that individuals face I would adhere to what we have said And I dont know that I could ever agree that the right to privacy that is protected by the Bill of Rights should not be a part of a fundamental charter of a civilized society Q What is the most difficult decision you have had to make as a Justice A A couple of cases and I suppose particularly the schoolprayer cases The 1963 Schempp opinion is some 80 pages long The position I finally took took a long time to come around to In the face of my whole lifelong experience as a Roman Catholic to say that prayer was not an appropriate thing in public schools that gave me quite a hard time I struggled And of course Ive said some things I wish I hadnt Ive had 30 years to make mistakes Q Such as A Oh I prefer to correct myself in opinions and I have After all Ive also had 30 years to make those corrections Q Was there a case or line of cases that have been singularly disappointing not to prevail on A I dont know whether to prevail on I do wish we had found a solution to the definitional horror of obscenity Perhaps it has been my fault this has been a very difficult issue which we seemed to have not gotten quite right Q You seem to possess an abiding faith that the most difficult problems are susceptible to legal resolution A I certainly believe so We must never give up trying because how are we going to have an ordered society unless the problems are redressable somehow by law I dont mean necessarily law as pronounced by the judges Major problems can be as effectively addressed by the Congress as it demonstrated in Title VII of the Civil Rights Act Q Where do you think that faith of yours in the law comes from A I can only suggest I dont know if by osmosis but I surely came away from law school with that I dont know if I started with it It is what is so magnificent about law Q You have been a lawyer for almost 60 years Have you ever awakened in the morning and wondered what it would have been like to have tried something else A Never Q Always happy with the choice A I would have loved to have been a great quarterback Q A playmaker perhaps A Oh I dont know On my team plays could have been called by consensus Q Only 10 other Justices in the history of this country have served 30 years as you will beginning this term Is it a particular time for reflection A No It is another term with a lot of work to do,,
TEXAS SAYS CENTER USES DECEPTION TO STOP ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/us/texas-says-center-uses-deception-to-stop-abortion.html,The realization usually sets in when the films narrator says that abortion is the equivalent of murder That is when many women first understand that the Pregnancy Problem Center does not perform abortions that in fact the center personnel are there to talk them or frighten them out of the procedure rather than to help them through it A Texas Assistant Attorney General Steve Gardner believes that kind of confusion is the purpose of the centers carefully vague advertisements and what he says are evasive answers to questions over the telephone So the state has gone to court to seek a revocation of the centers corporate charter on the ground that it is using deceptive trade practices Mr Gardner says women are being emotionally harmed when they go to the center seeking abortions and instead are shown films of aborted fetuses If women are deceived it is selfdeception said Chuck Pelletier who opened the center here in 1984 But he agrees that his workers avoid telling callers that abortions are not performed there And he says that at least half the women who visit the center are looking for abortions 100 Similar Centers in Country Mr Pelletiers center is one of at least 100 such facilities around the country set up to resemble abortion clinics but with an opposite intent according to the Texas Attorney Generals office Several such centers in other states are also facing legal challenges the Texas authorities said Many of the centers were created according to the guidelines of the Pearson Foundation an antiabortion group begun in St Louis by Robert J Pearson The Pearson Foundations guidebook on How to Operate a ProLife Center That Looks and Sounds Like an Abortion Clinic has been entered into the court record here The book advises that an ideal site is an office space near the entrance to an abortion clinic If the girl who would be going to the abortion chamber sees your office first with a similar name the book says she will probably come into your center The book also advises workers to be persistent with callers You want to give the woman information but not too much it says Be put off by nothing The stakes are life and death A phone put back on the receiver with no appointment made probably will mean death for the unborn baby and perhaps for the soul of the mother Mr Pelletier said that a thousand babies are alive today because of his center He estimated that more than 75 percent of the pregnant women who have come to the center have let their babies live Testimony was taken this week from seven women three by deposition in Tarrant County District Court where the center is charged with violating the Deceptive Trade Practices Law The women told about the films the dawning realization of what type of center they were in the personal questions from counselors and of the fear the centers counselors tried to instill in them about the abortion process In addition to revoking the centers charter which would deprive it of its nonprofit status the state is asking for 10000 in civil penalties and a stop to the practices that make the center appear to be an abortion clinic Mr Pelletier says he does not know how his center will be able to operate if it loses its corporate charter He says the center is financed by many small donations Opposed to Deceiving Women Mr Gardner emphasizes that the issue of abortion is not being debated in the trial The state is not proabortion or antiabortion he said But it is definitely opposed to deceiving women who are pregnant and possibly emotionally distraught Mr Pelletier said that because his business was not profitseeking it should not be bound by the Deceptive Trade Practices Law He also said that nothing was permanently hidden from the pregnant women who come to the center All that really matters is the timing he said We disclose everything we do He said workers were instructed not to lie to callers but to avoid answering some of their questions
First Monday in October,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/opinion/first-monday-in-october.html,The summers debate about William Rehnquists fitness to be Chief Justice battered the Supreme Court as much as its new leader It aroused fear among legal scholars and politicians that a chief with a 15year record of hostility to civil rights and civil liberties joined by a conservative new Justice Antonin Scalia would produce fundamental changes in law To the extent that such fears are warranted they hurt the Court  and that should trouble the justices as much as the public The speculation hurts by disparaging the ideal of a government of laws and not of men The claim that objective justice is a myth hardly mitigates the problem Americans treasure the ideal as worth pursuing even if it can never be fully realized They look to the courts for wisdom objectivity and fairness of the sort they never expect from the other branches of government The Courts ability to deliver depends in part on the statesmanship of its Chief Justice He can do much to insure that his colleagues honor their judicial duty instead of pursuing a mostly political agenda He can help the Court to live with precedent departing only in principled directions that can be convincingly charted He can help it resist the temptation to rekindle debates over issues like abortion and the exclusionary rule unless case and circumstance clearly require it Some of those who most rejoice in the Rehnquist and Scalia appointments protest a double standard liberals feel free to shatter precedents when theyre in control so why should rightleaning justices submit to greater constraints On issues like abortion and the exclusionary rule at least that argument wont wash The Courts decisions about a womans liberty and right to privacy are hardly radical Illegally seized evidence is no more acceptable for use in American courts in 1986 than in 1914 when the exclusionary rule was fashioned Both positions grew out of experience and plainly evolving understandings of constitutional liberty Wisdom and fairness should transcend any political stance Some of the Courts finest moments have come when the objective judge overruled the opinionated lawyer Justice John Harlan deplored vulgarity yet upheld a mans right to write his contempt for the military draft on his jacket Justice Lewis Powell detested campus radicals but held that they had every right to organize Justice Rehnquist momentarily shedding his preVictorian personal views about women delivered the Courts first judgment that sexual harassment violated civil rights law On this first Monday in October let that splendid tradition and not just the election returns be uppermost in the justices minds
JUSTICES TO OPEN 1986 TERM TODAY FACING KEY ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/06/us/justices-to-open-1986-term-today-facing-key-issues.html,With a new Chief Justice and a new member the Supreme Court will begin its 198687 term Monday facing issues that include racial disparities in death sentencing and the constitutionality of teaching creationism in public schools Job discrimination and the use of affirmative action as a remedy are among the contentious issues posed by the 91 cases the ideologically polarized High Court has agreed to hear in the coming months One of the employment cases on whether Federal law bars granting special benefits to pregnant employees has caused a deep split among feminists Another involves discrimination against people with such diseases as tuberculosis and AIDS Briefs Are Less Bold The Reagan Administration has filed briefs in these and other cases in support of its conservative civil rights policies It has opposed broad affirmative action plans special benefits for pregnant employees and the use of Federal law to combat discrimination against people infected with the virus that can cause acquired immune deficiency syndrome But Solicitor General Charles Frieds briefs so far this term seem generally less bold in tone than the last term when the Court rejected his aggressive arguments for abandoning its protection of abortion rights and for outlawing affirmative action preferences The Administration is keeping up the pressure on the lecture circuit though Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds recently made the most direct attack in many decades by a highranking official on a member of the Court He denounced Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr as reading radical egalitarianism and liberal orthodoxy into the Constitution 2 Changes at Court President Reagans elevation of William H Rehnquist to be Chief Justice and of Antonin Scalia to become an Associate Justice capped the most determined effort by any Administration in more than 40 years to entrench its ideology in the Federal courts These changes may sharpen the Courts ideological differences Chief Justice Rehnquist and Justice Scalia two fervent conservatives with formidable intellects will anchor the conservative wing But they do not appear the have enough allies to produce any immediate shift in the Courts voting patterns Here are some of the cases the Court has agreed to review Racial Discrimination And the Death Penalty The Court will hear arguments Oct 15 in a sweeping challenge to alleged racial discrimination in the administration of the death penalty in Georgia and elsewhere The appeal by a man sentenced to death for the murder of a white police officer in a robbery of an Atlanta furniture store in 1978 is based on statistics showing that in Georgia the killers of whites are far more likely to be sentenced to death than the killers of blacks Other studies have found similar disparities in other states Opponents of capital punishment say this suggests that judges and jurors place a lower value on the lives of black victims than of white victims If accepted by the Court the defendants argument that this systematic bias was unconstitutional would cast grave doubt on the death penalty as administered in many perhaps all of the 36 other states that have such laws Many experts however doubt the Court would take such a step It would amount to a virtual admission with nearly 1800 prisoners now on death row that the Courts elaborate efforts since 1972 to purge the deathsentencing process of racism and arbitrariness have failed A Federal appeals court rejected the defendants legal arguments ruling that racial disparities in capital sentencing would be unconstitutional only if there were proof that race was intentionally being taken into account It also said the study had shown no discrimination as to the race of the defendant McCleskey v Kemp No 846811 Disability Leave For Pregnant Employees Confronting an issue that has produced a major split among feminists the Court will consider whether Federal law bars preferential fringe benefits including disability leave and guaranteed reinstatement for pregnant employees While some feminists argue that employers should be required to accommodate women who have children others say special treatment for pregnant employees revives sexist stereotypes and makes employers reluctant to hire women of childbearing age The case involves a California law that requires employers to give up to four months of unpaid leave to employees who are unable to work because of pregnancy but not to other disabled employees The question is whether this violates the Federal Pregnancy Discrimination Act of 1978 The Federal law states that women affected by pregnancy childbirth or related medical conditions shall be treated the same for all employmentrelated purposes as other people who are similar in their ability or inability to work A Federal appellate court upheld the California law saying Congress did not intend to bar additional benefits for pregnant employees But some womens groups including the National Organization for Women have joined with business groups and the Justice Department in arguing that Congress intended to outlaw discrimination in favor of pregnant employees as well as against them The Justice Department and the business groups have urged the Court simply to strike down the California law and similar laws in Connecticut Massachusetts and Montana The National Organization for Women said the Court instead should extend to all disabled employees the special benefits mandated by state law for pregnant employees California Federal Savings  Loan v Guerra No 85494 Job Discrimination And Affirmative Action The Court has agreed for the first time to consider the legality of an affirmative action plan favoring women over men Together with another case involving preferences for blacks it may answer questions left open by three major rulings last term In those decisions the Court endorsed limited racial preferences for members of minority groups in hiring but only when narrowly tailored to redress past job discrimination It said the effect of layoffs on identifiable employees was so severe that racial preferences in layoffs would rarely if ever be justified This terms cases involve promotions One is an appeal by a veteran employee of Santa Clara County Calif a man who asserted that a lessqualified woman had been promoted ahead of him to be a road dispatcher under a plan to increase the number of women promoted The Justice Department filed a brief in the case supporting the mans argument that the county had violated the Federal law against sex discrimination It said the countys plan was not based on findings of past discrimination and had too severe an effect on men Womens and civil rights groups have defended the countys affirmative action plan as necessary to redress gross underrepresentation of women in the countys skilled job categories Johnson v Transportation Agency No 851129 In United States v Paradise No 85999 the Justice Department has urged the Court to overturn as plainly unconstitutional a lower court order requiring that one black Alabama state trooper be promoted to a higher rank for each white promoted The lower court ordered the 1for1 quota as part of a courtordered plan to cure a long history of intentional discrimination that had excluded blacks from the state police force until 1972 The Justice Department stressing that it had joined the black plaintiffs in suing to end discrimination said the lower court had gone too far by using a flat racial quota violating the rights of white troopers Another job rights case raises an issue that has become increasingly important as AIDS has spread Whether Federal law bars discrimination against sick people who are or are incorrectly thought to be contagious The case grew out of a Florida school boards dismissal of a teacher who had tuberculosis out of concern that she might infect her students The teacher sued under Section 504 of the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 which bars programs receiving Federal money from discriminating against anybody with a disability who was otherwise qualified The Justice Department supporting the school board in the Supreme Court has argued that Section 504 bars only discrimination based on the disabling effects of a disease not discrimination based on concern about contagiousness even if the concern is unreasonable In the Administrations view Federal law allows discrimination against victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome based on fear of contagion even though the medical authorities agree that AIDS cannot be spread through normal personal contact in the workplace The American Medical Association homosexual rights groups and others filed briefs in the case disputing the Administrations position School Board v Arline No 851277 Religion in Schools And the Workplace The Court is to rule on the constitutionality of a 1981 Louisiana law that requires the teaching of creation science in any public school that teaches the theory of evolution A Federal district court and a threejudge appellate panel struck the law down as an effort by fundamentalist Christians to promote religious belief in the biblical account of creation in violation of the First Amendment which prohibits an official establishment of religion The full United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit voted 8 to 7 to let these rulings stand In its Supreme Court appeal the state argued that creation science consists of scientific evidence and not religious concepts and is a legitimate alternative to the theory of evolution which the state said had not been proved correct Many prominent scientists have joined parents school officials the American Civil Liberies Union and others who sued to invalidate the law in arguing that it represents a religiously motivated effort dressed in pseudoscientific garb to distort the teaching of science Edwards v Aguillard No 851513 The Court has also agreed to consider whether a Federal statute barring religious discrimination in employment requires school oficials in Connecticut to accommodate a teachers religious practices by granting him more religious holidays a year than most other employees Ansonia Board of Education v Philbrook No 85495 In addition the Court has agreed to consider whether Florida violated a recently converted SeventhDay Adventists religious freedom by denying her unemployment compensation after she was dismissed from her job for refusing because of her new religion to work Friday nights or Saturdays Hobbie v Unemployment Appeals Commission No 85993 Election Laws And First Amendment Two cases involving corporate campaign spending and closed primaries present tensions between election laws and the First Amendment rights of free speech and association On Tuesday the Court will hear the Federal Election Commissions appeal of an appellate decision permitting nonprofit ideological corporations to spend directly on political campaigns The law prohibits all direct corporate spending The case Federal Election Commission v Massachusetts Citizens for Life No 85701 involves charges by the commission that the antiabortion nonprofit corporation acted illegally in spending 9812 in 1978 to print and distribute a newsletter that included candidates voting records on abortion issues The Election Commission said in its appeal that the appellate decision could open the way for any corporation to set up a separate ideological affiliate which could then funnel coporate money into poliical expenditures without having to disclose the actual source of the money The Court will hear arguments Wednesday in Connecticuts appeal of a Federal appellate ruling that it violated the state Republican Partys right of freedom of association by barring it from opening to all voters its primary elections for Congress and statewide offices The case Tashjian v Republican Party No 85766 could have an important impact nationally because more than 35 other states including New York and New Jersey have similar closed primary laws They bar citizens who have not affiliated themselves with a political party from voting in that partys primaries The Exclusionary Rule And Rights of Suspects The Court has been asked to expand the exception it created in 1984 to its rule that excludes the use of evidence in criminal trials if the evidence was seized in violation of the Fourth Amendment An Illinois law authorized warrantless inspections of automobile wrecking yards in which stolen cars are often found After the police had charged three men with possession of a stolen car based on such an inspection the law was held unconstitutional and a state court suppressed the evidence obtained in the search In its appeal supported by the Justice Department the state urged the Supreme Court to create a new exception to the exclusionary rule to allow the use of evidence seized in reasonable goodfaith reliance on a statute later held to be unconstitutional Illinois v Krull No 85608 The Court also has before it a trio of appeals by state prosecutors supported by the Justice Department from state court rulings that suppressed confessions by broadening the rules that require the police to warn suspects of their rights to remain silent and to have a lawyer present when they are questiond One case Colorado v Connelly No 85660 involves a man who spontaneously walked up to a Denver police officer and said he had killed someone After being told of his rights the man proceeded to confess in more detail the murder of a girl The Colorado Supreme Court barred prosecutors from using either the first statement or the more detailed confession It said psychiatric testimony showed the statements had been involuntary because the man was driven to confess by mental illness In Colorado v Spring No 851517 the Colorado Supreme Court suppressed a suspects statements implicating himself in a murder because Federal agents who had arrested him on other charges had not disclosed when they read him his rights that they would ask about the murder In Connecticut v Barrett No 85899 the Connecticut Supreme Court reversed a sexual assault conviction on the ground that the police should have stopped asking questions when the arrested suspect stated that he would answer questions orally but would not make a written statement in the absence of an attorney Pocket Veto Power And Rights of Congress The Court faces a major dispute between the President and Congress over Presidential pocket veto power and the right of Congress or its members to challenge Presidential actions in court The case is a Government appeal of a ruling by the United States Court of appeals for the District of Columbia that Mr Reagan could not use the pocket veto between two yearlong sessions of Congress In what may be the most important issue in the case the lower court also upheld by a 2to1 vote the legal standing of the Senate the bipartisan House leadership and 33 House Democrats to sue for a judicial ruling on the issue The Administration urged the High Court to rule broadly that none of them had standing and that judges may not entertain suits brought by Congress or its members to challenge the validity of Presidential actions The case began in 1983 with a bill passed by the House and the Senate conditioning military aid to El Salvador on human rights progess there Mr Reagan neither signed nor vetoed the bill within the time allotted by the Constitution In such an event Article I provides that the bill becomes law unless the Congress by their adjournment prevent its return in which case the President by figuratively keeping the bill in his pocket has effectively vetoed it and does not give Congress a chance to override the veto The appeals court held that the President may make a pocket veto only at the conclusion of a twoyear Congressional term when all pending legislative business comes to an end Thus it ruled the El Salvador aid provision automatically became law Even so the provision expired by its terms on Sept 30 1984 so the case is important mainly for the precedent it will set
Robertson Depicts Abortions As Racial Suicide in the West,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/06/us/robertson-depicts-abortions-as-racial-suicide-in-the-west.html,Working toward a potential Presidential campaign here Saturday night the evangelist Pat Robertson asserted that an increase in abortions was leading to racial suicide in the West Mr Robertson said abortion was causing a depopulation of the West that threatened the power of Western industrial nations He tied the trend to abortions In the United States there will be 40 million abortions performed between 1973 and 2000 he said What we are doing is committing racial suicide Mr Robertson said apparently referring to a reduction in the population of the developed nations of the West rather than to any particular racial group
FETUS RETURNED TO WOMB FOLLOWING SURGERY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/science/fetus-returned-to-womb-following-surgery.html,In a pioneering operation a team of California surgeons has removed a 23weekold fetus from his mothers womb successfully operated to correct a blocked urinary tract and then returned the unborn baby to the uterus and sewed the womb back up Nine weeks later Baby Mitchell was born alive and well at a Texas hospital near his parents home Last week a few weeks after his first birthday Mitchell was back in San Francisco for minor surgery that completed repairs on his urinary tract According to Dr Michael R Harrison the pediatric surgeon from the University of California at San Francisco who led the team Mitchell would have died in the uterus without the surgery Today hes doing fine said Dr Harrison He may have some kidney problems in future but Im confident hell do OK Dr Harrison is scheduled to present the first full medical report of Mitchells case to the American Academy of Pediatrics at its meeting in Washington later this month Medical experts familiar with the surgery say Mitchells operation is a dramatic milestone in the controversial new field of fetal therapy and fetal surgery This surgery was remarkable for having removed the child from the womb but it also occurred against a backdrop in which there is growing excitement and significant qualms over the possibilities of fetal surgery Only in recent years have other techniques been developed in which for example doctors use long needles to install shunts to drain excess fluid from the infants bladders or brains Baby Mitchells successful operation is a remarkable technical achievement said Dr Frederic Frigoletto a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at Harvard University and chief of maternal and fetal medicine at Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston But he added much more needs to be learned about how to determine which fetuses will benefit from surgical intervention and which will not The safety and efficacy of fetal surgery are not proven he said The overriding question is Are you really doing any good with these therapies said Dr John C Fletcher chief of the bioethics program in the clinical center of the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Md It is time to bite the bullet and do a properly controlled clinical trial on the use of shunts said Dr Fletcher who said he was speaking for himself and not NIH According to experts in bioethics and law if fetal treatment ever does become routine it will join a list of controversial social issues such as regulations for the treatment of handicapped infants courtordered Caesarian operations on women unwilling to have them and the rights of frozen embryos whose parents have died This is essentially an uncharted area where the basic values of maternal autonomy and of fetal welfare may come into conflict said George J Annas a professor of health law at Boston University School of Public health Fetal surgery is a new medical field that is being pioneered at 13 centers in five countries according to Dr Frank Manning director of an international Fetal Treatment Registry at Womens Hospital in Winnepeg Canada Dr Manning said Baby Mitchell was the third infant treated since 1982 with open surgery all by Dr Harrisons group in San Francisco Two other fetuses with blocked urinary tracts were given bladder shunts that were sewn into place One died at birth because the procedure had been performed too late to prevent lung and kidney damage The other lived for about six months but died of complications of another birth defect The last Mitchell is thriving In his case a hole was surgically created in his abdomen through which his bladder could drain Dr Manning said 124 other fetuses have been given shunts  little tubes about the size of dry spaghetti placed by way of a catheter into fetal bladders and brains to drain away fluids Fetus as FullFledged Patient In addition new therapies are developing to medically treat fetuses by giving mothers drugs vitamins hormones or special diets to correct a specific defect in her fetus While fetuses have been given therapy in the form of blood transfusions since the early 1960s the newer therapies are driving physicians as never before to view the unborn child as a fullfledged patient There are two thrusts in medicine that have brought us to think about the fetus as a patient Dr Harrison said in a recent interview One came from people like me who take care of babies after birth We look at them and realize were too late If the problem could be fixed earlier he said some babies could be saved The second thrust came from advances in detection Using the noninvasive imaging technique of ultrasound Dr Harrison said people have become incredibly slick at seeing fetuses and at diagnosing fetal problems Birth defects can now be detected after just nine or ten weeks of pregnancy with a variety of new methods Prenatal diagnosis which has prompted controversy because it can lead to elective abortion was never meant to be merely a search and destroy mission said Dr Harrison Diagnosis can now make fetal therapy possible Eight years ago Dr Harrison with his colleagues Dr Roy A Filly and Dr Mitchell S Golbus formed a Fetal Treatment Program that led first to extensive animal experiments with open fetal surgery techniques We asked ourselves what diseases would be amenable to therapy Dr Harrison said and found that each falls along a spectrum At one end is the doomed fetus It will die no matter what you do At the other end is the fetus who has problems but we know from experience it will be all right Most birth defects in fact are best treated after birth he said In between are conditions that call for active management of the pregnancy Sometimes babies are delivered prematurely by Caesarian section Dr Harrison said because defects produce ongoing trouble and the longer the fetus stays in the womb the worse off it is Some anatomic malformations if severe enough will destroy an organ system such as the kidneys brain lungs or heart before an induced early delivery is possible We can now in some cases prevent that maldevelopment by surgical intervention either shunts or open surgery Dr Harrison said Three conditions that fall along a such a spectrum and that might in carefully selected cases be surgically corrected are hydrocephalus or water on the brain a herniated diaphragm and a urinary tract obstruction known as hydronephrosis the condition Mitchell suffered Hydronephrosis is the first such anatomic defect to be successfully corrected by open surgery in a human fetus When the urinary tract obstruction is partial Dr Harrison said the fetus may develop normally But when the blockage is complete the fetus cannot urinate Fluid backs up and puts destructive pressure on its developing kidneys Amniotic fluid which is actually fetal urine is not produced Without amniotic fluid fetal lungs do not develop The exact prevalence of hydronephrosis is not known since so many fetuses die before birth But Dr Harrison estimates that 1 in 2000 may be affected Mitchells parents agreed to tell their story to a reporter on a condition that their last name not be disclosed Mitchell is however the babys real first name given in honor of Dr Golbus in San Francisco I asked for a sonogram when I was between five and six months pregnant Mitchells mother said My grandmother is a twin and we wanted to be prepared Her obstetrician had tragic news The babys bladder kidneys and the tubes connecting them were greatly enlarged There was no amniotic fluid and it was determined that the babys urethra was completely blocked They told us to consider ending the pregnancy she said or to consult some doctors in California who might be able to operate I already felt him kicking We knew by then that he was a boy Our minds were made up to save his life if we could It was the couples first pregnancy A special test developed by the team in San Francisco indicated that the babys kidneys were still healthy Other tests indicated he had no other birth defects But with the teams procedure Mitchells mother who is 32 years old would have to expose herself to considerable risks including two Ceasarian operations a drug taken daily to prevent labor after the fetal surgery and the danger of uterine rupture in this and future pregnancies When the incision is made at the top instead of the bottom the uterus as it sometimes has to be in this procedure said Dr Harrison the risk of rupture increases Without the operation Mitchell had zero chance for survival said Mitchells father They asked us hundreds of times to think carefully about our decision The fetal surgery was perfomed on July 22 1985 Mitchells mother was given the anesthesia halathane It is a superb relaxant Dr Harrison said because it puts the mother the kid and the uterus to sleep An eightinch incision was made across the mothers belly a few inches higher than a normal Caesarian using a special staplelike device that stops bleeding as it cuts The tiny babys legs were pulled out while his upper half attached to the placenta were left inside his mother The umbilical cord is not supposed to come into contact with the air Mithcells mother explained or else it would be damaged Dr Harrison cut a hole through the babys abdomen and bladder sewing the bladder directly to the babys skin He added saline water to the uterus to provide some amniotic fluid stuffed the fetus back inside and stitched up the uterus along with the amniotic sac The fetus was outside his mother for three minutes Mitchells mother took the drug Ritodrine every day to prevent labor Nine weeks later Mitchell was born in a second Caesarian operation made through the same cut Although he was six weeks premature the baby weighed six pounds two ounces Mitchell needed some assistance in breathing but within a few hours his father said he was the perfect picture of health Today Mitchell is like many other 1yearolds He has straight brown hair long dark lashes and is cutting his first three teeth His parents say he is developing normally He can walk holding on to the couch and he smiles all the time said his mother Weve decided hes an angel Last week Dr Harrison finally opened Mitchells urethra and closed the hole in his abdomen so that the baby now urinates normally Mitchells right kidney has very little function said Dr Harrison and the left kidney is about 50 percent efficient The parents say they take Mitchell regularly to a pediatric kidney specialist We are watching closely and if he fails to grow his mother said he may one day need a kidney transplant Other surgeons in the meantime are experimenting with bladder shunts inserted nonsurgically through catheters to drain fetal urine Of 79 babies given bladder shunts since 1982 said Dr Manning 55 died before birth Of the 34 survivors all are doing well except one child who had serious complications stemming from the shunt Fortyfive other fetuses have been given shunts to drain excessive fluid that collected on their brains The survival rate is very high about 85 percent said Dr Manning but only about a third have normal brain function he said The rest have serious brain damage Without treatment the condition is often fatal This our worst fear he said that we will save babies who are badly damaged There is now agreement that there should be a moratorium on brain shunts said Dr Friggoletto There is lack of evidence that they provide any benefit and substantial evidence that they may be bad The Jury Is Out All fetal shunts Dr Manning said are notorious because they kink fall out or get plugged up Babies are born holding them in their fists Thus the jury is out he said on whether shunts or open surgery techniques are the best way to treat selected children Other congenital malformations such as hernias of the diaphragm in which the liver pushes up into the chest and spina bifida in which the spine fails to close are undergoing experimental treatment in animals Novel transplant techniques using fetal cells and even fetal organs are being developed in animals Fetal therapy will open a pandoras box of problems said Professor Annas I can envision a woman saying she doesnt want to be cut open So her doctor goes to a judge who tries to force her to be cut open The law has not begun to think seriously about such questions said Professor Annas Because a disorder can be treated ought it to be treated He said he believed the mothers rights were likely to prevail over those of the fetus But where fetuses are concerned there is a supercharged atmosphere he said
COURT SELECTS 22 CASES FOR NEW TERM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/us/court-selects-22-cases-for-new-term.html,Opening its new term today the Supreme Court agreed to decide whether Jews Arabs and members of other minority groups who do not belong to distinct nonwhite races may bring racial discrimination suits under an 1866 civil rights law The Court also agreed to decide whether governmentowned airports can ban the distribution of religious political and other literature in their buildings and whether an Illinois obscenity law violates the Constitution Among other issues the Court agreed to resolve were whether it should overrule a 125yearold Supreme Court decision that Federal courts have no power to order a states Governor to extradite a fugitive to another state whether a New York law authorizing warrantless searches of automobile junkyards violates the Constitution and whether a city may make it a crime to oppose in any manner a police officer in the execution of his duty These were among 22 cases the Court agreed to hear as William H Rehnquist the new Chief Justice took his seat at the center of the Courts bench and Justice Antonin Scalia joined in hearing the first four arguments of the 198687 term Symbolic Significance The 1866 civil rights law was raised in two appeals one brought by members of a Maryland synagogue against eight men who are accused of defacing it with Nazi and antiSemitic slogans and the other involving a college instructor who asserts that he had been denied tenure because he is Arab Legal experts said that while the two cases had limited practical importance because the 1866 law is not used very often their symbolic significance was considerable Rejecting a Reagan Administration appeal the Court also declined at least for the time being to overturn a ruling by a Federal court in Manhattan that abortion rights groups have legal standing to sue for revocation of the Roman Catholic Churchs exemption from Federal taxes The groups assert in their suit against the Government which has not gone to trial that it has allowed the church to support antiabortion political candidates and lobby against legal abortion in violation of Federal restrictions on the use of taxexempt funds LaRouche Appeal Rejected The Court also refused to hear the last appeal by Lyndon H LaRouche Jr of a 202000 jury award against him for harassing NBC News by impersonating one of its employees in a telephone call to a senators office The Court listed most of the more than 1000 appeals that had accumulated over the threemonth summer recess designating the 22 it would set for arguments and the much larger number it had declined to review It takes the votes of four of the nine Justices to accept a case for full review The cases accepted today for review together with four in which the Court heard arguments and 87 others it had already agreed to hear will fill the calendar into March The two cases under the 1866 civil rights law involve conflicting interpretations by two Federal appellate courts on whether the law can be used to combat discrimination against members of minority groups that are not distinct nonwhite races Law Passed After Civil War Section 1 of the Civil Rights Act of 1866 passed to protect newly freed slaves in the aftermath of the Civil War extended various property contract and other rights to all persons to the same extent as is enjoyed by white citizens A Federal appellate court in Richmond held by 2 to 1 that a Jewish congregation could not use this law to sue eight men who had defaced the Shaare Tefila Synagogue in Silver Spring Md in 1982 with swastikas and antiSemitic slogans including Death to the Jude The majority said the 1866 law did not protect Jews against discrimination by other whites because Jews were not members of a distinct nonwhite race In its Supreme Court appeal Shaare Tefila Congregation v Cobb No 852156 the congregation argued that although Jews do not consider themselves a scientifically distinct race the 1866 law should be available to victims of any discrimination motivated by racist animus Conflicting Rulings Made The dismissal by the United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit conflicted with the reasoning of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit in Phailadelphia In the same week that court held that an Iraqiborn college professor who said he was denied tenure at a Pennsylvania college because of his Arab background could sue under the 1866 law even though he was Caucasian The Court will hear that case AlKhazraji v St Francis College No 852169 with the synagogue case In the case involving governmentowned airports the Court agreed to hear an appeal by Los Angeles airport officials from a Federal appellate ruling that its terminal buildings were public forums like city streets and parks so that religious and other groups had a right to distribute literature there The case began as a suit by Jews for Jesus Inc and one of its ministers after he was barred in 1984 from distributing religious literature inside airport buildings Official airport policy limited the interior of airport buildings to airportrelated uses Policy Ruled Unconstitutional The Federal appellate court held that this policy which relegated First Amendment activities to the sidewalks outside was unconstitutional Board of Airport Commissioners v Jews for Jesus No 86104 The obscenity case is an appeal by two clerks at adult book stores who were convicted of selling obscene magazines They argued that the Illinois statute violates the First Amendment because it allows use of local community standards rather than an objective national standard to judge the social value of allegedly obscene works Under a 1973 Supreme Court ruling sexually explicit material may be banned only if it appeals to prurient interest depicts sexual conduct in a patently offensive way and lacks serious literary artistic political or scientific value It is undisputed that judges and juries may use local community values in applying the first two elements of this test Pope v Illinois No 851973 Debating Warrantless Searches The Court will consider the constitutionality of New Yorks law allowing warrantless searches of automobile junkyards in a prosecution appeal of a decision by the New York Court of Appeals the states highest court which held the law violated the Fourth Amendments restrictions on searches and seizures The New York court barred use of evidence seized from a junkyard in Brooklyn by five plainclothes police officers in 1982 in a routine warrantless inspection The highest courts in at least five states have upheld similar laws New York v Burger No 8680 The extradition case grew out of the refusal of two successive Governors of Iowa to extradite an Iowa man to Puerto Rico to stand trial in the murder of a pregnant woman allegedly by running her over deliberately and repeatedly with his car after an argument with her husband in a grocery store parking lot Gov Robert Ray and then Gov Terry E Branstad of Iowa refused the extradition request by Puerto Ricos Governor out of concern that the murder charge was too severe and Ronald Calder the defendant might not get a fair trial in Puerto Rico It Questions 1861 Ruling Puerto Rico appealed to the Supreme Court from a decision by a lower Federal court that it could not order Iowas Governor to extradite Mr Calder because an 1861 Supreme Court ruling held that Federal courts have no power to enforce the Constitutions explicit requirement that a states Governor honor an extradition request from another states Governor Puerto Rico noting in its appeal that it has the same rights as a state under the extradition clause urged the Court to overrule the 1861 decision as a relic of the era of slavery and order that Mr Calder be extradited Puerto Rico v Branstad No 852116 In Houston v Hill No 86243 the Court agreed to hear the citys appeal of an 8 to 7 decision by a Federal appellate court striking down a city ordinance that makes it a misdemeanor to in any manner oppose molest abuse or interrupt a police officer in the execution of his duty The appellate court ruled in a civil suit brought by a homosexual rights activist who had been arrested several times for violating the ordinance but never convicted that the ordinance was an overly broad restriction on the First Amendment right of free speech
EXTREMIST FINDS CABLE TV IS FORUM FOR RIGHT-WING VIEWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/us/extremist-finds-cable-tv-is-forum-for-right-wing-views.html,Rules that require cable television systems to offer access to local residents are enabling a former Ku Klux Klan leader here to promulgate his racist and radical views in a number of towns and cities around the country Three years ago when cable was getting off the ground I realized that public access channels were perfect for views like mine that were having trouble getting expressed Tom Metzger said in an interview in his office here 25 miles north of San Diego Mr Metzgers program called Race and Reason has prompted controversy in a number of places where it is telecast It consists of interviews by him with people whose views are at least somewhat similar to his own He calls himself a racialist and says he opposes abortion because we have lost a whole generation of white children to abortion since it became legal On Blacks and Abortion He says I understand the black experience as well as any white man could but I dont sympathize to the point I want the white race pushed off this continent by the rising black birth rate We support anybody who is against the system he said He said his television programs attracted protest when some Klan or Nazi group would hit on deporting Jews or speak of the alleged genetic inferiority of blacks or urge racial separation Mr Metzger directs the White Aryan Resistance which publishes WAR a newspaper that calls itself The Newspaper of the International White Racist Each edition lists cable systems that carry Race and Reason There are now 35 of the 30minute Race and Reason programs in circulation More are made each month as Mr Metzger or occasionally a substitute conducts interviews It is produced in a studio in Fullerton Calif provided to him by a cable television company that is required by its franchise to give such service to people who ask for it Controversy in Idaho The most recent controversy created by his programs came in midSeptember when a cable system in Pocatello Idaho carried its first Race and Reason program The program was one of the few that did not feature Mr Metzger He said Roy Frankhauser of Reading Pa interviewed Richard Barrett a Mississippi lawyer Problems of racial conflict in Philadelphia were discussed and Mr Barrett spoke out for a return to racial segregation and racial separation The Pocatello Human Relations Council had previewed the tape and decided that it was unable to block the telecast because the franchise agreement between the city and the cable company forbids only the use of the public access channel for advertising commercial products or displaying pornography So the council conducted a callin program that ran for 90 minutes after the Metzger tape was played Forty people called and 39 of them protested The Associated Press reported Mr Metzger said conflicts occurred when the program was first shown in Austin Tex and in Corvallis Ore but have been resolved by opponents creating their own programs that run before or after his Hitler Birthday Cards Race and Reason is no longer shown in Corvallis It ceased after 16 tapes were shown because the local sponsor Richard Masker one of Mr Metzgers followers moved away without renewing for 16 additional weeks He lost his job his wife divorced him and he said to hell with it and moved to Arkansas Mr Metzger said The Corvallis GazetteTimes reported that Mr Masker lost his job after he mailed Hitler birthday cards to many Jewish residents of Corvallis The cards said May his memory refresh your soul and give you inspiration Heil Hitler Mr Metzger said sometimes he has had historical revisionists on my show He said they do not deny that some Jews got hurt in Nazi Germany in the Hitler years but they say not so many were killed as the numbers they claim Mr Metzger grew up in Warsaw Ind attended high school and spent three years in the Army which taught him electronics Earlier Days in Politics He came to California in 1961 AntiCommunist luncheon meetings sponsored by the Douglas Aircraft Corporation where he worked led him to politics He joined the John Birch Society became a Goldwater precinct worker in 1964 moved to Fallbrook in 1968 and supported George C Wallace for President His 1972 tax protest over the Vietnam War wrecked his thriving television business but introduced him to other tax protesters who he said were atheist racists Christian Identity racists Nazis all kinds of people In 1975 he joined the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan and soon became the Grand Dragon for California He left the Klan in 1980 he said He managed to win the Democratic nomination to the House of Representatives in 1980 in a district with a strong Republican incumbent and low Democratic registration causing an outcry He was disavowed by the state Democratic organization The district is heavily Republican and he lost by a margin of 7 to 1 He lives and operates his television repair business from a house on a back street here He said all the other people on the street were Mexican immigrants While he gets along with them he said I would just as soon they were still back in their own country Range of TV Viewers The television program is broadcast Mr Metzger said to one million subscribers of the Group W cable network in Pennsylvania alone as well as many more in San Francisco San Diego Memphis Pocatello Austin Atlanta parts of Los Angeles and nine smaller southern California cities Most cable franchises require the operators to provide a channel for public access and some require maintenance of production facilities that must be provided free of charge These rules derive from the 1972 Federal Communications Commission rules on cable TV While the requirements at the Federal level were removed by court decision in 1979 they live on in the local franchises We havent got on in New York yet because cable access is so crowded Mr Metzger said But we will
NASSAU COUNTY COMPTROLLER IN A TOUGH STATE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/nyregion/nassau-county-comptroller-in-a-tough-state-race.html,In the Republican stronghold of Nassau County Comptroller Peter T King has had everything going for him as a politician incumbency fund raising and party organization All those partisan advantages are reversed however as Mr King mounts his first statewide campaign He is running for Attorney General as the Republican Conservative and RighttoLife nominee This time Mr King is the challenger in an arena dominated by Democrats The incumbent is Robert Abrams who has held the office eight years and last won reelection by the biggest margin of any attorney general in New York history The Abrams campaign expects to outspend the King campaign several times over The statewide Democratic organization headed by Governor Cuomo is much bigger than the Republican So is the statewide Democratic voter enrollment Hopeful Against Odds Despite the odds Mr King remains hopeful He has been traveling the political circuit charging that his opponent represents the ultra left and has not done enough to fight crime which Mr Abrams denies I believe politics should be a contact sport  and its better for the public too Mr King said in an interview In attacking the Attorney General he has been making forays upstate Limited in funds he has found free publicity easier to get there in contrast with the scant attention the contest has attracted downstate In the final days before the election Mr King plans statewide radio and television advertising So far he has collected 147000 He hopes to push the total to 250000 with more fundraising events in Manhattan and Rochester In Manhattan he will seek help on the East Side and Wall Street from the fashion industry and union officials He plans also to appeal to Irish groups around the state Fiscal Goals Shortened But Mr Kings 250000 would be only a fraction of the 15 million goal he first set  and an even smaller fraction of the more than 2 million that Mr Abrams is budgeting Now in his second term as Nassau County Comptroller the 42yearold Mr King previously served as a Councilman in Hempstead the most populous town in the United States Before that he held Republican appointments as deputy county attorney and general counsel to Nassaus offtrack betting agency Mr King is also the GOP leader of Seaford the middleclass suburb on the South Shore where he lives with his wife Rosemary and their two sons Despite a penchant for controversial stands involving occasionally even opposition to his party leadership Mr King somehow has avoided banishment from a party usually described as monolithic His most daring display of independence came in the power struggle after the Nassau Republican chairman Joseph M Margiotta was convicted of mail fraud and extortion in 1982 When Mr Margiotta insisted on staying in party office while appealing his case in court Mr King called for the succession of Vice Chairman Ralph J Marino Supposed to Be Dead A stormy meeting of party leaders voted Mr King down 69 to 1 It was like a shooting gallery and I was the target he recalled I was supposed to be dead after that However Mr King said he endured retaliatory efforts to remove me Eventually Mr Margiotta was forced out and replaced by Joseph N Mondello whom Mr King quickly supported Further while local Republican officials normally refrain from issues beyond municipal services Mr King became a vocal champion of Roman Catholics in Northern Ireland and made repeated publicized trips there A number of oldtime Republicans didnt want me to get involved he said and polls indicated the issue did not help him politically But in recognition of his efforts Mr King a grandson of Irish immigrants was named grand marshal of last years St Patricks Day Parade up Fifth Avenue Ties to Democrat Questioned Republicans were dismayed too when Mr King struck up a partnership in support of Northern Ireland Catholics with the Nassau District Attorney Denis E Dillon  the only Democrat holding town or countywide office Their friendship paid off for the GOP however Mr King played a key role in persuading Mr Dillon to accept Republican endorsement for reelection in 1981 effectively neutralizing the District Attorneys power to draw voters from other parties to the Democratic ticket In another headlined controversy this time with the top elected county official of his party Mr King warned in 1983 that Nassau was headed for a serious deficit County Executive Francis T Purcell at first denied the deficit but the year ended with a record gap of 36 million Nassau Democrats criticize Mr Kings record though they have never beaten him at the polls For one thing they have twitted him for his changing numbers projecting the deficit The Hempstead Democratic chairman Edward A Grause charged that although Nassau had the nations highest local taxes Mr King had never used his authority to audit the myriad Republicancontrolled town and village agencies The problem is hes part of the problem Mr Grause said Audit Policies Defended In response Mr King said that he would have to expand his staff tenfold to audit the localities and that doing so would only duplicate the audits already done by the state Comptroller As the son of a city police detective and one who worked his way way up Mr King sees himself representing traditional Democrats and Republicans middle of the road Some of his views however are the mirror opposite of Mr Abramss Mr King opposes abortion supports capital punishment and is against racial hiring quotas to help minorities
EL AL TRIAL OPENS; SYRIAN ROLE CITED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/07/world/el-al-trial-opens-syrian-role-cited.html,A Jordanian accused of trying to blow up an El Al jumbo jet told British investigators that Syrian military intelligence officers had supplied him with an official Syrian passport 12000 a bag with deadly explosives hidden in a false bottom and training on how to detonate the bomb a prosecutor said here today The Jordanian Nezar Hindawi 32 years old is charged with giving the carryon bag to an unwitting Irish woman who was pregnant with his child On the first day of his trial at the Old Bailey he saw the woman AnneMarie Murphy for the first time since April 17 when she believed herself to be on the way to Israel to marry her lover Miss Murphy who has since had the baby described to a jury of seven men and five women how Mr Hindawi parted from her at Heathrow Airport that morning having assured her that he would fly on another flight and meet her in Tel Aviv He Just Kissed Me Goodbye He just left me there she said testifying as the prosecutions first witness in a voice so hesitant that it was often inaudible He just kissed me goodbye on two cheeks Earlier she described how her lover riding in a London taxi to the airport put what appeared to be a square battery in a pocket calculator that he then pushed down deep into her bag having explained that it was a gift for a friend According to the prosecutors opening statement explosives experts discovered that the battery armed a timing device hidden in the calculator which would have triggered a detonator setting off three and a quarter pounds of Czechoslovakmade plastic explosives concealed at the bottom of the bag At 104 PM on April 17 when the bomb was set to explode El Al Flight 16 was due to be flying over Austria at an altitude of 39000 feet with 375 people aboard including 220 who had boarded the plane at Kennedy International Airport in New York Miss Murphy and 137 others who boarded in London and 17 crew members One of the Most Callous Acts It was one of the most callous acts of all time the prosecutor Roy Amlot declared Mr Hindawi a handsome man with dark curly hair flecked with gray flashed a confident smile from the dock at his lawyers as Miss Murphy a chambermaid at the Hilton Hotel when he met her was called to testify Described by the prosecutor as a simple single Irish girl the auburnhaired witness was smartly dressed in a stonecolored cotton jacket over a print blouse Obviously nervous she looked ahead steadfastly until she had been on the stand for nearly an hour before stealing a long glance at the man she thought she would wed There was a sharpness to that look but otherwise she kept her feelings in check Sometimes she chewed her lower lip as she paused to take in the meaning of a question but it was not until late in the afternoon when she came to the moment at the airport when El Al Israel Airlines security agents called in the police that she broke down There Was Something Wrong I got a fright she said sobbing briefly It hit me then there was something wrong Mr Hindawi who had periodically broken into smiles during her testimony now stared blankly from the dock Her answers had come slowly and painfully as Mr Amlot led her step by step through the course of her romance with the Jordanian who was by her account out of touch and out of London for most of the year and a half that she knew him In that period she had twice become pregnant On the first occasion she had a miscarriage the second time she said he didnt want to know about it once she finally reached him in West Berlin His Attitude Changed According to her testimony Mr Hindawi pressed her to have an abortion promising to take her on a holiday if she did But when he appeared at her door on April 7 his attitude had been transformed Then she said he wanted to marry her He said in Israel the holy land she replied when asked by the prosecutor where the marriage would take place When we got over there Mr Hindawi told her not to tell family or friends about their plans she testified It would be a surprise she quoted him as saying Later he became very angry when he discovered that she had told two of her sisters Mr Amlot had already supplied the prosecutions version of the defendants movements in this period and earlier His Jordanian passport showed that he had visited Poland East Germany Rumania and Bulgaria as well as Italy and West Germany in 1985 On Feb 9 in Damascus he received the official passport in the name of Issam Shaar Conflicting Accounts Questioned six times by the police Mr Hindawi gave conflicting accounts of what he believed to have been in the bag At first he said he had thought he was smuggling drugs for the Syrians Later after acknowledging that he knew it had been a bomb he asserted that he believed he had disarmed it by switching the calculator from off to on In the course of his sessions with the police Mr Hindawi was able to name key Syrian intelligence officials and identify their photographs according to Mr Amlot including the head of military intelligence and an air force intelligence officer named Haitham Said who he said had shown him the bag in Damascus and taught him how to set the bag
Conviction on Abortion Ads,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/us/conviction-on-abortion-ads.html,A pregnancy center and its founder were convicted of deceptive trade practices today and fined 39000 for falsely advertising as an abortion clinic then trying to persuade pregnant women to have their babies The Texas Attorney Generals office said the civil court trial was the nations first against a pregnancy center for deceptive trade practices A jury of five women and seven men deliberated eight hours before voting 11 to 1 to convict the center the Problem Pregnancy Center of Fort Worth and its founder Charles Pelletier of violating the Texas Deceptive Trade Practices Act The attorney generals office said the center run by volunteers falsely advertised as an abortion clinic when its purpose was to keep women from having abortions Steve Gardner an assistant attorney general said the verdict sends a strong message to clinics across the country  dont lie to pregnant women in the names of facts in the name of help in the name of God or anybody Mr Gardner said the center was fined 9000 for violating the state consumer law and 30000 for violating a temporary injunction issued July 8 that limited its activities The jury also assessed 70000 in attorneys fees Mr Pelletier said he would appeal the ruling He said the verdict could restrict free speech in churches nonprofit organizations and other organizations beyond antiabortion groups Shelby Sharpe the centers attorney argued that the center was not a commercial operation because it did not charge women for advice and pregnancy tests It therefore should not be held accountable under the act he said But the state attorney Eliot Shavin said the pregnancy center advertised as if it sold a service and attracted customers seeking a service The defendant testified that fetuses have a right to life said Mr Shavin In order to convince others of their belief they further assert they have a right to lie They have no such rights Mr Pelletier a disabled Vietnam veteran who founded the center in 1984 said employees purposefully avoided telling women that the center did not perform abortions
CATHOLIC COLLEGES IN U.S. DEBATE ACADEMIC FREEDOM AMID DISPUTES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/us/catholic-colleges-in-us-debate-academic-freedom-amid-disputes.html,The nations Roman Catholic colleges and universities a key part of the American educational network for more than a century have recently had to examine a question that goes right to the heart of their identity Can there be true academic freedom in an institution that retains strong religious ties The question has gained currency with the Vaticans move this summer to strip the Rev Charles E Curran a relative liberal on sexual issues of his license to teach theology at the Catholic University of America and with a proposal by the Vatican to regulate Catholic institutions of higher learning around the world There are 235 Catholic colleges and universities in the United States with 595100 students The schools founded by religious orders and dioceses primarily to meet the needs of children of Italian and Irish immigrants are now largely independent institutions that cater to a student body of varied ethnic and religious backgrounds The colleges and universities are separate from the churchs network of seminaries which train men for the priesthood A Vatican report released Sunday finds the seminaries to be places where Catholic doctrine is accurately taught and dissent is rare At the colleges and universities however educators are divided on the wisdom of the steps taken against Father Curran and on the document on higher education To some the moves threaten the academic independence that has characterized the colleges and universities in the last two decades But for others the actions represent a long overdue effort to bring the schools in line with orthodox teaching The Vatican has done us a good service said Msgr Eugene Clark the John A Flynn Professor of Catholic Questions at St Johns University in Queens It is forcing the question What is a Catholic college To Monsignor Clark the answer is clear Catholic colleges must be a source of pure Catholic teaching To present anything less he added would be consumer fraud An Effort to Quiet Dissent But the Rev Richard P McBrien head of the theology department at the University of Notre Dame said the purpose of a university was to examine ideas in an open atmosphere and not to limit inquiry He warned that efforts to impose orthodoxy could extend beyond the teaching of theology to other disciplines It is clear that the Vatican does not know what a theologian is and what a university is he said Both conservatives and liberals agree that the Vaticans steps concerning educational institutions are part of an effort by Pope John Paul II and some United States bishops to quell dissent in the American church Among the other actions mentioned were the curtailing of the power of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle the threat to discipline 24 nuns who signed an advertisement in 1984 on abortion and criticism of Governor Cuomo by the Archdiocese of New York All the actions involved dissent on sexual issues particularly abortion In a curious way the Catholic schools themselves can be said to be responsible for much of the turmoil in the American church As Governor Cuomo has said the schools have produced a generation of educated Catholics who feel they have a right to participate in the shaping of American Catholicism A Right to Be Heard We lay people have a right to be heard said the Governor a graduate of St Johns University and its law school He warned that the current mood could lead to a restraint of intellectual activity At the core of the debate on the campuses is the extent to which Catholic theology may be challenged at a Catholic university The test case has involved Father Curran a popular lecturer for more than 20 years who questioned the churchs ban on divorce birth control and abortion In the religion department of a secular university Father Curran would have been left alone in a regular Catholic college he might have been the source of some mild questioning But at Catholic University the only American college that operates under a papal charter his views became grounds for dismissal The Catholic institutions have much in common with Americas secular colleges and universities They have sports teams professional schools and rathskellers where students drink beer but they also have things that set them apart There are chapels and singlesex dormitories And most require students to take some courses in theology and philosophy Monsignor Clark said that in the last 20 years secularization has menaced the identity of Catholic colleges He noted that many of todays secular colleges beginning 350 years ago with the nations first college Harvard were founded by religious groups but over the years became secular institutions Orthodox Catholic teaching must be emphasized he said or we will go the way of the Protestant colleges But Sister Alice Gallin executive director of the Association of Catholic Colleges and Universities in Washington said the Catholic character of the schools could be expressed in various ways People tend to look only at theology she said We feel that the total environment which pays attention to social justice issues and the value of the individual person is also a fruit of our religious heritage Sister Alice said this broader approach was in keeping with the teachings of the Second Vatican Council of the 1960s to reach out beyond the Catholic community This approach includes the teaching of ecumenism ethics and social values as well as Catholic theology The sticking point with the Vatican however continues to be in theology Because of his views Father Currans license to teach theology at Catholic University was withdrawn by the Vatican No license is needed to teach at the other Catholic institutions Nonetheless some Catholic educators worry that similar standards might be imposed on them because of a draft being circulated by the Vatican Proposed Schema for a Pontifical Document on Catholic Universities Under the proposal those hired to teach any subject at Catholic colleges around the world would have to demonstrate doctrinal integrity and uprightness of life Final decisions involving those who teach theology would be left to the local bishop Like most American bishops John Cardinal OConnor of New York has not commented on the proposal according to a spokesman Msgr Peter Finn In the past however the Cardinal has emphasized that Catholic institutions particularly schools should have a distinct Catholic character Sister Alices association which represents all of the American Catholic colleges and universities has taken a strong position against the proposed document that would regulate the colleges and universities The presidents of nearly all of the institutions have also signed a statement against the Vatican proposal Among them is the Rev Theodore M Hesburgh the president of Notre Dame Proposal Called Serious Threat In the current issue of the Catholic magazine America Father Hesburgh calls the proposal a serious threat to the historical institutional academic freedom and autonomy of the American schools He noted that the schools received 500 million a year in Federal assistance and said most of those funds were directed at helping poor students attend them and pay the relatively high tuition costs which largely sustains these institutions Institutional autonomy is essential to Federal support he added Catholic colleges in the United States began to proliferate in the late 19th and early 20th centuries with the arrival of thousands of Irish and Italian immigrants The newcomers feeling alienated from the American Protestant culture wanted a familiar and valuecentered educational environment for their children Most of the schools were founded by religious orders including the Jesuits the Dominicans and the Franciscans Until the 1960s many of the colleges and universities maintained a distinct Catholic character As with other colleges of the time there were strict rules on drinking and curfews but there was also mandatory attendance at mass and there was no meat in the cafeterias on Fridays There were few nonCatholics in the student body and even fewer among the faculty Things began to change in that decade in part because of the general changes taking place on other campuses but also because of the special circumstances within the Roman Catholic Church There was a liberal mood because of the reforms of the Second Vatican Council and the number of priests and nuns in religious orders began to decrease A More Nonsectarian Posture Faced with growing financial burdens most of the Catholic colleges and universities chose to become independent of the religious orders and dioceses that founded them They began to accept more and more funds from the Government which required that they adopt a more nonsectarian posture Nonetheless the schools kept their identity as Catholic colleges Under their charters certain key positions such as that of university president were retained by representatives of the founding religious orders With increased lay control in the last two decades the schools have flourished many have gained national reputations Father Curran and others who support him have warned that the recent Vatican moves could damage the reputation of these schools At a news conference after the Vatican took away his license Father Curran said he was concerned that those interested in studying and teaching Catholic theology would look elsewhere when selecting a college But Monsignor Clark said that todays students were looking for sound teaching rather than for experimentation They are far more conservative and pragmatic than students were 10 years ago he said The faculty on the other hand is still giving the old liberal answers that no longer work He cited as an example the position of some Catholic theologians that the Vatican should relax its ban on divorce To a 20yearold student who has suffered the effects of divorce that is a horrifying prospect he said It is our students who are changing the atmosphere

WAGNER TO SEEK SCHOOL CONTRACEPTIVES LIMIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/nyregion/wagner-to-seek-school-contraceptives-limit.html,The president of New York Citys Board of Education said yesterday that he would ask the board to prohibit the dispensing of contraceptives on school grounds to students under 18 The board president Robert F Wagner Jr said that while he still supported the distribution at the health clinics at the schools there had been concern among some board members in the last two days about the practice He said he was eager to expand the number of clinics and hoped to win board support eventually for the contraceptive distribution Two high schools have been dispensing contraceptives directly to students who have parental consent to use the clinics Clinics at seven other high schools write prescriptions for students to receive the devices at hospitals or community health services that run the schoolbased clinics and that approach would still be allowed under Mr Wagners proposal The two city high schools are among at least 10 nationwide that dispense contraceptives and 39 more have physicians who can prescribe birthcontrol pills or devices [ Page B4 ] In another development yesterday the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York described the schools program as a clandestine effort and called it outrageous In a statement Bishop Edward M Egan the archdioceses vicar for education said the policy was dangerous to healthy family values At a time when educators at the highest levels are speaking of the crying need for values in education is this clandestine effort not establishing promiscuity rather than restraint as part of the value system for young Americans the statement said The superintendent of education for the Roman Catholic Diocese of Brooklyn Msgr Vincent D Breen said yesterday that the problem of teenage pregnancy would not be solved by encouraging promiscuity which is the conclusion you can draw from the Board of Education proposal The birthcontrol program in the health clinics which began as early as 1984 in some of the schools was not publicly disclosed until this week But Mr Wagner said yesterday that there had been no deliberate effort to keep the program secret Three of the seven board members Edward L Sadowsky Richard I Beattie and Mr Wagner himself said they approved of the distribution of contraceptives at the schools But two board members whose votes are considered swing votes on the board Dr Irene Impellizzeri and Dr Gwendolyn C Baker are opposed to such distribution The distribution of contraceptives at schoolbased clinics or through affiliated clinics run by major hospitals or community health centers came to light in a report on sex education distributed to board members last week The report said nine high schools had statefinanced health clinics that along with general health services such as physical examinations and treatment of illnesses offered birthcontrol counseling distribution of contraceptives and laboratory testing Asked at a City Hall news conference yesterday if the school health clinics recommended abortions for pregnant students the citys Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones said I dont believe a counselor should be an advocate of abortion If a girl was found to be pregnant her parents should be called in and the clinics counselor would then discuss what options are available without advocating a position he said Mr Wagner pointed out that publicly financed health clinics outside the schools legally dispensed contraceptives to people under 18 and without parental permission Parental Consent Forms Mr Quinones said new parental consent forms which parents must sign before a student can participate in any school health clinic services including obtaining birthcontrol devices would be circulated in the next several weeks Mr Wagner in addressing the archdioceses concern that there had not been public debate on the matter said he had only learned of the distribution program in last weeks report He said Mr Quinones knew about it last spring when preparing new consent forms One high school West Side High School in Manhattan an alternative high school for dropoutprone students where the average student age is 18 has been distributing birthcontrol devices at its clinic since the clinic was opened in the spring of 1985 At Louis D Brandeis High School in Manhattan the parents association in consultation with the principal Murray Cohn has approved the distribution of birthcontrol devices Mr Cohn said Sunday that the distribution had begun but clinic workers said they were waiting for the new parental consent forms before dispensing the devices At Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn the new principal Frank Mickens said he had halted contraceptive distribution at the schools clinic when he found out about it two weeks ago Mr Mickens who is one of the few blacks who are high school principals in the city system said he questioned why the nine schoolbased health clinics were in schools with large numbers of students from minority groups Areas of High Need A Board of Education spokesman Robert H Terte said a resolution adopted by the board in 1984 authorizing the opening of the nine clinics specifically stated that the clinics should be in areas of high need Mr Wagner in lining up support for his view that the schoolbased clinics should be able to provide contraceptives found unequivocal support only from Mr Sadowsky and Mr Beattie One board member Dr Impellizzeri who is dean of the School of Education at Brooklyn College said she objected to dispensing contraceptives in the school clinics but did not oppose writing prescriptions for them in a privileged doctorpatient relationship Mr Quinones said four new health clinics would open soon at four junior high schools But these clinics will not provide prescriptions for contraceptives nor distribute them he said
"DESPITE U.S. OBJECTIONS, MORE SCHOOLS OFFER FAMILY PLANNING",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/08/us/despite-us-objections-more-schools-offer-family-planning.html,Despite objections from some Reagan Administration officials there has been a rapid increase in the number of clinics that provide family planning and other health care services to students at public schools around the country Typically local officials said the clinics with the permission of the school authorities are run by hospitals or community groups that serve the needs of adolescents Data collected by the Center for Population Options show the number of such clinics has increased from 12 in 1980 to 28 in 1983 and to 61 today The center a private nonprofit group based in Washington seeks to prevent unwanted pregnancy among teenagers At least 10 of the school clinics including 2 in New York City dispense contraceptives and 39 more including one in New Haven and seven in New York City have physicians who can write prescriptions for birth control pills or devices The clinics say that twothirds to threequarters of their work involves first aid physical examinations for school athletes laboratory tests immunizations drug abuse counseling and other activities unrelated to family planning But they regard family planning services as an essential element of their programs Geraldine W Johnson who supervises clinics at two public high schools in Bridgeport Conn said today We offer comprehensive health care but our bottom line is that we want to address the crisis of adolescent pregnancy Parental Consent Needed In some places such as DuSable High School in Chicago there has been opposition to the clinics with picketing by critics But elsewhere there has been little debate Dr Leroy Taylor 3d director of the clinic at Pinkston High School in Dallas said birth control and other services were provided to students only with parental consent Virtually all of the clinics have similar requirements At many schools parents give consent for their children to receive health services in general without specifying birth control as a separate item The Secretary of Education William J Bennett has denounced school birth control clinics as a classic bureaucratic response to the problem of teen pregnancy This is not what school is for he said in April at a seminar for education writers It offers a bureaucratic solution a highly questionable if not offensive one  in place of the exercise of individual responsibility not just by the children but by the adults around them Mr Bennett said Judith Senderowitz executive director of the Center for Population Options said the clinics work was directly related to the educational mission of the schools  to keep students in class A major objective of the clinics is to keep kids in school so they wont drop out because of teen pregnancy she said Dr Otis R Bowen Secretary of Health and Human Services said that teenage pregnancies were a top priority of his department and he noted that on the average nearly 3000 teenage girls become pregnant in this country every day While the Reagan Administration has recommended abstention as the best way to prevent such pregnancies officials at Health and Human Services have not yet developed an official position on the dispensing of contraceptives to students Judith Steinhagen principal of DuSable said that of the 1850 students enrolled at the school last year more than 800 used the clinic and 21 percent of the users received family planning information or contraceptives Opposition to the clinics comes from antiabortion groups among others Douglas Johnson legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee said his group was concerned that the clinics were acting as funnels into abortion clinics The Center for Population Options said that none of the school clinics performed abortions But local officials said that clinics do sometimes refer pregnant teenagers to abortion clinics after a full discussion of all the options available
ABRAMS AND KING TRADE PROBITY CHARGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/09/nyregion/abrams-and-king-trade-probity-charges.html,Peter T King the Republican candidate for State Attorney General repeatedly questioned the integrity of the incumbent Robert Abrams yesterday Mr Abrams in response tried to link Mr King with insurance commission kickbacks and pressure on county and town workers to contribute to the Republican Party in Nassau County The accusations were traded during the candidates first facetoface confrontation a 90minute debate at The New York Times Each appeared to be stung by the accusations but reacted with controlled anger often leaning toward the other to make a charge or rebut one The campaign I believe is a campaign to restore integrity in the attorney generals office Mr King the Nassau County Comptroller said Contributions Under Scrutiny He accused Mr Abrams of jeopardizing an investigation into organized crime so that he could gain a public relations advantage and of accepting 42500 in campaign contributions from two New Jersey partners in a Brooklyn coop conversion One partner had been convicted 14 years ago of tax evasion as part of a broader investigation of extortion and fraud in the construction of a postal center in New Jersey Mr Abrams said that he did not know about the criminal background and that a campaign panel of lawyers was determining what to do about the contributions Mr Abrams in attacking Mr King cited scandals in the Nassau Republican Party in the 70s Was he aware of what was going on Were you aware Mr Abrams asked leaning toward Mr King who was seated next to him If you were aware why didnt you say something If you werent aware why werent you aware A jury in Federal Dstrict Court last year found that the Nassau County Republican Committee had required government workers to contribute 1 percent of their salaries to the party to obtain promotions and wage increases The verdict has been appealed Other Topics Covered Mr King who has been the Seaford Republican leader since 1975 denied any role in the kickbacks and contributions He said he had been the leading opponent of Joseph M Margiotta the former Nassau Republican leader who was imprisoned for his role in the insurance kickbacks The personal attacks and talk about crime and corruption dominated the session but the candidates also covered other issues in replying to questions by four reporters of The Times The topics included these  Regarding the New York City corruption scandals Mr King favored the appointment of a special state prosecutor to supersede Democratic district attorneys so that Democrats arent investigating Democrats Mr Abrams said that a special prosecutor was unnecessary and that he favored creating a state ethics board to investigate potential conflicts of interest He said the city ethics board was very weak  Both candidates opposed testing state employees for drugs calling it an invasion of civil liberties Note this well I agree with the Attorney General Mr King said with a smile  The candidates argued that the Long Island Lighting Company rather than its customers should bear the full 46 billion cost of the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station if it did not open even at the risk of bankrupting the utility  They also strongly criticized the State Public Service Commission and called for its reorganization I believe it has totally outlived any usefulness it ever had Mr King said Mr Abrams said the PSC had lamely allowed cost overruns at Shoreham and other nuclear plants He said that if the agency were more effective the attorney general would not have to be involved in rate cases Role as States Advocate Both candidates said they had obligations to defend the states positions in the courts even if they disagreed with them Mr Abrams acknowledged that he had not done so in the case of Westway the longdisputed highway and development project on the West Side of Manhattan that was killed last year because he had voted against it as Bronx Borough President just before he was elected Attorney General in 1978 Mr King said he would step aside and assign an assistant if he were required to defend the states position permitting Medicaid financing of abortion which he opposes Mr King said he would use the attorney generals office as a pulpit to promote capital punishment Mr King charged that in several instances including Shoreham and a dispute over the Attorney Generals Organized Crime Task Force Governor Cuomo had shown a lack of confidence in Mr Abrams He noted that Mr Cuomo had assigned his special counsel Fabian Palomino rather than Mr Abrams to represent the state in the Shoreham case Crime Is Preeminent Issue Mr Abrams did not respond directly although he had earlier acknowledged that there had been disagreements between him and the Governor Mr Abrams said his first priority if reelected would be to seek more money for all aspects of law enforcement from the local to the state level Crime is a preeminent issue Mr Abrams said You have to put your money where your mouth is he said but he could not estimate how much his proposals would cost Mr King said his priority would be to coordinate agencies investigating organized crime This is something that requires a total and concerted effort among all facets of the criminaljustice system he said Both said state legislators should be barred from representing clients before state agencies They then engaged in an angry exchange over a former Abrams aide who had joined the law firm of Andrew M Cuomo The firm has represented seven clients before the realestate financing bureau of the Attorney Generals office Mr Abrams said that there had been no impropriety but that he favored stricter limitations on former state employees in business Mr King responded that I have no doubt that if Andrew Cuomos father was Republican you would have called a news conference and put out a press release on it to condemn it

Jersey and I like having the executive power to do things My Sons in Dartmouth Well if vice doesnt appeal and executive does how about President Mr Kean came in third in the East after George Bush and Bob Dole in a Harris poll of Presidential preferences taken in March Being realistic youve got to do certain things to run for President Thomas Howard Kean said in his Brahmin accent For one thing you have to spend a good part of your life in Iowa Im not doing that And I only visit New Hampshire because my sons at Dartmouth His advisers say the Governor understands that given the current field and the conservative mood his candidacy would be a very long shot But their attitude is nothing ventured nothing gained When asked if the 51yearold Mr Kean is testing the waters they respond in the spirit of a nod and a wink  a marked contrast to the labored protestations of New York Governor Cuomos staff on the same subject Any Republican candidate who can win over 60 percent of the black vote and 68 percent of the labor vote has obviously got something to teach the Republicans nationally said the political consultant who worked on Mr Keans two gubernatorial races Roger Stone But can Mr Kean  a Republican who supports the Equal Rights Amendment freedom of choice on abortions sanctions against South Africa gun control and environmental protection  ever gain the support of the conservative wing of his party If he has balanced the budget cut taxes and signed the death penalty what difference does it make if the selfappointed figures of the far right in Washington dont like him Mr Stone asked The guy has taken what Reagan gave us and built on it Mr Kean may not have won over the far right but the patrician Republican  an Episcopalian millionaire who is a direct descendant of William Livingston the first governor of New Jersey and a relation of Theodore Roosevelt and Peter Stuyvesant has won over this consummately earthy ethnic industrial and Democratic state He went from the slimmest gubernatorial victory margin in New Jersey history in 1981 to the largest one in 1985 Keeping his reputation as a nice guy Mr Kean has been firmly pushing his programs through the Legislature and with a little help from Brooke Shields and Bill Cosby polishing New Jerseys image Nobodys made a joke about New Jersey since Gary Hart Mr Kean said proudly recalling the Colorado Senators quip in 1984 about the dubious joys of campaigning at New Jersey toxicwaste dumps Affairs of One State On this October day the tall genial man with the duckfooted walk and gap between his front teeth is concentrating on the affairs of his state Tom Kean may not be flashy but he is not dull His conversation ranges from The Federalist Papers to the opera Otello from Shakespeares Hamlet to the JeffersonHamilton conflicts from the charms of okra to the culture of China In the course of a few hours the former high school history teacher quotes James Baldwin Thomas Jefferson Aristotle Winston Churchill Adam Clayton Powell Paul the Apostle Arthur Conan Doyle Benjamin Franklin LaoTzu and George Santayana If you know the main threads of our countrys history he said you are better equipped to look toward the future and understand the present His brand of Republicanism he said is rooted in the beliefs of Abraham Lincoln Theodore Roosevelt Dwight D Eisenhower and in some ways Ronald Reagan Opportunity is the operative word he said Abraham Lincolns first program was to open up the Western lands and tell people that if they worked a piece of land they could own it He made no distinction between black or white people Consistent Manner Unlike many politicians he does not change his persona to suit different groups His manner is the same whether he is talking to mayors or to maintenance workers to board chairmen or to black children standing outside a Newark hospital After a rally for Republican candidates in Bloomfield the Governor continued on with Nick Amato the Essex County Surrogate who is running for county executive and Earl Harris a Newark City Councilman running for Surrogate to a luncheon of black ministers Isnt it about time that our neighbors in New York State began divesting in those South African companies he asked to the cheers of the crowd The Republicans in the New York Senate blocked a divestiture proposal arguing that the state could better influence events there if it held on to its stock New Jersey is in the process of divesting itself of 43 billion in pensionfund holdings in companies doing business in South Africa Jefferson and Apartheid I dont have much sympathy for those who say there are two views on apartheid he said later I dont think you can teach your children to read Thomas Jefferson and not at some time recognize that apartheid is exactly the opposite of what American democracy is all about He often talks about morality and doing the right thing but there is no trace of selfrighteousness One of the guests at the luncheon was George Richardson a black man who was serving in the Assembly with Mr Kean when the Newark riots broke out in 1967 Tom and I met at the Owl Club a nightclub in Newark to try to formulate some kind of approach to the cities Mr Richardson recalled There hasnt been any Republican around since Nelson Rockefeller who could deal with both blacks and whites the way Tom can Prefers Executive Branch Although his grandfather served in the United States Senate and his father in the House Mr Kean said he was not drawn to that branch of government The Governor likes the feeling of accomplishing things every day sometimes large and sometimes small When a child wrote a letter last winter saying that his father would not buy him a skateboard for Christmas unless theres a brand new Rolls Royce in the driveway or unless the Governor comes calling at the front door Mr Kean asked for the address He got the skateboard the Governor said And finally those who say Tom Kean is too nice to go far in the roughandtumble world of national politics should consider this The Governor of New Jersey is the man who stood up to Frank Sinatra The crooner from Hoboken threw one of his famous fits after the Liberty Weekend opening ceremony in July when he was forced to wait to leave the island because Mr Keans boat was first in line for departure Dock workers were scurrying to move the Kean boat out of the way when the Governor arrived Get that boat out of here the singer screamed That was a very nice performance tonight the Governor replied with his gentle smile New Jersey appreciated it As Mr Sinatra mumbled Thank you Mr Kean and his guests boarded and sailed off  leaving the blueeyed one redfaced The Governor grinned at the memory A fascinating guy Sinatra he said with only a wisp of irony
POLITICAL NEWCOMER CHALLENGING BRODSKY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/nyregion/political-newcomer-challenging-brodsky.html,ROBIN BERGSTROM said her interest in politics was awakened as a reporter and news editor of radio station WVIP in Mount Kisco and then intensified in Albany during the legislative year she worked as an assistant to State Senator Mary B Goodhue That really turned me on to politics seeing you could accomplish something  and that women could do anything Ms Bergstrom said Now she is seeking to take her interest one step further as a candidate for the State Assembly in the 86th District of Greenburgh and north Yonkers But the 39yearold Republican of HastingsonHudson who also has the Conservative Party endorsement faces a formidable task challenging one of the countys most visible Democrats Assemblyman Richard L Brodsky of Greenburgh who is seeking reelection to a third term as an Assemblyman Mr Brodsky who is 40 years old and a former fourterm county legislator won handily in his first try for the Assembly seat in 1982 beating William R Crosbie a Republican Mr Brodsky got 59 percent of the vote to Mr Crosbies 39 percent in a threeway race Two years ago Mr Brodsky won again this time with 54 percent of the vote against Richard A Fontana the former Mayor of Ardsley The Democrat saw it as a more satisfying victory than the one over Mr Crosbie because 1984 was a Reagan year and I more than survived the Republican landslide Ms Bergstrom is seeking to portray Mr Brodsky as a partyline Democrat who represents a faction in Albany that continues to spend and not return tax revenues to the people despite tax cuts Mr Brodsky scoffs at that notion saying that constituents have benefited handsomely from Cuomo administration tax policies Tax rates are lower with the maximum down from 10 percent to 9 percent and personal exemptions are higher Mr Brodsky argued while other benefits credits and deductions have also improved he said He also spoke of legislation that he said had helped the district and he described what he felt was his influential role in the Assemblys Democratic majority Ms Bergstrom for her part would support amendments offered by the Assemblys Republican minority that would establish educational tax credits providing a typical 465 a year for homeowners based on the amount of school taxes they pay She also favors a constitutional amendment to limit spending a state GrammRudman bill she said referring to the Federal legislation that provides automatic limits on expenditures New York States shortterm debt is the largest of any state and our per capita taxes the third highest in the nation she said Ms Bergstrom argued that she would more adequately represent the views of the districts voters than Mr Brodsky  based on what they tell me on train platforms and in other encounters One such issue is the death penalty which Ms Bergstrom favors and Mr Brodsky opposes The average convicted murderer spends only seven years behind bars she said Crack and the drug problem also is of prime concern the Republican challenger asserted She said the Legislature made it a Class B felony for anybody convicted of selling drugs within 1000 feet of a school but that doesnt go far enough She favors a Republican amendment that would have eliminated pleabargaining in such cases which she said Mr Brodsky opposed She has released her 1984 and 1985 tax returns calling on Mr Brodsky to do the same He said he had no reluctance about releasing his records before the election saying that its one of the many levels of privacy one gives up in running for office Mr Brodsky has a list of 26 bills he has sponsored or cosponsored that have been signed into law in the last two years A dozen relate specifically to the district the majority dealing with financial aid to Yonkers He speaks proudly of having worked closely with State Senator John E Flynn a Yonkers Republican who is retiring this year In fact Mr Brodskys campaign literature includes an article describing this bipartisan relationship and while it refers to Mr Flynn as easygoing gentlemanly and wellliked it characterizes Mr Brodsky as aggressive ambitious and occasionally annoying but effective Mr Brodskys legislative role has come to the attention of county Democratic leaders who have approached him as a possible County Executive candidate and as a replacement for Mr Flynn whose Senate District includes Mr Brodskys Assembly District but the Democrat has rejected those overtures I enjoy my work in the Assembly and especially being in the majority he said recalling his frustration as a minority member of the Republicancontrolled County Legislature In the Assembly by contrast Im in a leadership role as a member of the Democratic Steering Committee and chairman of two subcommittees on economic development and on air quality and nuclear issues He has proposed some controversial legislation including state takeovers of Consolidated Edison and other private utilities and he identifies himself with what he feels is the positive record of the Cuomo administration particularly in terms of tax cuts We put through the largest tax cut in the states history he said and more legislation is required Unless a change is made the new Federal tax legislation will produce an extra 2 billion in state revenues because the state income tax is linked to the Federal form thus confronting state taxpayers with higher taxable income but without the lower rates in the Federal version Mr Brodsky said he thought further tax cuts would be addressed in a special session of the State Legislature Ms Bergstrom has taken aim at Mr Brodsky for working to oppose a a Westchester hotel tax sought by the Board of Legislators Assessed on hotel rooms at a rate of 3 percent the tax would bring in 3 million a year to be used for transportation according to county officials But Mr Brodsky has helped keep the bill from the floor of the Legislature saying the county government had a 22 million surplus and that the potential hoteltax revenues should go to local governments He accused Ms Bergstrom meanwhile of changing her position on Medicaid financing for abortions to garner the Conservative Partys endorsement in the legislative race Ms Bergstrom said she was prochoice adding But I would like to see people who believe that abortion is tantamount to murder not have to pay for Medicaid abortions She said this could be done through a taxform checkoff just as taxpayers were able to indicate that they wanted a dollar of their tax to help support Presidential campaigns In the meantime Conservative Party leaders said she had agreed not to support Medicaid financing for abortions Mr Brodsky questioned whether she could be prochoice while opposing Medicaid financing for abortions Ms Bergstrom who is divorced lives with her two children Jenny 17 and Chip 11 and was the editor of a small news magazine in Dutchess County before coming to Westchester seven years ago She said she helped develop an allnews morning format for WVIP during her five years as news director In addition to working for Senator Goodhue she has been employed on a parttime basis by Readers Digest interviewing authors around the nation for a television service provided by the magazine to 160 stations She has also been involved in community work she said and is a vestryman of the Grace Episcopal Church in Hastings Ms Bergstrom also had sought an independent line on the November ballot collecting most of an estimated 2000 signatures on petitions herself but some people who signed thought they were registered voters and they were not she said so the effort failed Nevertheless she said it was a marvelous opportunity to meet people The Republican candidate works with volunteers at train stations supermarkets fairs and other events in the district as well as going doortodoor in the evenings and afternoons to meet voters and promote her campaign She said she had raised 30000 for the campaign not counting the amount the State Republican Committee is putting into mailings to Republicans Conservatives and independents Mr Brodsky puts his own spending figure at 20000 to 25000 Mr Brodsky married a year ago and the father of a baby girl Emily said his opponent had collected quite a lot of money shes by far the most wellfinanced opponent Ive faced He said top Republican leaders were hoping to bloody me up for future races The Democratic incumbent who is also traveling the political circuit to press his case maintained that the district had become increasingly Republican in the last four years The current registration is 25200 Democrats 19100 Republicans 1150 Conservatives 440 Liberals 165 RighttoLifer and 14100 independents The RighttoLife candidate is Sheila Donohue
MR. POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/magazine/mr-power.html,IN HIS CORNER OFFICE AT THE JUStice Department a private sanctum guarded by Federal Bureau of Investigation agents Edwin Meese 3d the 75th Attorney General of the United States has surrounded himself with symbols of the power he wields a Border Patrol pistol a United States marshals badge miniature police cars and helicopters The office says much about the way Meese sees himself for its motif reflects not so much the lawyer in Meese as it does the hardnosed lawman Americas top cop Just outside his door hang two Herblock drawings portrayals of Meese as the beadyeyed zealot Oh theyre just a couple of funny cartoons Meese says Yet it is clear that these two caricatures and some others like them on the walls of his outer office mean much more to him  they are a symbol of how he has made his presence felt in 19 months as Attorney General If the next two years produce the conservative transformation in judicial precedent that the Ronald Reagan Presidency has promised but so far not delivered much of the credit must go to the 54yearold Meese The most prominent loyalist from the Reagan California days still in the Administration Meese has taken center stage in an ideological debate that previously lacked a credible point man within the Government Now it has one pornography or drug smuggling abortion or school prayer the Attorney Generals legal agenda is the Presidents political agenda His instincts are Ronald Reagans instincts Fred F Fielding the White House counsel during the Presidents first term says of Meese For Meese the path has been a tortuous one muddied by infighting at the White House and nearly broken up altogether during his long confirmation hearings by allegations of earlier wrongdoing But the strength of Ed Meese is perseverance An ironwilled partisan with a polemical confrontational style he is also the quintessential available man an ambitious loyalist who defines himself through the approbation and acceptance he receives That combination of loyalty availability and ambition are essential elements in the rise of Meese giving him power and access unequaled in the Reagan Administration Meese frequently sees the President a couple of times a day offering counsel on matters ranging far beyond his duties at Justice Often just privately Ill see him for a few minutes here or a few minutes there says Meese Sometimes Ill ride in the car with him to someplace Besides serving as Attorney General Meese is chairman pro tem of the Presidents Domestic Policy Council comprising the director of the Office of Management and Budget the chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers and five Cabinet officers in addition to Meese He also attends meetings of the National Security Planning Group the handful of top foreign policy and national security advisers that devised last summers disinformation campaign against Libya But it is what he has done at the Justice Department that will be his legacy for Meese has returned the department to a political role it has not played since the Nixon Administration Prior to him the postWatergate Attorneys General men with names such as Saxbe Levi Bell Civiletti and Smith  offered a subdued leadership But Meese has quickly steered the department back to the political arena shaping it into a reflection of how he sees himself  boldly morally conservative In the process he has become its most forceful leader since Robert F Kennedy This department will be fiercely independent in    upholding the law Meese promised at his ceremonial swearingin in March 1985 But this is not inconsistent with conscientiously and vigorously implementing the Presidents philosophy which is in the mainstream of todays American political thinking Since then Meese has played a key role in judicial nominations and has publicly chided the Supreme Court for decisions he disagrees with In turn he has experienced the unprecedented public rebuke of two sitting Justices William J Brennan Jr and John Paul Stevens While conceding that Meese has every right to assert his own perception of what justice is Burt Neuborne professor of law at New York University who until recently was the legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union calls the Attorney Generals views disastrous He is genuinely committed to the proposition that if a majority of the electorate expresses itself on a particular sub  ject that majority should not be held in check by the courts says Neuborne of Meese By crippling the courts he would sacrifice effective protections of individual rights and radically transform society into a majoritarian tyranny The only bright spot in all of this is that so far he has been able to achieve so little His rhetoric has far outstripped his effectiveness Over the last several months I had five interviews with Meese in which he talked about the Supreme Court about his perception of the roles of judges and the police and about his efforts to change the Justice Department He also discussed his confirmation ordeal his close friendship with Ronald Reagan and the death of his son  all of which have profoundly affected him Because of his blunt feisty outspokenness the public perception of the Attorney General is often devoid of the humanizing nuances But Meese says he is baffled by that image I would ask you to go through all the press conferences Ive had since Ive become Attorney General and all the interviews Ive given he says I would defy you to find statements or collections of statements that would give rise to the kind of caricature that too often is created of me In person the Attorney General exudes genuine warmth His suite of offices is energized by those waiting to see him  FBI Director William H Webster leaves as an interviewer enters a group of lawstudent interns mill about photographer in tow to memorialize their moment with Meese trusted aide William Bradford Reynolds is in the anteroom But Meese is not preoccupied He clearly relishes the interchange with his questioner His gaze is direct and he speaks with certitude I AM NOT BY NATURE an unduly combative person Meese says I believe in persuasion rather than mortal combat And to the extent that people are trying to use me as a target for attack possibly the reason is that I have stood very strongly for the objectives and the priorities and the principles and the philosophy of the President He stands just as strongly as I do But when youre the President youre not as vulnerable to attack Yet Ed Meese rarely misses an opportunity to tackle headon those who disagree with him To withdraw because theres opposition on the other side he says to back down in the face of that would be cowardice When he works hard to see that judges nominated to the Federal bench will share the Administrations philosophy about such matters as abortion school prayer and federalism Meese calls it getting the best people When someone criticizes an appointee that is partisan politics Thats the combination of a party being out of power and being enraged by the fact that Ronald Reagan will be selecting as high a percentage of the judiciary as he is the Attorney General says The fact that its an election year and the fact that you just have some people who like to politicize things Meese calls Jefferson B Sessions Jr whose nomination for an appealscourt judgeship was rejected in June by the Senate Judiciary Committee a very courageous prosecutor There was a fierce debate over the attitudes of Sessions a United States Attorney from Mobile Ala toward blacks Meese says it was a campaign of ideologues Meese believes that Daniel A Manion who narrowly won Senate confirmation in July as an appealscourt judge was also unfairly singled out If his name had been Smith or Jones Meese contends Manion wouldnt have been opposed But he was a lightning rod for these ultraliberals because his father had been connected in some way with the John Birch Society Anything in which the John Birch Society was involved in was seized upon by the ultraliberal groups to be a basis for politicization But at the suggestion that he has politicized the Justice Department or that he has favored conservative interests over any others Meese bristles Thats an exaggeration he says Ive spoken out on some issues which I think need to be aired But I dont think that theres anything partisan about my comments on the Constitution Meese says Weve tried to find the kinds of judges that should be acceptable to any group If you look at the judges who have had difficulties I mean how can you do better or get a more acceptable person than a man who has got 15 years of distinguished service on the Supreme Court to be appointed Chief Justice How can you get a better person or a more acceptable person than a man like Nino Scalia who has got an impeccable record in a variety of ways as a practicing lawyer as a teacher on the appellate court I think you cant find two more qualified people in the history of Supreme Court appointments MEESE TAKES from a folder on his desk several sheets of paper that together constitute his blueprint for change at the Justice Department He has drawn up these documents so that he can clearly focus on the task at hand In a twopage outline entitled Policy Goals he has neatly encapsulated his agenda There are the usual priorities that any Attorney General would have  controlling narcotics trafficking terrorism and public corruption  and there are others which are innocentsounding euphemisms for the conservative political course that the Attorney General has embarked on Total nondiscrimination policy for instance stands among other things for an end to racial quotas benefiting minority groups an Administration goal that was directly repudiated by the Supreme Court in its last term Meese however has not given up on it Preservation of constitutional values encompasses some of the most important issues on the Reagan Administrations socialpolicy agenda including leaving to the states the issues of abortion reform and prayer in the schools Religious liberty means going to court as the department did this summer to defend the Roman Catholic Church against the loss of its taxexempt status when another churchrelated group contended it was engaging in political lobbying and campaigning in opposition to legal abortion  activities the tax exemption does not permit Meese believes that even in defeat there is still glory in losing for a good cause That is why he was willing last spring to use a relatively trivial case to ask the Supreme Court to overturn its 1973 Roe v Wade decision legalizing abortion  even though the constitutionality of Roe hadnt been an issue in the case and even though the High Court had specifically reaffirmed the Roe decision three years earlier The department lost its case 5 to 4 but thenChief Justice Warren E Burger switched camps questioning for the first time the wisdom of the Roe decision We got one step closer Meese says Similarly he sees the Justice Departments defeat earlier this year in three affirmative action cases as hinging on a mere technicality Though conceding that the Court directly repudiated his contention that quotas can be used only to aid specific identifiable victims of discrimination Meese says that even in losing there was acquiescence by the Court that the point we were making should be the end result someday They just said were not ready to do that yet The biggest victory of the term Meese says was the Supreme Courts upholding of the Georgia antisodomy law  a case the Justice Department wasnt even involved in We dont have to be in a case to get our view across Meese says The point of view that weve been making  that the Court should not supersede its judgment for the judgment of the states was vindicated in that case Another of the Attorney Generals innocuoussounding policy goals is to promote truth in the courtroom But what Meese really wants is the total repeal of the Supreme Courts 1966 Miranda v Arizona decision which requires the police to inform suspects of their constitutional rights and its 1961 Mapp v Ohio decision prohibiting the introduction of evidence obtained without a valid search warrant These two rulings have according to Meese inhibited truth in the courtroom He maintains They have cast aside probative evidence for nontruthfinding reasons Neither Mapp nor Miranda helps any innocent person They only help guilty people I think if you look at all the cases the only evidence that evers been excluded is evidence of guilt Obviously in taking public positions I dont have the time or the audience to go into legal subtleties But I think the average man in the street understands what it means if the truth about criminals is excluded from the courtroom And when the Mapp and Miranda cases are explained to most people they understand that they are less safe from criminals Thats not hard to figure out According to Meese there are better ways to avoid the police abuses that the two decisions were meant to counteract One he says is videotaped confessions so there will be no possible way that you could have coercion or any intimidation by the police But he adds The best way frankly is with welltrained welldisciplined wellsupervised policemen Since his youth  when his father a clerk at the Oakland police court would come home and regale him with stories about the cases hed heard that day  Meese has had a fascination with police work His sympathies are with the cop on the beat who wants to nab the culprit and he seems genuinely perplexed by the judicial concern about police misconduct Most of the time he says the officer is not acting illegally To Meese lawyers and judges are the ones who argue the technicalities I wouldnt want to be a judge he says not even the Supreme Court would interest him Thats the one thing Ive absolutely ruled out For me the job of being a judge on whatever bench would be much too confining for anything I would really enjoy Meese is proud of the stand he has taken against judicial activism A judges job he insists isnt to decide how the police officers going to act his function is to find the facts You may want to argue on what should be the niceties he says But if you take my approach and the approach of most people in law enforcement the more evidence you get in the more likely youre going to find the truth which ultimately should be the end result of the courtroom process TO IMPROVE THE MANagement of the 62500employee Justice Department Meese is centralizing policy planning and budgeting under the control of a few trusted deputies To implement his policy goals he has organized key executives into small teams whose job it is to focus on Administration priorities Meese and six top aides including FBI Director Webster and Assistant Attorney General Reynolds comprise the command group that meets every morning at 810 to map strategy Another group chaired by Meeses new Deputy Attorney General Arnold I Burns matches the departments budgetary resources to its priorities A third group headed by Reynolds does strategic planning because Meese explains I wanted a group of people who were not involved with the daytoday issues to look to see where the justice system and the department ought to be five years from now Of Meeses aides the 44yearold Reynolds is probably the best known Reynolds retained his position as Assistant Attorney General in charge of the Civil Rights Division after the Senate Judiciary Committee last year refused to confirm him as Meeses new Associate Attorney General Reynolds has been the Justice Departments most uncompromising foe of racial quotas and he continues to play a key policymaking role within Meeses inner circle He has also kept up the attack on the Supreme Court last month accusing Justice Brennan of possessing radical views that threaten individual liberty Meese who says he has not read the speech in which Reynolds made his charges refused to comment on it I dont know any reason why I should particularly read it he said People give speeches all the time in the department here T Kenneth Cribb Jr 38 is the Attorney Generals closest aide and probably the leastknown outside of the department A onetime national director of the Intercollegiate Studies Institute the oldest conservative student organization in the country and a consultant to the Heritage Foundation Cribb served on Meeses staff at the White House and followed him to the Justice Department Now as the Attorney Generals counselor Cribb stays in the background and receives almost no publicity yet he serves as a link between Meese and conservative interest groups I am a source of information for the Attorney General about people who want him to entertain their views Cribb says I am sometimes asked to attend meetings to make his views known and to report back to him During Meeses long confirmation battle Cribb sat behind Meese every day that he testified One Senate staff member swears they even dressed alike so that from behind the dais they just sort of melded together At the White House a principals only rule was imposed to keep Meese from bringing Cribb into the weekly meetings at which judicial nominees were chosen Ken Cribb is kind of my principal personal assistant says Meese Hes an additional set of arms legs and particularly brains In Cribbs view the debate over judicial activism still has many years to run The public discussion has been started by this Attorney General but it takes a generation for daytoday politics to catch up with ideas that are first expressed in a philosophical context For example the politics of the 1960s were the result of philosophical ideas first expressed in the 1930s So what were saying now will be important for generations to come An inveterate notetaker and maker of charts and diagrams Meese likens his role at Justice to being atop a wellregimented corporate structure During his tenure at the White House however where his Cabinetlevel staff job of counselor to the President gave him responsibility for seeing to it that each department hewed closely to the Presidents policies Meese found himself part of an organization beset by jealousies and infighting The battle among the Presidents top advisers was frequently waged through the press and it was Meeses reputation that suffered the most He was supposed to formulate policy and James Baker the chief of staff was supposed to make the trains run on time one White House aide recalls But he never really got the policydevelopment syndrome Youd go through a meeting with him and think everything had been decided and then absolutely nothing would happen The uncertainty led to internecine fights and ultimately the policy development got done elsewhere Meese now strongly defends his record at the White House saying that he established what is generally looked upon as the strongest Cabinet system of any President in modern time He was however outflanked by Baker who took the White House policymaking role for himself But Bakers credentials were suspect among conservative factions Baker had been George Bushs Presidential campaign manager He hadnt even registered as a Republican until 1970 This closet moderate couldnt be the conservatives friend in the White House But Meese could It turned out that Baker was the pragmatist the doer says a former Reagan Administration official But he was also the one the conservatives tended to scream about They thought he was breaking the faith And Meese became the person who conservatives turned to He filled a vacuum He became in essence what other conservatives thought he was  what they made him into He became the darling of the conservatives Paul D Kamenar executive legal director of the conservative Washington Legal Foundation describes the relationship between the Justice Department and conservative interest groups as conscious parallelism It helps the department when we come in as an amicus curiae taking a more extreme viewpoint Kamenar says That way they cant be called extremist ED MEESE WAS born and raised in Oakland Calif I was born in 1931 in the Depression Meese says Our family never had a lot of money This was never a big thing to my folks and never a big thing to us At the age of 10 he and his three younger brothers published their own weekly neighborhood newspaper and put the 640 they earned from it toward war bonds He was valedictorian of his public high school class and the winner of a Lions Club speakers contest He notes with pride that all four of the Meese boys went to college My folks made a lot of sacrifices so that we could he says He traveled East for the first time in 1949 to attend Yale where 60 percent of his 1123 classmates had graduated from elite Eastern preparatory schools Meese having been awarded a lastminute scholarship that he now calls a fluke was virtually the antithesis of the typical Yale student but he found a niche for himself with a slew of extracurricular activities debate team Political Union a religious club freshman crew manager of the track team librarian at his residential college Among his notable qualities were an abiding loyalty to even casual acquaintances and his energy and enthusiasm for almost any task Two of Meeses younger roommates at Yale recalled recently how he took an almost parental interest in them patiently teaching one to play bridge and helping another to get into a Yale society He was naive recalls Maxwell K Dickinson a former roommate of Meeses and now a Florida stockbroker He didnt look under rocks to see what was bad about everything He wasnt jaundiced He never had bitter things to say I dont remember anything ever disappointing him After graduation Meese returned to California and started law school at Berkeley finishing in 1958 after a twoyear interruption to serve as an artillery officer in the Army He joined the Oakland District Attorneys office just out of law school and was still there a few years later when Sanford H Kadish a Berkeley law professor recruited him to help teach a clinical law program I needed someone who was actually working in the field Kadish remembers Ed was willing He was very reliable Always did what he was supposed to do Genial Likable There was a softness and a gentleness to him no sharp edges to his personality Ed didnt have profound political convictions He was your average diligent young fellow from an average Republican background and he might have continued in just that way except that his attractiveness led to opportunities He became an ally of people who had very profound political beliefs and he assimilated those beliefs There is a disarming simplicity to the way Meese characterizes his relationship with the man who has given him or helped him get just about every important job he has had during the last two decades Well I guess the way Id describe it we have worked together closely for almost 20 years Meese says of Ronald Reagan We are good friends And we are people who by and large without any real effort on my part to do this come up with the same viewpoint on most issues pretty much totally independent of each other Privately White House chief of staff Donald T Regan has bridled at Meeses easy access to the President But anyone who has ever attempted to cut Meese off has ended up the loser Always the President stands by him The two first met in Sacramento Reagan was the newly elected Governor of California and Meese was a young deputy district attorney from Oakland with a penchant for publicity Campus turbulence in the 1960s had already given Meese his first big break he had directed the arrest in 1964 of 761 protesters at the University of California at Berkeley In 1966 he testified before the House UnAmerican Activities Committee that the Berkeley organizers of an early antiwar group were giving aid and comfort to the enemy and that penalties of 20000 and 20 years in prison wouldnt be inappropriate if the group carried through with plans to march on an Army induction center Meese signed on as the Governors extradition and clemency secretary but soon transformed the job into that of Reagans legalaffairs adviser and within two years was his executive secretary the highest staff job He was the capable loyal aide who reduced complex problems to a few clear choices for his boss to choose from When Reagan left office in 1974 Meese moved to the San Diego suburb of La Mesa After a year with Rohr Industries Inc a manufacturer of aerospace components he started a law practice his main clients were the Reagan precampaign committee called Citizens for the Republic and the state Chamber of Commerce In 1977 Meese began teaching at the law school of the University of San Diego a small private school He also became director of the law schools Center for Criminal Justice Policy and Management During his threeyear tenure with the center which was financed by conservative groups Meese published three papers two dealing with policepress relations and a third on child abuse The Attorney General now looks upon his days in San Diego wistfully We had a beautiful home he says I had a good job I had the ability to do three things teach direct the criminal justice center and practice law on the side And economically we were doing very well So it was an ideal situation I would have been very happy to stay there It is easy to understand how Meese could romanticize his time in San Diego It had been a charmed existence compared to what awaited him in Washington Besides the infighting at the White House there were financial problems brought on by carrying two big mortgages Unable to sell his home in La Mesa for 20 months Meese had nonetheless purchased a new house in McLean Va He fell 15 months behind in his payments on the California residence but two savings and loan officials who oversaw Meeses account looked the other way Both later got Federal jobs as did a La Mesa businessman who arranged a 70000 loan  later forgiven  to a buyer to facilitate the purchase of Meeses house Questions were also raised among other things about Meeses stock trading and whether he obtained special treatment from Government agencies for businesses in which he had an interest It was such goingson that led his predecessor at Justice William French Smith to appoint a special prosecutor to investigate Meese When Meese has occasion to mention Smith now it is almost never by name He is my predecessor the same way a candidate might refer to my opponent The investigation was an electionyear liability for Ronald Reagan but he stuck by his friend as he always had before and Meese  who denied any wrongdoing  was eventually cleared In March 1985 13 months after he was first nominated he was sworn in as Attorney General One of his lieutenants remembers how his boss tried to laugh off the ignominy during one of his first staff meetings Not such a bad record Meese had quipped nominated in February confirmed in March Meese does not like to discuss the year he spent in limbo a period when Justice Department morale sank perceptibly But it is clear he was deeply affected by it He calls the confirmation battle an unfortunate byproduct of the ultrapartisan politics thats practiced by some people here But I dont think youre ever going to change people There are just some people who believe in political character assassination and its unfortunate that they get elected Its one of the sad parts about any political system Of this time Meese now says You always have days when you wake up and say Why are you doing this I told the President that if he at any time felt it was hurting him I didnt want to proceed He insisted just absolutely the opposite He wanted me to go through with the thing It was that kind of support I felt a commitment to him I wanted to carry out what the President wanted me to do In the summer of 1982 Meeses 19yearold son Scott the middle of three children and a sophomore at Princeton was killed in an automobile accident Meese and his wife Ursula were devastated by the tragedy Its the worst thing obviously thats ever happened to us he says now his eyes welling up And I think I was just fortunate to have a lot of very good friends who were helpful at that time including the President who was extremely helpful and supportive The President and Nancy Reagan Meese holds dear the traditional values that his relationship with the Reagans embodies In his own mind the Justice Department is an extension of those values providing law enforcement that is not just vigorous but he says compassionate as well As Meese sees it that means protecting the average man from crime from pornography or even his own Government And he has no doubt that the people who really matter are behind him The law enforcement community has labored for many years being the scapegoat for the increase in crime while having to take a lot of court decisions which have been inimical to effective law enforcement he says I have gotten a tremendous response from the law enforcement community because I am willing to speak out on issues which are key to protecting the public
BELAGA AND THE GENDER FACTOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/nyregion/belaga-and-the-gender-factor.html,IF you know that Julie D Belaga is the first Republican woman to run for Governor it is probably not because she told you Mrs Belaga does not talk much about being a woman Governor ONeill the Democratic incumbent challenges her politics not her gender But it is Mrs Belagas sex not her politics that some say could change voting patterns Any split between how women view the election and the issues and how men take sides in the contest could make the difference for some candidates between winning and losing on Nov 4 they say That difference is the difference between Democrats being able to recapture the legislature said Dr Stanley Greenberg president of the Analysis Group a polling company in New Haven Its the difference between who wins control of the Congressional delegation which stands even now with three Democrats and three Republicans The difference between how men and women vote with the tendency of women in recent years to vote Democratic more than men exists at an issue level it exists at a party level it exists at a voting level said Dr Greenberg who is working for the Democratic Party The presence of female candidates such as Mrs Belaga could change that Although she is a Republican will female voters be more likely to vote for Mrs Belaga because she is a woman In exit polls during the 1984 Presidential election the three major television networks found fewer women than men voting Republican  56 percent of the women compared with 62 percent of the men according to The New York TimesCBS News poll Other polls found that women provided the margins that elected Democratic Senators in Illinois Massachusetts Michigan and Iowa Women are a substantial majority of the Connecticut electorate Of the more than one and a half million registered voters 893328 or nearly 60 percent are women according to the Analysis Group Although statistics on turnouts in the state are not available nationally in 1984 turnout among female voters was clearly higher than for men for the first time According to a Census Bureau survey 61 percent of the registered female voters as opposed to 59 percent of the men voted Women cast 535 percent of the vote Republicans nationally and in the state are apparently counting on female candidates to help reverse the trend toward the Democrats But it will be Mrs Belagas stands on issues that concern women say Republican leaders that will persuade women to vote for her Dr Barbara Kaplan of the Gene Reilly Group a market researcher in Darien doubted the effect of a candidates sex Im not sure that being a woman is any more important than being a candidate who understands how to stress issues that appeal to women Dr Kaplan said I dont think the Democrats or the Republicans can lay claim to the womens vote said Dr Kaplan whose research is based on interviews with groups of women The candidate who gains an advantage is the candidate who can present the issues in a compelling way that shows women how public policy can resolve their personal problems she said The problems according to Dr Kaplan generally concern economics and go far beyond what are considered traditional womens issues such as equal pay or abortion Being a woman and being appealed to as a woman is not as important as being poor and having to pay the rent and pay for day care she said Republican leaders said Mrs Belaga should be able to appeal successfully on the issues If the economy and those things are of big importance to female voters then were going to be right on target because of the kinds of things well be selling to the public and the issues that Republicans stand for the state chairman Thomas J DAmore Jr said If you do things in an artificial sense that says OK were going to go after the womens vote and try to buy it so to speak I think the publics much too sophisticated for that The Democratic chairman Timothy J Moynihan said People dont specifically vote on ethnic background gender or whatever They make the comparison on ability credibility and performance Mrs Belaga a fiveterm legislator from Westport conceded her gender helped But she added she is not making a conscious effort to woo women Theres an instant affinity there she said There are women who come talk to me immediately about the fact that I am out there running proud of what Im doing excited that I have good credentials that there are no apologies for who I am or what Im all about and theyre cheering me on Being a woman she said is an asset in that it helps me break into traditional groups of people that might not vote Republican if I were a male candidate When you meet someone for the first time as a woman Mrs Belaga said you have to show them that youre bright that you can handle the issues and that you have ideas on how to solve problems Once you do that I think it becomes an asset State Representative Christine M Niedermeier a fourterm Democrat from Fairfield who is challenging United States Representative Stewart B McKinney in the Fourth Congressional District said Were still at the point where women are given the benefit of the doubt and looked upon as being extrasensitive to people and their problems However she acknowledged that if statistics showed women moving to the Democratics they also show men moving to the Republicans I need to get support from women so I cant take them for granted but if I play a campaign just to women Im going to lose support from men who are just as equally an important part of the electorate she said However even in Connecticut where from the statehouse Ella T Grasso calmed many skeptics about women in politics questions linger Mrs Belaga mentioned that some older ethnic women were skeptical of her candidacy Miss Niedermeier as she was campaigning at a picnic for the elderly was asked when she would marry The ultimate test will be at the polls The 1984 shift of men to the Republicans along with President Reagans ability to attract a majority of women closed many disparities nationally But they remain open in state and local races The gender gap is as large now as it ever was Dr Greenberg said I dont see anything in Connecticut politics that would make me think it would override that process Ronald Reagan was able to override it but there is no Ronald Reagan in Connecticut politics

An Imposed Ignorance,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/opinion/l-an-imposed-ignorance-378986.html,To the Editor Room for Darwin and the Bible is a good vehicle for raising an important issue that is seldom discussed our unwillingness to tolerate rational discussion of claims made in the name of religion or allegedly backed by religion as proper subject matter for public education Irving Kristol is a case in point He holds that the scientific theory of evolution should not be taught as dogmatic fact but as a hypothesis But how then should the creationist account be taught Apparently not at all in the public schools even though Mr Kristol holds that as a matter of faith it is perfectly defensible Leave this defense to the parochial schools and churches Suppose we generalize this advice We live in an age where morality itself is linked with Christianity and the very association of a belief with secular humanism is sufficient to condemn it where many politicians and even one potential Presidential candidate claim religious backing for their viewpoints and where religious leaders of various faiths use the prestige and authority of their offices to express opinions on abortion and other matters of public policy Mr Kristols view leaves no place for the rational evaluation of such claims in the public school setting It condemns to ignorance those who do not have the means or will to study theology It is often said that a persons religion is a private matter Fair enough But when religion is used to defend public policies that affect all of us believer and unbeliever alike the rational evaluation of its claims becomes proper subject matter for the general educational process I strongly suspect that our failure to encourage such an evaluation as part of the normal process of education in the public schools is associated with a common fallacy the confusion of the question whether a person has a right to hold a religiously oriented opinion with the quite different question of the rightness correctness of that opinion A person has a right to hold such an opinion but that does not make it rightDONALD F KOCH East Lansing Mich Sept 30 1986 The writer is professor of philosophy at Michigan State University
APARTHEID ISSUE ROILS OSSINING,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/12/nyregion/apartheid-issue-roils-ossining.html,DURING the last few weeks officials of the town and village of Ossining have been confronting the issue of South Africas apartheid policy instead of the zoning and budget questions that generally occupy their agendas What brought the issue to the forefront in the town of Ossining was a yearly running event in the village it was the adoption of an investment policy for village funds The yearly Ossining Town Road Race is scheduled to take place today as it has on this date for the last seven years but with one difference The town has withdrawn its sponsorship in the process removing its contribution of publicity and cleanup and some of the police protection previously given to the race The split came when the race committee insisted that the official race Tshirts carry an antiapartheid slogan and the town insisted that it could not get involved in political issues that were beyond town matters The fivemember Town Board voted unanimously to withdraw its support of the road race because as Supervisor Barbara C Fratianni explained We dont wish to make political statements She added The members of the Town Board are all personally opposed to apartheid but the town should not get involved in making political statements because youre opening up the floodgates Once you establish a precedent how can you decline any other requests The 16 members of the race committee all of whom voted to go ahead with the Tshirt slogan even if it meant losing town support said Stop Apartheid did not set a precedent because it was not like other political statements This is not an issue like any other issue because it has only one moral stand that you can take a side on Clay Tiffany the race director said He accused town officials of harassment in an effort to block use of the slogan and discourage sponsors During the three Town Board meetings when the race was discussed Mr Tiffany said he was told that he had not submitted papers necessary to administrate the 131 and 1mile runs and that he could not include the name Ossining in the official name of the race Once a decision not to sponsor the race was made the town used paid advertisements in addition to legal notices to announce the towns disassociation Originally the race committee had agreed to use Save the River as a slogan and Mr Tiffany said the Town Board had not objected But when the slogan changed the board despite 1800 local signatures collected supporting the antiapartheid slogan withdrew town sponsorship The signatures had no bearing on the decision Mrs Fratianni said Its a cutanddried case she said The town should not be the vehicle for the expression of selfinterest groups Next year it may be Stop Abortion or some other slogan Mrs Fratianni expressing disappointment over the controversy said the nonprofit race had been a very important town event When it was established eight years ago it was part of an effort to familiarize people outside the town with Ossining Because road races were relatively new then it became a success featuring about 300 runners plus entertainment food booths and a large turnout of residents Mr Tiffany beleives that todays race will be a success in spite of the towns withdrawal By last week about half of the 4600 he said was needed  to pay for additional police protection insurance publicity printing refreshments and entertainment  had been raised he said He added that the committee had difficulty this year in attracting large sponsors American Cable Systems is the major contributor he said adding that most businesses in town had contributed smaller sums Meanwhile another controversy involving South Africas racial policy is coming to a close in Ossining The village of 22000 residents is ready to adopt an investment policy that does not include the antiapartheid clause that had been demanded by a village Trustee and a resident The village is required by the state to formulate an investment policy to assure the reliable investment of village funds in this case several million dollars according to the Mayor But Thomas Cambariere a village Trustee said adoption of a policy presented an opportunty for the village to take a stand against apartheid by including a clause that would prevent investment of village funds in banks that have investments in South Africa If every municipality took such a stance it would make a significant difference Mr Cambariere said Whether its a dollar or a million dollars its the same principle  dollars dont govern the principle And I think Im in synch with the feelings of many people in the community Al Berger a village resident agreed arguing that if the villages money supported apartheid it was the responsibility of the Village Board of Trustees to act But Mayor Joseph G Caputo said state guidelines had been used to formulate the villages investment policy and that the other trustees felt that their personal opposition to apartheid should not influence their decision as village officials He added that only one of the five banks designated by the Village Board to be considered for handling village funds Barclays had South African connections and that the bank was making no new investments in South Africa The United States Congress in fact barred new investment in South Africa by American businesses earlier this month when the Senate voted to override a Presidential veto of legislation imposing stiff economic sanctions on South Africa We are a village and we are interested in our own priorities Mr Caputo said I just didnt think it was necessary to put such a statement in the policy There is a tacit agreement among the officials of some municipalities in the county not to invest in banks with South African connections In Yonkers there was an earnest request from the City Council to formalize such an agreement said Arthur J Doran the City Manager However he added the city was advised by the State Comptrollers office that each municipality was required to invest where yields were highest and that it was inappropriate for local jurisidictions to formulate foreign policy While most municipalities have not dealt with the issue the county adopted a resolution a year ago barring investments in banks that had made loans to the Government of South Africa or to private banks in South Africa according to Mark Moran a county spokesman
SCHOOL CLINICS ACROSS NATION DEFEND ROLE WITH TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/13/us/school-clinics-across-nation-defend-role-with-teen-agers.html,An increasing number of schools around the country are looking beyond the school nurses office in an effort to bring health care to lowincome students and to combat teenage pregnancy According to participants in a national conference on schoolbased clinics held here this week comprehensive clinics are providing services and a sense of community for students who might otherwise never see a doctor or counselor An estimated 61 of such clinics are in operation around the nation now many providing sex counseling and reproductive health information along with examinations immunizations first aid drug and alcohol abuse programs nutrition advice and other services tailored to adolescents in lowincome areas The Center for Population Options a national advocacy group says 100 more schools expect to open clinics The sex counseling aspect of the clinics work stirred controversy in New York City this week when attention was called to the practice of schoolaffiliated clinics dispensing contraceptives to teenagers Conference participants here in Denver acknowledged their concern with teenage pregnancy and birth control but stressed that the clinics provide a positive climate while offering general health care Most of the clinics require written consent from parents before they see a child We look at sex education as a part of good health care  sex education is separate from health care in peoples minds said Truman Thomas director of social services for the Children and Youth Project of the pediatric department at the University of Texas which opened a schoolbased clinic in Dallas in 1967 Looking at Broader Problems In his opening speech Dr James P Comer director of the School Development Program at the Yale University Child Study Center argued that poverty large families low education levels and unconcerned parents force adolescents out of the mainstream of values The way to change these structural problems Dr Comer said is to help teenagers feel related to the clinics in their schools In Kansas City Mo the Adolescent Resources Corporation reported that 63 percent of the students using clinics would not have sought treatment elsewhere and at the West Dallas Youth Clinic undiagnosed health problems including 100 heart murmurs were discovered in 30 percent of the patients Administrators also say the teenagers need an accessible comfortable place to talk  whether about selfimage and depression or sex and pregnancy When pregnancy occurs the clinics say part of their success is a high rate of return to school after delivery A St Paul clinic says about 80 percent of its mothers remain in school Focusing on Prevention In a report the St Paul clinic Healthstart Inc said one goal was to provide counseling on family planning and primary prevention counseling stressing selfesteem problemsolving and decisionmaking Abstinence and postponement of sexual activity are emphasized St Pauls program is one of the 32 in the country in which schools prescribe birth control measures but do not fill the prescriptions In response to concerns that availability of contraception promotes promiscuity Dr Laurie Schwab Zabin an assistant professor at Johns Hopkins School of Medicine cited a program in Baltimore in which the pregnancy and abortion rates were said to have decreased Among those that had not begun sexual activity before the program began there was a postponement of sex for an average of seven months she said
SCIENTISTS DEVELOPING A NEW DRUG THAT BLOCKS AND HALTS PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/13/us/scientists-developing-a-new-drug-that-blocks-and-halts-pregnancy.html,Within a year a drug should become available in France for use under physicians supervision that both blocks and terminates pregnancy according to a World Health Organization official If a woman wishes to avoid pregnancy after intercourse or if she has missed a menstrual period and believes she may be pregnanta single pill would initiate menstruation sweeping the egg cell out of her system Dr Jose Barzelatto the director of WHOs program on human reproduction noted that in such a case the woman could not tell whether she was actually pregnant The new drug is still known only by the designation RU 486 given by its developer the RousselUclaf Company a French affiliate of HoechstRoussel Pharmaceuticals based here in Switzerland Exciting Advance Seen The development of RU 486 is one of the most exciting advances in the family planning field in a number of years said Dr Wayne Bardin director of the Center for Biomedical Research of the Population Council in New York Research by the Population Council which was founded in 1952 to explore ways to cope with global population growth is financed by a number of foundations and government agencies in the United States and abroad The new drug is the fruit of a prolonged search for a morning after pill that would also have an abortive effect Pills previously developed for use after intercourse contain female sex hormones or estrogens and must be given in such high doses that they induce vomiting and abdominal pain After RU 486 has initiated menstruation the womans monthly cycle returns to normal A number of contraceptive procedures now in widespread use sometimes lead to cycle irregularities and bleeding Abortion Opponents Alarmed According to Dr Bardin the prospect that RU 486 will allow a woman to abort a pregnancy in the privacy of her home has already alarmed opponents of abortion He said he and other researchers had been questioned by members of Congress seeking to insure that no research on such drugs was being done with Federal funds While the drug has been tested in the United States there are no immediate plans to make it generally available there Before that happens it would have to be approved by the Food and Drug Administration The new drug is one of a number of contraceptive strategies being explored under auspices of WHO to stem the global population explosion Some appear particularly well adapted to developing countries where population growth is rapid health care facilities are limited and frequent contraceptive dosages are impractical Every year according to the most recent annual report of the WHO program about 500000 pregnant women in developing countries die and 15 to 20 percent of these deaths are the result of illegal abortion attempts Reports from 74 such countries indicate that in half of them only one out of five women practice contraception Tested in Australia and India The new strategies include a vaccine that immunizes the woman against the hormone chorionic gonadotrophin whereby a fertilized egg signals its presence to the mother causing her menstruation to cease If this signal is not received the egg is swept out A single vaccine injection appears effective for about 18 months It is being tested on 30 women in Australia and others in India A contraceptive strategy developed by the Population Council increasingly used in Scandinavia as well as in many developing countries implants silicone tubes the thickness of a toothpick under the skin of the upper arm The tubes contain the synthetic hormone levonorgestrel which is gradually released into the bloodstream preventing pregnancy for five years in a high percentage of cases If a woman wishes to become pregnant the tubes can be removed and fertility returns almost immediately But a visit to a clinic is required both to start and end the procedure Monthly Cycle Is Disrupted And while according to Dr Barzelatto the procedure is extremely effective in most users the monthly cycle is disrupted and some users have reported irregular bleeding With Copronor an implant being developed by WHO and the National Institutes of Health in Bethesda Md no return to the clinic would be needed Its tube is gradually absorbed by the body Copronor should be ready for marketing in about three years Another new device is a vaginal ring that slowly releases levonorgestrel Its diameter resembles that of a contraceptive diaphragm and it is inserted in the same way When it is ready for the market it could be sold across the counter and used without the help of a clinician Its dosage is lower than that needed in pills since its secretions enter the bloodstream more directly Thus its side effects such as interference with the monthly cycle are less Similar Molecular Structure The drug RU 486 is the product of efforts by researchers at RousselUclaf to find a way to block the action of progesterone the hormone needed to maintain pregancy and turn off menstruation The blocking action has been achieved through synthesis of a steroid RU 486 part of whose molecular structure is like that of progesterone This enables it to attach itself to chemical receptors in the uterus that normally receive the progesterone In this way progesterone from the ovary finds no vacant receptors and its activity is blocked Prostaglandins and their chemical analogues are used to induce uterine contractions as an aid to normal deliveries and also to induce abortions although large doses needed for the latter role produce severe side effects According to the most recent annual report on the WHO program a number of clinical trials have used sulprostone a prostaglandin analogue in combination with RU 489 The two drugs together seem to be more effective than either of them when given separately Single Dose Is Sufficient In tests with 37 Swedish women in early pregnancy all but two aborted after a fourday course of RU 486 plus an injection of sulprostone on the last day of dosage In hundreds of tests of RU 486 on women in Scandinavia the United States and elsewhere a single dose of the drug has been found to be sufficient When it is made more widely available in France it will at first be given only to physicians They will be advised to use it in a period beginning three days before the ovary is due to discharge an egg cell and ending a week after that As stated in the annual report the tests with RU 486 strongly suggest that treatment with such a drug combined with a prostaglandin constitutes a safe simple and effective medical approach to the termination of early pregnancy Furthermore the report said it does not require special skills and is relatively free of side effects
SCIENCE WATCH; Abortion Trend,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/14/science/science-watch-abortion-trend.html,Forty million to 60 million induced abortions are performed in the world each year about 33 million of them legally according to a new study by the Alan Guttmacher Institute By contrast about 131 million babies will be born in the world this year according to estimates by the United Nations The Guttmacher report said that the worldwide abortion rate including illegal abortions is 37 to 55 abortions per 1000 women of childbearing age well above the United States rate of 27 per 1000 The longterm trend is toward more permissive abortion laws according to the report by the institute a private organization in New York that studies population issues More than half the worlds people now live in countries where abortion is available on request and another fourth live in countries where abortion is permitted to protect a womans health The most restrictive policies tend to be in fundamentalist Islamic countries and in countries of subSaharan Africa and Latin America But in a number of these countries medical practitioners provide abortions without being prosecuted the researchers found While the abortion rate in the United States is lower than the estimated worldwide average it is higher than that in other Western industrialized countries
EXCERPTS FROM LIEUTENANT GOVERNOR FOES' DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/nyregion/excerpts-from-lieutenant-governor-foes-debate.html,Following are excerpts from a debate yesterday at The New York Times between the three candidates in the Nov 4 election for New York State Lieutenant Governor Stan Lundine DemocratLiberal Michael Kavanagh RepublicanConservative and Thomas A Droleskey Right to Life Their Role in Office Q Do you have any agreement with your Governor candidate as to your role as Lieutenant Governor If not in any event what do you consider the role of Lieutenant Governor LUNDINE Yes I have an agreement with Governor Cuomo that the Lieutenant Governor will be a full partner in developing all the public policy of the state and in implementing that part of our administrations initiatives that we determine make sense for the Lieutenant Governor to take responsibility for Governor Cuomo and I    are both convinced that any enterprise that is billions of dollars in scope deserves more than just the chief executive officer it deserves an executive vice president or a second officer    Q Does it bother you Mr Lundine that this Governor has a reputation of not delegating authority LUNDINE Well thats certainly a matter that I wanted to talk to him about and wanted a clear understanding about But our understanding is that I will be involved in all the decisionmaking    KAVANAGH Well I think first of all its unfortunate that you have to address that question to the lieutenant governor candidates It seems to me the best person to answer would be the gubernatorial candidate and the Governors refusal to participate in exchanges such as this to debate to tell the people what role he envisions for the Lieutenant Governor is just another extension of his irreponsible conduct Andy ORourke and I have reached an agreement that because of my expertise in the field of criminal justice that I will assume a lead role in the ORourke administration in implementing substantial reforms to our criminal justice system The criminal justice system in this state with particular emphasis upon this city doesnt work The criminal community in the city of New York views the criminal justice system primarily as an inconvenience it has absolutely no deterrent value whatsoever    Q On Medicaid funding of abortion would either one of you want to repeal it in the state LUNDINE I would not KAVANAGH I would The Tax Windfall Q Lets talk about the 2 billion tax windfall What should we do with that money How should we return it to the taxpayer And should we not also cut taxes at the same time LUNDINE The Governor was the first responsible public official in this state who last spring said that this state should not and will not under his administration spend this money but will return it to the taxpayers by cutting rates of taxes    We need to reform state taxes so that theyre more fair to working lowerincome people and to middleincome people Second he proposes that we must take action to make New York more competitive with other states for economic development    Q Do you think the money ought to be given back proportionately to whoever paid the increase LUNDINE I think we have to retain progressivity in taxes in New York    At the same time we have to make compensation for the capitalgains taxpayers who will be paying more and I personally feel that rate reduction ought to be a top priority for New York because it has a tremendous effect on decisionmakers who affect jobs in New York KAVANAGH Theyre not even willing to make the commitment now We stand for the proposition that this is a windfall in every sense of the word and that this state government must take responsible steps to insure that every bit of this 2 billion or 25 billion or whatever it turns out to be is in fact returned to the people who paid it and that this state government not only has to do that as an act of fundamental fairness to those taxpayers but it also has to do that as an act of credibility on its part to convince the business community that in fact New York is sincere when it talks about tax reform This Governor makes a great todo about the fact that hes initiated this massive tax cut In fact in his first year in office he resisted Senate initiatives to reduce taxes and raised taxes by 1 billion The second year he went along with this proposal We think that much more can be done and what we proposed  in addition to returning this windfall to the people who paid it  we propose that there be substantial reductions in taxes beginning first off with salestax reform    Ethics in Government Q We talk about the New York City scandals Is there any state role in combating such scandals or making sure it doesnt happen again KAVANAGH The state can play a lead role in investigating and rooting out corruption amongst municipal officials Here we have the situation where the Governor of this state has failed to take a resonable and responsible step to deal with this corruption We have four district attorneys who are investigating and in charge of prosecuting state violations that have been generated by this scandal These district attorneys have political relationships with some of the targets of these investigations    That sort of relationship does not lend itself to a full fair and thorough investigation    We have the situation here that the Governors son has in effect developed a law practice which I think everyone would agree the relationship of Andrew Cuomo with these clients and with his father creates at the very least very serious ethical improprieties about this practice and his access    LUNDINE The Republican campaign started off with mudslinging and they just continued it right on through    The Governors proposals on ethics go beyond those that have been proposed by any other responsible party in the state Theyve been blocked by the State Senate in the main    Cuomo and Lundine will be at the forefront of getting the kind of legal reform of the political system in New York State to make its ethics of the highest integrity and to make the punishment for any abuses by public officials appropriate to the crime    In my judgment the district attorneys in these cases have been doing their job effectively There is not one bit of evidence that someone has been given soft treatment or not prosecuted    I would say the same of the Republican United States attorneys    This business of bringing in Andrew Cuomo is just another example of trying to equate him with these things It is as underhanded a political tactic as I can imagine These people are public officials accused of serious crimes Andrew Cuomo at best is a accused of practicing law and attracting clients because of who he is    In fact he has refused though neither legal ethics nor the law would require him to to represent clients before state agencies something incidentally that Mr ORourke refuses to disclose whether he did or did not do in Westchester County    KAVANAGH    The fact is that hes indicated that he does not recall If there were some it was incidental to his practice and Ive accepted that Summing Up Q Its time for sumup DROLESKEY    Last week in The New York Times  a week ago today in the science section there was an article about a procedure done by some surgeon who had removed a 23weekold fetus from the womb performed urinary tract surgery on it and returned it to the womb and it was born For those who say they are prochoice what makes that one child human and worthy of medical treatment and another child the same age worthy of destruction This I believe is the critical question of the campaign Do we want a person as Governor who believes in one thing yet uses his public career to do something else    LUNDINE We base our candidacy on three things One is that the Governor has a good record He cut taxes balanced the budget hes invested in our states future in education and infrastructure Theres 932000 more jobs in New York than when Governor Cuomo took office Hes led the way toward economic revitalization Secondly that we have the experience relevant to the offices we seek  I at the local and national level the Governors lengthy experience at the state level and that our integrity I believe should be beyond question I guess mine hasnt been questioned But I know of no person in public life whose integrity I respect any more than or as much as Mario Cuomo Finally we have laid out an agenda for the future in terms of jobs and new technology in terms of housing programs education environment and the other major public issues facing this state KAVANAGH I think its a tragedy for the democratic process that you folks  and you represent the people of this city and great state have to rely upon what the lieutenant governor candidates say are the great issues for this campaign Its a tragedy for the people of this state for the democratic process that this Governor has arrogantly refused to defend his record and to reveal his plans for the next four years If you had heard from the candidates you would have heard that Andy ORourke represents a constructive and necessary change that he is a person who is committed to placing a cap on state spending on fighting these terrible and traumatic increases in state spending that weve suffered He is a public official committed to longterm and meaningful tax reform He believes in a firm fair and effective system of criminal justice that would begin with the imposition of the death penalty upon people who commit premeditated murder   
LUNDINE AND KAVANAGH CLASH IN DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/nyregion/lundine-and-kavanagh-clash-in-debate.html,The two major party candidates for lieutenant governor of New York differed yesterday on the need for a special prosecutor to investigate corruption in New York City the death penalty and the necessity for special anticrack legislation Their views came in a debate at The New York Times that was dominated by talk of crime and corruption It was the first debate between Representative Stan Lundine the DemocraticLiberal candidate for lieutenant governor and his RepublicanConservative opponent Ulster County District Attorney Michael Kavanagh Thomas A Droleskey the Right to Life Party candidate also participated The respective gubernatorial candidates have yet to debate because of conditions imposed by Governor Cuomo Mr Kavanagh who was a more aggressive debater than his opponents concentrated throughout the 90minute session on the current corruption in New York City calling it a total breakdown of the criminal justice system in the city and what he said were Mr Cuomos broken promises from the 1982 campaign for governor Kavanagh Wants Prosecutor The lowerkeyed Mr Lundine resting on what polls indicate is a substantial lead for Mr Cuomo and himself voters cannot split their ballot a vote for one gubernatorial candidate is a vote for his running mate  talked about the Cuomo record defended the Governor and accused the Republican ticket of mudslinging In calling for a special state prosecutor the 42yearold Mr Kavanagh said that Democratic district attorneys who have the prime responsibility for investigating corrruption have political relationships with some of the targets of these investigations He noted that party leaders under investigation played major roles in nominating the prosecutors Mr Lundine responded that he found it amusing that a district attorney would suggest the superseding of fellow prosecutors In my judgment the district attorneys in these cases have been doing their jobs and doing them effectively Mr Lundine said Some of the most heated moments came when the two candidates discussed Andrew P ORourke the Republican candidate for Governor and Andrew Cuomo the Governors son and their legal clients Mr Kavanagh began the exchange when he said that there were very serious ethical improprieties in Andrew Cuomos law practice which includes several major realestate developers as clients Andrew Cuomo Defended Mr Lundine charged Mr Kavanagh with underhanded political tactics in raising questions about Andrew Cuomos law practice in the same context as New York City corruption These people are public officials accused of serious crime Mr Lundinesaid Andrew Cuomo at best is accused of practicing law and attracting clients because of who he is Declaring that Andrew Cuomo has declined to represent clients before state agencies Mr Lundine said Mr ORourke the Westchester County Executive had refused to list clients whom he represented before Westchester agencies while he was a parttime county legislator Mr Kavanagh contended that Mr ORourke was barred by legal canons from disclosing clients without their approval The two also differed on the death penalty with Mr Lundine opposed although he had voted for the death penalty in the case of a military officer convicted of treason Mr Droleskey like Mr Kavanagh supported capital punishment Differences on Crack Addressing the problem of crack the concentrated smokable form of cocaine Mr Lundine said he agreed with the Governor that there should be greater penalties for crack dealers including a maximum of life in prison for selling three vials of crack But Mr Kavanagh contending that Mr Cuomo and other politicians have postured on the issue said that current laws are adequate The problem has been that the laws are not being enforced Mr Kavanagh said Criticizing plea bargaining in New York City courts to eliminate case backlogs Mr Kavanagh said There is an unholy devotion toward the disposing of cases On the abortion issue Mr Kavanagh and Mr Droleskey said they would support legislation prohibiting Medicaid funding of abortion in New York but Mr Lundine supported the Governors position in favor of Medicaid financing The sides shifted on a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion with only Mr Droleskey in support
SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; JUSTICES TO HEAR APPEAL ON ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-to-hear-appeal-on-abortions.html,The Supreme Court agreed today to decide whether states may require girls under 18 years old who seek abortions either to wait 24 hours after the doctor has notified their parents of their plans or to obtain a judicial exemption from the notification requirement The abortion case is an appeal by the State of Illinois from a Federal appeals court decision striking down a provision of a 1983 state law as an undue burden on minors rights to have abortions While the issue is relatively narrow the Court could use the case to clarify its confusing line of decisions on what kinds of restrictions on the access of minors to abortion may be required to give their parents a chance to consult with them Different state laws impose a wide variety of restrictions many of which have been struck down by lower courts New Debate Likely The case also seems likely to provoke another heated debate among the Justices who split 5 to 4 in June in striking down a Pennsylvania law regulating adult access to abortion And it will provide the first occasion for Antonin Scalia the Courts newest member to vote on an abortion issue as a Justice He suggested publicly in statements before President Reagan made him an appellate judge in 1982 that the Supreme Court had been wrong to hold that the Constitution guaranteed a right to have an abortion But Justice Scalia has not disclosed whether he agrees with the views of Justices William H Rehnquist and Byron R White that the Court should overrule itself and abandon its protection of abortion rights The Illinois law required that a minor dependent child seeking an abortion must wait at least 24 hours after both parents had been notified by the doctor unless the parents waived the waiting period The 24hour wait and the notification requirement could also be bypassed if the minor could persuade a state judge that she was mature enough to make her own decision or that parental notification would not be in her best interests The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit held that the state could require parental notification or judicial approval but that the 24hour waiting period was too burdensome because it might cause much longer delays increased costs and medical risks The Illinois law differs somewhat both from the restrictions on minors abortion rights that the Supreme Court has previously upheld and from those that it has struck down Earlier Court Rulings The Court has ruled that states may not impose 24hour waiting periods on all women including adults who seek abortions and may not require parental consent for all minors seeking abortions But it has upheld requirements that doctors notify parents before performing abortions on immature dependent children under 18 as well as parental consent requirements so long as the minors may bypass these requirements if they can convince a judge that they are mature or that parental involvement would not be in their best interests In its appeal in the pending case Hartigan v Zbaraz No 85673 the state said the 1983 law was designed to protect minors against their own immaturity to foster and preserve the family structure and to protect the rights of parents to rear their children It said a 24hour waiting period was necessary to give parents a chance to consult with their minor daughters The case is an action challenging the constitutionality of the 1983 state law on behalf of all Illinois physicians who perform abortions and dependent children who want abortions A Federal district court ruled the entire notification requirement unconstitutional along with the 24hour waiting period before the law had gone into effect The Seventh Circuit upheld the notification requirement but not the waiting period It also held that the procedures for judicial waiver of the notification requirement were constitutionally inadequate The Supreme Court indicated today that it would not review that aspect of the decision directly In other developments today the Court took these actions Sexual Privacy The Justices refused to hear arguments on whether states may make heterosexual sodomy between consenting adults a crime The case was an appeal by Oklahoma from a state appellate court decision that all private sexual acts between consenting adults of opposite sexes were protected by the constitutional right to privacy Todays action did not create a national precedent But it left intact the lower court decision that an Oklahoma law providing up to 10 years in prison for the crime against nature including oral or anal sex was unconstitutional as applied to heterosexual acts In June when it issued its muchdebated 5to4 decision upholding prosecution for homosexual acts under a Georgia law making all anal and oral sex a crime the Court explicitly declined to say whether the Constitution would protect heterosexuals from prosecution under the same law Todays action indicated that at least for now the Court would rather leave that emotionally charged question unresolved than grapple with it experts said The Oklahoma decision grew out of a prosecution on rape crime against nature and other charges of a man who was said to have forced a woman to commit various sex acts after meeting her in a bar and taking her home The jury acquitted him of rape but convicted him of crime against nature after being told that he could be guilty of that crime even if the woman had consented The jury recommended a long prison term In reversing this conviction the Oklahoma Court of Criminal Appeals ruled that for purposes of his appeal it must assume that the woman consented to all the sex acts It based its decision which predated the Supreme Courts ruling on homosexual sodomy on earlier Supreme Court rulings that recognized a constitutional right of privacy Oklahoma v Post No 852071 Search Without Warrant The Court agreed to decide whether the police may search apartment house garbage bins without a warrant The case was a prosecution appeal of a California appellate courts ruling that without a warrant the police may not comb through garbage bins in apartment buildings for evidence of crime The appellate court following earlier rulings by the California Supreme Court held that such searches violate the privacy rights of people who dump their trash into such garbage bins It barred prosecutors from using papers recording sports wagers that they had recovered from a garbage bin in the underground parking garage of an apartment building in a gambling proscution of a man who lived there California v Rooney No 851835
"SEX: AT CITY SCHOOL CLINICS, IT'S A HEALTH ISSUE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/15/nyregion/sex-at-city-school-clinics-it-s-a-health-issue.html,A 16yearold student visited the health clinic at Martin Luther King Jr High School yesterday morning for a pregnancy test She waited 15 minutes and had her suspicions confirmed she was pregnant The resident nurse practitioner Fran Combe called the girls mother She and her mother had discussed it and they both decided she would have an abortion Ms Combe said I recommended a clinic to her where we have been very pleased with the care In the first month of the school year Ms Combe has conducted three pregnancy tests at the school Two were positive Last year 10 girls  all except one were under 18 years old  visited the clinic and were found to be pregnant Five were recommended to the abortion clinic in Manhattan that Ms Combe mentioned two others were recommended to another abortion clinic three girls aged 16 and 17 gave birth and dropped out of school The clinic at Martin Luther King at 122 Amsterdam Avenue near 66th Street is one of nine statefinanced clinics at New York City high schools The clinics provide general health care such as diagnosis and treatment of illnesses physical exams and dietary advice in addition to birthcontrol counseling Two of the clinics have been dispensing contraceptives although one has ceased the others write prescriptions for contraceptives At its meeting today the Board of Education is to have its first full discussion of the role of the health clinics since the birthcontrol services were revealed in a report to the board two weeks ago A doctor at St LukesRoosevelt Hospital Center Dr Alwyn T Cohall works one day a week at the Martin Luther King clinic and one day a week at the Louis D Brandeis High School clinic at 145 West 84th Street Dr Cohall said it was vital that the clinics provide a full range of health services Many of the students had not seen a doctor since childhood and needed such services as dental examination tests for sicklecell anemia and treatment for asthma Further he said if the clinic provided only birthcontrol counseling students would be more reluctant to visit for fear that they would be stigmatized as sexually active Teenage girls even in 1986 have a tremendous amount of mythology as far as fertility and birth control is concerned said Dr Cohall a 31yearold pediatrician There are still girls who think you cant get pregnant the first time they have sex or that you cant get pregnant having sex standing up or that if you douche with CocaCola right after having sex that you will prevent yourself from getting pregnant Similarly he said young men often expressed reluctance for unfounded reasons to use condoms Its a kind of gamblers philosophy Dr Cohall said of the prevailing attitude among the students about the risk of pregnancies It was not uncommon said Ms Combe who has a masters degree in nursing science from Yale University for girls to visit the clinic either unaware that they were pregnant or denying their condition Two weeks ago she recalled a 16yearold in the ninth grade came down for a headache and a stomach ache She complained that my tummy hurts She did not have a parental consent form Then I noticed she was in the corner quietly crying I put her in the exam room Like all the girls she was wearing a baggy sweat shirt I pulled up her sweater and obviously she was five months pregnant Abortion Ruled Out Ms Combe said that a sonogram taken at Eastern Womens Center the abortion clinic at 14 East 60th Street that she most frequently recommends showed the girl to be seven months pregnant  one month too late for the abortion she said she wanted After informing her mother of the pregnancy the girl decided to have the baby In all pregnancy cases Dr Cohall said the options are put before the student Our recommendation is they tell their parents so they can make an informed decision he said We talk about what life would be like with a child what an abortion would involve adoption In some situations parents are not informed of the students decision to have an abortion if in the judgment of the nurse practitioner the student would be physically abused by the parents Ms Combe said Many Dr Cohall said first visited the clinic with complaints such as head and intestinal pains During the taking of routine personal medical histories questions are asked about sexual activity and birth control is broached We talk about what things dont work and about what things do work Dr Cohall said We talk about abstinence the pill the diaphragm spermicidal agents condoms Abstinence is often not a realistic choice Dr Cohall said But if a girl is just testing the waters with a partner we can work on abstinence One of the things they want to hear is that its OK to say no Prescriptions are written at the Martin Luther King clinic that can be filled free of charge at Roosevelt Hospital four blocks from the school he said So far the school clinic has not distributed contraceptives although he would like it to Dr Cohall said Robert F Wagner Jr the Board of Education president has proposed that the distribution of contraceptives at health clinics be restricted to students 18 years or older I dont see why there should be an arbitrary cutoff at 18 Dr Cohall said There are 15yearolds who are more mature than 18yearsolds and vice versa

"POLAND'S MIXED BLESSING: ITS MANY, MANY BABIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/16/world/poland-s-mixed-blessing-its-many-many-babies.html,The empirical evidence is as clear and strident as an infants howl at midnight Poles are having more children than Government demographers thought they would and more children in relation to population than any country in Europe Schools in cities are often in triple session Nurseries and daycare centers have long waiting lists and in every town and city the numbers of toddlers baby carriages and obviously pregnant women attract attention In a country that lost one out of every six citizens in World War II and that reached its prewar population of 35 million only five years ago such fecundity is often a matter of pride and joy But for demographers and planners at the hub of a centrally planned economy the anomalies and imbalances caused by the Polish pattern of population growth are troublesome By the late 70s we started to see a leveling off in the birth rate and we were all predicting that the same thing was happening that happened in West Germany East Germany Belgium Hungary where the reproductive rate stabilized or even dropped said Waldyslaw Kondrat a demographer at the Institute of Work Then came 1981 and all our predictions proved wrong and the birth rate of some 700000 shot up by some 60000 more than expectations Family Size Going Up Average family size also appears to be inching up from the 23 children per family and today one out of every five people added yearly to the population of Europe not including the Soviet Union is a Pole The reason for this increase is a matter of debate with some sociologists arguing that after the collapse of the Solidarity labor union many people retreated from public life into family life Others say it was simply the extended maternity leave benefits gained during the Solidarity period that encouraged women to space their pregnancies at shorter intervals effectively taking 6to10year leaves from work to give birth and raise two or three children Mr Kondrat said it was not the growth of the population itself that was troublesome as much as the dislocations and imbalances caused by the unanticipated demographic trends For example he said that with the prolonged baby boom the ratio of productive to nonproductive citizens was growing He added that needs for schools clinics nurseries textbooks notepads and crayons were confounding planners who already had to deal with a longstanding housing crisis Food Becoming an Issue Another study by the Polish Academy of Sciences found that a growth in population of 5 to 10 million a level that some demographers say they think could be achieved by the end of the century would necessitate a 40 percent growth in agricultural production But farm productivity has risen only slightly in the last decade and meat is still rationed Meanwhile young people from the farms are continuing to pour into cities with women leaving the rural areas at a faster rate than men This according to Janina Wasilewska a Polish demographer who works at the Academy of Science has created farm pockets where young and middleaged men outnumber women of the same age by 40 to 50 percent Adding to the complexity of Polands demographic picture are the sensitive and ambivalent attitudes toward birth control and abortion in what is both an overwhelmingly Roman Catholic society and a Communist nation Abortion has been legal in Poland since 1956 and sociologists estimate that 200000 to 300000 abortions occur each year One study showed that in Poland there were 230 abortions performed in Government clinics for each 1000 live births a figure that is slightly more than the rate in Sweden and the United States though far less than that of any other Warsaw Pact country where abortion has been the major means of birth control In East Germany for instance the figure was 556 abortions per 1000 live births in Hungary it was 1161 abortions per 1000 births and in the Soviet Union according to international population experts there are 23 times as many abortions as live births Church Staying Silent Despite the devout and widespread devotion to Catholicism in Poland abortion is far less a public issue here than in the United States Occasionally there may be a display condemning abortion in a church or a passing reference to the issue in a sermon But as D Peter Mazur an American demographer wrote in an international bulletin on family planning The Catholic Church apparently does not speak out against the abortion law in part because it believes its followers are fully aware of its position in this regard and in part for political considerations Mr Mazur a professor at Western Washington University in Bellingham wrote his article in International Family Perspectives after spending several months in Warsaw reviewing a 1972 Polish survey of 16000 married women between the ages of 20 and 49 Polish demographers who recommended Mr Mazurs article as the best available analysis said the data on which it was based were nearly 15 years old but added that except for some relatively minor shifts the figures accurately reflected current practices The survey showed that the most common form of birth control was withdrawal which was relied on by 213 percent of the women interviewed The second most favored method was rhythm cited by 213 percent of those surveyed Use of condoms was cited by 10 percent birthcontrol pills by 18 percent and interuterine devices by threetenths of 1 percent Attitude Toward Abortion In the survey the same women were asked about their attitude toward the law that legalizes and subsidizes abortions for women in the first three months of pregnancy Only 15 percent favored the measure as it now stands and a third wanted all abortions made illegal 51 percent favored severly restricting abortions Mr Kondrat said that there were familyplanning groups of volunteers working in the country but that they were ineffective in spreading birthcontrol information He said access to pills and devices was limited A Western diplomat a woman who served two tours here said that from her point of view she found the lack of birthcontrol information available to Polish women a form of real oppression Meanwhile a young Polish woman in her second year of college said she had never heard of any sexeducation courses in high school I think the students are ready for such courses she said but not the teachers
BOARD BARS CONTRACEPTIVES AT CLINICS IN CITY SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/16/nyregion/board-bars-contraceptives-at-clinics-in-city-schools.html,The Board of Education voted yesterday to prohibit the distribution of contraceptives at health clinics in high schools but to allow the clinics at nine schools to continue to operate for six months During that time prescriptions for birthcontrol devices  but not contraceptives themselves  would be dispensed to students who request them The board president Robert F Wagner Jr had sought to have the board approve a plan to distribute contraceptives at all clinics But he did not offer his proposal for a vote because he had the support of only two other members on the sevenmember board Edward L Sadowsky and Richard I Beattie Mr Wagner said he hoped that at the end of the six months he would be able to persuade the board that the distribution of contraceptives was necessary to reduce unwanted pregnancies among teenage students The decision in a 5to2 vote directly affects one high school West Side in Manhattan where contraceptives have been distributed at the health clinic for about two years At another school Boys and Girls High School in Brooklyn the distribution of contraceptives was stopped several weeks ago Objections on Prescriptions Both Mr Wagner and Schools Chancellor Nathan Quinones said they hoped that after the six months clinics would be opened at more schools My hope is we would have contraceptive distribution in all of the schools Mr Wagner said after the vote I believe after a careful review my colleagues can be persuaded that it tends to make youngsters less promiscuous and not more promiscuous The two female board members Drs Gwendolyn C Baker and Irene Impellizzeri said they could not condone the clinics prescribing birthcontrol devices We cannot support the location of clinics in any school that provides abortion counseling and the distribution of contraceptives that may encourage sexual activity and promiscuity among teenagers Dr Impellizzeri said Dr Baker said sexeducation courses should be improved and questioned the role of school clinics as distributors of contraceptives Adoption of Curriculum In barring the distribution of contraceptives the board rejected the opinions of the City Health Commissioner Dr Stephen C Joseph and the director of two of the school clinics Dr Alwyn Cohall Earlier in the meeting the board had unanimously agreed that material from a sexeducation curriculum written by the division of curriculum and instruction would be compulsory in all schools from kindergarten to 12th grade by next fall Mr Quinones said the curriculum which in the high school years deals with birthcontrol methods childbirth and abortion would be used as a base for parental advisory groups at each school The groups in consultation with local officials would submit plans for approval by the Chancellor by next March on teaching about sex In the last two years 21 of the 32 community districts that run the elementary and junior high schools have introduced sex education At high schools the subject is taught depending on the schools choice board officials said Referrals at 7 Schools The sole school where contraceptives had been distributed until yesterday is West Side High School an alternative institution for dropouts and foreign students many of whom are 18 and older At Boys and Girls High School the new principal discontinued the distribution of contraceptives several weeks ago At clinics at the other seven schools prescriptions are written for birthcontrol devices and the students have been referred to the affiliated hospitals or community health centers that run the school clinics The clinics provide an array of general healthcare services They were approved by the board in 1984 At the time board members were not informed that dispensing birthcontrol devices and prescriptions would be among the services At the Board of Education meeting according to its procedures no public comment was permitted five hecklers opposing the role of the schools in sex education were removed by guards After all the board members had given their views it was clear Mr Wagner did not have the votes to approve the distribution of contraceptives Instead he offered a resolution allowing the sixmonth review birthcontrol prescriptions and referrals for filling them Gray Area of Legality Several members asked a panel of lawyers whether it was constitutional to require the students to have parental consent to use the clinics a requirement that has been the practice and will continue to be the practice according to Mr Wagner The counsel to the board Mary Tucker said the question was a gray area She pointed out that under state law teenagers could use publichealth clinics without parental consent And she cited similar Federal case law Mr Sadowsky a lawyer and former City Councilman from Queens said that because of the special place school plays in society he favored requiring parental consents But he stressed Once that child is given consent and walks into the clinic I dont care whether that clinic is in a Board of Education site or at a hospital the doctorpatient relationship pertains and should be the rule of conduct Question of Affordability Mr Beattie a lawyer from Manhattan said parental consent should not be necessary When a teenager comes into a health clinic he said because it is in a high school doesnt mean it should be any different from any other During a long questionandanswer session between Dr Cohall and board members the doctor said that merely writing a prescription is not good enough because many teenagers cant afford the 10 and 15 a month for the pill Having it on site would get around that he said The Manhattan Borough President David N Dinkins issued a statement opposing the views of Dr Baker who is his appointee to the board It seems clear that when distribution of contraceptives is an integral part of a comprehensive education and health program Mr Dinkins said it becomes an effective way to promote more responsible adolescent sexual behavior PLANNED PARENTHOOD CAMPAIGN NEW ORLEANS Oct 15 AP  The Planned Parenthood Federation unveiled a national campaign today to prevent teenage pregnancies by persuading sexually active teensagers to use birth control and by discouraging teenagers from having sex Planned Parenthoods president Faye Wattleton speaking at the groups convention here said the 15 million campaign would to try to build teenagers selfesteem and show them how to be responsible We have to be realistic about our sexuality Ms Wattleton said Its OK for a child to be interested in their sexual development Ms Wattleton said the campaign is designed to debunk myths about sex get lawmakers to push for more sex education and make the public aware of the growing number of teenage pregnancies in the United States The campaign also will focus on teenage boys Often the men have been left out of the debate of teen pregnancy she said The organization is preparing television and radio advertisements which Ms Wattleton said they hoped would appear in November
2 CATHOLIC LEADERS DIFFER ON DISSENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/18/us/2-catholic-leaders-differ-on-dissent.html,Archbishop Roger M Mahony of Los Angeles and the Rev Charles E Curran a theologian who has been censured by the Vatican for his views about sexual issues differed sharply but gently in an unusual public discussion of dissent in the Roman Catholic Church The event Thursday night which drew a capacity audience of 1500 to the University of Southern California here was one of the few times an American archbishop had publicly discussed dissent since the Vatican dismissed Father Curran from his post at the Catholic University of America two months ago While neither man engaged in a formal debate the two exchanged views on a variety of issues the extent and degree to which a theologian may dissent the role of the church as the authority on church doctrine and teachings and the role of Catholic scholars in bringing about change Archbishop Mahony while not entirely ruling out dissent by scholarly theologians argued that the current tensions occurred when theologians began to usurp the teaching role traditionally held by the hierarchy Room for Dissent and Debate Father Curran who agreed with the Archbishop that Roman Catholics must adhere to certain basic principles taught by the hierarchy said that in teachings that were outside the core of the central tenets of Catholicism there was room for dissent and debate He said There will always be some tension in the church precisely because no one in the church  Pope or theologian  has a monopoly on the Holy Spirit Father Curran has maintained in his writings and in his lectures that church teachings on divorce abortion the use of contraceptives and homosexual acts all officially banned or condemned by the church may in limited circumstances be justified Father Curran said he was challenging his dismissal from a tenured post at the Catholic University in Washington DC where he has taught for 20 years Turning to the Courts At a news conference following their discussion Father Curran also said he had engaged the law firm of Cravath Swaine  Moore of New York City to represent him He said that if he lost his case in the academic arena as he suspected he would he would then turn to the courts Archbishop Mahony who presides over the nations largest diocese and is considered a theological conservative told the audience It is misleading and wrong to describe the situation of dissent even legitimate dissent from authentic church teaching as if it were only a matter of diversity or plurality of opinions in the church Church teachings from the hierarchy and the Pope the Archbishop went on to say is not simply one theological opinion alongside others it is rather church doctrine Without referring to Father Curran Archbishop Mahony said at one point that when certain Catholic theologians confidently assert that Popes and bishops are teaching error they appear to put their own judgment above that of the hierarchical magisterium the teaching authority of the church hierarchy  and in so doing inevitably discredit the latter Family and Sexual Issues However Father Curran argued that in the area of noninfallible hierarchical teaching those teachings that fall outside the core teachings considered essential to the Christian faith there was room for discussion and debate Those areas he said include family and sexual issues He said that official Catholic history abounded with instances of erroneous teachings that the church was later forced to revoke often at the prodding of dissenting theologians He cited several instances including a 19thcentury view that slavery was acceptable He outlined how the church had changed its views on the meaning of marital sexuality over time Father Curran also suggested that the magisterium by definition will tend to lag behind the theological enterprise He noted that several influential 20thcentury theologians had all experienced disciplinary action by church authorities Thus he went on history indicates that hierarchical teaching in the past has been erroneous Father Curran said the Sacred Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith dismissed him on the basis of his writings Your writings have accused you he said he was told of the 16 books and numerous articles that he has written over the years He observed with just a hint of a wry smile that there might even be dissent about scholarly writings among bishops
"OPPENHEIMER, STEPHENS PRESS ELECTION BIDS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/nyregion/oppenheimer-stephens-press-election-bids.html,THE race for State Senate in the 36th District centers on the question of whether the incumbent Suzi Oppenheimer a Democrat gets the job done as she says or whether as her Republican opponent Willis H Stephens Jr asserts the salary paid her is a waste of taxpayers money Mrs Oppenheimer 51 years old and a former fourterm Mayor of the village of Mamaroneck is completing her first term in the State Senate in the central Westchester district As Mr Stephens 30 years old and a resident of Port Chester sees it Mrs Oppenheimer has been ineffective for two main reasons she is a Democrat in a State Senate that is controlled by the Republicans and she doesnt have the respect of the Republican leadership Shes basically just occupying a seat Mr Stephens said recently The record is very clear that a lions share of the legislation introduced under her name has not been passed Noting that he is an assistant counsel to Warren M Anderson the majority leader of the State Senate Mr Stephens said Im probably responsible for passing more legislation than she is If elected he said it is very likely that he would be given a committee chairmanship even in his first term Mrs Oppenheimer a former Wall Street securities analyst offered a very different view of her first term in office I have accomplished a great deal but my name isnt on it she said explaining that typically legislators of the minority party find that their proposals are passed only after a member of the majority party is made the lead sponsor For example she said early this year she introduced bills to deal with the states municipal insurance crisis Several of her bills such as one calling for creation of a statewide insurance fund for all municipalities and nonprofit agencies were incorporated into an omnibus bill passed by the Legislature she said On the home front she said she had won approval of a 2 million allocation to install noise barriers on the New England Thruway Also she said My district office is one of the best in the state Weve helped thousands of people Mrs Oppenheimer who is also running on the Liberal line and Mr Stephens who also has the Conservative line are vying in a district made up of parts of Mount Vernon and White Plains all of the cities of New Rochelle and Rye and the towns of Eastchester Harrison Mamoroneck and Rye The candidate of the RighttoLife Party is Humphrey Sarlo The Democrats have about a 6000vote edge in the district but the election could be decided by the independent voters who represent about 39000 of the districts 160000 registered voters Mr Stephens has never run for public office but he said he was hoping to continue a family tradition His father Willis H Stephens Sr represented Putnam County in the State Assembly from 1953 until 1982 as did his grandfatherfather D Mallory Stephens from 1925 until 1952 Im trying to fulfill every sons dream to follow in my fathers footsteps the younger Mr Stephens said Both candidates have been waging their campaigns primarily on the streets of the district Mrs Oppenheimer who won narrowly two years ago said she expected to spend about 100000 for mailings and advertisings Mr Stephens said that he had so far raised about 30000 used primarily on mailings and was hoping to raise additional funds Mr Stephenss mailings which attack Mrs Oppenheimers record have been called pure rubbish by the incumbent She takes issue for example with one brochure that shows a traffic jam and suggests Mrs Oppenheimer is responsible for it because she voted against a bill directing the State Department of Transportation to consider doing its construction work after 8 PM Mrs Oppenheimer insisted that she had voted for this bill which passed the Senate but was not approved by the Assembly Mr Stephens said that Senate records show she voted against it When contacted last week a spokesman in the Journal Clerks office of the State Senate reported that Mrs Oppenheimer voted for the bill when it came to a vote March 4 last year On other issues the two also have differences For example Mrs Oppenheimer voted against the death penalty Mr Stephens said he would vote for it But while he is against abortion Mr Stephens said he would probably vote for continued Medicaid financing of abortions on the premise that poor women should not be deprived of abortions so long as other women may legally obtain them Mrs Oppenheimer is a supporter of Medicaid financing of abortion According to Mr Stephens Mrs Oppenheimer has been too liberal on issues involving crime drugs and public safety For example he said Mrs Oppenheimer voted against bills to increase the penalties for fraudulent check writing and to allow lawenforcement agencies to check pharmaceutical records Her liberal positions show in many of her votes he said Mrs Oppenheimer described her political philosophy this way I maintain a very independent record I tend to be more conservative and am voting pretty Republican on all the insurance and Government fiscal issues and on many crime issues However I vote Democrat on the human issues Mr Stephens said of his own political philosophy I am not a staunch conservative Im a fiscal conservative more than an ideological one
WEARY LAWMAKERS PUT FINAL TOUCHES ON HECTIC SESSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/us/weary-lawmakers-put-final-touches-on-hectic-session.html,An exhausted 99th Congress completed its business and adjourned tonight and the lawmakers eagerly headed home for a final stretch of campaigning before the November elections In reviewing the last two years Congressional leaders maintained that they had written a solid record of legislative achievement highlighted by major revisions of the nations tax regulations immigration laws and budget procedures However the leaders conceded it was also a Congressional session that had missed most of its deadlines lapsed frequently into partisan fighting and sometimes approached paralysis before ending at 934 PM As a result the lawmakers failed to make a significant impact on reducing the huge Federal budget deficit which will be the principal issue facing the 100th Congress when it convenes in January Tough and Productive Representative Dan Rostenkowski the Illinois Democrat who heads the House Ways and Means Committee offered this epitaph for the 99th Congress Its been tough but its been productive The Senate majority leader Bob Dole said today We leave behind a record of unusual accomplishment However he added the narrow sixvote margin held by Senate Republicans plus the intense political maneuvering for control of the next Senate had limited his flexibility It hasnt been easy the Republican leader from Kansas admitted As they ended their work many lawmakers expressed frustration at the way Congress had spent so much of the last two years thwarted by a combination of inefficient procedures and independent lawmakers determined to use those procedures for maximum leverage on the legislative process Capitol Hill is a place these days where every faction seems to think time is on its side and as Representative Leon E Panetta a California Democrat noted the 99th Congress scored most of its points in overtime the final two weeks after the original adjournment target of Oct 3 Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican leader expressed a widely held view when he said The flow of legislation must be substantially improved if we are to avoid these endofsession nightmares we create for ourselves The manner in which we conclude our sessions is a national embarrassment A New Mentality Legislators of both parties agreed that the biggest item of unfinished business is the budget deficit which could reach 150 billion to 170 billion in the current fiscal year Last year Congress adopted a law committing itself to reducing that deficit to 108 billion next year and to zero by 1991 and that law has clearly altered the spending mentality on Capitol Hill In recent debates over drug legislation and aid to the Philippines for instance lawmakers frequently asked the questions What will it cost and How will we pay for it Spending for the military as well as for social welfare programs was practically frozen by this Congress and Senator Phil Gramm a Texas Republican who was the chief author of the budgetbalancing law told the Senate Friday night We turned the corner we changed direction But there is also a broad belief among members of Congress that they have not begun to deal with the fundamental problems underlying the deficit Next year is going to be the test said Representative Dick Cheney of Wyoming the thirdranking Republican in the House leadership This year we just played around with it The real crunch is getting to 108 billion To many analysts Congresss failure to make substantial inroads on the deficit reflects some basic facts of political life The two chambers remained in separate hands for the third straight Congress the first time in 100 years that power has been so fragmented on Capitol Hill Moreover analysts agree the fact that President Reagan has no plans to run for office again places him on a different political wavelength from legislators in both parties who have to face the voters Theres a much different climate when all elements of the Government are in the hands of one party said Representative Thomas S Foley of Washington the Democratic whip This is a most unusual situation Many Democrats and some Republicans say that the biggest obstacle blocking a serious assault on the budget deficit is Mr Reagans adamant refusal to consider a tax increase The White House says that Congress is not prepared to trim popular domestic programs particularly benefit programs that increase automatically every year The resulting deadlock has left many lawmakers sputtering with dismay Senator Pete V Domenici the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee told his colleagues Friday night I think the real question is how do we get the deficit to zero in four or five years These are the stark facts staring us square in the face Checks and Balances The dispersal of power in the capital many lawmakers noted means that each camp has a greater ability to block legislation than to enact it into law Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the Democratic leader said the 99th Congress will be remembered as a Congress that made the system of checks and balances work For instance he said Congressional Democrats were able to alter the Presidents illconceived policies by such measures as economic sanctions against South Africa But the same tactics praised by Mr Byrd were denounced by Mr Michel the Republican leader who said Neutralizing the power and popularity of President Reagan has seemed almost like an obsession among the House Democratic leadership It has not been a healthy atmosphere In this atmosphere many proposals did not make it through the legislative maze The House passed legislation to require the Administration to take a tougher stance against its trading partners but the measure died in the Senate A bill rolling back textile imports from a dozen countries passed both houses but Congress then failed to override the Presidents veto The House also approved legislation that would require the President to abide by the strategic arms limitation treaty and to stop most nuclear testing for a year Both provisions were dropped under pressure from the President on the eve of his meeting with Mikhail S Gorbachev the Soviet leader in Iceland Liberal Democrats failed to reverse a Supreme Court decision that severely limits the application of antidiscrimination laws to colleges and other recipients of Federal funds But conservative Republicans were equally thwarted in their attempts to legalize officially sanctioned prayer in the public schools and to limit a womans right to have an abortion Revamping of Tax System The most successful legislation had enough political appeal to attract bipartisan backing from both parties The huge taxoverhaul bill which stands out to most members as the highlight of the session was able to survive because neither party wanted to be held responsible for killing it The Presidents signature has been delayed to await action on corrections to the original bill but Mr Reagan is expected to sign it shortly Similarly the national concern about drug abuse that inundated Congress last summer helped produce a bill in record time that allots 17 billion for enforcement and education efforts The immigration bill which seemed dead several times would permit the legalization of millions of aliens while barring employers from hiring workers who are in this country illegally This measure too had bipartisan backing and finally passed when Hispanic lawmakers softened their opposition In some cases Congressional sentiment was so strong that it was able to overcome resistance in the White House For example Mr Reagan fought bitterly against imposing what he called punitive sanctions against South Africa but Republicans and Democrats alike said he was out of step with the mood of the voters and Congress Lawmakers overrode Mr Reagans veto inflicting his most embarrassing defeat on a foreign policy issue Mr Reagan also proposed a vast increase in Pentagon spending but Congress approved about 290 billion barely more than it allotted last year Here again Congressional leaders said Mr Reagan was not in tune with the budget priorities of most Americans who had been subjected to a steady barrage of reports about waste and inefficiency in the Pentagon In Senator Byrds view the decision to hold down military spending injected a healthy dose of reality into the budget blueprint On a number of environmental issues Congress took the lead in passing bills that the Reagan Administration did not favor In particular it pushed through a 93 billion fiveyear program to clean up serious toxic waste dumps Mr Reagan threatened to veto the bill because he did not like the new taxes that would be imposed to finance the cleanup But a fervent plea by Mr Dole and other Republicans who thought a veto would be politically disastrous helped persuade Mr Reagan to sign the measure The nature of compromise in a divided Congress was highlighted by approval of hundreds of new water projects such as harbor dredging and flood control The bill was strongly backed by many lawmakers whose regions would receive Federal funds but the White House insisted that any measure include a requirement that local communities pay part of the cost Apart from revision of the tax code Mr Reagans top domestic priority the White House advanced a meager legislative program But the President did succeed after years of frustration in pressuring Congress to allocate 100 million to the rebels battling the Marxist Government of Nicaragua 2 Views of Aid Package Representative Cheney hailed the vote as a big victory But Thomas P ONeill Jr who is retiring as House Speaker after 10 years said his failure to block the package was the biggest disappointment of the year For all the problems experienced by the 99th Congress for all the divided powers and cross pressures the lawmakers usually found a consensus that reflected the views of their constituents In a statement today Mr Dole admitted that not every policy dilemma was resolved and some of our answers are less than complete THE 99TH CONGRESS ITS 1986 RECORD Following are the major actions of the 99th Congress second session THE COURTS President Reagans nominations for the Supreme Court passed Senate muster William H Rehnquist was confirmed on a 65to33 vote after a somewhat bitter committee debate to replace Warren E Burger as Chief Justice Antonin Scalia was confirmed unanimously to be Associate Justice Vice President Bush cast the tiebreaking vote for Daniel A Manions nomination to the Federal appellate bench And for the first time in 50 years the Senate removed a Federal judge convicting Harry E Claiborne imprisoned for tax evasion on three impeachment counts voted by the House INCOME TAX After long behindthescenes negotiations over the most comprehensive changes in the Federal income tax system since World War II Congress passed the Tax Reform Act of 1986 consolidating 15 tax brackets into two and eliminating many tax breaks Sixty percent of Americans are expected to pay lower taxes 25 percent the same and 15 percent more SOUTH AFRICA In a major rebuff to the Presidents foreign policy Congress overrode his veto of economic sanctions against South Africa Among other things the legislation bans all new investment by Americans in South African businesses and prohibits key imports from South Africa THE ENVIRONMENT Congress expanded the national program to clean up toxic waste sites The 9 billion fiveyear program with five times more money than previously authorized will be financed largely by new taxes including one on corporate earnings Congress also approved although a veto is possible legislation to strengthen the Clean Water Act and provide money for building sewage treatment plants WATER PROJECTS The first major legislation to finance water projects in 15 years was approved and beneficiaries are to help pay for them The 163 billion program includes many projects for the New York metropolitan area such as dredging New York Harbor GUN CONTROL Federal laws on gun control were softened in legislation making it easier to buy sell and transport firearms across state lines IMMIGRATION To curtail the influx of illegal aliens Congress approved the most sweeping changes in immigration law in at least two decades The legislation would prohibit the hiring of illegal aliens and would offer legal status to those who have lived here continuously since before Jan 1 1982 DRUGS Responding to the emotional issue of illegal drug use Congress substantially increased penalties for Federal drug crimes and provided 17 billion for enforcement education and treatment programs THE MILITARY The most sweeping reorganization of the military command structure in a generation was approved The reorganization strengthens the role of the Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff making him the Presidents principal military adviser and gives new authority to field commanders Congress approved 35 billion for the Strategic Defense Initiative the President had asked 534 billion for the antimissile plan The Pentagon budget was set at 290 billion for the smallest increase of the Reagan Administration THE DEFICIT Congress met the deficit ceiling set by the budgetbalancing law with a package of accounting maneuvers and sales of Federal assets including Conrail CONVENTION AGAINST GENOCIDE Thirtyseven years after it was first submitted by President Truman Congress approved a United Nations convention declaring genocide an international crime and obliging the nations that adhere to the convention to punish those who commit genocide EMBASSY SECURITY Security at oversees embassies was bolstered with legislation authorizing 24 billion over the next five years CONTRA AID Congress authorized 100 million in aid to the rebels in Nicaragua supporting one key aspect of the Presidents foreign policy Congress allowed for 70 million in military aid and 30 million in humanitarian aid to be released in three installments if the President determined that negotiations could not solving that countrys civil war A fivemember commission would have to certify his assessment for the aid to be released NATIONAL FLOWER Congress declared the rose to be the national floral emblem
German Doctors and the Nazi Mentality,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/magazine/l-german-doctors-and-the-nazi-mentality-429886.html,Professor Liftons article without directly raising the issue provides a powerful brief for todays Right to Life movement It clarifies the statement made by a German official explaining why the Federal Republic has no abortionondemand law We have been down that road before That road went from enforced sterilization to abortion to infanticide of the unfit to generalized killing of the unfit to genocide We bypassed the first step because feminists have enough political power to protect women But abortion on demand is now a solidly established and courtprotected right and infanticide of the unfit is rapidly attaining the same status in American society Influential voices are already calling for further steps along that road WILLIAM L SANTRY Woodbury NJ

ABZUG VS. DIOGUARDI: A BATTLE FOR THE CENTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/nyregion/abzug-vs-dioguardi-a-battle-for-the-center.html,With two weeks to go before Election Day Representative Joseph J DioGuardi a freshman Republican from Westchester and his challenger former Representative Bella S Abzug are locked in a spirited battle for the political middle ground The DioGuardi campaign which until now has been forced to issue news releases with the candidate still in Washington has sought to portray his opponent as an outoftouch liberal seeking to disguise her past Ms Abzugs general theme has been that Mr DioGuardi is too conservative for the district which was represented for 16 years by Richard L Ottinger a liberal Democrat While both candidates struggle for the center  and for the substantial uncommitted vote in the 20th Congressional District where there are 94000 registered Democrats 90000 Republicans and 65500 unaffiliated voters the harshest exchanges so far have had little to do with the broad issues For example Mr DioGuardi said at a fundraising event in White Plains a few weeks ago that Ms Abzug tried to legalize marijuana in 1974 when she served in the House of Representatives That might have been in step with Greenwich Village he said in a reminder of Ms Abzugs Manhattan background but we in Westchester find it reprehensible He was referring to a proposed amendment to the Controlled Substances Act which would have decriminalized possession of three ounces of marijuana It never went anywhere Ms Abzug said explaining that lots of kids were being picked up and sent to jail for smoking a joint and we were saying the police should be going after the drug trade She said Mr DioGuardi meanwhile supported President Reagan in cutting funds for drugcontrol programs He denied that saying he voted for the Omnibus Drug Act which includes 114 million for the Drug Enforcement Administration and asserted that she sought to oppose creation of the DEA Ms Abzugs reply was that she voted for appropriations for the agency Ms Abzug for her part rebuked Mr DioGuardi for his membership in the Winged Foot Golf Club in Mamaroneck saying Im told it does not accept blacks or Jews and I think thats shocking The club would not comment on its selection process but Mr DioGuardi said that as a 15year member he had never witnessed such discrimination He said he would consider resigning if such bias existed Mr DioGuardi said that in 1971 Ms Abzug voted against a welfare reform bill that would have increased Social Security benefits demonstrating that she says one thing but in the past did another Ms Abzug was recorded as saying at the time however that under the guise of being a reform measure the bill will leave many recipients of public assistance perhaps 90 percent worse off than they are under the present system In recent days Ms Abzug has accused Mr DioGuardi of repeatedly voting against legislation that would benefit children by supporting the Higher Education Act which kept aid at 1985 levels while opposing an amendment to the school lunch program legislation that would have maintained costofliving increases Mr DioGuardis staff discounted the criticism saying that the Congressman was voting for spending freezes in both cases Kieran Mahoney Mr DioGuardis campaign manager said the Congressman had sponsored legislation making it easier to prosecute child sexual abusers and that Mr DioGuardi was a prime mover in a youth suicide prevention program The candidates take opposite views on many issues Mr DioGuardi favors the GrammRudmanHollings fiscal reform act the Star Wars proposal and military aid to the contra forces in Nicaragua while Ms Abzug opposes them Ms Abzug supports Federal financing of abortion and the Equal Rights Amendment while Mr DioGuardi opposes both He supports the use of New York harbor as a port for the Navys nuclear warships which Ms Abzug opposes Ms Abzug would like to see the Indian Point nuclear power plant closed he favors its continued use
A FORMER CONVENT TO HOUSE PREGNANT TEEN-AGERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/nyregion/a-former-convent-to-house-pregnant-teen-agers.html,MELISSA DOLPH is 18 years old nine months pregnant and homeless Her mother is dead she does not know where her father is and the father of her unborn baby is in jail Her foster parents she said do not want her anymore For now she is staying at St Agnes Home Inc in West Hartford which up to last year was the only shelter for pregnant teenagers in the state This teaches me responsibility and to be able to interact with different people she said If Ms Dolph had lived in another part of the state she may not have been so lucky She may have ended up on the street or in a rundown boarding house as others in her situation sometimes do Until last year when a shelter in Bridgeport opened St Agnes a 15bed facility was the only one in the state In response to the growing need for shelters for pregnant teenagers a new one is to open next year in New Haven The shelter Life Haven will attempt to do more than simply provide housing for homeless pregnant young women and their newborn babies Coordinators of the project say they will try to give hope and guidance to carry these teenaged mothers through life We dont see ourselves as the overall solution to a very complex problem said Mary Ellen Pascale director of Life Haven But we feel we can make an impact in preventing second pregnancies and we will help these girls to stay in school or get job training and raise their selfesteem Their lack of selfesteem Ms Pascale said began long before they became pregnant The chief of maternal and child health for the State Department of Health Dr Vijaya Bapap noted that when teenagers feelisolated and do not receive affection from their parents they tend to get into antisocial behavior This results in truancy drug abuse and pregnancy To top all that society the media promotes sex as the cool thing to do You cant watch a half hour of television without seeing champagne in one hand and the girl in the other So when teenagers are exposed to this and feel no purpose to life they get into trouble she said Dr Bapap said the teenage pregnancy problem was not new but unlike years ago when the family and community helped more many of todays teenagers have little or no such support Many times they are thrown out of the house or have no home to begin with she said Cornell Scott the director of Hill Health Center in New Haven who worked with Ms Pascale on the project said many of the efforts being made on behalf of homeless teenage mothers were merely BandAids We need to have some kind of prevention for those at risk he said suggesting decent housing education job opportunities and encouraging family support Its obvious when young women have nothing to look forward to they are more apt to get pregnant he said According to the State Department of Health between 1982 and 1984 the lastest year for which such statistics are available there were 12384 births by teenagers in the state and probably twice that many pregnancies since roughly half of them end in abortion Ms Pascale said that about half the number of teenagers who gave birth in that time period were either homeless or in need of alternative living arrangements because of abuse or inadequate housing During that same period there were 15 shelter beds  all at St Agnes  available Last year Mary Glen in Bridgeport opened with three beds and Life Haven which is to open next spring will provide shelter to at least 25 pregnant and postpartum teenagers The new shelters for pregnant teenagers Ms Pascale said are in response to a growing need that communities are now beginning to recognize as requiring priority financing Were responding to this need not creating it she said And if we dont respond and become part of the solution society will suffer Part of the reason for the current acute need for shelters for pregnant teenagers Ms Pascale said is the decline of the socalled host homes of the past Private families would take in an individual teenager for the duration of her pregnancy providing her with shelter and support But with the rise of the twoincome family fewer homes are offering to take in teenagers She said homes for unwed mothers  there were few in the state to begin with  fell victim to the changing trends among teenagers most of whom now keep their babies as opposed to giving them up for adoption Life Haven which has no religious affiliation is in the Fair Haven section of New Haven  a mix of bluecollar and blighted neighborhoods Housed in a 60yearold former convent that belongs to the adjacent St Francis Roman Catholic Church the large redbrick structure is now being brought up to meet fire and housing codes as well as undergoing some renovation Situated on a residential street the building is bordered by a thick row of bushes in the front and an old black wroughtiron gate on one side with a parochial school connected to the church on the other Large Gothic stainedglass windows and an impressive domeshaped entrance to the front door with a stone statue of the Virgin Mary standing on the peak lend evidence that this building was once a convent Inside with its green walls high ceilings and heavy oak doors and windowsills the threestory 25bedroom building is eerily quiet An infant car seat and baby clothes in the foyer are the only signs that next year dozens of pregnant teenagers and new teenager mothers will fill its hallways and rooms The chapel hidden behind stainedglass double doors will serve as a daycare center Catherine McMurty a volunteer who is setting up diets and working on health and home maintenance issues works in one of the rooms surrounded by scores of books on Catholicism that the nuns have yet to be removed Ms Pascale a petite energetic 32yearold mother of a 13yearold said she was leasing the building from the St Francis Parish Corp for 1000 a month She chose the building because of its accessibility to hospitals clinics and public transportation It was used up until last year by the Sisters of Mercy who were looking for other living arrangements Startup costs have exceeded 300000 so far and Ms Pascale expects the operating costs  staff salaries food utilities  to be at least 250000 a year The staff will include herself a fulltime social worker secretary and six grouphome care workers to provide 24hour supervision Financing has come from the State Department of Health the Episcopal Deanery the Archbishops Annual Appeal the Carolyn Foundation  a Minneapolisbased organization and the New Haven Foundation She said most of the operating costs would be covered by thirdparty reimbursements from the state notably the Department of Children and Youth Services She said the young women living in the facility would not be expected to pay anything and any homeless pregnant teenager or teenager with a newborn would be eligible Most she said will be referred by schools state or private agencies Unlike the shelter in West Hartford where high school and business education courses are offered on the premises Ms Pascale said Life Haven would refer the young women to other community agencies for those services In return the residents will be responsible for keeping doctors appointments and for cleaning cooking and caring for their own children Ms Pascale predicted that the average length of stay would be three to five months but said she would consider each teenagers individual needs Ms Pascale worked in a Jewish home for the elderly and in 1979 served on a state commission to study the needs for shelters for pregnant and postpartum teenagers She said the findings overwhelmingly concluded that shelters were desperately needed She said she would help teenagers who wanted to place their babies with adoption centers but was not working with any center on a regular basis She also indicated that the women who would come to Life Haven were from varied backgrounds Well have kids from the suburbs and the inner cities and all kinds of IQs she said Ms Pascale said she was trying to take the concerns of starting the shelter in stride She met with Mother Theresa in New York recently and said she left with more confidence in her project Mother Theresa said to me People will see what youre doing and the money will come dont worry

LOSERS IN A ZERO-SUM GAME,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/books/losers-in-a-zerosum-game.html,WHY ERA FAILED Politics Womens Rights and the Amending Process of the Constitution By Mary Frances Berry 147 pp Bloomington Indiana University Press 1795 WHY WE LOST THE ERA By Jane J Mansbridge 327 pp Illinois University of Chicago Press Cloth 35 Paper 995  FOR many feminists one of the most compelling events of recent years was that historic moment when Geraldine Ferraro was nominated for Vice President of the United States But if her nomination represented a feminist dream come true the dark night had come a year earlier when the time limit on the equal rights amendment expired leaving the ERA as one of a tiny number of constitutional amendments passed by Congress but failing in the states In different ways these two books try to explore what went wrong Mary Frances Berry professor of history and law at Howard University and a member of the United States Commission on Civil Rights looks at the question from her vantage point as a historian and a lawyer By using the lessons of several controversial amendments  among them the income tax Prohibition and woman suffrage  Ms Berry seeks to draw some general conclusions about the fate of the ERA The analysis leads her to conclude that controversial amendments get passed only when two conditions prevail simultaneously First proponents must show that a constitutional amendment and only a constitutional amendment can remedy some serious social wrong and second there must already exist a broadbased and regionally diverse consensus in the states that such an amendment is desirable Even then social change is arduous all of these controversial amendments took over half a century to pass If Ms Berry gives us the long historical view of how the ERA failed Jane Mansbridge associate professor of political science and sociology at Northwestern University tells us the inside story Using a rich range of sources she shows us who the ERA advocates were who their opponents were how the two sides were recruited and the nature of the dialogue between these two groups and members of state legislatures In what will probably become the most controversial aspect of the book Ms Mansbridge concludes that at least some of the political outcomes of the fight over the amendment were byproducts of the organizational structure of the proERA movement itself In brief she argues that in the period between 1972 and 1982 the Supreme Court found unconstitutional the most blatant forms of formal sex discrimination thus making the ERA an amendment with largely symbolic rather than substantive effects Further she notes that because proERA groups were voluntary organizations whose members belonged because they cared passionContinued on page 9 ately about womens rights such organizations were illprepared to make any symbolic concessions in order to pass the amendment especially when few substantive gains could be expected in return As her most intriguing case in point Ms Mansbridge focuses on the debate over the draft by showing that its proponents took it for granted that the ERA would require the drafting of women for combat She argues convincingly that an alternative interpretation was always possible an interpretation she calls the deferential one In this interpretation ERA advocates could have argued that the question of women in combat was irrelevant because the war powers clause of the Constitution would take precedence over an equal rights amendment just as the courts have held that it takes precedence over the First Amendment Those on active duty in the military for example do not have the rights of free speech guaranteed to ordinary citizens ERA supporters could therefore have finessed the question of women in combat by arguing that the war powers clause left it up to Congress to decide womens roles in the event of national emergencies For those who care about womens rights the critical question is the one central to both books if ERA supporters had done something different would the amendment be part of the Constitution today In effect both Ms Berry and Ms Mansbridge think the answer is at least a qualified yes Ms Berry thinks that ERA supporters should have built a statebystate coalition before the amendment reached Congress and should have been more active in educating opponents and legislators out of their irrational fears Ms Mansbridge on the other hand is concerned that organizational dynamics blinded proponents to alternative resolutions of some critical issues she explores the possibility that different stances on these issues might have swayed key legislators in key states But is this true And if it is true would it have been worth it The history of America is dotted with zerosum conflicts between competing groups where any gain real or symbolic is matched by a corresponding loss on the other side Almost all the controversial amendments Ms Berry cites as examples reflect such conflicts between slave labor constituencies and wage labor constituencies the Civil War amendments between nativeborn Protestants and immigrant Roman Catholics Prohibition and between traditional forms of property and new industrial property income tax THE debate over the ERA represents another such zerosum conflict between women who are positioned to take advantage of a genderneutral world and those whose status is enhanced by the preservation of traditional sex roles If this truly is a zerosum conflict the kinds of alternative strategies Ms Berry and Ms Mansbridge suggest may be impossible or irrelevant ProERA activists might have had a hollow victory for example had they chosen the deferential model of women in combat that Ms Mansbridge suggests If as she argues the amendment was more symbolic than substantive by 1982 a deferential ERA would have merely duplicated protections that the Supreme Court had already created but left unchallenged the idea that men and women could legitimately have different treatment based on sex alone This could have proved a fatal flaw incapable of protecting women in periods of conservative retrenchment And antiERA activists as Why We Lost the ERA demonstrates were irrational only in blaming the ERA for social changes already well under way long before the amendment passed Congress Beautifully documented in this book for instance is the flight of higherstatus women from the role of housewife and the consequent decline of that status to the new one of just a housewife Yet antiERA activists were not mistaken in assuming that the symbolic impact of the amendment would be to accelerate precisely these forces and in the fundamentalist churches and the new conservative movement they found traditional political organizations mostly male more than willing to respond to their concerns Education of these women and their legislative supporters therefore is quixotic at best Both these excellent books have important lessons to teach They demonstrate the truth of the political theorist Susan Moller Okins observation in Women in Western Political Thought that there is a fundamental political tension between womens family roles and the rights of citizenship and that opposition to equal rights will be fierce when such rights come up against these traditional roles Moreover they suggest that the new battles feminists face today in trying to reduce this tension between citizenship and parenthood  comparable work day care parental leaves an accessible range of reproductive choices increased spousal and child support  will be opposed not only by those with symbolic objections but by new groups as well who will be asked to pay for these programs As feminists prepare for these struggles all of us would do well to ponder the lessons that may be drawn from these two illuminating studies With an everincreasing number of women in the paid labor force and with young women who take for granted they can have it all  the question of womens rights is destined to remain at the heart of American politics
THE UNIVERSITY AS A METAPHOR FOR BRITISH LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/19/arts/the-university-as-a-metaphor-for-british-life.html,The old image of Cambridge was of golden boys fresh from their Homer or Virgil spending mellow afternoons indolently punting past ocher cloisters to serene picnics somewhere far up river Stands the church clock at 10 to 3 the poet Rupert Brooke famously rhapsodized in an ecstasy of nostalgia for the university and its rural trimmings and is there honey still for tea But in recent years novels stage plays and television dramas have combined to present a harsher picture Cambridge in this revisionist view is a blend of dream factory and success mill filling the heads of its undergraduates with standards that they then proceed to compromise and expectations that they inevitably fail to fulfill As a more jaundiced Brooke might put it today stands the clock at 10 to 4 and is their liquor still to pour The most recent example of this iconoclasm  the latest attempt maybe to use the university as a metaphor for the hopes and failures of the English intelligentsia  is Simon Grays Common Pursuit which opens at the Promenade Theater tonight The play begins and ironically closes with a group of undergraduates setting up a literary magazine at some unnamed Cambridge college in the early 1960s In between we witness the moral emotional and spiritual ravages inflicted by the next two decades on the editor his associates and the journal itself which theyve boldly shifted to London Just about everything ends up being betrayed from principles to friendships from literary seriousness to marriage Simon Gray himself went up in the university jargon to Cambridge in 1956 and didnt go down until hed spent eight years there first as an undergraduate reading English and then as a postgraduate student failing to complete several projected theses That meant he arrived slightly later than the generation whose apotheosis and decline Frederic Raphael described in his novel and television serial The Glittering Prizes but it allowed him to overlap with many who went on to make their names in the media and the arts If Peter Hall Thom Gunn Andrew Sinclair Ted Hughes Jonathan Miller and Mr Raphael himself preceded him he was at Cambridge when Margaret Drabble was winning a reputation for academic brilliance Michael Frayn was writing a witty column in the university newspaper Trevor Nunn was directing plays at the Amateur Dramatic Society or ADC Derek Jacobi and Ian McKellen were establishing themselves as the actors and David Frost was editing the student literary magazine Granta Mr Gray was still there when Mr Frost became host of a fashionably irreverent BBC program called That Was the Week That Was and there when Mr Frosts contemporary Peter Cook left to start a fashionably irreverent nightclub in Soho The satire boom of the early 60s and indeed Londons international image as the eras swinging city owed much to Cambridge and especially to its revue club the Footlights Mr Frost Mr Cook Mr Miller all belonged So did John Cleese Graham Chapman Eric Idle and many others who became well known as comedians in the 60s and 70s Cambridge it seemed led directly to London acceptance and applause with nary a pause for drama school or other vocational study To be active as an undergraduate in extracurricular theater extracurricular journalism or extracurricular anything else was virtually to be professional already When Eric Idle then Footlights president was asked by a visiting American if he hoped to be an actor after Cambridge his reply was curt and indignant I am an actor The wonder is that most of them also managed to scrape their way to a BA in anthropology SerboCroatian or whatever they were officially at Cambridge to study Simon Gray wasnt a great undergraduate careerist He coedited a magazine called Delta in which he published some of his own early fiction and launched a memorable attack on the universitys exam system getting himself denounced as a psychopathic hoodlum by the establishment Cambridge Review for his impertinence But by his own admission he spent most of his time sleeping drinking playing poker seeing movies and cultivating a reputation for sophistication In the essay he contributed in the late 70s to a book called My Cambridge  the narcissistic title of the collection seems significant  he conducted a cutting postmortem on his student life accusing himself in retrospect of slickness intellectual pretension arrogance and laziness Indeed the only lectures and seminars he attended were those offered by the only local figure he admired F R Leavis the most formidable of the universitys English dons and the author of a volume of criticism called The Common Pursuit the same title Mr Gray has wryly borrowed for his play Dr Leavis with his implacable integrity and ferocious contempt for even the slightly secondrate was a major influence on many Cambridge students in the 50s and 60s For Thom Gunn his passion his discrimination his commitment to literature as neither pastime nor occasion for scholarship helped teach me to write better than any creative writing class For Peter Hall director of the National Theater his death in 1978 was a terrible shock His lectures were the inspiration of my Cambridge years the director wrote in his recently published diaries he somehow inculcated a feeling that art was to do with better standards of life and better behavior Indeed Mr Hall went so far as to attribute to Dr Leavis all the seriousness at the basis of his own theatrical work and that of Trevor Nunn the director of the Royal Shakespeare Company Nevertheless high standards are intimidating and hard to sustain in the world beyond the university Reviewing a book about Dr Leavis in 1984 Mr Gray paid a passionate tribute to his genius as a teacher and declared him the only great man I have met But the new Common Pursuit shows the difficulty maybe the impossibility of keeping alight the cultural torch lit by the old Common Pursuit At one point the editors wife actually sacrifices a muchwanted child to his impoverished journal having an abortion so he can afford to bring out something that has already started publishing pop poems he despises And before long the magazine has collapsed The editor has turned his professional attention to junk books and the most severe of his Leavisite contributors is dead It is the familiar Cambridge story infinite promise inevitable disillusion excellence as a beguiling chimera that ends by tormenting those who fail to meet its demands But excellence was not always so rigorously defined at Cambridge For some it simply meant proving oneself the cream by rising to the top and staying there Thats the aspiration of most of the characters in The Glittering Prizes if not always their achievement The undergraduate director of an acclaimed student production of Much Ado About Nothing goes on to win an Oscar nomination for a movie hes made then deteriorates into just another wealthy exploitative Hollywood hack The young man who played Claudio becomes a smart shallow mean television interviewer The brilliant girl who was Beatrice also joins the BBC only to be dismissed for alcoholism The productions Benedick is played by an undergraduate not unlike the late Tony White a reallife student who reputedly brought star quality to role after role at the ADC in the 50s joined the Old Vic Company in London then abandoned both stage and glitz becoming a plumber housepainter and oddjob man before dying at age 45 Everywhere in The Glittering Prizes the cream is turning sour or revealing itself as scum or simply evaporating In The Common Pursuit there are parallel portraits notably an outrageously pushy student who end up incompetently fronting a BBC books program and coveting the job of the Sunday Times theater critic But of course Cambridge did foster genuine achievement as well as opportunism Mr Gray himself is proof of that accomplished dramatist as he is So is Mr Raphael and so is Michael Frayn who arrived at Cambridge from the London suburbs in 1954 and was instantly and lastingly seduced by the excitement of the place I liked its sheer exclusiveness he said in a recent interview the feeling of being somewhere hard to get into full of the sort of people Id never met before people with a certain style sense of irony and panache It was a miniature world where there was all the pain and possibility and ambition of the macroworld yet things were somehow small intense and graspable I once met a very grand figure in the advertising business whod done some acting as a student there and he said One is never so famous afterward as one was at Cambridge  Leaving Cambridge Mr Frayn added was like being ripped from the womb yet theres a sense in which he carried the place away with him It is a living presence or powerful memory in work after work that hes published since And his affectionate reminiscence is sometimes combined with a certain cynicism In his play Donkeys Years a government minister a senior civil servant and other middleaged graduates return to Cambridge for a reunion only to revert emotionally to the spoiled students they once were In his novel Sweet Dreams the main character is killed in a car accident and finds himself in a heaven where his afterlife consists mainly of having chic dinner parties with his old college chums and fulfilling one megalomaniac fantasy after another Eventually he becomes chief sidekick to God  who turns out to be the most gifted most fashionable undergraduate of his Cambridge generation Mr Frayns satire is not of course altogether original Cambridge people have often been accused of being selfseeking gogetting obsessive in pursuit of their worldly aims Thats a view of them widely held at Oxford whose typical students Cambridge tends to regard as effete dandified and perhaps rudest of all amateurish Again its a truism in the outside world that Cambridge graduates remain clubbable to the point of being incestuous still going to each others parties still doing one another favors still reviewing each others work as they reviewed it at the university itself But the fundamental point of Sweet Dreams perhaps is that just three years as an undergraduate at Cambridge can stamp one deep and for life  it is an experience of such intensity that it colors whatever happens to one afterward Thats the case even with some of those who have criticized and attacked Cambridge Why else would David Hare who hated being at the university in the later 60s have set his best play Teeth n Smiles at an undergraduate ball  and ended it with part of the college being burned down Why else would Mr Gray admit in My Cambridge to feeling violently sick in the stomach and remembering something continuously undiagnosably unpleasant at the university on the few occasions hes returned since being there Why has he felt impelled to write The Common Pursuit now His play seems a testimony to the magnetic force of the world he rejects
COLUMN ONE; POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/us/column-one-politics.html,Back BurnerHow much does Governor Cuomo think you should pay in state taxes over the next four years How much in rent The answer is that he hasnt taken a stand Those issues  a restructuring of the state tax code revision of the rentstabilization laws  are among several politically sensitive decisions that the administration has put off until after the election And some groups are beginning to complain after all they ask isnt one purpose of an election campaign to elicit from candidates a commitment on the issues Tenant groups are planning a rally for Thursday outside the Governors Madison Avenue campaign office to press Mr Cuomo to take a stand now on rent stabilization Meanwhile some Wall Street brokers are pressing for the Governors thoughts on taxes He has promised to return to taxpayers the 2 billion a year in extra taxes the state is expected to take in as a result of the new Federal code But pending study by his advisers he has declined to give even a hint on how that should be done and on whether he wants to benefit any particular group Said Gary Fryer chief spokesman for the Cuomo campaign If there is political posturing here it is not by us it is by those saying Do these things now  Some people go out in a campaign and promise this promise that Mr Fryer said The Governor is acting responsibly and saying No I wont make promises now for political advantage Ill wait till the facts are in  Borough ExecutiveAll those years that everyone thought Robert Abrams was Bronx Borough President it turns out he was really County Chief Executive  at least according to a television commercial for Mr Abramss reelection as Attorney General Does Mr Abrams think the title Borough President carries a negative image considering the suicide of a Borough President Donald R Manes of Queens who had been linked to the citys corruption scandal The ad is running heavily upstate said Ethan Geto a top Abrams political adviser and we found people upstate didnt know what he was talking about when he said Borough President so we came up with this way of describing it This has nothing to do with Donald Manes or anything like that Theres no ulterior motive here In the AudienceThe seating arrangement at the Roman Catholic Churchs annual Alfred E Smith dinner is analyzed each year as if it were the May Day lineup of Soviet officials on Red Square  an indication of who is in favor with the archdiocese and who is not This year it turns out that Mark Green the Democratic candidate for Senate was missing from among the dozens of politicians  Democrats and Republicans alike  who sat on the dais As the evening wore on last week he was spotted sitting among the lesser lights at one of the ordinary tables He was overlooked Randy Daniels Mr Greens spokesman said when asked why the candidate wasnt on the dais Whether it was deliberate or not I dont know Mr Green like many Liberal Democrats advocates several positions that are at odds with the those of the Catholic church supporting for example a womans right to have an abortion and the use of Medicaid funds to pay for it Mr Daniels said Mr Green wound up attending as a guest of someone who shall remain nameless who had bought tickets to the dinner Senator Alfonse M DAmato the Republican being challenged by Mr Green was invited to sit on the dais but was detained in Washington Andrew P ORourke the Republican challenger to Governor Cuomo was seated prominently As for the archdiocese a spokesman would say only that we dont invite every officeholder or candidate for office to the dinner No CoStarsMr Cuomo announced with great fanfare on Aug 12 that the Members Only sportswear manufacturer would undertake a 6 million advertising campaign against illegal drug use and that he would be featured in one the nationwide commercials not a bad vehicle for a man who is running for reelection as Governor and who might one day run for President But when Mr ORourke the Republican candidate for Governor got wind of all this he put his foot down If Mr Cuomo gets a nationwide spot courtesy of Members Only Mr ORourke said then he wants one too The result Members Only decided it would rather do no commercial than do one with Mr ORourke It seems the company doesnt think he is much of a name nationwide Filming of the

"THE STATES, THE FEDERAL GOVERNMENT AND THE ATOM",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/20/us/the-states-the-federal-government-and-the-atom.html,Once the United States Nuclear Regulatory Commission decides that a power plant has been properly designed built and staffed should a state or local government be able to block its operation The issue is already before the courts in New York where the Shoreham Nuclear Power Station on Long Island has been held up for more than a year The issue is expected to reach the courts here in the next few days because of the commissions decision to allow loading of nuclear fuel at the Seabrook plant in New Hampshire Its operation is opposed by neighboring towns in Massachusetts In both places the ostensible issue is whether the plant operators preparations for a nuclear emergency are adequate or even possible But the emergency planning question because it is the only one still pending at the plants masks a variety of others Perhaps foremost among these is the question of who will pay for the plants which are 10 times more expensive per unit of capacity than older nuclear plants These costs might have been justified if oil prices had continued to rise rapidly but now the cost of the oil the nuclear plants would replace in their 30year lifetimes seems unlikely to approach construction and operating costs No Consensus No Middle Ground A broader question is whether changing politics and public policy will accommodate projects that take decades to complete In New York state and New England the shifts in public opinion since the 1979 accident at the Three Mile Island nuclear power plant in Pennsylvania and the explosion at the Chernobyl plant in the Soviet Union this spring have added passion to a debate whose tenor resembles that over abortion The partisans do not seem able to create a consensus for either side and there is no obvious middle ground Because of the similarity of the cases and Shorehams earlier completion it appears that as New York goes so goes New Hampshire The Seabrook plant an 1150megawatt reactor undertaken by the Public Service Company of New Hampshire in conjunction with 15 other utilities serving all six New England states was conceived a decade before the Three Mile Island accident at a time when utilities thought that putting their generators close to major consumers would improve the reliability of electricity supplied Massachusetts objected early to the situation of the plant a stones throw from its northern border but the opposition meant little until after the Three Mile Island when the Nuclear Regulatory Commission required that all new plants have plans for warning sheltering or evacuating the populations within 10 miles in emergencies That circle takes in six Massachusetts communities Governors Divided Over Seabrook Opposition to Shoreham an 809megawatt plant in Suffolk County on the Islands North Shore is likewise of long standing The first major government body to take up the cause was Suffolk and while the County Executive later wavered opponents have enlisted Governor Cuomo In New England some New Hampshire towns would like to prevent operation of Seabrook but they have been overruled by Gov John H Sununu Gov Michael S Dukakis of Massachusetts was considering whether to back the border towns in his state when the Chernobyl explosion occurred With advice from a dean at Harvards Kennedy School of Government he has since decided that in the immediate area which includes some of New Englands most popular beaches neither sheltering nor evacuation is a practical option in case of a rapidly developing accident Last week the Nuclear Regulatory Commission told the owners of the Seabrook plant that they could load fuel and test the reactor at extremely low power Mr Dukakis wants the fuel loading stopped because he argues testing will contaminate the reactors innards with radiation making it far more expensive to convert the plant to another fuel or abandon it  a contention the owners dispute Massachusetts officials say they will appeal the commissions order New York state made the same argument over Shoreham reasoning in pleadings before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission that nothing should be done to foreclose alternatives at a time when it was unclear whether commercial operation would ever follow The regulatory commission decided in the Shoreham case however that no accident that could conceivably occur at low power would require evacuation or sheltering of those outside the plant and that the utility the Long Island Lighting Company could proceed with lowpower testing at its own risk For Lilco and for the Public Service Company of New Hampshire Seabrooks main owner the plants have become a lifeordeath proposition in which failure almost certainly means bankruptcy and they have always shown every determination to plunge forward Costs Continue to Rise While the debate continues the meter is running Interest and other overhead costs run more than 1 million a day at each plant The combined cost of Seabrook and Shoreham approaches 10 billion In New Hampshire a law passed almost a decade ago in response to Seabrooks mounting costs bars companies from charging consumers for plants not in service If the courts or the Federal regulators rule that the plant is not safe the financial error of having built the plant would fall on shareholders bondholders and banks not ratepayers Public Service of New Hampshire which owns about onethird of the plant has already agreed not to charge consumers for at least a portion of its cost The New York Public Service Commission has ruled that if Shoreham does operate 135 billion of its estimated 45 billion cost will have to be borne by Lilcos investors and lenders The owners of both plants are expected to try to make consumers pay for as much as possible no matter what the plants fates If the economics are murky the politics are not neither Governor appears to have suffered much for his position and neither seems likely to suffer if he is eventually overruled by the Federal agencies or Federal courts Elsewhere the Federal Governmentss exclusive authority over nuclear power under the Atomic Energy Act is under challenge In August at the National Governors Conference Gov Madeleine M Kunin of Vermont won committee approval for a resolution proposing to allow the states to set regulations over nuclear plants stricter than the Federal ones In Ohio Gov Richard F Celeste has declined to cooperate with emergency planning for the Cleveland Electric Illuminating Companys Perry nuclear plant Smaller Evacuation Zone Sought The industry is pressing the Nuclear Regulatory Commission to cut the 10mile circle for emergency planning to 2 miles using data from Three Mile Island and research in progress about the movement inside nuclear plants and in the environment of radioactive contamination Critics respond that while the estimates now in use may overstate the risk in some cases it is far from clear that this is true for all accidents and all radioactive materials One plant already operating in Maryland has applied to shrink its emergency zone as has Shoreham Another hope for plant operation is what the utilities call the realism argument maintaining that local governments and states can be judged to be prepared for an accident even if they deny it In the event of an emergency the utilities hold public officials would uphold their sworn duty to protect public health and safety even if they had sat out planning and drills The five commission members all appointed since the Pennsylvania accident and since the emergency planning rule was strengthened endorsed that argument in the Shoreham case But Lilco was dealt a blow when a Federal court ruled that utility linemen and meter readers could not substitute for lawenforcement personnel The states efforts to carve out a role in nuclear regulation may have more impact on the nuclear industrys future than its present only about 20 plants listed as under construction appear likely to be completed and most of those are adjacent to reactors already in operation for which emergency planning has been completed
EXCERPTS FROM D'AMATO-GREEN DEBATE IN ALBANY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/22/nyregion/excerpts-from-d-amato-green-debate-in-albany.html,Following are excerpts from a debate last night between the two candidates in the Nov 4 election for United States Senator from New York  the incumbent Alfonse M DAmato and Mark Green Opening Statements GREEN Thank you I want to thank the League especially for allowing the public to hear tonight the clearest choice in a generation for the United States Senate between a fighting Democrat out of the party of Roosevelt and Truman and Cuomo and a far right Republican out of Joe Margiottas corrupt Nassau machine Ask yourself tonight as you watch which of us can best represent your needs and your beliefs in the United States Senate in the future For example I think its wrong to send 100 million in aid to thugs called the contras in Nicaragua My opponent says its fine I think its essential that we have tougher handgun control laws to reduce the killing on our streets My opponent disagrees I think women have the right to choice My opponent wants to make all abortions criminal Well based on my years of experience with Ralph Nader I think Al DAmato is a consumer fraud    Because while he talks like Jacob Javits he votes like Jesse Helms and because while he ways that he brings home the bacon in fact New York has lost more Federal aid than any other state per capita As a result of my opponents votes there is less money for Social Security less money for pollution control enforcement less money for student loans    DAMATO    Weve just concluded a rather historic session  the 99th Congressional session came to an end And with it some historic legislation has been passed Tax reform true tax reform And I voted for that and fought for it and fought in that bipartisan tradition to see to it that New Yorks interests and concerns were heard and observed I led the battle along with my colleagues along with Governor Cuomo and Pat Moynihan to preserve the deduction of state and local taxes We won that fight by coming together I fought the battle to bring more dollars in mass transportation to this state As a result of that 600 million more have come to New York due to my efforts to see to it that there was a dedicated source of funding for mass transit Its been Al DAmato whos been fighting for working middleclass families in New York fighting to preserve senior citizen housing Urban Development Action Grants Its a record that Im proud of Its the kind of record that has brought bipartisan support to my candidacy     Campaign Contribution Q You testified on behalf of a discotheque owner from your home town of Island Park Your testimony was as a character witness for a man who was accused of being an associate of a major mobster Now on one hand weve seen you out speaking very forcefully against the mob yet heres your testimony Do you see this as contradictory DAMATO Not only speaking forcefully but doing something passing the comprehensive crime control bill Doing more to bring about an effort in terms of mobilizing this nation and its resources against the scourge of a drug epidemic And to more particularly respond to your question this was a person in my community a local community who I had known as a hardworking family man businessman I was not aware of his associations that have come subsequently And by the way there have been some whove said youve accepted some money I was not aware of that We had more than 70000 individual contributions to our campaign Our campaign checked out the records Indeed he and I believe his wife have made contributions Those contributions were returned  GREEN Let me talk about Philip Basile since you asked the question Hes a man whose nightclub had 20 drug arrests in one year Hes a man who was indicted and convicted of conspiring with an organized crime member a member of the Lucchese family to get a drug dealer out of prison You know who his only character witness was Al DAmato He exploited the position of US Senator walked into court and said that this man Philip Basile was a man of integrity Instead the jury thought that he was a felon What kind of signal does it send on the issue of drugs on the issue of crime when Al DAmato testifies for such a man and then takes 1000 from him  Dealing With Soviet Q Mr Green both your Democrat and Republican opponents have painted you as a leftist Democrat Following that theme do you feel we can negotiate with confidence with the Soviet Union GREEN Of course First I am in the progressive mainstream of both my parties My first job in public life was with Jacob Javits I worked a decade with Ralph Nader then with Senator Gary Hart Governor Cuomos appointed me to the States Industrial Cooperation Council So I think Im working for patriots and my public career    as a public interest lawyer demonstrates it Of course we have to stand up to the Soviets in places like Afghanistan We have to sit down with them as well when it comes to negotiating arms control treaties Im very disappointed that this administration said that Star Wars would be a bargaining chip but they wouldnt spend it And they went there with high hopes and came back with alibis I think this is the first Administration since the nuclear genie got out of the bottle that hasnt produced one single arms control treaty     Q Senator DAmato    you said President Reagan was correct in not giving up the Strategic Defense Initiative but the agreement that the Russians were willing to sign would continue to allow SDI research This agreement would have been the only one in history that was an actual arms reduction agreement which is something the President said he wanted Isnt this simply standing up to the Russians for the sake of standing up to the Russians DAMATO I dont believe so I think Ronald Reagan will eventually have that nuclear arms accord  one that is verifiable one that really reduces weapons  nuclear weapons I think we are very close But I also think theres another reason that hes come so close and thats because he has insisted on bringing us to a position of strength We were teetering on the brink of falling perilously behind in terms of being able to preserve peace I think that our SDI is an important part in terms of securing for American today and its future its legitimate defensive needs Why should the Soviets be concerned about a defensive system and the testing of that system Were not talking about an offensive system  a defensive system     Central America Q    The President said that one of the things that caused him to go into aid to the contras was the placement of MIGs at an airbase in Nicaragua or the preparation rather of the base for MIGs Do you think that was not cause for him to take action And what action would you have told him to take were you to be a U S Senator GREEN The President does not yet return my phone calls But if I called him and he took the call I would say that if the Soviets went into any country in Central America with MIGs or nuclear missiles  as they did of course in Cuba in the early 1960s  that would be cause for an American response Realize of course there are no Soviet MIGs in Nicaragua to our knowledge Why are we in Nicaragua Were saying that were protecting the Contadora nations around Nicaragua from them exporting their revolution Well let me tell you the Sandinistas I think have betrayed a lot of their revolution    But the Contadora nations who are supposedly the beneficiaries of our policy oppose Al DAmatos 100 million in aid to the contras    They prefer instead to negotiate with Nicaragua    Q Senator DAmato on that question DAMATO You know its interesting that the same people who today oppose aid to Nicaragua are for the most part the same people who opposed aid to El Salvador El Salvador would have been lost We would not have had President Duarte whos attempting to build and does have the broadbase support of the people who are now themselves under attack by the guerrillas I might suggest when we begin to liken Nicaragua to Vietnam that we just dont understand history or where we are in this nation 
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN; DODD AND EDDY ARGUE ROLE OF U.S. IN CENTRAL AMERICA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/nyregion/the-political-campaign-dodd-and-eddy-argue-role-of-us-in-central-america.html,Senator Christopher J Dodd a Connecticut Democrat and Roger W Eddy his Republican challenger clashed sharply yesterday over the role of the United States in Central America and in providing aid to the rebel forces in Nicaragua Mr Eddy charged that Mr Dodd often speaks for and sides with President Daniel Ortega Saavedra of Nicaragua and displays what Mr Eddy called a strange hypocrisy by not criticizing the loss of free speech or a free press in Nicaragua as he had done in the Philippines Mr Dodd in turn said he had spoken out against the Sandinista Government of Mr Ortega and that it was absolutely incorrect to suggest that because he opposed aid to the antiSandinista rebels known as contras he was a defender of the Sandinistas In a debate at The New York Times only their second confrontation of the campaign the two candidates agreed on a number of key issues despite their pointed remarks on Central America and campaign tactics Star Wars Research Backed They generally agreed for example on the need for a stronger stance by the United States to open foreign markets such as Japan to American exports They both said they supported the Equal Rights Amendment and Federal funds to pay for abortions They also said they would support research on the Strategic Defense Initiative known as Star Wars although Mr Dodd said he differed with President Reagan on the amount of money to be spent At one point Mr Dodd praised Mr Eddy for his support of environmental issues when Mr Eddy served in the Connecticut General Assembly in the late 1960s I wish you were running for the state legislature Mr Dodd said with a grin Mr Eddy a 66yearold farmer inventor and novelist from Newington who trails far behind Mr Dodd in most polls criticized his opponent for not being a leader on issues and for wavering back and forth so that nobody ever really knows where you stand In deciding whether to run Mr Eddy said he had been told in Washington that Mr Dodd had the safest incumbent seat in the United States Senate Such a position he said should bring strong leadership He said Mr Dodd had squandered a great opportunity Mr Dodd 42 of East Haddam who is seeking a second sixyear term said he had focused on issues such as Latin America housing and programs for children instead of being what he called a Jack of all issues He also said he had been a good regional senator working with the Congressional delegations from other states such as New York Mr Dodd said Mr Eddy had resorted to gimmickry which he called insulting to voters in recent newspaper ads offering a 10000 prize in a drawing of coupons which asked readers to evaluate critical statements about Mr Dodds voting record Mr Eddy saying his ads were totally fair game said he had tried to talk about issues and Mr Dodds voting record but had attracted little attention And suddenly I put out a questionnaire or a survey and all of a sudden the issues are being focused on he said Mr Eddy called his differences with Mr Dodd on Central America the clearest division with his opponent He said that if the United States had abandoned the rebels in Nicaragua it would have sent a signal to Central America and Mexico that we basically didnt feel we could control that whole area down there anymore He added The time to stop potential disaster is early Getting Ourselves Into a Mess Mr Dodd said Its not a question of being for the Sandinistas but rather trying to find a way in which you can resolve those differences and disputes if you can short of having to engage in the military conflict He said of the United States involvement Were slowly getting ourselves into a mess Mr Dodd said that if Mr Eddy felt so strongly about removing the Sandinista Government Why dont we just go in and do it instead of this muddling along as we apparently are Mr Eddy said he was overwhelmingly against sending American troops down to Central America and Im trying to avoid the necessity of that Before ending their debate with handshakes and exchanges of Thank you Christopher and Thank you Roger Mr Dodd said he would leave it to his Congressional colleagues and people in the region to measure his effectiveness Mr Eddy said Now I represent I think the future  even though theres quite a difference in our age I think I represent the return of government to the state level and to the local level
The Civil Liberties of the Unborn,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/opinion/l-the-civil-liberties-of-the-unborn-082686.html,To the Editor As one who considers herself a civil libertarian I am disturbed by the position the American Civil Liberties Union has taken on the California woman facing criminal charges in connection with her newborn infants death news article Oct 9 Janet Benshoof of the ACLUs reproductive freedom project holds a womans right to privacy rules out any interest on the part of the state in her pregnancy The ACLU attorney directly involved Lynn Palprow calls the California legal action a nightmarish intrusion into this womans life Neither of them it seems considers how this womans behavior has intruded on the wellbeing  and the very life  of her unborn infant A primary consideration in this case is the placenta previa condition of which the mother was reportedly aware and concerning which she had been given specific instruction which she then failed to follow Her use of drugs and participation in intercourse given this condition were active abuses of her vulnerable unborn infant Her failure to follow medical directions in the event of hemorrhage was an act of neglect which deprived the baby of the oxygen and nutrients necessary to sustain life If any of these acts had occurred once the baby was outside her womb there would have been no question of her criminal culpability The more general issue here is drug abuse during pregnancy The term fetal distress syndrome is well chosen The unborn infant of a drug abuser suffers physical distress which is then compounded by withdrawal effects following birth Can anyone who has seen such infants many born prematurely and underweight  attached to wires and tubes in neonatal units ever again think of drug abuse during any phase of pregnancy as a victimless crime With increasing neglect caseloads in the courts based on positive toxicologies in newborns the argument that a womans body is hers at all times to do with as she pleases loses validity from moral ethical and legal perspectives When that body houses a viable being capable of pain total bodily autonomy is no longer permissible The freedom of choice which I believe to be a womans right for firsttrimester abortions is not applicable past the point of viability Once a woman has made the choice to bring a pregnancy to term she has given implicit recognition to the existence of two bodies  her own and the personinthestateofbecoming inside her body That this person is not visible before birth does not mean he or she is without a right to legal protection from harm  especially harm at the hands of the mothertobe on whom he or she is fully dependent before birth There must be an assumption of responsibility for the wellbeing of the unborn infant Where because of immaturity or characterological problems this responsibility is not assumed by the mother herself legal measures are called for It is my hope that the California case will break some legal ground on this complex issue It is also my hope that the ACLU will recognize the right of the unborn infant to protection of civil liberties INGEBORG OPPENHEIMER Yonkers Oct 10 1986 The writer is a clinical social worker
AROUND THE NATION; Girl Will Have Abortion Despite Parents' Protest,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/us/around-the-nation-girl-will-have-abortion-despite-parents-protest.html,A State Appeals Court panel today gave a 15yearold who is 11 weeks pregnant the right to obtain an abortion despite objections by her adoptive parents The panel upheld a ruling by a Superior Court judge that said the girl whose name was not disclosed was mature enough to decide whether to end her pregnancy Under state law a judge may grant an abortion to an unmarried girl under the age of 18 without parental permission if the court is convinced the girl is mature enough to make the decision The girls parents said the law deprived them of their right to take part in key decisions in their childs life said Edgar L Kelley their lawyer The abortion is planned for Thursday

EPISCOPAL RESOLUTION ASSAILS VATICAN 'COERCION',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/23/us/episcopal-resolution-assails-vatican-coercion.html,By a unanimous vote the 518member Convention of the Episcopal Diocese of New York has passed a resolution deploring what it says is coercive discipline or other action that narrows the realm of free debate among theologians and biblical scholars The author of the resolution the Rev Christopher Webber rector of an Episcopal church in Bronxville said he was prompted by actions of the Roman Catholic Church that are creating an impression of the Christian church as authoritarian and not open to freedom and diversity The resolution was passed late Tuesday by the diocese convention an annual meeting of members of the clergy and the laity held at the Cathedral of St John the Divine The diocese the thirdlargest in the United States represents 46000 Episcopalians in Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and Westchester Putnam Dutchess Rockland Sullivan and Orange counties Free and Open Inquiry The resolution titled Freedom and Authority in the Catholic Church says in part We believe that truth is best served by free and open inquiry and that God calls us to allow and preserve to the fullest possible measure freedom of biblical and theologial scholarship and diversity of expression within His church For these reasons we deplore any action that narrows the realm of free debate With concern for the greater unity within the church we would avoid any use of coercion because we believe the witness and mission of the whole church is impeded by such action Bishop Paul Moore of the Episcopal Diocese of New York said he supported the intent of the resolution Neither John Cardinal OConnor of New York who was in Rome yesterday nor Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago could be reached for comment last night A spokesman for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops said the conference would have no immediate comment Archbishop Rembert G Weakland of Milwaukee who has strongly questoned the Vaticans actions in disciplining dissidents also declined to comment Father Webber rector of Christ Church in Bronxville said that last August he began to feel that events taking place in the Roman Catholic Church were having an unfortunate impact that these events were creating an impression of the Christian Church as authoritarian and not open to freedom and diversity Disciplining of Theologian Cited He said he was particularly concerned about the disciplining of the Rev Charles Curran and Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle Father Curran a professor of theology at the Vaticanchartered Catholic University of America in Washington DC was told by the Vatican in July that he was no longer eligible to be an official Catholic theologian because of his dissent from the Vaticans views on abortion divorce homosexuality and birth control Archbishop Hunthausen announced on Sept 6 that because of his opinions the Vatican had stripped him of his authority in several areas including the liturgy ministry to homosexuals marriage annulments and dealings with priests who had left the ministry These are instances of the Roman Church attempting to tighten its discipline Father Webber said It was important to say there is another kind of Catholic Christianity which respects human freedom and reason and has room within it for diversity of expression Bishop Moore said last night that he first learned of the resolution when it came to the floor of the convention from the ecumenical commission of the diocese I cant speak for the convention he added but personally I felt very pleased that it was passed because I feel deeply that freedom is an essential part of being a Christian and that in order to reach the truth about God which continues to be revealed in new ways as years go by we must allow our minds the freedom to explore new understandings of the ancient truths of the faith
VOLUNTEERS AROUND U.S. SUBMITTED TO RADIATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/24/us/volunteers-around-us-submitted-to-radiation.html,Hundreds of human volunteers around the nation were exposed to radiation to determine its effect on fertility and other biological functions and how the human body absorbed and retained radioactive contaminants according to documents released earlier this year by the Department of Energy The Atomic Energy Commission and its successor the Energy Research and Development Authority both forerunners of the Department of Energy financed studies involving researchers from Government laboratories and such private institutions as the SloanKettering Institute for Cancer Researchin New York City and the University of California at Berkeley The latter two studies involved injecting trace amounts of radiation in volunteer patients to study metabolism In one major experiment involving inmates at the Washington State Prison the testicles of 64 volunteers were exposed to large doses of radiation Vasectomies were performed prior to discharge from the study to eliminate the possibility of defective offspring according to a summary of the experiment prepared by the Department of Energy but it added In several instances the volunteers changed their mind and did not desire a vasectomy at the conclusion of the study Other government documents gathered by the House Energy Committees Subcommittee on Energy Conservation and Power found that the vasectomies would be necessary to avoid any possibility of contaminating the general population with irradiationinduced mutants The committee found an appalling number and variety of such expermients on more than 1000 subjects nationwide according to its chariman Representative Edward J Markey of Massachusetts who said that the panel would issue a report next week At the Oregon State Prison the testicles of 67 volunteer inmates were irradiated from August 1963 to May 1971 according to Government documents after which there were sperm counts hormone evaluations and other studies of the inmates According to research by the subcommittee the Government intended to keep in contact with the irradiated prisoners to watch for further health effects but these plans were dropped in 1976 at the request of the US Attorney in Portland after several irradiated inmates filed suits against the Federal Government Prisoners Were Paid The Oregon prisoners were paid 5 to 10 per irradiation and 100 at the end of the study according to documents gathered by the subcommittee The subcommittee research also outlines experiments in which 14 human subjects in Richland Wash were immersed in tritium a radioactive form of water or given the material to drink or inhale to measure retention and excretion Others were injected with radioactie phosphorus or fed fish from the Columbia River that were contaminated with phosphorus discharged by reactors at the Hanford site The data from these experiments indicated that humans absorbed tritium at a rate 4 times faster than measured for rats according to the report of the subcommittee staff The tritium study was financed by the Atomic Energy Commission Other experiments sought to measure the helpfulness of radiation in fighting cancer The documents released by the Department of Energy mention one study in which progesterone a hormone found in women was labelled with small amounts of radiation and injected into three patients one 10 weeks pregnant A therapeutic abortion 6 days later because of severe sickle cell anemia was performed said the summary prepared by the Department of Energy
THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN; REAGAN MILITARY STAND UNITING CONSERVATIVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/25/us/the-political-campaign-reagan-military-stand-uniting-conservatives.html,President Reagans handling of the arms talks in Iceland and his strong support for a defense against missiles have cooled a feud among conservatives over the direction of their movement and the strategy that Republicans are pursuing in this years elections While Democrats dispute how much of an impact the Presidents handling of the arms issue will have on the Congressional races this year and insist the economy will predominate relieved Republican conservatives contend that Mr Reagans strong stand has united their ranks and given them a powerful election issue The arguments are a healthy sign for a movement growing into a new majority said Representative Newt Gingrich a conservative strategist involved in a tough campaign for reelection here But a lot of conservatives who were worried about the campaign are now reasssured For the conservative movement that regarded Ronald Reagan as a hero before the rest of the nation did 1986 has been a difficult year that included internecine struggle and for some disappointment and malaise Feuding Over Strategy It has been a year in which the Old Right which got its start in Barry Goldwaters campaigns took the neoconservatives as Johnny come latelys to the movement There has been fierce feuding as well over electoral strategy between ardent believers in conservative doctrine and elements of the White House staff and others whom the conservatives regard as too moderate The conservatives have argued that without an aggressive thematic campaign the Republicans would lose ground to Democrats running races based on local issues or as voices of protest against economic difficulties But with Election Day less than two weeks away and with many Republicans privately fearful that the Democrats will retake control of the Senate the various factions have arrived at a truce thanks largely if indirectly to the President The truce is built around the proposed missile shield that is the central military goal of the conservative movement What brought the two sides together is the perception that some themes were needed to pick up marginal voters in at least a half dozen Senate races that are expected to be decided by the smallest of margins For the pragmatic Republican campaign strategists the Presidents speeches in favor of the missile defense which he calls his Strategic Defense Initiative have given him an issue through which he can rally voters who support him personally behind Republican Senate candidates Polls have repeatedly shown that many Americans who approve of Mr Reagans handling of his job are nonetheless voting for Democrats this year GOP Gains at Polls Seen I think it has worked surprisingly well said Robert Teeter a leading Republican poll taker who is widely regarded as a pragmatist Mr Teeter said that in the wake of the Iceland summit most Republican candidates had gained at least a couple of percentage points in the polls For the conservatives a missile defense was a matter of principle and the key for them was that the President showed that he could stand firm against the political pressure to reach arms agreements with the Soviet Union We were expecting the worst from the Iceland summit said Burton Yale Pines senior vice president of the Heritage Foundation a leading conservative research organization Instead he said Mr Reagan refused to sign an unacceptable deal and came away more committed than ever to SDI The Presidents speeches in the final days of the campaign are still less sharp in their defense of the antimissile plan than some conservatives might like But nonetheless they have been heartened by his clear stand on the issue and his charges that Democrats would raise taxes and block the appointment of tough judges Representative Gingrich a persistent troublemaker for the House Democratic leadership said he was not worried about the battles that have engulfed the conservative movement over the last year He sees the infighting as a reflection of the diversity of the movement that has gathered around the President What we are talking about is leaving the exciting adolescence of Rebel Without a Cause and trying to govern the country he said Old and New Conservatives The strands of the new movement include the many elements of the Old Right traditionalist conservatives who emphasize hierarchy and order libertarian conservatives who accent the free market and antiCommunist conservatives for whom the primary goal must be rolling back Soviet influence Added to this mixture in the late 1960s and 1970s were the new forces of conservatism the neoconservatives former liberals dismayed by what they see as a liberal tendency toward antiinterventionism abroad and racial quotas at home and the New Right a diverse array of groups that include the politically active Evangelical Christians and opponents of abortion of busing to achieve racial desegregation and of gun control While tactically more aggressive than other Republicans Mr Gingrich recognizes that the New Right cannot go it alone The highest priority has to be keeping this coalition together said the 43yearold founder of the group of young House Republicans the Conservative Opportunity Society All of a sudden you have more people in the tent than will ever agree with each other he said You have to keep them from killing each other But that figuratively speaking is exactly what has been happening this year For example at a meeting this spring of the Philadelphia Society a group of conservative intellectuals the Old Right challenged their new allies especially the neoconservatives In an article published at the time Dr M E Bradford a professor of English at the University of Dallas who is a leader of one of the older ideological wings of conservatism said that certain groups who have recently attached the conservative label to themselves were involved in trying to steal our identity and put it to uses at variance with its origins The liberal converts he said were essentially still supporters of the welfare state The pragmatic technicians of the Administration in the meantime threatened to make the conservative cause synonymous with the tepid compromises rationalized in public by the servants of the President he said Sober Ideological View What we have learned Dr Bradford concluded in one of the gloomier statements on the right in recent years is how little is accomplished by winning elections Meanwhile on the New Right leaders complained that Republicans were not pursuing the conservative social agenda aggressively enough and that this would lose votes too Morton C Blackwell chairman of the Conservative Leadership Political Action Committee a former White House liaison with the New Right and other groups said that Republicans had operated too much on the least common denominator basis to the disappointment of conservative activists who wanted more aggressive stands on gun control abortion and other issues For the pragmatist the entire debate on the right wing is a dangerous sectarian battle that has little regard for governing or building a majority By refusing to bargain away the missile shield program and effectively selling his position to the public Mr Reagan has largely reunited the major factions at least for the moment
PASTOR FINDS G.O.P. SUPPORT LUKEWARM,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/us/pastor-finds-gop-support-lukewarm.html,The Rev Donald Lynch is a 31yearold assistant pastor who decided to run for Congress this year With 4000 and an allvolunteer organization made up mostly of conservative Christians he won the Republican nomination in Indianas Second Congressional District His top issues included AIDS and abortion People are dying from abortion and people are dying from AIDS Mr Lynch said in an interview this week Something needs to be done right now He advocates barring AIDS victims from schools for instance In the primary he defeated a Muncie businessman who had strong support in the partys establishment In the general election he is waging an uphill battle against Representative Philip R Sharp the Democratic incumbent Mr Lynch has raised about 62000 since the primary a spokesman said which is not much for a Congressional race Scant Aid From National Party He has not received much help from the national party he feels he deserves more His campaign chairman John R Price asserts that the old Republicans do not want to see candidates like Mr Lynch win The young ministers campaign reflects some of the growing pains of a key movement in the Republican Party the mobilization of Christian conservatives as party activists and candidates It is a movement that presents the party with both opportunities and risks in the view of many people familiar with the situation It has already led to some tension beween newly energized Christian activists and longtime members of the party establishment The partys ability to manage these tensions could be critical over the next two years as it seeks to preserve the electoral gains forged by President Reagan according to people in political circles In this election season Indiana offers a case study of the process Gordon K Durnil chairman of the Indiana Republican Party presides over a highly successful party that controls both houses of the State Legislature the governorship and both United States Senate seats Welcoming Fundamentalists The state chairman said party leaders worked hard in recent years to make fundamentalists feel welcome as they have with other new arrivals We are now political leaders managing coalitions said Mr Durnil Were no longer this little inbred country club set But many party regulars were caught off guard this year by the primary victory of Mr Lynch assistant pastor of the Beech Grove Independent Nazarene Church south of Indianapolis His previous political activity was largely limited to the antiabortion movement It was not the only Congressional upset in Indiana in which conservative Christians played a crucial role In the Fifth Congressional District most of the Republican county chairmen backed State Treasurer Julian Ridlen in his effort to succeed the retiring Republican incumbent But the nomination was won by State Senator Jim Butcher who is heavily supported by conservative Christians the Rev Pat Robertson the television evangelist appeared at fundraising events in Mr Butchers primary campaign Stress on Legislative Experience Mr Butcher however emphasized this week that he was a lawyer with eight years of legislative experience He drew a distinction between himself and political newcomers such as Mr Lynch I am a Christian and Im involved in politics Mr Butcher said but its not like all of a sudden I got into politics Ive paid my dues This is a natural progression Indeed the party appeared to close ranks quickly around Mr Butcher Stuart Rothenberg who is director of the political division of the conservative Institute for Government and Politics and coauthor of the book The Evangelical Voter says Mr Butcher is the successful model for candidates who come out of a religious background Voters Mr Rothenberg said are uneasy with candidates perceived only as outgrowths of religious movements Rougher Road for Pastor The course has been rockier for Mr Lynch The National Republican Congressional Committee did not put much emphasis on his district this year as it has in years past It gave Mr Lynch 1000 a small proportion of what it could provide in money and services under the law Mr Price the chairman of the Lynch campaign asserted that the committees treatment of Mr Lynch amounted to Christianbashing In an interview in his law office this week Mr Price argued that theres no other discernible reason for the national committee not to make a heavier commitment to the Lynch campaign A spokesman for the committee responded Its not fair to characterize the committee as making a decision based on someones religious preference Mr Price a longtime activist from the partys conservative wing asserts that candidates like Mr Lynch are the new Republicans with clearcut positions on the issues Christian Consultants Warning As an example he cites Mr Lynchs stance on acquired immune deficiency syndrome Mr Lynch has campaigned heavily on the threat of AIDS Gary Jarmin a political consultant to Christian Voice a conservative lobbying organization argues that the party can pay a price for appearing to slight candidates like Mr Lynch Mr Jarmin said Lets say Lynch doesnt win this race and 88 comes and you nominate someone you consider a very viable candidate that the establishments pleased with You come to us and say Look we need you conservative Christians to help us knock off Sharp Why should we help you Mr Durnil the Republican chairman said he believed that over the years the party built up a relationship with religious activists that would last He said he believes the party had been strengthened by their emergence and he discounted the notion that they could cost the party the support of younger more liberal voters However John B Livengood the Democratic state chairman asserts that Republican leaders are concerned about the heightened visibility of fundamentalists like Mr Lynch in their party I think the leadership in the Republican Party is in public trying to put the best face on it he said And in private theyre hoping they can outlast it
DODD AND EDDY CLASH OVER LEADERSHIP ROLE AND CAMPAIGN TACTICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/nyregion/dodd-and-eddy-clash-over-leadership-role-and-campaign-tactics.html,THE campaign for the United States Senate entered its final days last week much as it began with Christopher J Dodd the Democratic incumbent and Roger W Eddy his Republican challenger still trading barbs over the issue of leadership When they announced their candidacies  by coincidence on the same day March 20  Mr Dodd said he would run on his record and Mr Eddy called the Senator a young man living in the past Starting their final round of campaign appearances including a debate last Wednesday at The New York Times Mr Dodd praised his record and Mr Eddy said his own candidacy represented the future which he described as returning power to the state and local governments Sitting next to each other at a conference table Mr Eddy said of Mr Dodd On no one particular issue has Mr Dodd emerged as a solid leader a solid spokesman Every position hes taken is subject to change depending on the whims of the voter polls and that to me is not leadership And I think you have as Ive said squandered a great opportunity In response Mr Dodd said he had focused on issues such as housing Latin American policy and programs affecting children rather than becoming what he called a jackofallissues He said that in 12 years in Congress he had demonstrated leadership and had taken independent stands I think Ive been a good regional Senator he said noting he has cooperated with the Congressional delegations from the Northeast on issues In turn Mr Dodd chided Mr Eddy saying he had not spelled out his positions on issues during the past eight months I think that opportunity has been squandered and missed Mr Dodd said Mr Eddy said he had tried to talk about issues but that nobody paid attention until he offered a 10000 prize in a contest asking newspaper readers to evaluate some critical comments about Mr Dodds record Mr Dodd called the contest gimmicky and said I think its insulting to voters in the state Mr Eddy said it was fair game and added Suddenly I put out a questionnaire or a survey and all of a sudden the issues are being focused on The DoddEddy race has been one of contrasts from the beginning Mr Dodd 42 years old the son of the late Senator Thomas J Dodd has spent six years in the House of Representatives and six in the Senate He lives in East Haddam Mr Eddy 66 a farmer inventor and novelist from Newington served three terms in the state legislature in the 1960s and is making his first run for statewide office In contrast to the fights for the gubernatorial nominations in both parties neither Mr Dodd nor Mr Eddy had any opposition within their parties Mr Dodd wears neatly tailored dark blue suits Mr Eddy wears rumpled gray suits and the points of his shirt collar seldom stay down Mr Dodd has raised more than three times Mr Eddys campaign budget of about 360000 The most recent University of ConnecticutHartford Courant poll of 500 adults taken by telephone between Oct 13 and 18 showed Mr Dodd leading Mr Eddy 53 percent to 9 percent with 38 percent undecided Mr Eddy said that when he was considering whether to run he had been told in Washington that Mr Dodd had the safest incumbent seat in the United States Senate This didnt exactly start me off on an up optimistic note he said But I used that as an example If anyone had such a position he should be able to take strong positions on what he believed and stay with them  Thats what leadership is Mr Dodd said he would not pretend that he was a leader on every issue Senators who try to do that he said turn out to be the least effective members of the institution While most of the attention has been focused on their differences and their sometimes barbed exchanges Mr Dodd and Mr Eddy did find themselves in substantial agreement on several topics For example they both stressed the importance of a strong Federal presence to open up foreign markets to American exports from manufacturing states such as Connecticut They both stressed the need for continued Federal support to help maintain and improve Connecticuts highway and rail systems They both opposed the Federal tax revision bill which was signed into law last week They said they supported an equal rights amendment Federal funds to pay for abortions and continued research for the Strategic Defense Initiative or Star Wars When Mr Dodd pointed out the similarities and noted that Mr Eddy had said previously that they disagreed on most every issue Mr Eddy interjected major issue Well these are not insignificant issues tax reform environmental legislation educational legislation all the whole social agenda Mr Dodd said With that Mr Dodd went on to praise Mr Eddy for being what he called one of the strongest and earliest spokesmen on behalf of environmental legislation when he served in the General Assembly I wish he were running for the state legislature Mr Dodd said Mr Eddy just smiled Responding to a question on whether they would support a Federal tax increase to help reduce the budget deficit Mr Eddy said No Mr Dodd said he wanted to know what kind of tax would be increased before he responded I dont rule it out Mr Dodd said of a tax increase When Mr Eddy prodded him to give a yes or no answer Mr Dodd said he was taking a page from Mr Eddys speech in the General Assembly in 1971 urging enactment of a state personal income tax The tax was repealed a few weeks later after an outcry from the public It was an eloquent speech Mr Dodd said referring to one by Mr Eddy on a similar issue when the state was facing a large deficit I dont consider this an answer Mr Eddy said
EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE BETWEE DODD AND EDDY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/nyregion/excerpts-from-debate-betwee-dodd-and-eddy.html,Following are excerpts from a debate last Wednesday between the Democratic and Republican candidates in the Nov 4 election for United States Senator  the incumbent Christopher J Dodd and Roger W Eddy Leadership Mr Dodd your opponent says you havent taken the job seriously you have your finger to the wind and you dont lead Whats your response DODD Well I would disagree with that I think there are any number of instances over the last six years 12 years  six in the House six in the Senate  where Ive demonstrated leadership taking independent positions on issues Going back you want to just look at the six years in the Senate certainly the 81 tax cut proposal which I thought was a mistake Today I think if you were to ask most members of the Senate if theyd like to have a vote back in the last six years that would be one of them theyd like to have back given David Stockmans recent revelations about it certainly taking a leadership role on that On the issue recently of tax reform which I happened to have disagreed with there were 23 of us ultimately who voted against that bill to be signed into law today offering amendments on that bill starting the Childrens Caucus in the Senate some 32 members actively involved in those questions Certainly being asked to respond to the President in 1983 on the Latin American policy having offered the initial amendments in 1981 in that arena The only housing bill to be adopted under the Reagan Administration in the last five years the DoddSchumer Bill which was certainly leadership    EDDY    When I first went to Washington and I was being persuaded  and I must say I was willing  to make this run I was told that Mr Dodd had the safest incumbent seat in the United States Senate This didnt exactly start me off on an up optimistic note But I used that as an example if anyone had such a position he should be able to take strong positions on what he believed and stay with them Thats what leadership is Leadership is not simply being against somebody or being against an incumbent President And so he himself has brought up this tax bill of 1981 He was one of eight senators to vote against that bill And his suggestion that maybe a lot of people would like to have that vote back now well thats just his opinion I think it happens to be the foundation of the prosperity both in the state of Connecticut and nationally   He was the Democratic spokesman against the Central America policy But Ive observed during this campaign that the Senator has backed off even that position This is what Im referring to I say that if you are perceived to be an incumbent United States Senator from an important state such as Connecticut and you believe something or other you should in my opinion youshould come out front on it and stay within reason of course Sometimes evidence comes up which can change your mind but not be always waivering back and forth so that nobody ever really knows where you stand    Criticism Q Mr Eddy you called your opponent the Senator from Communist Nicaragua You were giving a 10000 prize in a drawing evaluating some uncomplimentary statements about his conduct But one recent poll only gave you 9 percent of your vote Has your criticism backfired EDDY    There are three legitimate issues in any campaign First and most important is ones voting record how he or she voted on issues Second public statements before a group like this before a television program before a radio What do you say That is fair game fair campaign game And finally public conduct in a public place by a public official Im not interested in Mr Dodds private life and Im certain hes not interested in mine But I am interested in his public life because he represents me and I want a senator or a representative or a Congressperson in Washington for whom I can be proud    Now I didnt refer directly to the other part I have yet to hear or observe or be told any statement any voting record where Mr Dodd has said that he disapproves of Daniel Ortega and a Communist dictatorship in Central America On the one hand I observe great eloquence when Mr Dodd speaks about access to the press and everything in a place like the Philippines I sense great conviction on his behalf He wants an open society in the Philippines hes spoken out eloquently on that And yet I detect utter silence when it comes to precisely the same things in Nicaragua DODD    Quite the contrary I have spoken out against the Sandinista Government and my concern for it In fact its one of the reasons why a lot of the groups that are to the left of center on this issue are not have been terribly pleased because I havent been a defender of the Sandinistas I think the issue has been framed very cleverly by the President and the Administration that if youre not for the contras you must be for the Sandinistas    And if we can move away from sort of the bumpersticker approach  that if youre not for the Sandinistas or if youre not for the contras you must be for the Sandinistas  and start to look at this issue in the context of whats in our interest whats in the interest of our allies I think you can develop a better policy I relate it back in fact since you raised the Philippines when President Reagan was asked in the 1984 debates whether there was an alternative to President Marcos He said no just Marxism in that particular debate In fact we found out there is an alternative Id like to suggest there is here too As far as the ad goes and so forth that are raised on it those questions there its gimmickry and I think its insulting to voters in the state Thats been the reaction I think by and large that somehow theyre going to decide to vote for someone because theres a 10000 reward and a drawing People expect far more out of a candidate and a candidacy    And so weve come down to the last month or so and so its scramble time and do whatever you have to do in order to get your word across    And it hasnt worked And I regret it I think its squandering an opportunity to really lay out issues    EDDY    We are the peacekeeper of the world We have acquired that role in my lifetime And the Central America area is critical to our national security and our national defense    In my way of thinking this is maybe the clearest division between Mr Dodd and me possibly based on our experience  in my case the fighting in World War II Ive said this I believe it The time to stop potential disaster is early And thats where leadership is Thats where you have to make a tough decision You have to say well maybe the majority of people arent with me on this but this is where we take our stand We take our stand with the tools at hand Sometimes the tools are not perfect but I say the ultimate goal of this destabilization process in Central America is Mexico I say it is serious I say it is indirect aggression from our major antagonist the Soviet Union via their surrogates    And I dont wish to get back into my questionnaire the response has been frankly overwhelming Weve had close to 14000 replies Its been interesting It has been a way for me to get the very thing I tried to do for the length of time that he discussed  to get issues out there Ive talked about every single major controversial or noncontroversial issue facing the people today And to be perfectly honest with you got very little attention either from my opponent  the only thing he said was why dont I talk issues which is precisely what Ive been doing  and quite frankly didnt get much attention for a lot of good reasons  overshadowed by the gubernatorial primary overshadowed by many things overshadowed by the perception that this was at the very best an uphill race for me And suddenly I put out a questionnaire or a survey and all of a sudden the issues are being focused on Stand on Reagan Q Mr Eddy youve criticized Mr Dodd for voting against President Reagan in your words every step of the way Are there areas in which you disagree with the President and what are they EDDY Yes there are Ill start with some rather simple social issues  not so simple but I mean theyre very cutanddried I certainly disagree with him on his attitude toward abortion and say the womans right of choice I do not favor prayer in schools I do not favor the educational voucher system Im a strong supporter of a public educational system and also I believe in private education too Im not saying we should curtail that yet I dont want to see us support it I oppose many aspects of what this Administrations attitude appears to be on the environmental area I think that I myself and others in the state of Connecticut worked for many many years attempting to bring about some changes in environmental attitudes And I think along with many others I was helpful in changing those attitudes  and this spills over into the Federal and national area I think thereve been some steps backward in that area the attitude of drilling rights and grazing rights and in the nonfunding of acquisition of park lands and so forth I particularly disagree with him in what I consider to be a critical area facing this nation today and that is on trade imbalance    The primary threat comes from the Orient and Japan in particular but it exists everywhere And I have said  I made this speech which has achieved some heat for me as well as some support that the Japanese Government in collusion with our industrial leaders in the 50s devised a policy of predatory trade which quite simply  an oversimplification here  but this is basically the way it works We will close our markets to you meaning us but we will take advantage of your wideopen market And by this means we will undermine many of your basic industries which in fact they have done  and the only export that Japan has accepted willingly and now other countries in the Orient from us is our jobs It is the major threat today facing American working men and women There is no question about it in my mind that this is an issue that must be immediately addressed in the next session of Congress DODD Well I would add two other issues Roger I guess would disagree as well with the taxreform bill which we agree on by the way he and I agree on  and GrammRudman where we disagree And the Administration was supportive of that particular position EDDY And by the way I just want to make it clear I am not for tariffs because certainly you can argue that tariffs caused the Great Depression of the 30s but I am for saying that this country has got to forget the role of being the financier for the world    I say listen American industry American working men and the women American management can compete I just know they can Weve always been able to compete So there are ways of forcing action in this And I want some leadership and I want to be able to use the language that will attract attention to this issue and in fact I have Mr Dodd is now talking about it    DODD I gave that speech Roger two years ago EDDY Well thats wonderful Im proud of you for recognizing this but Im saying lets take some leadership here I know I will It will be my major effort in Washington    DODD I tell you again this has been I think worthwhile I think an area where theres probably some pretty fundamental agreement on what we can keep doing Maybe its a modest modification but the difficulty that began about this issue was I think frankly the comments that the Japanese were culturally liars cheats and thieves Now I only read the quote and didnt hear my opponent say it EDDY Well I did so Ill give you that DODD That to me that is not to discuss trade That to me was the kind of statement that I think does just the opposite  it diverts attention from the issue All of a sudden you had a statement that was made that by most estimates Id have to call a racist statement    Youve had ample opportunities to retract a statement like that and I would hope maybe this morning you might because I dont think it ought to keep coming up It doesnt serve your candidacy well    EDDY Well let me answer and let me say theres no apology going to be offered here because I will explain precisely what I meant And what I thought I said but which in a good political way can be misinterpreted deliberately The fact of the matter is that the Japanese Government in collusion with their industrial leaders decided upon a policy which included the stealing of patents the lying when it came to trade agreements and cheating insofar as dumping Those are precisely what I meant by those three words Now as far as saying that the ordinary Japanese individual and then the socalled Japanese man in the street lies cheats I had no intention of saying that or implying But I will not withdraw from my statement of the highlevel policy and if you dont believe what I say ask IBM Ask the Zenith Radio Corporation Where do you think all the patents that are now being sold back to us in the form of radio or TV came from They came from Zenith They were stolen through industrial espionage    I stand by the statement and I say that we must recognize that and must suggest to the Japanese Government and their industrial leaders that they have to join the civilized trade world Thats all And there are other ways that they acquire technology which are less illegal in fact which are legal Transportation Q Transportation is always an issue    Do you favor Federal legislation creating a centralized register or licensing system of truckers and would you raise the 55mileanhour speed limit DODD No I voted against raising the 55mileanhour speed limit    I think the data is too strong that supports saving many lives and the fact of the matter is 55 means 65 If you make it 65 it means 75 as a practical matter So I think that speed limit is proper Now I cosponsored legislation that would require  I dont know I think it was Senator Heinz apparently who offered the legislation  but it would set up standards Theres some 20 or 30 states in this country where to get a drivers license to drive a Volkswagen or a 16 wheeler is no different at all And with deregulation of trucking of course weve had a lot of new a lot more competition on the line but the problem is youre getting an awful lot of people driving vehicles that have little or no experience So some sort of registry if you will or requirement that in order to drive one of these big vehicles should require more than just passing a local driving test I think its essential    We have a highly congested system In fact I95 is being used now 20 to 25 percent more than it was when the tolls were in And so youre getting a tremendous amount of congestion along those roads and I think something along those lines of registry training and the like or passing a special licensing requirement standardized  if youre going to have 20 to 30 states with Interstate traffic as much as it is    And the fact is there is a lot of data there that supports the fact that the numbers of accidents the number of  where trucks are involved  is pretty substantial Its been fairly even since deregulation but nonetheless it has gone up EDDY    Im 60 percent in favor of removing the 55 and 40 percent against it And I really I dont think thats a good answer but Ive offered it And the reason for it is I think the major cause of accidents its been determined at least as far as I can read is by the multiplepurpose highways the multiplespeed highways the highways that have some people going 25 miles an hour others going at 45 and others going at 75 It isnt so much speed that kills despite the slogan it is the multispeeds that seem to kill And another thing that bothers me is when you have an unrealistic law a law that nobody obeys then you should really recognize that the people themselves are talking to you    Now to get into I think a far more complicated and possibly important issue and that is the transportation system in Connecticut is in a state of chaos absolute chaos And Im not going to become narrowly partisan here and say its all Governor ONeills fault or its all  thats just  electioneering And Im not going to indulge in it But the truth is the truth is that our highway system is critical to the economic survival of Connecticut If we dont have good roads and that includes Interstate 95 if we dont have those good roads and if we cant get easily from one factory to another then we as a state are courting with disaster economic disaster So I use 95 a lot I think all of you here do It is probably one of the worst major highways in the United States of America It needs great great changes and it is sort of civilization gone mad You have trucks walltowall trucks You have cars courting disaster And I cant say heres what Id do  these are the six steps Id take The only thing I know is that weve got to do something and our representatives and our senators in Washington have got to become aware that Connecticut is on the brink of a serious transportation problem and it also includes the railroad as every commuter in Fairfield County has told me at least twice And I think here I would question a little bit the privatization plan that this Administration has in fact urged Because I think theres grave worry in Fairfield County on the part of those who use this railroad in order to commute to their jobs that the fact is that heres a case where  much as I espouse private industry and believe in it and think its the ultimate solution for providing jobs and everything else  that they do tend to look at profit and loss and that if they conclude that the railroad in Fairfield County coming into New York is in fact running at a loss or not as much profit they could let it deteriorate they could not take the proper care of it    DODD I think the railroad is important    But obviously to the extent you can support alternative modes of transportation in addition to talking about registry on trucks and so forth relieves some of that burden and pressure along our roads    But I would just say in fairness to Governor ONeill you cant have it both ways You cant be critical of the fact that our roads arent in great shape and then turn around and be critical because hes trying to do something about it If anything else hes being criticized today because an awful lot of the gridlock is being caused by repairs on the highways and roads And that was something that was very important people wanted in the state but we let it go far too long far too many years because people didnt want their dollars spent in that arena and now they are And its going to give Connecticut I think by the time these repairs are completed over the next year year and a half probably the finest road system in the country Therell be congestion because the corridor in which we live is one of the most congested in the country But to fault him for trying to repair these things right now I think is in a sense unfair EDDY Well I think that I have to keep the record straight here And I did not fault him I thought I bent over backward to try to avoid getting into the gubernatorial race here Im just saying that the truth of the matter is that Connecticuts highways are critical to our survival absolutely critical We are a corridor and if ever we allowed any administration Republican or Democratic in the state capital to somehow or other sacrifice that and I think they have been sacrificed and I think were paying the price now And I think that therefore this is a critically important issue also an opportunity for some leadership in Washington because there is Federal money involved in many of these projects as we all know And so therefore heres an issue where a Congressperson or a senator can say this is critical to our state its critical to our survival as the No 1 in the nation and I personally would be involved in this DODD As I have in that particular case In fact one of the major issues is the railroad station in Stamford And I was able finally to get Mrs Dole to agree to come up and knew there was a great controversy with contractors and so forth A lot of them were just sitting there  come up begun the work and that station should be completed  a loan but its a revolving thing But nonetheless she was interested and lent support on the issues involving National Airport Who was going to own the National Airport The State of Virginia or the State of Maryland and so forth And I felt that the State of Virginia probably had a better case to make since it was in Virginia but nonetheless the votes were going to be difficult to count on that kind of a question If Paul Sarbanes asks me one more time whether or not that Stamford railroad station is complete one more than that hes going to lose my vote every time be in trouble So we are making efforts and taking leadership and really trying to come up with financing for an important part of that transportation issue South Africa Q Could I pose some short questions    Do you support economic sanctions against South Africa EDDY Yes I do But I must add to that if you will allow me to I do not support would not have supported the present what I consider more radical sanctions that have been actually voted into law   I would have taken a more moderate position and I think I would have come down more on where the President appeared to come down    DODD    I supported the sanctions bill that was adopted this year by the Senate and it was sustained rather we overrode the Presidential veto on that issue I feel that what we asked for there was reasonable This is a nation that wants to be perceived as part of the family of Western democracies It does not see itself as a totalitarian or authoritarian government I think thats a central point in the debate on South Africa that doesnt often get discussed Star Wars Q    Do you support research for the Strategic Defense Initiative EDDY Absolutely yes DODD Yes not at the levels the President wants Equal Rights Q Do you support the equal rights amendment DODD Yes EDDY Yes Abortion Q Do you support Federal funds to pay for an abortion DODD Yes EDDY Yes Federal Taxes Q Would you support a Federal tax increase to help cut the deficit EDDY No DODD Youve got to tell me what kind of a tax I dont rule it out Closing Statements Q    I want to give you each your final two minutes to either go back to a point or summarize your views or use them however you will    DODD Well Ill just take that last point    what tax I mean are you going to talk about a gasoline tax a consumption tax Are you going to talk about increases in brackets broadening base Theres a variety of things that can be done    I think to take a position of absolutely no tax increase without considering all the implications of that is a mistaken position to take without assessing what they are I just come back to what we sort of started on this Its always these incumbents are running and so forth It gets egomaniacal I suppose to some extent But I happen to believe the best test of whether or not a person ought to be returned to office  the incumbent the burden of incumbency  is really the question of effectiveness    Were talking about a nationalinternational agenda but also having enough balance about it that youre not walking away from the problems of your state or your region I think Ive been a good regional senator When issues involved the City of New York the state the New England region generally Ive tried to be a cooperative member I dont see us as engaging in some of the parochial contests that can oftentimes happen But if its Long Island Sound or our transportation networks the pollution question and so forth I think Ive been a good cooperative member of my delegation along with those of New York New Jersey Massachusetts and the like    EDDY    1988 in particular but even this year is going to be I think a watershed Its going to be the direction that the State of Connecticut the whole nation takes insofar as national defense issues and also domestic fiscal matters And here is where Mr Dodd and I generally are in disagreement I think that he represents and you know the Senate is involved here the control of the Senate is involved the direction of the Government Were very definitely at a watershed position How are we going to go Are we going to go backward Are we going to go back to the policies which in my opinion did bring us to the very brink of national low morale with all the other things you heard about  high inflation high unemployment a feeling that we were no longer moving that we were no longer what we should be in this country Or are we going to continue on a direction which I approve of which this Administration has made Now I represent I think the future  even though theres quite a difference in our age    I think I represent the keep going the keep going of returning this government to the genius of America which was to let the local government the people there do what they can possibly do and the Federal Government become involved only when it becomes obvious that the problem cannot be solved in that Thats what this election is all about It contains national defense issues as our peacekeeping role and domestic national issues on our overall direction
STAKES ARE HIGH IN SUFFOLK HOUSE RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/nyregion/stakes-are-high-in-suffolk-house-race.html,GREGORY J BLASS and George J Hochbrueckner the Republican and Democratic candidates for the House seat from the First Congressional District in Suffolk County have had at last 25 joint appearances and debates But there has been little heat and few major differences between them It really comes down to the voters having a pretty good choice said Mr Hochbrueckner a former state assemblyman Its coming down to whos the more effective and the more responsive said Mr Blass the Presiding Officer of the Suffolk County Legislature The lowkey responses of the two candidates belie the intensity and the significance of their campaign for the seat being vacated by Representative William Carney who is rarely mentioned by either of his wouldbe successors Mr Carney after serving four terms was persuaded by Suffolk Republican leaders to step aside because of their fears that his less than allout opposition to the opening of the Shoreham nuclear plant would result in his defeat That is part of the significance of the House contest If the 37yearold Mr Blass loses Democrats will control all three of the House seats in Suffolk County a situation that William M Blake the Suffolk Republican leader has acknowledged could jeopardize his leadership His potential successor Walter Hazlitt the Brookhaven Town Republican chairman also has a stake in the contest because Brookhaven makes up at least half the Congressional district The other two Suffolk Democrats in the House Thomas J Downey of the Second District in Suffolk and Robert J Mrazek whose Third District stretches along the North Shore of Suffolk and into Nassau County are strong favorites to win reelection Also heavily favored are two Nassau Republican Congressmen Norman F Lent and Raymond J McGrath and a Queens Democrat James H Scheuer whose district juts into the Great Neck area Both Mr Blass and Mr Hochbrueckner say that the Island turnout will be critical this year when many politicians predict that statewide turnout will be low because of the widespread perception that Governor Cuomo and Senator Alfonse M DAmato are strong favorites to win reelection Mr Hochbrueckner having confronted the Reagan tide in 1984 when he unsuccessfully challenged Mr Carney is looking for a favorable wave this year from Governor Cuomo But Mr Blass is looking to Senator DAmato to help propel his fellow Republican into office Mr Blake had openly promoted Mr Blass for the House seat because he was considered a strong candidate In addition his position as Presiding Officer of the Legislature could become part of the Republican bargaining over a county executive nomination next year Mr Blass of Jamesport was elected Presiding Officer late last year over Mr Blakes opposition A Blass loss would leave him as Presiding Officer but facing for a contest for reelection in January The 48yearold Mr Hochbrueckner who was a fiveterm Assemblyman before he challenged Mr Carney in 1984 has said that another defeat would end his political career The First District contest is also significant because the Conservative and Right to Life Parties which combined produced nearly 8 percent of the vote for Mr Carney two years ago have gone their own way  making Mr Blasss job more difficult Mr Carney aided by President Reagans coattails won 53 percent of the vote against Mr Hochbrueckner in 1984 The Conservative candidate is Dominic J Santoro of Rocky Point the Brookhaven Town Conservative leader who objected to Mr Blasss selection because of his antiShoreham position William J Doyle of Shirley is the Right to Life candidate Republicans have a 2to1 enrollment edge over Democrats in the district 46 percent to 23 percent but independents are also a sizable factor  about 25 percent of the registration The First District includes the eastern half of Smithtown Brookhaven and the five East End towns Before Mr Carneys first election in 1978 the district was represented by a Democrat Otis G Pike for many years a point that Mr Hochbrueckner often raises People have to be reminded that Democrats dont have two heads he said If Democrats do not t have two heads they do have more money in the district Mr Hochbrueckner expects to spend at least 300000 and Mr Blass at least 200000 Unions are a major source of Hochbrueckner funds and workers while Mr Blass is relying heavily on business and Republican Party money and workers Vice President Bush has campaigned with Mr Blass and Representative Tony Coelho of California chairman of the House Democratic Campaign Committee campaigned for a second time with Mr Hochbrueckner last week Mr Coelho has also brought money  35000 from the campaign committee Mr Blake is actively involved in the Blass campaign and has enlisted Arthur Finkelstein for polling and Richard Bond as a political consultant Both serve yearround as consultants to Mr Blake Although both candidates are in effect trying to sell their personalities in their mailings radio advertising amounting to about 9000 a week for each man and hundreds of public appearances there are some differences on issues Mr Blass is a strong supporter of the Reagan Administration which his polls indicate is popular in the district He maintains that the United States should continue its research into antimissile space defenses known as Star Wars Mr Hochbrueckner has called the program a tremendous waste of money Mr Hochbrueckner says that the United States should abide by the SALT II agreement limiting nuclear arms But Mr Blass maintains that the Soviet Union has not complied with the agreement and the United States should continue its buildup to a better bargaining position They also differ on American aid to the antigovernment forces in Nicaragua known as the contras Mr Blass supports providing material aid but not troops Mr Hochbrueckner opposes both Mr Blass supported the idea of a Federal death penalty for drug dealers whose drugs cause a death a legislative provision that was rejected by Congress Mr Hochbrueckner opposes the death penalty in all cases Mr Hochbrueckner opposes abortion Mr Blass says that government should not ban abortion Both are Roman Catholics Each candidate argues that he has been a more vigorous opponent of Shoreham but privately they both agree that the plant which is in the First District is probably not a substantial issue in the race now Both have independent antiLilco lines on the ballot The ad hoc parties are the Public Power Alternative to Lilco which supports Mr Hochbrueckner and the Concerned Citizens Against Lilco backing Mr Blass Mr Hochbrueckner is one of three Suffolk Democratic Assemblymen consistently elected in Republican districts He gave up almost certain reelection to a sixth term in 1984 to challenge Mr Carney A native Long Islander he attended the State University of New York at Stony Brook and Hofstra University but did not graduate He parlayed electronic training in the Navy into what he calls a career as a mustang engineer  someone who came up the hard way He has been vice president of an electronics firm since he left the Assembly He and his wife Carol Ann have four children They live in Coram Mr Blass is also a Long Island native A graduate of Fordham College and Fordham Law School he too served in the Navy He was first elected to the County Legislature in 1979 and is a practicing lawyer as well as a legislator His wife Barbara operates a

THE NATION; Meese Dissents On the High Court,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/26/weekinreview/the-nation-meese-dissents-on-the-high-court.html,Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d extended his constitutional critique in a new direction aiming at what he called an astonishing arrogation of power by the Supreme Court and at those who place its rulings on a par with the Constitution itself A High Court decision he said in a speech at Tulane University in New Orleans does not establish a supreme law of the land that is binding on all persons and parts of Government henceforth and forevermore Many legal scholars  including some who agreed with Mr Meese that the Court in a 1958 ruling used overly sweeping language in calling its 1954 desegregation decision the supreme law of the land  expressed concern that his statements could be taken as encouraging defiance of Court rulings Disregarding their status as law would shake the foundations of our system said Eugene C Thomas president of the American Bar Association A Meese spokesman said later that the Attorney General was advocating dissent only in a responsible fashion seeking a constitutional amendment for example Leading the Reagan Administrations efforts to shrink the role of the courts in setting national policy Mr Meese has in the past accused the judiciary of usurping legislative powers and of using the Constitution as an empty vessel into which each generation may pour its passion and prejudice Instead he believes the courts should defer to elected officials on such issues as abortion and affirmative action unless laws clearly conflict with the original intentions of the Constitutions framers

CUOMO AND O'ROURKE: WHAT EACH PLEDGES TO DO IF ELECTED; REPUBLICAN CANDIDATE STRESSES COMBATING DRUGS AS TOP PRIORITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/27/nyregion/cuomo-o-rourke-what-each-pledges-if-elected-republican-candidate-stresses.html,Andrew P ORourke the Republican candidate for governor has established three priorities if he is elected  combating drugs making the state economically competitive with its neighbors and creating jobs The first and major priority is to do something about the problem of narcotics with drug education and direct prosecution Mr ORourke the Westchester County Executive said in an interview last week devoted to a look forward on issues His second priority he said would be a 24 billion state tax cut over three years to make New York competitive with neighboring states He said Connecticut and New Jersey have been siphoning jobs and business from New York and have half the states unemployment rate which is now 6 percent To create jobs Mr ORourkes third goal he has proposed establishing a commission to coordinate Federal and state economic development programs and has called for state subsidies to encourage industry in depressed areas such as the South Bronx and innercity sections of upstate cities Mr ORourke has spent much of his campaign talking about what he calls the Governors reluctance to debate him But he has also released 16 papers that constitute his assessment of the state of the state Many of the papers were released with little fanfare Last week in Albany at the end of a news conference that concentrated on debates Mr ORourke almost as an afterthought pulled out a paper on governmental authorities and quickly summed it up Other papers have been released upstate and received little attention downstate or released downstate and largely ignored The papers borrow heavily Mr ORourke acknowledged from the 1982 campaign of Lewis E Lehrman the Republican candidate who was defeated by Mr Cuomo Richard Behn who said he wrote the ORourke papers was a key figure in the Lehrman campaign too Mr ORourke spent most of the weekend campaigning upstate at a time when most statewide candidates are concentrating on the more populous downstate region Our major thrust is upstate Mr ORourke said He said he expected a low turnout of voters in New York City next Tuesday Other Republicans say Mr ORourke is trying to shore up his Republican strength upstate to avert a possible rout on Election Day Crime and Drugs Among Mr ORourkes suggestions are what he called one of the most comprehensive proposals on crime and drugs He has suggested that convicted felons be denied release on bail pending appeal and sentencing within 60 days He also has proposed what he called shock incarceration for firstoffense drug dealers and people convicted of nonviolent offenses They could serve 90day hardlabor terms as an alternative to state prison he said to build up discipline selfesteem and perseverance He supports legislation to give crime victims a greater role in sentencing and paroleboard deliberations He also favors a state constitutional amendment permitting disclosure of circumstances surrounding pardon and commutation applications which are now kept secret And he supports the death penalty for premeditated murder Mr ORourke often talks especially upstate about the allegations of municipal corruption in New York City He has urged the Governor to appoint a special prosecutor for such cases to supersede the Democratic district attorneys in New York City His contention is that Democratic prosecutors are investigating fellow Democrats including political leaders who helped sponsor their careers On drugs Mr ORourke said We must send a message to drug dealers  deal crack and you deal yourself a prison term He said the state needed 25 more judges to handle drug cases Death Penalty He favors the death penalty in cases in which the acts of drug pushers can be directly linked to a fatality and wants mandatory drug education starting in first grade He said that if elected he would create a state drug enforcement agency to coordinate all antidrug activities He also favors more state funds for residential treatment centers and a crackdown on open sale of drug paraphernalia Mr ORourke has also proposed an economic growth commission to coordinate Federal and state economic development programs and to provide onestop shopping for all business problems Contending that New Yorkers pay far more state and local taxes than residents of neighboring states he proposed the state tax cut and that the state match dollar for dollar the Federal Government tax revision measure which he called a windfall He is proposing two state income tax rates 4 and 7 percent and a salestax exemption on the first 75 worth of clothing a year purchased by a taxpayer The maximum rate for next year for the states income tax is now 9 percent for earned income and 13 percent for unearned income He opposes abortion but like Mr Cuomo accepts the Supreme Court decision permitting it Unlike the Governor he has said he would seek repeal of state Medicaid financing of abortion He has proposed an expanded workfare program with the state providing as it once did 75 percent reimbursement to local welfare

Survey He has called for a halt to deinstitutionalizing the mentally ill saying this would help reduce the number of homeless He has also urged a survey of 73000 released mental health patients to determine their needs He said he would seek separate Metropolitan Transportation Authority boards for Long Island the northern suburbs and New York City transit operations and would make the MTA directly accountable to the governor On education Mr ORourke said the governor rather than the Legislature should appoint members of State Board of Regents He has favored appointment of an inspector general for education to survey school systems to determine what is working and what isnt in our education programs
REAGAN DUE TO HELP IDAHO REPUBLICAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/27/us/reagan-due-to-help-idaho-republican.html,The Republican heavy artillery will come to Idaho next week to try to shove Senator Steven D Symmss reelection campaign out of a deadlock and into the winners column Despite the Senators advantages of incumbency a solid Republican electorate and plenty of money to run a campaign Gov John V Evans the Democratic candidate has Mr Symms against the wall in one of the handful of races likely to decide control of the Senate President Reagan and Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada the general chairman of the national Republican Party will be here to help Senator Symms next week And his homestate colleague in the Senate James A McClure who is immensely popular here will take Mr Symms around Idaho in nine major campaign events to urge voters to reelect him With polls on both sides showing the race an even match the campaign has turned bitter The candidates called each other liars when they debated Thursday night on a statewide public television network Mr Symms who will spend about 3 million on his campaign accused the Governor of sending out a fundraising letter that called me Qaddafis best friend in the United States Senate a charge everyone knows to be a lie Dishonest Advertising The 48yearold Senator also accused Mr Evans of running advertisements that are totally distorting my record  totally dishonest in my view Governor Evans 61 said that as he and his advisers planned his campaign on which he will spend about 2 million they looked back at Mr Symmss victory over Senator Frank Church in 1980 and saw the dirtiest campaign in the history of the state of Idaho We saw really the crucifixion of a senator who had served the state very well for 24 years the Governor said Mr Symms who had served eight years in the United States House of Representatives won in 1980 with a margin of 4262 votes less than 1 percent of the total Mr Evans accused Mr Symms of telling outright lies about my campaign positions in saying that the Governor supported free choice on abortion Antiabortion sentiment is high in Idaho where 40 percent of the electorate is Mormon and Governor Evans who grew up in the Mormon Church says he favors abortion only to save the life of the mother No estimates were available of the audience for the debate telecast during the fifth game of the World Series A Saturday editorial in The Lewiston Morning Tribune took note of the debates competition saying Evans left a lot of issues stranded on base Symms booted a couple of hot ones and Evans probably came out a run or two on top with the eventual outcome of the series still in doubt Attacks on Effectiveness Senator Symms says Governor Evans flipflops on issues and has been ineffective But the Governor says Mr Symms has lost effectiveness in the Senate because he is allied with those on the conservative fringe The Democrat attacks votes against costofliving increases in Social Security checks cast by Senator Symms who has advertised his endorsement by the National Alliance of Senior Citizens Governor Evans says that group wants to phase out Social Security Do you support that program Mr Evans asked in the debate Mr Symms quickly said No that is not my plan and moved to another subject Governor Evans called himself a plugger and said Im not comfortable in fast company Senator Symmss style of life in Washington has been criticized by some here as fast track Senator Symms said I will continue to work for limited government for free enterprise for a strong national defense and to support the President Videotapes of the debate will be rebroadcast over the weekend by commercial stations in Spokane Wash which cover northern Idaho and here in Boise Peter Hart of Washington a consultant and poll taker for Governor Evans said his results show the two almost exactly even Ed DeBolt of Washington who does polling for Mr Symms said his figures show the Senator leading but that the statistical margin of error in the small sample wipes out the lead Effect of Gubernatorial Race Mr Evans will probably be helped by the campaign of a popular Democrat Cecil Andrus who is expected to be reelected Governor He held the job from 1971 until he resigned in 1977 to become Secretary of Interior Mr Andrus is considered to have a substantial lead over David Leroy the Republican nominee and he and Mr Evans have campaigned as a ticket Even though the governorship has been in Democratic hands since 1971 Idaho has a Republican majority There are 28 Republican and 14 Democratic State Senators The House of Representatives has 67 Republicans to 17 Democrats Also on the ballot next month is an effort to overturn Idahos law that prohibits requiring employees to join a union Supporters of organized labor plan an extensive canvassing effort on Election Day that is expected to bring out voters who will support Governor Evans Both Senate candidates have avoided discussing that ballot issue and another that would establish a state lottery and never mentioned them in their debate In 1984 President Reagan got 724 percent of the Idaho vote topped here among Presidential candidates only by the 781 percent for William Jennings Bryan in 1896 when he spoke for free coinage of silver a popular position in this silvermining state Bryan the Democrat lost to McKinley

CUOMO PRESSED FOR A DECISION ON TV DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/nyregion/cuomo-pressed-for-a-decision-on-tv-debate.html,Governor Cuomo pressed repeatedly yesterday for a decision declined to commit himself to participating or not participating  in the only television debate of the gubernatorial campaign scheduled for Saturday Two candidates  Andrew P ORourke the Republican and Denis E Dillon of the Right to Life Party withdrew over the weekend from the debate to protest the inclusion of Dr Lenora B Fulani of the New Alliance Party a group they accused of extremist views Dr Fulani had been invited on Friday at the request of Governor Cuomos campaign But shortly after her inclusion was announced Jewish groups raised questions pointing out that the New Alliance Party had endorsed several of the teachings of the Rev Louis Farrakhan the Black Muslim minister whom the groups called antiSemitic Mr Cuomo said yesterday that he had received a telegram from Dr Fulani in which she said she did not endorse all the teachings of Mr Farrakhan The Governor said that in response his campaign had sent a telegram asking her if she joined him in condemning the minister on his antiSemitism Something I Will Not Do Until he receives a reply Mr Cuomo said he cannot make a decision on debating her Dr Fulani reached for comment last night said she had not yet drafted a reply She added however that since the controversy began I have been called upon to refute my support for Minister Farrakhan  something I will not do Dr Fulani said that Mr Cuomo who has differences with the Catholic church is not asked to repudiate the Pope even though many regard the churchs position on abortion as antiwoman Most of yesterday afternoon the Governors top political advisers met at the midtown law office of Mr Cuomos son Andrew to decide what to do about the politically difficult issue of the debate which would include only the Governor and Dr Fulani If Mr Cuomo goes ahead with it he leaves himself open to criticism by Jewish groups If he cancels he will be rejecting the very candidate he had requested to be invited Late yesterday a solution politically acceptable to the Governor seemed at hand when with the strong support of the Cuomo campaign some officials of public television the debate sponsor proposed canceling the debate and scheduling instead individual interviews with all four candidates But last evening that proposal was rejected by David Hepp the producer of the Inside Albany program that organized the debateThe Governor is the one who has to make the decision just as the other candidates made a decision Mr Hepp said Does he want to debate Fulani or not Mr Hepp said he would agree to the interview format only if the Governor formally withdrew from a Fulani debate Dr Fuliani a research psychologist ran for Mayor last year as a candidate of the the New Alliance Party Earlier yesterday the American Jewish Committee a humanrights group issued a statement intended to discourage the Governor from debating Dr Fulani It urged major party figures to refrain from structuring their debates so that greater notoriety or attention comes to groups like the New Alliance Party which it said advocated bigotry Besides the publicbroadcasting session the only other debate of the gubernatorial campaign is scheduled for Thursday at The New York Times Dr Fulani was not invited to attend because The Times invites only candidates of major parties that have permanent ballot spots as a result of having obtained at least 50000 votes in the last election Craig R Whitney an assistant managing editor of The Times said television coverage would be permitted under a pool arrangement
KREMLIN RESUMES ISSUING KEY DATA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/28/world/kremlin-resumes-issuing-key-data.html,After years of withholding data on child mortality the Soviet Union has resumed publishing figures on this key social indicator The Soviet Union is also again announcing the size of its grain harvests after a fiveyear silence These are among statistics that are again being released either in the annual statistical yearbook or in newspapers after years of silence The new figures on infant mortality published in the weekly Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta show that the Soviet level has remained at more than twice the Western level Publication of the data had ended in 1974 when the rate began to rise sharply Soviet grain figures were last issued for 1980 Thereafter they were omitted apparently in an effort to conceal poor crops The new figures prove to be within 1 percent of the estimates made for the Soviet harvests by the United States Department of Agriculture Many statistics that used to be given such as regional data for coal oil gas and steel output remain secret But the partial relaxation appears to be part of a policy of greater openness by Mikhail S Gorbachev the Soviet leader Brezhnev Stagnation Pointed Up The renewed disclosure of some statistics may also be intended to reflect on the economic stagnation under Leonid I Brezhnev in the late 1970s and early 1980s and to illustrate gains made under Mr Gorbachev The statistical relaxation was pointed up this month in an interview that the newspaper Izvestia had with Mikhail A Korolev chief of the Central Statistical Administration No matter how bitter the truth may be Mr Korolev said it is of course better that halftruths that try to cut sensitive corners In the interview Izvestia referred to the Soviet habit of comparing current economic performance with 1913 the last peacetime year before World War I The Government newspaper recalled a line from Arkadi Raikin the Soviet satirist I hear were doing better than in 1913 Thats pretty good Some of the new statistics suggest results from Mr Gorbachevs antialcoholism drive The statistical yearbook for the first time gives data on the consumption of vodka and other hard liquors It was 281 billion liters in 1984 and 238 billion in 1985 or roughly 85 liters per person A liter is about a quart Effect of AntiAlcohol Drive The latest issue of Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta said that since June 1985 when sales of vodka were reduced deaths from accidents poisoning and injuries fell by 24 percent The paper also said that there had been 100000 fewer deaths from bloodcirculation disorders a reduction attributed largely to the drive against drinking Izvestia said recently that output of wines and spirits was down by 35 percent and that people had spent 85 billion rubles 119 billion less on alcohol in the first nine months of 1986 compared with the same period last year On child mortality the data show that 26 infants out of 1000 died before their first birthday in 1985 The figures for 1983 and 1984 were 253 and 259 They showed some improvement over the previously reported figure of 279 for 1974 Rates in the West Are Lower The rate for the United States was 105 in 1985 and for Japan 6 In developing countries the rate ranges from 50 in China to 194 in Afghanistan Child mortality rates are considered one of the barometers of a societys development and wellbeing In the first 50 years of Soviet history they declined rapidly reaching a low of 229 in 1971 But then they turned upward The official Soviet explanation is that the increase reflected improved statistical reporting But a 1980 study by two American experts Christopher Davis and Murray Feshbach found the Soviet explanation unconvincing and contended that the rise was more likely the result of factors such as alcoholism among women a high abortion rate pollution influenza epidemics housing shortages and the large proportion of Soviet women who work In any case the new figures indicate that the rate has remained high suggesting that the factors causing the increase have not been eliminated At the same time Soviet figures have indicated a moderate success for a program in effect since 1983 to raise birth rates centered on initiatives for mothers to have more than one child High Differential in Births The incentive program reflects concern over a flagging birth rate in the European part of the country although rates among the Moslem peoples of Central Asia have soared The program provided benefits for additional children increased maternity leaves and guaranteed apartments for couples with children In 1983 the first year that the program was in effect the birth rate rose to 198 per 1000 residents from 183 It was 196 in 1984 and 194 in 1985 and according to the Ekonomicheskaya Gazeta was at a similar level this year By comparison the birth rate in the United States has dropped steadily and was at 157 in 1983 The grain harvest figures newly published by Moscow showed that the harvest last year was 1917 million metric tons a decent crop by the standards of recent years but short of the planned goal of an average annual crop of 238 million tons in 1981 to 1985 The figures were 1726 million tons for 1984 1922 million for 1983 1868 million for 1982 and 1582 million in 1981

WHITE WINS BLACK SUPPORT IN DETROIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/29/us/white-wins-black-support-in-detroit.html,On a recent Sunday Mayor Coleman A Young toured churches on Detroits east side trying to persuade their allblack congregations that they should vote for a white suburbanite for Governor rather than a black resident of the inner city On the face of it it would appear to be a hard task But Mr Young drew a chorus of amens at St James Missionary Baptist Church and other churches when he denounced William Lucas a Republican who is black as the candidate of a party that wants to dismantle affirmative action and the Civil Rights Commission and favors apartheid in South Africa And Gov James J Blanchard a Democrat who is white received a similarly favorable response when he declared Government has a duty to be a force for good to invest in schools to make sure there is opportunity for all Despite Mr Lucass appeal to make history by making him the nations first black Governor Mr Blanchard is far ahead among both white and black voters according to recent polls Governor Has 30Point Lead The most recent poll commissioned by The Detroit News and conducted Oct 1518 showed 55 percent of the voters favoring the Governor and 25 percent supporting Mr Lucas with 17 percent undecided The poll had a margin of sampling error of plus or minus three percentage points Polls commissioned by other news organizations in the state are reporting similar results This is bad news for Mr Lucas the executive of Wayne County which includes Detroit and some suburbs His strategy was based on holding the normal Republican vote outside Detroit and drawing 30 to 40 percent of the usually solid Democratic black vote in the city The black vote can be critical in a close election In 1982 Mr Blanchard lost the rest of the state but won by 205000 votes on the strength of a 250000vote margin in Wayne County Mr Blanchard appears to be the beneficiary of the states improved economy Unemployment was close to 16 percent when he was elected to the governorship in 1982 now it is under 8 percent Economic Development Stressed Mr Blanchard has made economic development the centerpiece of his administration and it appears to be paying off in a state that has painful memories of mass layoffs and plant closings in the recession of the early 1980s Mr Blanchards embrace of economic development and his theme working together for Michigan appears to be attracting voters who would normally vote Republican while keeping his Democratic base intact Some prominent businessmen in the state including Lee A Iacocca chairman of the Chrysler Corporation have endorsed his reelection The Governor wooed and won the assembly plant that Mazda the Japanese auto maker had decided to build in the United States He has also encouraged Japanese auto parts suppliers to open operations in Michigan Together with Mayor Young Mr Blanchard came up with enough money and inducements to persuade Chrysler to build a new assembly plant in Detroit near the old Jefferson Avenue plant which is scheduled to be torn down Chrylsers decision is expected to save the city several thousand jobs Campaign in Search of a Focus Mr Lucas maintains that the states improved fortunes are a result of the national economic recovery led by President Reagan but Governor Blanchard seems to have convinced a lot of people that actions by the state are responsible for the current relative prosperity Mr Lucas largely deprived of the economic issue by Mr Blanchard has struggled to find a focus for his campaign He has won the support of antiabortion groups with his outright opposition to abortion but has made little headway with calls for lower taxes and a tougher stance on crime Moreover while black voters have often demonstrated their willingness to support white candidates both nationwide and in Michigan white voters have generally not reciprocated Although few white voters outside of the Detroit area have talked openly about the issue Mr Lucass race could be a factor in his poor showing in the polls Mr Lucas disputes the polls particularly the one reporting on black attitudes Ill get my votes in the privacy of the voting booth he said recently noting that he won more than 90 percent of the black votes in Detroit in previous elections Youngs Support Seen as Vital But Mayor Young is the most powerful political figure in Detroit And while relations between him and the Governor have been cool the Mayors willingness to campaign with Mr Blanchard apparently means the Democratic organization in Detroit will work enthusiastically for the statewide ticket something that has not always happened in the past people who follow Michigan politics closely say Mr Lucas has been troubled from the outset by a disorganized fractious campaign staff and the continuing need to raise money Under Michigan law candidates for Governor who accept public campaign funds are held to a spending limit of 12 million so Mr Lucas will not enjoy the financial advantage of many Republican candidates Just how powerful a factor money can be was demonstrated in the Republican primary here Aug 5 when Richard Chrysler a wealthy businessman who is no relation to the automobile family came close to defeating Mr Lucas by spending 3 million of his own money on advertising Mr Lucas has received 750000 in state funds but has been forced to take time from campaigning to raise the 450000 in private contributions that the law permits

"BOMB EXPLODES AT ABORTION CLINIC IN MIDTOWN, INJURING 2 PASSERS-BY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/nyregion/bomb-explodes-at-abortion-clinic-in-midtown-injuring-2-passers-by.html,A bomb exploded in a midtown Manhattan abortion clinic early yesterday morning but the center opened later in the day The device was hidden in a planter and went off at 130 AM gouging out a small hole in the ceiling of the waiting room of the Eastern Womens Center at 40 East 30th Street No one was in the clinic but there were several workers in other parts of the building Two men passing by were hit by glass the police said They were treated at hospitals and released The bombing caused about 10000 in damage officials said No Claim of Responsibility The police said that several phone calls to the bomb squad had warned of the attack but that no one had claimed responsibility As investigators searched for clues later in the morning it was business as usual at the clinic where about 260 abortions are performed each week More than 50 patients arrived for appointments and two antiabortion activists carrying graphic pictures of abortions protested outside Officials said they believed the device had been placed in the clinic during business hours because there was no sign of forced entry The center was open until 530 PM on Tuesday We always have bomb threats and all kinds of telephone threats said the clinics director Barbara Methvin It is sad that this will continue to occur that people will have to use this way of dealing with a law that dont agree with Mayor Koch said yesterday that the city was offering a 10000 reward for information leading to the arrest and conviction of those responsible Robert Creighton special agent in New York for the Federal Bureau of Alcohol Tobacco and Firearms said the bomb was small and unsophisticated He said his agency had investigated 45 abortion clinic bombings nationwide since 1982 Twentyseven cases have been solved he said Proabortion activists say there have been as many as 85 attacks nationwide this year alone A blast last Dec 10 damaged the Manhattan Womens Medical Center at 115 East 23d Street another clinic where abortions are performed There was a small fire but no one was hurt Mr Creighton said there appeared to be no link to that explosion
CUOMO'S DEBATE WITH O'ROURKE TO ENLIVEN RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/nyregion/cuomo-s-debate-with-o-rourke-to-enliven-race.html,Five days before the election the campaign for governor is still so low key that Governor Cuomo has not yet scheduled any formal political campaigning And his Republican opponent Andrew P ORourke is spending much of his remaining time in normally Republican suburbs and upstate and in radio and television interviews that cost him nothing In what will be their first and very likely their only encounter in one of the most lethargic campaigns in years Mr Cuomo and Mr ORourke will meet a third candidate Nassau County District Attorney Denis E Dillon the Right to Life Party candidate in a debate at The New York Times today A television debate scheduled for Saturday was canceled when the Governor asked that the New Alliance Party candidate Dr Lenora Fulani be included and the other two candidates declined to join a candidate from a splinter party that they said promoted antiSemitic and racist views The Governor through a spokesman Gary Fryer yesterday refused an invitation by WRGBTV in the Albany area to debate Saturday night Mr Cuomo has chosen not to campaign formally or to debate until now while Mr ORourke has been handicapped by a lack of money and polls indicating from the start that the Governor has an overwhelming lead Advertising Budgets The disparity in campaign funds is evident in the final weeks television and radio advertising and mail and telephone operations The Governor who is letting his advertising do most of his campaigning is spending at least twice as much as Mr ORourke The Cuomo advertising for the last week is costing about 200000 according to Andrew Cuomo the Governors son and campaign chairman That is a modest expenditure at a time when such advertising can run as high as 400000 a week but not so modest as Mr ORourkes 100000 The two candidates are each spending about 50000 for radio as is Mr Dillon The level of Mr Cuomos advertising is by choice since the campaign has at least 4 million available The excess funds will presumably be used for a Presidential campaign or a future state campaign Mr ORourke who has raised only about 12 million has less than 200000 available for his final week of campaigning Mailing and Telephone Campaign The Cuomo campaign is also continuing a large statewide mailing and telephone campaign targeted to about 2000 swing districts from the 14000 election districts in the state Mr ORourkes mailing financed by the Republican State Committee is to five of the states 34 congressional districts The ORourke television campaign is using his original commercial which features Mr ORourke in effect debating the cardboard cutout of the Governor His radio campaign emphasizes his own record and views The Cuomo advertising emphasizes his record A newcomer to the list is a 10second commercial that is to run this weekend It features the Governor urging New Yorkers to vote a message that is designed to counter what many politicians believe may be a very low turnout next Tuesday The Dillon campaign theme is that people should not waste their vote on Mr ORourke because the Governor will win anyway while support for Mr Dillon at least expresses opposition to abortion Other than todays debate Mr Cuomo is keeping up his schedule of ostensibly nonpolitical governmental appearances and speechs on behalf of a proposal on the ballot for a 145 billion environmental bond issue Mr Fryer said the Governor might make an overtly political trip to western New York on Monday and might campaign for State Senate candidates in the metropolitan area over the weekend Senate Democrats attempting to win a majority of the upper house have been critical of the Governor arguing that his noncampaign strategy may help him but not nonincumbent Democratic candidates for the State Senate who need all the exposure they can get
BITTER DIOGUARDI-ABZUG RACE: SPICE FOR A BLAND BALLOT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/30/nyregion/bitter-dioguardi-abzug-race-spice-for-a-bland-ballot.html,As Representative Joseph J DioGuardi and his Democratic challenger Bella S Abzug settled themselves around the microphones at WFAS Radio in Hartsdale for their second debate of the day the stations sound technician with a look of fear on his face asked them please not to shout he had a headache This is going to be a very cordial debate said the moderator Norman Weil as if uttering a warning rather than a prediction In the course of the debates they have held in their campaign for the 20th Congressional District seat in Westchester County cordial is a word that has not frequently come up Hostile perhaps but not cordial Bella has some strong beliefs and shes certainly not unwilling to project them Mr DioGuardi said Im not one to shrink from that In their joint appearances they have learned to play off each others jokes caught each others colds and developed a reputation for sharp often acrimonious exchanges that both seemed to savor In a campaign season in which debates between statewide candidates have been as infrequent as SovietAmerican summit talks Mr DioGuardi and Ms Abzug have met 11 times Most races have been as boring as possible Mr DioGuardi said Maybe we have provided some entertainment Beyond a shared appreciation for a good fight though Mr DioGuardi and Ms Abzug have little in common He is a conservative Republican who supports military aid to the Nicaraguan rebels known as contras and development of the Star Wars defense system she is a liberal Democrat who says no on both counts She favors legalized abortion and an Equal Rights Amendment he favors neither Both candidates have tried to make political hay of their differences by portraying the other as an extremist who is out of step with the district Essentially what they are fighting over is who can best articulate the concerns of Westchester a county known for its untroubled affluence but that also has a large population of urban poor in cities such as Yonkers and New Rochelle Ms Abzug a lawyer and former Representative who this year moved back to the county after many years in Manhattan has called a lack of affordable housing the countys No 1 problem and has charged Mr DioGuardi with failing to represent the needs of the more vulnerable residents of the district If you look at Joe on most of the programs that are needed in this district in education in housing to protect the seniors in family planning and in womens issues then you have to understand he is out of sync Ms Abzug said Mr DioGuardi who frequently interrupts to exclaim Distortion during Ms Abzugs remarks has labeled Ms Abzugs views more in tune with the West Village and West Hollywood not Westchester In contrast he has described himself as your nextdoor neighbor a man who jogs around the neighborhood every morning to see whether everything is in order Mr DioGuardi an accountant and a resident of the county for almost three decades has called drugs the countys top problem and has made one of the major issues of the campaign a bill that Ms Abzug cosponsored in 1973 that would have made possession of small amounts of marijuana a civil offense
CUOMO AND RIVALS IN LOW-KEY DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/nyregion/cuomo-and-rivals-in-low-key-debate.html,After months of longdistance campaigning in which they impugned each others character and ethics Governor Cuomo and Westchester County Executive Andrew P ORourke took it all back yesterday The Governor and Mr ORourke the Republican candidate for governor appeared with District Attorney Denis E Dillon of Nassau County the Right to Life Party candidate in their only debate of the campaign a 90minute session at The New York Times The debate produced disagreement on some issues but less heat than their repeated arguments over whether and how to debate  an issue that has dominated the campaign The exchange was a snapshot of the campaign as a whole  Mr Cuomo not making commitments Mr ORourke failing to engage him  that went a long way toward explaining why Mr Cuomo holds a lead of 50 percentage points in the polls [ News analysis page B5 ] Aides of both Mr Cuomo and Mr ORourke said they had urged their candidates to tone down the remarks so that Mr Cuomo a skilled debater would not come across as the heavy or so that Mr ORourke would not appear undignified Everybody was on their best behavior said the ORourke campaign communications director Richard Behn Mr ORourke said later that although many might expect blood on the coliseum floor his goal was to be helpful to the state not to kill Mario Cuomo Mr Cuomo said that I respond as I am questioned The tone was set from the start when the two major candidates declined in response to questions to offer evidence to substantiate implications they had made earlier in the campaign Tax Returns and Law Clients Mr Cuomo had implied that Mr ORourke had something to hide in his income tax returns and his list of law clients Mr ORourke had implied that Mr Cuomo a Queens Democrat was somehow linked to or should have known about suspected corruption among highranking Democrats in Queens or that the Governors son Andrew was using his position to enhance his law practice Mr Cuomo who only last week had said Mr ORourke must have something to hide said yesterday I never suggested anything untoward about Mr ORourkes conduct Mr ORourke said he would accept the Governors word that he knew nothing of the Queens scandals and that it was newspapers not he who had raised questions about Andrew Cuomos legal practice Disclosure of Finances Despite the truce Mr Cuomo while continuing to promote full disclosure of personal and professional finances by candidates again refused to disclose honorariums he has received for speeches while he has been the Governor He said he would do this after the election when it would be no longer useful as leverage Mr Dillon interjected that the question of ethics and integrity was a phony issue right from the start Now why shouldnt the public think were crooks when we spend our campaigns calling each other crooks with no evidence he added The three candidates sat shoulder to shoulder exchanging pleasantries and handshakes before and after the debate Their subdued and even friendly demeanor reflected the widespread belief among politicians and poll takers that Mr Cuomo holds such a huge lead in the race for governor that nothing is likely to change it in the final five days of campaigning They disagreed on several subjects but usually politely There were none of the flareups that usually characterize political debates earlier in the election season when the election outcome is more in doubt Mr Cuomo said he had considered but ruled out using for social welfare purposes some of the state tax reductions that are to be made to conform to Federal tax cuts He pledged to return all the money to the taxpayers although he would not commit himself to an acrosstheboard state tax cut in exactly the same proportion as the current state tax rates Both Mr Dillon and Mr ORourke favored tax reductions proportionate to the amount paid by a taxpayer State Aid to Localities All three candidates agreed that state spending and taxes should be cut beyond state tax reductions to conform with Federal tax changes But the Governor brushed off Mr ORourkes suggestion of a 24 billion tax reduction as good talk for a campaign The Governor attributed a 42 percent jump in state spending at least partly to increased state aid to localities while Mr ORourke blamed statemandated programs for a 50 percent increase in his county budget Mr Cuomo contended that twothirds of the Westchester spending increase was not statemandated but within the control of the County Executive Theres no question that the spending should be contained over the next four years said Mr Cuomo who has proposed a state expenditure ceiling Expenditure cap We could have one today Mr ORourke responded All we need is a governor thats going to say Ill lineitem veto  Fiscal Problems Later however Mr ORourke did not propose substantial spending cuts when Mr Cuomo challenged him to do so When Mr Cuomo blamed Gov Nelson A Rockefeller for much of the states fiscal problems Mr ORourke said with a smile I always thought there was a statute of limitations on dead politicians Both Mr Cuomo and Mr Dillon said they favored abolition of grand juries for indictments as Mr Cuomo had proposed in 1982 but not for continuing investigations such as those into organized crime There has not been a whole lot of movement in the Legislature on it the Governor said Mr ORourke disagreed I wouldnt monkey around with the grand jury system he said I think it works Warts and all Mr Dillon touched off one of the few tense moments when he challenged the Governor on whether Mr Cuomo favors notification of parents of a pregnant teenager before an abortion is allowed and whether Mr Cuomo would help set up a test case of the states Medicaid financing of abortion The discussion was significant because all three candidates are practicing Roman Catholics educated almost entirely in Catholic schools but they have taken a variety of political positions on abortion while personally opposing it Mr Dillon and Mr ORourke oppose Medicaid funds for abortions and Mr Dillon also calls for a constitutional amendment banning abortion Mr Cuomo argues that abortions and use of Medicaid funds for them are legal and that he cannot impose his personal views Parental Consent Mr Dillon noted that the Governor had said he favored parental consent for the dispensing of contraceptives in public schools Now it seems to me to be a contradiction if you favor somebody getting an abortion without the parents having to be notified but then you favor parental consent just to get the contraceptive device Mr Cuomo said that he supported notification of parents of a teenager about to have an abortion but that there was difficulty in writing a constitutional bill Even notification bills have been struck down because they artifically limited the right of a young woman to have an abortion he said He also cited State Court of Appeals interpretations that the Governor said required the state to finance abortions  about 50000 a year in New York State Mr ORourke suggested a law that would provide for a doctor to counsel a pregnant teenager to contact her parents A Battle of Statistics With fiscal matters dominating the debate Mr ORourke described as a battle of statistics Mr Cuomos contention that 935000 new jobs were created in the state during his tenure as Governor and that the state was doing better than the national average Mr ORourke argued that New York was not doing as well as New Jersey and Connecticut The two candidates also clashed over publicauthority borrowing not directly controlled by the governor which was up by 40 percent or 10 billion in the last four years Mr Cuomo said he was not overly concerned about this because of reassurances by State Comptroller Edward V Regan a Republican among others Mr ORourke said the growing debt was worrisome and added that some state highway building should be financed by an earmarked tax presumably on gasoline A Spirited Exchange That touched off a spirited exchange in which Mr Cuomo said he would have no part of a gasoline tax but then in response to questions by the panel of three Times reporters declined initially to rule out such a tax to finance mass transit Im not ruling out a gas tax for the MTA the Governor said referring to the need for new revenues for the Metropolitan Transportation Authority to finance transit borrowing if the current fares are maintained A few seconds later he said I am opposed to a gas tax anywhere Asked how he would pay for the transit capital program he said I dont know I have no idea Thats what Felix Rohatyn is working on Mr Rohatyn is the cochairman of his fiscal advisory panel Im sorry the Governor said Im not going to recklessly invent a scenario because its neat to write about

EXCERPTS FROM DEBATE BY CANDIDATES FOR NEW YORK GOVERNOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/nyregion/excerpts-from-debate-by-candidates-for-new-york-governor.html,Following are excerpts from a debate yesterday at The New York Times among candidates in Tuesdays election for Governor of New York Governor Cuomo DemocratLiberal Andrew P ORourke RepublicanConservative and Denis E Dillon Right to Life Ethics Charges Q Weve heard a lot of charges and countercharges about each others character particularly the Governor and Mr ORourke so we thought maybe wed clear the air to start this out First with the Governor Governor do you have any facts  we know youve talked about disclosure and things like that but do you have any facts that would indicate that Mr ORourke as a county legislator and a lawyer was guilty of either conflict of interest or anything illegal Either unethical or illegal CUOMO No and as a matter of fact I insisted from the beginning of the campaign that people understand that when I made a request for disclosure it wasnt designed to suggest anything about Mr ORourke or Mr Dillon or any of us I think disclosure is important for the people of this state I think that we could have here established a new precedent  not only the debate and the fullest possible disclosure by all candidates I think weve made some strides along those lines The fact is when Mr ORourke agreed to show his income tax returns and Mr Dillon previously had done that that was the first time to my knowledge in the history of the state that every candidate for major office the first time in 200 years  that every candidate for major office had made that kind of disclosure I would assume given the tenacity and the long memory of the press that you will insist that that be a precedent in 1990 and I think thats a good thing But no I never suggested anything untoward about Mr ORourkes conduct I was interested in disclosure for disclosures sake Q In the spirit of disclosure would you disclose the honoraria that you have received as Governor for speeches outside your office as Governor considering that there is a potential conflict there that you could be speaking before some group interested in legislation CUOMO I think its not inaccurate to say that Ive led the way in disclosure for 12 years I drafted  helped draft  Hugh Careys first disclosure order Ive disclosed everything for 12 years far beyond what the law required I have shown my tax returns and said here I would exchange tax returns with Andy ORourke and the honoraria the minute he agreed to do it The reason I didnt give the honoraria is I had nothing else to leverage with So yes I have no problem in making the same kind of frankly unprecedented disclosure that I have for 12 years  Q Mr ORourke to ask the same kind of question do you have any facts that would indicate that the Governor was in any way linked with the Queens corruption or that Andrew Cuomo in any way acted illegally or unethically as an attorney OROURKE    What Ive said about the Governor from the beginning was not that I charged him personally with any venality I never had and I never will What I said was if he knew something he should have done something and if he didnt know anything then people have to take that into account but from my own experience I found it very difficult to believe that you could live in the political arena and not hear something But I would certainly accept the fact that if the Governor said if he didnt hear anything or rumors or anything that thats what happened As to Andrew I never said a word about him other than I think somebody talked about client lists one day and I said If youre really after client lists you ought to look at those people that have attachment to the Governor whose clients work with the state   Q Why dont you release your client list and just end this subject once and for all Clients that do business with the county lets be more specific OROURKE I have said so many times and the Governor knows this to my knowledge This is a breakthrough ready    Ive gone back and asked my former partners to search their own memories about anyone who did business with the County of Westchester And to the best of their knowledge plus mine there were no such cases    Q I dont mean to be rude here but I cant believe this is the same gubernatorial campaign we were in last week This whole campaign has been based on charges flying back and forth Governor you said I didnt mean to suggest he has done anything untoward but the whole campaign has been based on suggesting something untoward Whats happened CUOMO Well lets be precise Can you show me one place one statement I made and if so Ill apologize to you  you show me a place where I suggested that Andy was doing something illegal or wrong I said he was wrong  lets be precise  I said he was wrong for not revealing and I repeat it  I dont know anything about Andy ORourke that I would suggest would be an act of dishonesty    Grand Jury Reform Q In 1982 the Governor running for governor proposed to eliminate grand juries and replace them in most felony cases with a hearing before a judge    Now four years later theres been no change in the grand jury system and in fact grand juries continue as as Judge Wachtler put it along in their way indicting ham sandwiches Could you each of us beginning with District Attorney Dillon tell us your current position on this proposal to replace grand juries in most cases with a hearing before a judge DILLON Well theres no question but that the grand jury in most cases doesnt perform the historical function it was designed to perform It is sort of a pro forma body before which the prosecutor places his evidence And the evidence is there and its already been judged by the prosecutor its sufficient They return an indictment I think its important however that we retain the grand jury for use in investigations I think the grand jury has a very important role to play in terms of longterm investigations of organized crime and whitecollar crime and that type of thing    CUOMO I think Deniss position is a good one Its consistent with what I said in 1982 We have had discussions There has not been a whole lot of movement in the Legislature on it it has been busy with some other things like the states RICO and other changes But its a subject that we should continue to pursue I think the reform would be a worthwhile one OROURKE I wouldnt monkey around with the grand jury system I think it works Warts and all I think its part of the great system of criminal justice we inherited in this country and we made it even better over here I think though that you have to take that into account when you look at the fact that last year considering all of the people we had involved in drug cases in the state of New York  and we had special prosecutors in New York City etc etc  there were only 236 drug cases actually tried Apparently the cops are doing their job out there making an awful lot of arrests Something is happening in the court system We arent trying enough cases and part of the 20point program that we put forth in this campaign  and while Im sure that the Governor didnt take any of our positions some of them happened afterwards like the appointment of more judges and things like that I think you have to look at this criminal justice system very carefully and find out why we are spending so much money in this way why it is that the results are so poor  Paying for Education Q Weve had a 40 percent increase in education spending in this state Do you think weve gotten our moneys worth OROURKE    We spend a tremendous amount on education in this state  second only I believe to California Yet we are not getting the kind of response that we need I remember a time when if you said you were a graduate of the New York school system it really meant something And I dont believe it means that much anymore We have apparently two million functional illiterates out there  forgetting whether theyre computerready or not by the year 2000 We have to start training people in reading writing and arithmetic I believe in report cards for schools letting us know where they stand on things I think there should be an inspector general in the school system I think the Governor should appoint the Regents Q What would the inspector general do and what can a Governor generally do other than throwing money at the problem OROURKE You know theres nothing wrong with that if the money is being well spent It apparently is not being that well spent I think an inspector general who reported back to the Governor and the Legislature and the people and was independent from the school system and just went out to look and see whats going on  find out how many computers never get out of the crates how many teachers never turn up how many temporary teachers cant pass exams things like that  CUOMO Im a little confused If we should stay out of it why should we appoint the Regents You cant have it both ways Andy I think the Governor should of course be involved How could you not be involved if youre the leader of this state and the subject of education which as Ive said has to be the No 1 priority    On illiteracy its not enough to take a test We know they cant read Were spending 37 million in various programs thats part of that heavy spending that this state is doing a 42 percent increase special teachers special targeted programs bilingual approaches to give them access to the English language teaching people who are on welfare to be literate so that they can get the most  the simplest kind of jobs and get themselves off welfare giving 95 million more to the teachers of this state so that they have the incentives to teach illiterate children  which is not an easy thing to do because some of them are in advanced grades Theres a lot we have to do a lot the Governor can do Now I did have a confrontation if you will with the Board of Regents and what I said was that we are spending 42 percent more money I want to see some evidence that were making progress There is some lets be candid    There are problems in pockets in this state that are disproportionate that are horrible in their inadequacy It would be wrong to say were not making some progress It would be wrong in my opinion to say that were making enough progress It would be wrong to say that the Governor ought not to be involved Should he command the whole education area In some states they do Are we ready for that I think not We have an established system of Regents for 200 years I want to study how we can change it  DILLON Id just like to add something to that The Governors Association back in August came out with a report They had studied the school systems throughout the country They suggested more of a role for government They suggested that legislation be sought in the various states whereby the governor would have the authority to oversee the local school districts and then to identify those that seem to be falling behind or not really educating young people the way they should try to give them as much help as could be according to established norms and then when a school district just cant see to make it to be able to declare that school district bankrupt and come in and actually oversee education in the school district until it was at a plane that is acceptable And I thought that was a very good plan Q Intellectually bankrupt or financially bankrupt DILLON Intellectually bankrupt that was the term they used in the report City Schools Q Do you think that extraordinary measures should be taken by the state as far as New York City education that New York City education is in such bad shape OROURKE I think that all of us would agree that the school system in New York has come upon very difficult times    And to grasp that you just have to look at the dropout rate and the crime rate in the schools the fact that up until a few years ago  and I think it is changing slightly  we were just pumping kids out of school whether they had any idea of what they were doing And I think a massive effort is necessary in New York City It has to be run in the main by the city    CUOMO Let me try to sharpen that focus just a little bit First of all again we have school districts like 26 in Queens that are very successful that are national leaders So there are parts of the city education program that are working very well There are other parts in areas where there are special vulnerabilities groups who are disoriented or for one reason or another in a particular kind of trouble Do we need to do more there Yes of course Just to get our perspective clear remember we were bankrupt in 75 Remember 76 and 77 We were barely sure wed have a city We had to plead for enough money just to keep the place alive We didnt make a whole lot of progress in our educational establishment in the 70s to the early 80s Were just beginning I think to make a move in the city of New York A lot of things have to be done The best thing I think to do besides making the teachers stronger  thats what the excellence program and the scholarships of excellence program and the 95 million was for  is to get to these students give them more motivation  I think that you have a lot of broken families you have a lot of latchkey kids We can make more of the school building as a facility in some especially weakened areas deteriorated areas Take the school building open it earlier to preK  more money for preK kids extend its use to the end of the day 6 7 8 9 oclock at night Keep the kids in the school if the parents want them to remain Give them special instruction recreation let them play basketball in social services in that building Were going to do that on a demonstration basis Ive agreed with the Regents on that proposal    Q Mr ORourke what do you think about the plan the Governor has seized on to expand the school day greatly  8 or 9 oclock in innercity schools OROURKE For a gentleman who wants to keep his hands out of education he apparently isnt I dont think that its something that I would take a position on without seeing and talking to some educators about it    If its a good idea maybe its worthwhile trying State Spending Q Governor your administration has increased spending over 40 percent more than twice the rate of inflation Sometimes youve said thats a good thing Other times youve said its the Republicans And no matter whos responsible isnt that an awfully large increase in state spending CUOMO State spending over the last four years is approximately a 42 percent increase thats far above inflation Its also the lowest in the Northeast    Is it spending or is it wasteful Is it for a social adventure Lets tell you where the spending went and see if anybody argues with it here Maybe somebody here will step forward as the Republicans refused to at my invitation to tell me where they thought the spending should be reduced Heres where the spending goes Over 61 percent of it goes to Andy and the local governments Over 61 percent About 20 percent goes to state operations The increase in state operations was in criminal justice  for prisons for prosecutors for personnel The secondlargest increase was in road and bridges the Rebuild New York bond issue Because bridges were in danger of falling We saved 200 lives its estimated last year    And of course the education budget OK Fortytwo percent    If you take out criminaljustice personnel that I had to add Id be down 2400 over four years    Now I wanted an expenditure cap I think you have to contain spending My budget incidentally as proposed is lower than the spending It was increased by the Legislature I could theoretically have lineitem vetoed I have that power the President does not They would have overridden it as they did Hugh Carey so I didnt do that But theres no question that the spending should now be contained over the next four years Weve done the roads and bridges weve done the criminal justice Ive proposed an expenditure cap Am I on the other hand embarrassed at the spending that we made No sir Because no one has stepped forward and suggested to me You shouldnt have spent that money on criminal justice You shouldnt have spent more on the homeless you shouldnt have spent it on education    OROURKE Well of course the Governor says that we get a percentage of it back and I think he forgets that 100 percent comes from us in the beginning CUOMO Thats true OROURKE And so weve lost 60 percent somehow or 50 percent in the process As to the bond issue I mean every time you go out and bond something  whether its the Rebuild New York bond which I supported you and I stood on the same platform together and supported that or the environmental bond issue  and let me say something nonpartisan I hope whoever you vote for for Governor you all support the environmental bond issue That only proves that the State of New York hasnt done much in those areas over a period of time    Expenditure cap We could have one today All we need is a Governor thats going to say Ill lineitem veto We need a Governor whos not going to give in to the Legislature on member items I mean this is like the Praetorian Guard getting donatives from the Emperor every year Everybody gets a little something around the State of New York That would save 100 million probably right there Q But Mr ORourke you havent fared any better in Westchester The fact of the matter is the Westchester budget has gone up 50 percent youve raised property taxes 20 percent Why should you think youd be better as a governor OROURKE One of the reasons why I decided to run for governor was I became convinced that this great engine of our economy is driven through Albany Westchester County has 2600 individual mandates on it from the state of New York Last year without even asking us they said Well youre going to pay another 3 million in MTA So be it we paid it They told us Were going to give you a veterans package like it or lump it But if you opt into it its going to cost you money We sign the bills up there and you pay the bill down in Westchester County Thats the reason why local government taxes go up And I believe that everybody who serves in Albany should serve a while in local government Theyd find out who has to pay the bills CUOMO    But in the end it comes down to this with all of this spending you have to make a decision What is your government about    Prisons happened homeless happened teenage pregnancy programs happened educating children happened Now you have to make a judgment as a people Are you for it or against it Do you believe in a government that makes missiles and leaves everybody to their own devices Or do you believe in a government that can help a little bit intelligently OROURKE Lets talk about what bonding is all about We are paying for yesterdays sins with tomorrows money thats really what were doing  And I believe the way you do that is to commit yourselves on a state basis to looking very carefully and not bonding anything except what is ultimately important and every year putting more and more into the operating account so that part of this ultimately gets paid off out of operating money Give you an example  let me finish this up itll just take a second I supported the roads but we need a dedicated highway tax every year to keep the roads up so you dont have to go back and borrow money sometime in the future CUOMO Please let me disassociate myself from that highway tax Andy ORourke is telling the people of this state he wants a highway which means a gas tax Im against it    New Taxes Q Governor do you rule out a gas tax to pay for the MTA capital program renewal CUOMO Im not ruling out a gas tax for the MTA I have put the whole Q You just said you were opposed to a gas tax CUOMO Im opposed to a gas tax for a highway fund Im opposed to a gas tax anywhere in the region Im not ruling out or ruling in anything on the MTA because Ive assigned that whole matter to Felix Rohatyn    and Ive asked them to put together a plan and to report to us in the Legislature when we come back I dont want to start making decisions presumptuously after I asked them to do that for me But yes I am opposed to a gas tax Q How will you pay for the MTA capital program CUOMO I dont know I have no idea Thats what Felix Rohatyn is working on Q So Governor youre telling us here that youll return the tax windfall but you wont tell us how youre telling us therell be a revenue increase to pay for the MTA but you wont tell us where CUOMO Absolutely correct Q The rent stablization is being reviewed you wont tell us  CUOMO No no lets go slowly On the windfall Ive explained to you that even if I wanted to give the money back you wouldnt know until 1988 So Im not refusing to tell you I dont have a secret plan    No 2 as to the MTA package we have an objective keep the fare until 1990 find a way to finance the MTA No I dont have a way to do it I dont know even what theyre going to suggest Well have to do it by the end of this year    Rent stabilization A report comes in in December of this year I have said publicly on two occasions that Ill wait to read the report I believe rent stabilization must be extended Landlords are unhappy about that I understand that I would suspect it should be extended for more than two years Ive made that public statement three or four times Q Governor isnt it incumbent on a man who wants to be Governor for a second term to tell the voters where he stands on such important things as taxes CUOMO I did tell you about taxes I gave you the biggest tax cut in history I said the windfall should go back There are governors  go to California and ask the two candidates there what theyre going to do with the windfall Theres been no answer yet Are you going to keep it for social purposes Are you going to spend it on your budget Ive told you I was the first to tell you Now youre asking me something I dont know Warren Anderson doesnt know Ned Regan doesnt know Shearson Express doesnt know Felix Rohatyn doesnt know how to do it No Im sorry And Im not going to recklessly invent a scenario because its neat to write about In Summary Q Would each of you sum up in two minutes what you want people to recall as they go to the polls on Tuesday DILLON I indicated when I declared my candidacy for this race that I thought that abortion was the most important humanrights issue facing us in the country today And I believe that the Governor of New York despite what was said here today could end public funding of abortions in this state The Harris v McRae case in the United States Supreme Court is very persuasive authority that public funding of abortions does not have to be And I believe that any Governor who believes that abortion kills human life or something so close to human life that it should not be disposed of casually would set up a precise test case to see whether the killing of human life is necessary funded by our tax money in this state And I would call upon the Governor to do that I would also remind him that the Catholic Church does not teach what is human life The Catholic Church teaches moral principles Science tells us that human life begins at conception human life is present at the womb All the Catholic Church does is apply the moral principle that once was universally accepted accepted even by pagan societies and that is that its always wrong to deliberately kill human life People who are prolife I ask them when they go to the polls on Tuesday in this particular election vote prolife vote an identifiable prolife vote    CUOMO I think most of us would agree that the state has made progress over the last four years I think the things that we dispute about are precisely what is the extent of that progress how is it relative to the rest of the country the rest of the region who gets the credit for it and who is best equipped to continue the progress and to enhance it I think the case for the progress being very strong even relatively is a good solid one The credit the credit does not go to the Governor It doesnt go to the Legislature It goes to everybody together This is a collective enterprise The Governor is supposed to show some leadership Weve tried We led this nation in the deductibility fight we tried on 21yearold purchase we tried with initiatives And I think Ive done that job adequately But obviously the Legislature makes the budgets The Legislature deserves credit for the tax cut just as I do Who can do it better Ive worked as hard as I could possibly work over the last four years Ive made some mistakes I think Ive done some things right I think Im stronger now than I was four years ago better able because of my experience of the last four years to do a good job in the four years ahead and I think Im the best equipped of the three to make futher progress  OROURKE    My belief is there are two great imperatives that must be answered in this race for governor one is the revitalization of the State of New York Were in competition not only with other states but with countries for talent for jobs for opportunity And I think its very important that we get the government of this state going forward And I dont think it has The second great imperative is the control of crime Because if society doesnt control crime then its done nothing And so I hope the day will soon come when we make meaningful progress against the drug dealers and against violent crime and against political corruption all throughout the state of New York And I think we can do it I pledge myself if I am lucky enough to be governor of this state to put in the same dedication and energy and enthusiasm and problemsolving ability that Ive had as county executive and in the 22 years of my public service But Id like to take a moment to tell you that running for governor is an exhilarating experience especially if you participate fully in the debates that go to make up the political process And I think weve seen here today that if wed debated earlier perhaps it mightve been better We couldve talked a lot about other issues I know Ive certainly learned a lot about the state of New York a lot about its people and a lot about myself    USE THESE FOR BITTEN GRAFS     
"G.O.P. FIELDS STAR IN COLORADO, SEEKING ANY EDGE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/us/gop-fields-star-in-colorado-seeking-any-edge.html,For several weeks White House political operatives have been arguing that in the final days of this years campaign President Reagan would be able to add two or three percentage points to the vote for Republican candidates in close races pulling them through and keeping control of the Senate in Republican hands Today in a speech at Colorado Springs Mr Reagan put that theory to perhaps its most important test for the second time urging Coloradans to choose Representative Ken Kramer over his Democratic rival Representative Timothy E Wirth They are in a nailbitingly close race to succeed Senator Gary Hart who is retiring to seek the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988 If Mr Reagan is going to do it anywhere he ought to be able to it here Republican officials concede And there is no race anywhere more crucial to Republican hopes of holding the Democrats to a net gain of three Senate seats or less which would perpetuate Republican control through the final two years of the Reagan Presidency GOP Seeks to Unseat 2 Most Republicans concede that the Democrats will pick up four or five seats that are Republican now so the Republicans chances probably depend on picking up at least two seats that the Democrats now hold Going into the final weekend of the contest former Gov Christopher Bond leads for the seat of retiring Senator Thomas F Eagleton in Missouri But late polls indicate that the Republicans are likely to fall short of the gains they had hoped for in Louisiana and California So as things now stand a great deal depends on Colorado where Mr Wirth and Mr Kramer have been trading illtempered charges in person and on television since shortly after Labor Day Each man has held narrow leads for a few days only to lose it according to The Denver Posts tracking poll Mr Reagans arrival in the state today coincided with the emergence of a small fragile trend to the Democratic candidate nothing decisive to be sure but perhaps a straw in the crosswinds here The Post poll which produces new totals each day showed a twopoint Kramer lead on Monday a onepoint Wirth lead on Tuesday a threepoint Wirth lead on Wednesday and a fourpoint Wirth lead today The number of undecided voters has been falling steadily and stood at only 7 percent on Wednesday About 600 likely voters are included in each sample with a margin of sampling error of plus or minus four percentage points That makes any single days findings this week inconclusive but the trend could have real significance Even Short Duration Mr Reagans first visit last month produced a small shortlived surge for Mr Kramer This time such a surge would not have to be very big or with Election Day so close very longlasting to decide the final outcome In a tacit acknowledgement of Mr Reagans popularity here Mr Wirth took fullpage newspaper ads this morning to list four major bills that Mr Kramer voted against but Mr Reagan signed He concluded by telling Mr Reagan I truly look forward to working with you as a US Senator The tenor of the campaign was neatly summarized in an exchange in one of the candidates debates Mr Wirth told Mr Kramer You talk about a spending freeze and making the courageous decisions But you have never met a weapons system that you didnt like Mr Kramer replied If I have never met a weapoms system I didnt like then you have never met a deficit or an appropriations bill or a tax increase you didnt like Running Mate Is Strong Representative Wirth is clearly the more articulate and the betterknown of the two candidates He has managed to spend almost as much money on television advertising as his opponent He has the stronger gubernatorial running mate in Ray R Romer who appears to be well ahead of Ted L Strickland a Republican And unlike Mr Kramer he has achieved a national reputation he was rated one of the 25 most influential House members by this years Almanac of American Politics But Mr Wirth is a liberal and Mr Kramer a conservative in a steadily more conservative state Colorado gave Mr Reagan 63 percent of its vote in 1984 and Senator William L Armstrong a conservative Republican 64 percent in the same year Mr Hart won by fewer than 20000 votes four years earlier Mr Kramer moreover has proved to be a much more dogged and less erratic candidate through most of the campaign than many expected His television commercials hammer home the contention that Mr Wirth is too big a spender one currently on the air shows four unidentified voters saying things like I dont want Tim Wirth spending my money for me and Tim Wirth represents big government Response to Main Theme The Republicans two biggest issues are his support for Mr Reagans missilesinspace program and a constitutional amendment decreeing a balanced budget In that sense he is an ideal nominee for the President to help because Mr Reagans main theme as he traveled through the South last week and stumps in the West this week is the need for a Republican Senate to restrain spending and give him the freedom to pursue the kind of nationalsecurity policies he defended in Iceland With candidate spending relatively even Mr Kramer has benefited from radio and television commercials sponsored by a number of national organizations the National Conservative Political Action Committee the American Conservative Trust the National Rifle Association antiabortion groups and the Realtors Political Action Committee which has spent more than 300000 in Colorado But the Republicans ultraconservative backing has also backfired on occasion ad it did on Wednesday when State Senator Martha Ezzard one of the Republican candidates whom Mr Kramer defeated for his partys nomination appeared at a Wirth fundraisign luncheon and created a local sensation by attacking the activities of the radical far right and by implication those of Mr Kramer Issue of Missile Money Mr Kramer himself gave Mr Wirth the largest opening of the campaign on Oct 15 when he said he would be willing to spend 1 trillion in the next 25 years on the program for missiles in space That would amount to 40 billion a year more than 10 times the amount Congress agreed to spend last year but the Republican said the money could be found by making heavy cuts in offensive weapons Mr Wirth has pounced upon the issue asserting that Mr Kramers plan would force the dismantling of most of the nations offensive weapons systems conventional as well as nuclear Although Mr Kramer later disavowed the 1 trillion figure reporters for both Denver newspapers and several local television stations have said that they heard him do so and the figure was widely reported on Oct 16
SURVEY FINDS NO BIG COLLEGE SWING TO RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/us/survey-finds-no-big-college-swing-to-right.html,The results of a new survey rebut the idea that college students have become politically more conservative The study shows a move to the center and a continuation of liberal views on specific issues such as abortion the environment and taxing the wealthy The survey made public today shows that while the number of students who identify themselves as liberals today has shrunk by a third from the number in 1970 the total who describe themselves as conservatives has held relatively steady 15 to 20 percent with a net gain of 24 percentage points since 1970 The report American Freshmen 20Year Trends was prepared by the Higher Education Research Institute at the University of California at Los Angeles and the American Council on Education It records from 1966 to last year the educational achievements attitudes and goals of freshmen at almost 600 colleges and universities around the country The survey covered 300000 freshmen last year Center Identification Rises The number of freshmen describing themselves as political centrists has increased about 11 percentage points from 454 percent in 1970 to 567 percent last year The number of students describing themselves as liberal stands at 224 percent But most students continue to support traditionally liberal political and social values For instance 605 percent of last years freshmen supported national health insurance 733 percent favored legal abortion and 78 percent approved of greater Government involvement in protecting the environment In another area of concern almost half the freshmen surveyed last year said they decided to attend college largely to improve their reading ability despite an overall increase in high school grades over 20 years according to the report Underpreparation Is Stressed The reality is there is a lot of underpreparation of students for college these days said Prof Alexander W Astin at a news conference on the report this morning Professor Astin who teaches at the University of California at Los Angeles is director of its Higher Education Research Institute In the poll last year 11 percent of freshmen said they would need tutoring in a specific subject almost double the number in 1971 the first year this question was asked Last year 405 percent of the students said improving reading and study skills was an important reason for their attending college In 1971 this figure was 22 percent Professor Astin said that while most of these students were not illiterate many were considered marginal in their ability to read and write Theres no way we can avoid assuming some responsibility for training these students he said Grade Inflation Is Noted The report notes that electives such as band have pushed up high school grades at the same time that colleges have found a decrease in academic competence Grade inflation in which the number of A students in high schools is greater than the total of C students the report says is another symptom of declining academic skills Evidence suggests that todays students are very reluctant to undertake courses of study in college that challenge their academic skills Elaine ElKhawas a vice president of the American Council on Education suggested that colleges work with local high schools to move their curriculums away from soft subjects Liberal arts disciplines the report says have witnessed what can only described as a bear market Some individual fields showed especially sharp declines the report said Mathematics and statistics for example lost more than 80 percent of their students English has also declined by nearly 80 percent over the past 20 years More Majors in Business More students are passing up liberal arts degrees to major in business with 257 percent of men and 238 percent of women surveyed last year planning a business career In 1966 173 percent of men and 109 percent of women planned to major in business The choice of business and to a lesser extent computer science and engineering is often based on a desire for higher pay the report indicates The surveys show that 70 percent of last years freshmen considered being welloff financially important as against 40 percent 10 years ago And 70 percent said a major reason for attending college was to increase earning power as against 50 percent in the early 1970s Kenneth C Green associate director of the research institute said college students emphasis on money and status had developed from coming of age in a time of severe economic upheaval This is not something they saw on the evening news Mr Green said This is something they experienced firsthand They have adopted the attitude he said that Im not going to let this happen to me
BIRTH ADVICE IN SCHOOLS CONDEMNED BY BENNETT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/nyregion/birth-advice-in-schools-condemned-by-bennett.html,The United States Secretary of Education charged yesterday that the New York City Board of Education had made a bad decision in offering birthcontrol counseling in nine high school health clinics The Secretary William J Bennett told a luncheon audience in Manhattan that such programs encouraged sexual promiscuity among teenagers and constituted an abdication of moral responsibility by adults This sort of thing is a local matter but my own feeling is that it is a mistake he said It undermines the efforts of others who are trying to send a different message to young people The board president Robert F Wagner Jr who had introduced Mr Bennett rose to defend the citys policy He said the counseling was conducted as part of a comprehensive healthcare program that emphasized the importance of abstinence and saying no Clinics in 60 Schools This month a staff report by the board disclosed that clinics in nine schools had been providing abortion counseling and birthcontrol information Two of the clinics distributed contraceptives to students who had their parents consent to use the clinics According to the Center for Population Options of Washington a group that seeks to prevent unwanted pregnancies among teenagers more than 60 high schools around the nation have clinics providing comprehensive health care and at least 10 of them dispense contraceptives In the wake of the controversy the Board of Education has banned the distribution of contraceptives but let the nine clinics to continue to operate for six months while the issue is debated Mr Wagner took issue with Mr Bennetts assertion that education about birth control encouraged sexual activity The best reviews that we know of he said show that with such programs not only does the number of pregnancies go down but there is a significant delay in sexual activity Plea for Moral Literacy The exchange was at a luncheon of the Manhattan Institute a conservative research group at the Harvard Club at 27 West 44th Street It followed a 30minute talk by Mr Bennett urging schools across the country to emphasize not only academic subjects but also moral literacy Most Americans want their schools to help form the character of their children Mr Bennett declared Moreover he said there is a good deal of consensus on such specific traits as thoughtfulness fidelity honesty fairness selfdiscipline and respect for law that the teaching should foster The Secretary appealed to educators not to let the fear of controversy over such issues as nuclear war abortion or creationism stand in the way of efforts to promote formation of character in their students We should teach values the same way we teach other things  one step at a time he said We do not argue against teaching physics because laser physics is difficult Every field has its complexities and controversies And every field has its basics So the moral basics should be taught in school first The tough issues can if teachers and parents wish be taken up later And I would add a person who is morally literate will be immeasurably better equipped than a morally illiterate person to reach a reasoned and ethically defensible position on tough issues Since becoming the countrys top education official in February 1985 Mr Bennett has frequently appealed for more attention to the teaching of values including religious ones in public schools Because curriculums are under the control of state and local boards of education Mr Bennett has no authority over such matters However even critics concede that he has made effective use of the bully pulpit that he occupies to push educational policies consistent with the philosophy of the Reagan Administration
POLITICS GETS PERSONAL IN LOUISIANA'S 8th CONGRESSIONAL DISTRICT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/31/us/politics-gets-personal-in-louisiana-s-8th-congressional-district.html,In the battered studio of radio station KCLF a tiny AM channel in this little town on an old coil of the Mississippi River Clyde Holloway a conservative white nurseryman who is the Republican candidate for Louisianas Eighth Congressional District was taping an interview this afternoon to be broadcast to the 25000 people who live within the reach of the stations signal He was talking about sex race murder and patriotism or the lack of it He was talking about his opponent Faye Williams a Democrat a woman and a lawyer who stands a strong chance of becoming the first black person to be elected to the House of Representatives from Louisiana since Reconstruction I dont say Faye is a Communist Mr Holloway said  I dont even say she has a radical following We just dont know A Shooting in Los Angeles He had reached this point in the interview after discussing an event that occurred more than 15 years ago in Los Angeles where Ms Williams was then in graduate school Her estranged husband Stan Duke a black television broadcaster from whom she had filed for divorce had broken into her house beaten her and shot to death the man she had been seeing Averill Berman a white college professor and prominent political activist The part that worries me about her past is not the love affair Mr Holloway said The part that concerns me is that the guy who was killed was a known Communist in the Los Angeles area The old saying out in the street is that if you sleep with a dog you get fleas In Louisiana politics gets personal Two weeks ago The Alexandria Daily Town Talk  my hometown paper Ms Williams says drily  published an editorial that served up the facts of the shooting along with the advice that a candidates personal life relinquishes part of its shroud of privacy when one seeks public office There had been no public mention of the incident in the long primary campaign when Ms Williams returned from law school and a job in Washington to face Mr Holloway and four white men who are Democrats in an open primary election Not until almost three weeks after Ms Williams finished first in that primary did the newspaper publish what she had chosen not to mention A Matter of Public Record After all Ms Williams said she was a victim of the crime not a criminal I didnt see it as having any relevance in the campaign she added All my friends knew about it It was a matter of public record Faced with a choice of talking publicly about the incident when she announced her candidacy or of letting it lie in the record until someone brought it up she said she chose the latter Ms Williams said her friends and advisers knowing the way we play politics in Louisiana were concerned about the incident But I never knew anyone would make a racial appeal or an unAmerican appeal out of it she said She also said she was convinced that that was what raised the issue Sure it was she said That was the whole intent of it This is Mr Holloways third attempt at the Congressional seat He lost once to Gillis Long its veteran Demcoratic occupant and then to Mr Longs wife Cathy in a special election held last spring after Mr Longs death It is the first attempt for Ms Williams a native of Alexandria who has not lived there for 20 years but has maintained her legal residence there her aides say District Has a Liberal Cast I always wanted to run for public office she said but it was not until Mrs Longs decision not to run again coincided with Ms Williamss graduation from Howard Law School last year at the age of 43 that she decided to run for the House The Eighth Congressional District wanders down and across central and southern Louisiana and its majority population of blacks and Cajuns descendants of the Acadians who migrated here two centuries ago give it a liberal Democratic cast Ms Williams urban and elegant in manner and Mr Holloway slow and neighborly in delivery could hardly be more different Dr Berman she said referring to the victim of the shooting 15 years ago was simply a dear sweet friend who taught me a lot and thats the way Ill always remember him The facts the voters should be concerned with she said are that we have the highest unemployment rate the highest illiteracy rate the highest dropout rate the highest welfare rate and the secondhighest teenage pregnancy rate in the nation She Was Sent in Here Mr Holloway is suspicious I just believe she was sent in here to run for Congress he said I dont know whether it was the Black Congressional Caucus who sent her to run or the NAACP His newspaper ads call him conservative prolife and endorsed by President Reagan They describe her as ultraliberal proabortion for gay rights for gun control Mr Holloway plucked his Communist label of Dr Berman from a 1948 California State Senate FactFinding Committee on UnAmerican Activities If his use of that old episode backfires with the voters he said God help me Im going to buy a few acres of land in Australia Maybe we can fight them off the coast His pollster Verne R Kennedy of the Marketing Research Institute in Jackson Miss declined to release any information about voter support saying it was too close to the election But Ms Williams who has been publicly embraced by Mrs Long seems to be leading Her pollster Robert S Miller of Miller  Associates a market research firm in Baton Rouge said nightly telephone surveys of 400 voters showed that Ms Williams was the choice of 47 to 49 percent of those polled while Mr Holloways support was in the low 30s Fortyfour percent of her supporters were for Ms Williams even though they recalled the basic elements of the old murder Mr Miller added But that event is not what is moving the districts voters Mr Miller continued What is moving them is race The biggest gain in Clyde Holloways vote is among white Democratic voters who are just now finding out that Faye Williams is black Mr Miller said She has the support of about 30 percent of the whites in the district he said and about 99 percent of the blacks
EDUCATION WATCH; TEACHING ABOUT SEX IN AN EXPLICIT SOCIETY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/weekinreview/education-watch-teaching-about-sex-in-an-explicit-society.html,WHEN Frances Schaefer introduces her Brooklyn eighth graders to their sex education course she asks them to write questions they have about themselves their family their friends A common question said Ms Schaefer a gently spoken 17year veteran of the school system is How do you say no to your boyfriend without hurting his feelings Such questions  to which she responds with notions of individual responsiblity and selfrespect  give her the perfect chance she said to infuse moral values into the classroom Sex education a sensitive subject to teach at the best of times has been the focus of much attention at the New York City Board of Education in the last several months Beginning in the next school year the board has ruled it is to be taught in all grades from kindergarten through high school although parents may keep their children out of classes A few states including New Jersey and Maryland have mandatory sex education courses but New York Citys 301page curriculum officials say is one of the most comprehensive in the country A revamped version of a curriculum written in 1969 it contains detailed explanations of contraceptives and abortion the stages of pregnancy and for junior high and high schools information on AIDS There is a section on other sexually transmitted diseases and one on sexual abuse of children There is more information than just plumbing said Charlotte Frank director of the boards division of curriculum and instruction The curriculum has to respond to a more explicit society Ms Frank said the central theme of the program which was written at a time of steadily increasing teenage pregnancies is selfrespect She summed it up by a quote in the manual from the Rev Jesse Jackson You are not a man just because you made a baby You are a man because you raise a baby and provide for a baby An Early Start Written by a committee of teachers and doctors the curriculum begins in prekindergarten classes with lessons identifying such emotional experiences as happy sad angry In the early grades one assignment asks children to discuss with family members their reasons for having a family By grades 5 and 6 physical changes at puberty are outlined and the human reproductive system described It is in these grades that such terms as sperm testes penis ovum uterus vagina tampon and sanitary napkin are defined In junior high school the lesson plans deal with subjects that students see and hear every day on television and in films Emotional and physical changes during puberty are described different kinds of families such as those headed by a single parent are discussed along with the responsibility for raising a child For the first time contraception and the options for an unplanned pregnancy are explored By high school under the rubric starting and maintaining a family involves responsibility there are more detailed descriptions of birth control and abortion methods and the importance of the family in society A recent class at West Side High School in Manhattan was largely devoted to the effectiveness of different kinds of contraceptives A diaphragm was passed around the class as students wrote answers  the class is also intended to improve writing skills  to such questions as Why is it important to know about contraception Ms Schaefer who has a masters degree in psychology with a major in human sexuality has unusually high qualifications for teaching the course The majority of the teachers are health education or physical education instructors who do not always feel as comfortable as Ms Schaefer although all of them undergo training organized by the Board of Education Ms Schaefer who teaches at IHS 293 in Boerum Hill applies a sense of humor to the job In class I dont teach masturbation but discuss its existence she said I give scientific information and tell them no one ever died from not doing it She can also be matteroffact In class the other day in the context of dating we were talking about a persons right to control of ones body One of the boys asked What if she says she cant go any further and you cant stop yourself What is that I said That is rape He looked at me as though it was not the answer he expected Jerry Stoopack the assistant principal for health and physical education at Seward Park High School on the Lower East Side said Its easy to teach the biology Its hard to teach about making choices He added Anyone who says this is what you should or shouldnt do loses a lot of kids Mr Stoopack must also consider the differing cultural traditions of his students At Seward Park there are many newly arrived Asians When youre talking about the elements of mature behavior he said a kid may point out that even though she is in this country her parents are going to choose who she will be

ABOUT MEN; The Clinic,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/magazine/about-men-the-clinic.html,THERE IS NOTHING HERE TO suggest that this is in any way a mans place Though we men have been equal partners in the act itself though the throbbing nearlyhuman thing whose life is about to be prematurely expunged is of our own blood nothing suggests that we have had anything at all to do with this choice The waiting room is filled almost entirely with women  women alone women with other women women attendants doctors nurses and counselors who float in and out of the room occasionally calling out for a Miss Brownstein or a Miss Doyle and then accompanying the named client down a corridor to what The Clinics literature calls the procedure I have been here before Not to this particular clinic but to one just like it in Washington some six years ago I remember  not with pride but with shame and humility  how I behaved then how in a masculine haze of anger and selfinvolvement terrified of my own neediness overwhelmed by my own fears I failed to offer emotional support to a woman who deeply needed me This time I resolved it will be different I tried from the moment the words Its positive first issued from my friends lips to share in this ritual with her as she dealt with the vicissitudes of nausea depression anger and I assume loneliness that must accompany an unwanted pregnancy Offering to accompany her to the interview that precedes the procedure and then to the procedure itself I am politely turned down Why dont you just wait here sir I am told Someone will be down after its over to let you know how shes doing My friend too suggests that this is what she prefers and so I sit here reading a copy of Boston Business which I notice not without a trace of irony seems to be the only magazine The Clinic subscribes to As I contemplate the glaring contrast between my original complicity and my present extraneousness I feel a wave of anger well up But there is also a certain relief it is after all not my body into which perhaps at this very moment a vacuum hose is being inserted and the power turned on It is some 37 years now since my biological parents  in a time long before there were openly such places as The Clinic long before the procedure was a legal alternative  must have contemplated taking a similar measure Myself the product of an unwanted pregnancy it is impossible for me however ardently I may support legally available abortion to be emotionally neutral on the subject I cannot  nor should I it seems to me  react with equanimity when a life that might have been my own a child that might have been mine is sucked from the walls of a womans womb no matter in whose or in whats name No matter how clear to me it may be that the choice ought indeed must be a womans to make for it is her body that is endangered hers and the childs futures that are most clearly jeopardized it is also clear to me that there is something of mine here that is dying too some pain and complicity of my own that must be dealt with Very much like the women I know primarily those in their early and late 30s who have not yet had children I too hear a clock ticking though its digits are neither as clearly defined nor as biologically intractable as are a womans Adopted by parents who were well into their 40s when I was born having occasionally resented my father for his advanced age and ill health while I was growing up I have little desire to inflict a similar fate on my own sons or daughters I too feel yet another opportunity gone by as I imagine the power surging through the vacuum hose and into my friends womb I am suddenly roused from these reflections by the reappearance of The Clinics attendant who informs me Your friend is doing fine Shell be down in a few minutes Unseen by me untouched by me the act is done What might have been is not Who might have spoken is forever still The life I might have passed on remains entirely my own My friend enters the waiting room and walks over to me Howd it go I ask Fine she answers But Im starving We stop on the way home at the International House of Pancakes conveniently situated near The Clinic She orders blueberry pancakes I order French toast The bill comes to 735 Back in Cambridge we walk into my apartment and my friend heads right for the sofa to pick up her flute and book bag I think Ill go practice awhile before my lesson she says heading toward the door Well    would you like to come back here and take a nap later You might feel a little weak No thanks she answers I think Ill just go back to my room Well    can I call you later No she says I think I just want to sleep for a while She opens the door walks out into the bright breezy Massachusetts morning and is gone Somewhere in the bushes outside my window I hear a pair of nesting cardinals singing to each other A terrible sadness sweeps over me like a cold wind It is my 37th year I am learning I say to myself something of what it means to be a man
POLITICKING GOES HIGH-TECH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/magazine/politicking-goes-high-tech.html,WHEN THE SENate race in Missouri entered the homestretch early last month campaign strategists for Republican Christopher S Kit Bond began to take nightly readings of the voters mood As soon as they learned that the ReaganGorbachev meeting in Iceland had collapsed on Sunday Oct 12 they inserted three new questions into their polls On Monday night the President spoke to the nation about the meeting by Tuesday night Don Sipple Mr Bonds media adviser sensed he was onto something big What he read in the polls astounded him Missouri voters were backing the President by margins of 6 and 7 to 1 Mr Bond was already running a television commercial that stressed his support for the Strategic Defense Initiative the Presidents spacebased missile shield and attacked the armscontrol policy of his Democratic opponent Harriett Woods Mr Sipple decided to recast the spot to take advantage of the talks By Wednesday morning the consultant had sent Mr Bond a new introduction emphasizing that the President had been able to negotiate in Iceland from a position of strength By Friday the revised commercial was on the air With the use of increasingly sophisticated polling methods videotape machines and satellite technology political consultants like Don Sipple can now monitor the public mood on an hourbyhour daytoday basis searching for a cresting emotion that might sway a bloc of marginal voters Todays media whiz then tries to capture and manipulate that emotion in a new television commercial that can be put on the air overnight It used to take two or three weeks for information to reach the voters says the pollster Harrison Hickman but now its film at 11 Clearly weve pushed the edge of the envelope on this stuff During the current battle for control of the Senate this hightech highstakes struggle by consultants and pollsters for the hearts and minds of the voting public has reached a new level of importance and visibility When voters cast their ballots in Missouri and other states on Tuesday they will be making choices based largely on impressions created by these media consultants Marshall McLuhan was right the medium is the message In American politics today the medium is television and that medium is dominated by an elite of highly paid but unelected consultants The democratic ideal of a candidate talking directly to the voters and appealing for support has been profoundly distorted These electronic contests sometimes resemble a new form of television game show  one could call them Spot Wars  and the cost is staggering Kit Bond and Harriett Woods will each spend about 4 million on their campaigns with 60 percent going toward buying television time The Missouri Senate race has attracted national interest for a number of reasons Both of the contestants are tough seasoned campaigners Kit Bond a 47yearold lawyer is a moderate conservative who won his first statewide race for auditor at age 31 and has served two terms as Governor Harriett Woods who is 59 and a journalist by profession peppers her liberal stance with populist swipes at the big banks and corporations that have contributed heavily to her rival She lost a close Senate race in 1982 to John C Danforth but was elected Lieutenant Governor in 1984 Moreover both parties feel that the larger battle for conhinges on a handful of key races And Missouri where the retirement of Democrat Thomas F Eagleton gives the Republicans a chance to pick up a vacant seat is one of them Not surprisingly the race attracted the top guns in the consulting business and promised to be the Super Bowl of media advisers Mr Bonds man Don Sipple is a partner in the Washington firm of Bailey Deardourff Sipple which has a superb track record in selling Republicans The Woods team at the outset was led by the hottest name on the Democratic side Robert Squier who is also based in Washington Top guns do not come cheap Mr Squier for example charges a 60000 fee plus 15 percent of the media buy or another 350000 in a state like Missouri CONSULTANTS OF COURSE also work in gubernatorial and House campaigns but those races do not usually involve the sort of media warfare that dominates the major Senate contests there is much less money available for the candidates since many national contributors are more interested in senatorial campaigns The cost of television advertising however has grown so rapidly that today Senate campaigns design most of their tactics for one of three purposes and sometimes all three generating free television and radio coverage raising money to finance paid commercials and energizing supporters to go out and raise more money In Missouri one 30second spot on the popular evening game show Wheel of Fortune costs about 3000 and as the race moved into the final hectic month both candidates were spending about 250000 a week apiece on television alone The financial pressures have grown so great that candidates can spend up to half their time appealing for funds often on the phone with individual donors The price of running for the Senate today says Harriett Woods is spending more time than youd like to spend asking people for more money than theyd like to give The Woods campaign actually started organizing its fundraising effort in March 1985 Without money explained Jody Newman the campaign manager we couldnt be on TV and without TV we couldnt win Fund raising in any senatorial campaign takes place on both the local and national levels Within the home state the techniques have remained standard breakfasts and lunches pool parties and cocktail parties that charge anywhere from 10 to 500 a head The pitch is generally about local issues because the contributors are more interested in what the candidates will do for the state than in the way they will affect policy in Washington No Senate candidate however can raise enough at home these days to finance a campaign So while the elections are generally decided by local issues the money used to publicize those issues must be raised in Los Angeles and Detroit Chicago and Houston and above all in New York and Washington During their campaigns both Kit Bond and Harriett Woods have made regular trips to New York City in search of money While the Republican mainly worked the Wall Street crowd the Democrat concentrated on the citys large liberal community and Harriett Woods was continually running into other candidates in Manhattan We follow one another through the same art galleries and restaurants and living rooms she said But no city is more important in the fundraising game than Washington and few Senate campaigns this year are without a new breed of Washington consultant who does nothing but pry money out of the political action committees or PACs There are now more than 4000 PACs providing almost onequarter of all contributions to Senate campaigns When Mrs Woods scheduled a party for PAC representatives in September her Washington fundraiser Sara G Garland was up at 5 AM for several days addressing the invitations by hand Ms Garland also asked the Democratic Senators who signed the invitation to call special friends in the PACs and urge them to buy tickets As one veteran fundraiser put it In Washington nothing happens until the fifth phone call The evening garnered 130000 enough for perhaps four days of commercials and Mrs Woods was back again in October for a final dip into the Washington money pool Ms Garland also organized a series of smaller meetings between Mrs Woods and groups of PACs devoted to specific subjects For example at one breakfast meeting last July the guest list included PACs related to health a major Woods concern The hosts for the event were Representative Henry A Waxman of California and Senator Max Baucus of Montana senior Democrats on the committees handling health issues One PAC official resisted all appeals until Ms Garland said This is an opportunity for you I promise you a seat next to the Senator The response was immediate Im coming These days Republicans enjoy an obvious fundraising advantage Ronald Reagans farm and trade policies might not be popular in Missouri but the President raised 450000 for Mr Bond at one luncheon in St Louis Some PACs hedge their bets and back both candidates but most choose sides and the competition is fierce For example Mr Bond received help from John Danforth who as chairman of the influential Senate Commerce Committee has closed a few doors for us according to Ms Garland A lot of PACs are going to support Bond because Danforth talked to the CEO or made a call to the vice president for government relations she said Once their fundraising efforts were in gear both camps started exploring campaign themes In the fall of 1985 Don Sipple organized focus groups around the state  small gatherings of about a dozen voters Focus groups give you a feel you cant get from any polling said Mr Sipple who once served on Mr Bonds staff in the Missouri Statehouse What Mr Sipple discovered was that voters saw Mr Bond as a good guy a good Governor but not as an inspiring leader Accordingly Mr Sipple reasoned the Bond campaign should play to the candidates strength by emphasizing the comfort level he had achieved with many voters The focus groups told Mr Sipple that there were some very clear differences between the two candidates on a range of issues particularly budget and fiscal matters and the strategist thought he could label Mrs Woods a tax and spend Democrat The groups also indicated that Mrs Woods was coming across as too harsh and too liberal but that information had to be handled delicately It was infinitely easier for us to work on the liberal thing than on the harsh thing Mr Sipple explained When you engage in attacks on personal qualities that can be very dangerous Meanwhile Mrs Woods had hired Harrison Hickman and Paul Maslin two polltakers based in Washington who took a survey for her in February Mrs Woods was the preference of 47 percent of those polled as opposed to 44 percent for Mr Bond But that early in a campaign political experts are more interested in what they call internals answers to specific questions that reveal a candidates particular strengths and weaknesses One of the key findings was that Mrs Woods rated high on questions of personal character The poll revealed a major Bond weakness his image as a wealthy countryclub Republican But Messrs Hickman and Maslin also uncovered evidence of Mr Bonds strength On the question of who has the experience and qualifications a Senator needs Mr Bond led 2 to 1 B OB SQUIER IS A Washington celebrity widely quoted in the press and seen at the best parties a charming selfpromoter with a good record in close races In 1984 he worked for Paul Simon of Illinois one of only two Democrats to oust an incumbent Republican Senator Mr Squier actively sought the Missouri assignment because it promised to be one of the top races of the year and Mrs Woods and her staff were flattered by his attention He would give them instant credibility in Washington and leverage with the PACs He had a seasoned organization that offered a full range of services from debate preparation and research to a music composer and editing facility By contrast Joe Slade White who had worked for Mrs Woods in her previous campaigns was practically a oneman operation with little experience in major Senate races In explaining the choice of Bob Squier over Joe White Jody Newman Mrs Woodss campaign manager said What often happens in races like this is that you have a fight over the airwaves One candidate puts on a message and the other has to decide how to respond At times you have to rely on experience and instinct and you have to have the capability of getting on the air instantly Nonetheless while they wanted Mr Squiers contacts and his organization Mrs Woods and her closeknit core of advisers were not prepared to take his advice Ms Newman has devoted much of her professional life to promoting Mrs Woods and she approached the campaign with a simple heartfelt premise If people really knew Harriett they would vote for her But Mr Squier and the polltakers had looked at the numbers They knew their clients weaknesses as well as her strengths and they were not ready to canonize her During one planning meeting with the Woods staff Bob Squier turned to Harrison Hickman and muttered All they have to do is pin wings on her and shell fly to the Senate One key question in any Senate campaign is Which side goes on the air first with paid commercials The Woods team agreed to let Mr Bond take the lead He had more money so the shorter the campaign the better for Mrs Woods A longer campaign was also likely to tarnish Mrs Woodss halo effect as Mr Hickman put it She would look more and more like a politician Don Sipple was reading the situation in the same way and decided to begin Mr Bonds media campaign in May We wanted to draw her out he said We wanted to make her spend more money than she wanted to before the primary in August The initial Bond spots were lowkey In one he wandered through a field talking to a farmer about agricultural issues and casually mentioned that ladybugs help control aphids in a field of alfalfa That comment just said so much said Mr Sipple In a highly charged political environment when the farm issue will be a political football lets find out who knows about agriculture A second aim of the ads added Mr Sipple was to tighten up his candidates elitist image Mr Bond attended prep school at Deerfield Mass college at Princeton and law school at the University of Virginia not exactly a man of the people So the television spots invariably showed him in a checked sports shirt speaking directly to ordinary voters who nodded sympathetically During a trip to a state fair where Mr Bond was going to film some commercials the candidate doffed his lawyers shirt and tie in the car and put on one of his madefortelevision plaids  with the price tag still on it Don Sipple also prepared a second package of spots that focused on Missouris troubled economy taking care to separate Kit Bond from the Administration on such issues as trade policy The White House offered to provide the Bond campaign with a videotape of President Reagan meeting with the Republican but we passed said the consultant much to the consternation of the White House T HE BOND MEDIA campaign was functioning smoothly so well in fact that a Woods poll in early June showed that the Democrat had lost 11 points and was behind 48 to 40 More importantly there was a marked decline in her advantage on character questions the strongest element of her appeal The original strategy had been to run a series of positive spots after Mr Bonds initial wave but the poll results forced a reevaluation It was time for something dramatic The Woods camp had received a juicy piece of information Kit Bond sat on the board of an insurance company Mutual Benefit Life that held farm loans in Missouri and had foreclosed on local farmers After a Kansas City paper ran a story on one of the families David and Marilyn Peterson of Maysville Mr Squier took a film crew to their house for an interview During the filming David Peterson broke into sobs while talking about his lost dairy herd The Woods campaign in Harrison Hickmans words thought they had found a silver bullet Mr Squier edited the material into a threepart series that ended with an attack on Kit Bond for opposing a moratorium on farm foreclosures The consultants recommended skipping the original positive spots and coming straight out with the negative crying farmer spots Mrs Woods and her staff agreed The first two in the series began running in midJune The third spot with Mr Petersons outburst and the attack on Mr Bond followed That night a group of Bond staff members gathered in Kansas City to watch the commercial Katie Boyle Mr Bonds press secretary felt as if someone had punched her Warren Erdman Mr Bonds campaign manager immediately called Don Sipple The two men decided to hold their fire and try to determine how the ad was affecting voters Mr Erdman traveled to his hometown of Higginsville and showed the commercials to a focus group As they watched the third spot I watched their eyes I wanted to see their expressions said Mr Erdman When the citizens of Higginsville expressed distaste for the attack on Kit Bond Mr Erdman breathed easily for the first time in days A strategy was then formulated Katie Boyle would express sympathy for the Petersons but would denounce the Woods campaign for gutter politics The Bond camp also encouraged critical stories in the news media about the Woods spot With a tip from Katie Boyle Mike Reilly a reporter for The Columbia Daily Tribune tracked down the Petersons and after a lengthy interview with Marilyn Peterson wrote a story quoting her as saying I kinda felt like we had been used by the Woods campaign Miss Boyle rushed copies of the article to the Kansas City television stations and two of them used it on the air that night Within days the outcry against the spot had reached a crescendo around the state It was Bob Squier later conceded a masterful job of using the news media The Woods camp was reeling Jody Newman was on the phone with Bob Squier saying that supporters were upset about the negative tone of the ad The candidate herself was complaining about how she looked Messrs Hickman and Maslin took a quick poll and found decidedly mixed results In the St Louis area Mr Bond had actually increased his overall lead to 10 points But many voters who said their income was dependent on agriculture liked the spots and shifted in favor of Mrs Woods In a private memo accompanying the poll Messrs Hickman and Maslin said it would be a tragic error for the Woods campaign to back away from the attack Bob Squier told Mrs Woods and her other advisers that negative ads always cause a critical reaction at first but are effective in the long run The voting public is like an organism said Mr Squier It tries to reject information that is unpleasant In fact the consultant had assumed that Mr Bond would attack the commercials as dirty politics and he had a followup spot ready to go pointing out that Mr Bond had received 26000 for serving on the insurance company board and had failed to report the income on his Senate ethics report Mr Bond later said the omission was valid because the fee went directly to his law firm But Jody Newman in a fury told the consultants Weve spent eight years building up Harriett Woodss image and youve ruined it in a month When Mr Squier insisted that the campaign stick to the game plan he was dismissed It is a sign of the times that the dumping of Bob Squier made frontpage news and Mrs Woods complained that reporters were more interested in his status than in her speeches Messrs Hickman and Maslin who agreed with Bob Squier resigned a few days later Ms Newman hurriedly contacted the man who had worked on Mrs Woodss earlier campaigns Joe White at his vacation house on Long Island and asked him to replace Mr Squier Mr White was in St Louis the next day and within a few days a new series of Woods spots were on the air This time the candidate took center stage Against a soundtrack vaguely evocative of Chariots of Fire a voice praised her character and courage Mrs Woods was delighted with the spots Joe White has always made me look good she said The Washington hotshots were gone and the campaign staff in St Louis was in charge again In our judgment said Ms Newman Joe White would do things the way we wanted to do them B UT THE SPOT Wars were just heating up After Joe Whites first ads went on the air Don Sipple saw an opening for a counterattack He flew into St Louis late one evening and by the next morning he had produced a new spot featuring the negative news clippings about the Woods commercial  clippings the Bond campaign had helped generate That night it was on the air By using the Continued on Page 50 newspaper clips to make the point and not Mr Bond himself Mr Sipple got others to do the campaigns dirty work One of the articles quoted in Mr Sipples spot had called Mrs Woodss tactics sleazy and shallow and Mr White in turn thought he saw a target of opportunity He put together another commercial saying that Mr Bond couldnt take the truth about his ties to the insurance company At that point in midAugust both camps lapsed into an exhausted silence But as Labor Day approached Joe White knew he had a big problem Mrs Woods was trailing Mr Bond by 8 points in most polls There was only one thing to do Go negative Mr White decided to attack Mr Bonds strongest point his reputation for sound fiscal management Mr Bonds own commercials boasted that as Governor he had taken a budget deficit and turned it into a surplus In his commercial for Mrs Woods Mr White used the first 10 seconds of the Bond spot with its claim of financial wizardry and froze the frame A somber voice came on saying Thats what Kit Bond says What he doesnt say is the truth The truth the commercial concluded was that Mr Bond actually inherited a surplus as Governor and had to raise taxes to keep the state afloat The facts lie somewhere in between and depend on the accounting method used All candidates overreact to negatives noted Mr White They tend to believe the voters will turn against them So a negative ad throws an opponent off guard It also gives them the problem of how to respond and that occupies their time and resources The morning in early September that the spot was first televised Kit Bond was being interviewed at a Kansas City television station and a reporter asked for his reaction Mr Bond made a quick comment and privately told Katie Boyle he wanted to talk to Don Sipple But Mr Sipple had already called Mr Bond at the station leaving a number in Illinois where he was working on another campaign Mr Bond was late for an appearance in St Joseph but once on the highway his van pulled over at a convenience store where two adjoining phone booths were unoccupied On one phone Mr Bond called headquarters and talked to his campaign manager Warren Erdman who was negotiating with the Woods forces over future debates On the other phone his press secretary Katie Boyle reached Mr Sipple in Illinois and discussed the Woods ad At one point as some local farmers looked on in amazement Mr Bond had a phone in each ear talking to both advisers at once While Mr White succeeded in initially rattling his opponents the Bond team after sniffing the bait decided not to take it Demanding that Woods withdraw her commercial would sound like a lawyers trick said Mr Sipple and would admit that the ad had drawn blood Instead Miss Boyle made a statement rebutting the charges in the commercial Mr White also made seven other spots detailing Mrs Woodss views on such issues as drugs in the schools Mr White argued that since the babyboom generation was now having kids issues relating to children would play well Some of the spots were only 10 seconds long with Mrs Woods talking directly into the camera Because short spots are half the cost of 30second ads the campaign flooded the airwaves with them hoping to show that Harriett Woods was knowledgeable on many subjects The Bond camp had been caught napping Mrs Woods was outspending them 2 and 3 to 1 on television time and the attack on the Republicans fiscal record softened up his support with marginal voters said Mr Sipple She just kind of drowned us out By purchasing so much air time in early September the Woods camp hoped to influence the next round of polls The strategy worked The St Louis GlobeDemocrat showed Mrs Woods pulling even with Mr Bond at 40 percent apiece with 20 percent undecided Even before the poll was published Ms Garland was on the phone in Washington using the results to encourage PACs to contribute to Mrs Woods She raised 15000 in one day Within days Kit Bond was fighting back One commercial showed ordinary voters  most of them women  attacking Mrs Woodss sneaky rotten campaign tactics Another ad said Mrs Woods was rewriting the history of Mr Bonds Governorship Both commercials ran on a heavy schedule for eight days and by the end said Mr Sipple we had pretty much stopped her move New polls at the end of September showed Mr Bond back in front by 7 points Mr White acknowledged that Bob Squier had been right last spring in saying that Mrs Woods could win only by undermining Mr Bonds solid image of reliability So for the final weeks of the campaign he produced a series of negative ads capped by a renewed attack on the Republicans connection to the insurance industry The point was simple to identify Mr Bond with big money outofstate bad guys Joe White also took a gamble producing a spot in which Mrs Woods talked frankly about her support for a womans right to have an abortion The point was to stress the character issue her concern for average people Don Sipple entered the final weeks with a similar strategy Stress Mr Bonds strength with spots that highlight his deep roots in Missouri and attack Mrs Woodss weak points by having him identify with President Reagans tough stance in Iceland But that ad  by saying that Mrs Woods favored a test ban without verification  also triggered a controversy The Democrat fired back with her own spot accusing Mr Bond of telling an outright lie In the last 10 days of the campaign Mr Bond tried to capitalize on the Presidents postsummit popularity by appearing in a rally with him in Springfield and running a new spot with a Presidential endorsement At that point Kit Bond held a 9point lead in two polls but the Woods camp argued that the gap was closing In Spot Wars the television audience at home gets to pick the winner and they will do that on Tuesday

HETERODOXY WAS HIS DOXY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/books/heterodoxy-was-his-doxy.html,VOLTAIRE By A J Ayer 182 pp New York Random House 1995 SO much has been and is still being written about Voltaire that his own works are probably less often read than are the books discussing them Lytton Strachey whom A J Ayer is fond of quoting remarked about Voltaire more than 80 years ago Everyone it is true has heard of him but who has read him It is by his name that ye shall know him and not by his works It would therefore be unreasonable to expect that this rather short essay by a nonspecialist and intended for a nonspecialized audience should add much to what has already been said many times about Voltaire and his works Nor can the book claim much originality for having been written by an Englishman since Voltaires wellknown indebtedness to England has been more than amply repaid by Englands disproportionately large contribution to Voltaire scholarship Much more is yet to come The Voltaire Foundation of Oxford University  where Sir Alfred was educated and where he long occupied a distinguished chair of philosophy is sponsoring the gigantic endeavor of bringing out a new edition of the Complete Works of Voltaire the first such in more than a century What is remarkable however about this book is that its author after having for half a century published numerous highly respected philosophical volumes decided during the seventh decade of his life to read Voltaires chief works and to reflect on what they still have to say to us more than two centuries after they were written The contact of two great minds separated by time and culture brings into play the often unpredictable but usually instructive turns and twists of relevance For example when Voltaire scoffs in his Philosophical Dictionary at the dogma of original sin and ridicules the notion that God should have to wait until the sixth week after conception to endow the fetus with an immortal  and damned  soul Voltaire wrote What do six weeks matter more or less Sir Alfred observes with true Voltairean irony It is amusing to note that nowadays the opponents of abortion are more likely to believe in original sin than its advocates and that it is its advocates who believe that the six weeks do matter Being himself a professional philosopher which is more than one could say of the author of the Philosophical Letters and the Philosophical Dictionary  and observing quite rightly that Voltaire attached less importance to philosophy than to theology Sir Alfred devotes fewer pages to literary issues than he does to ideas and values especially those bridging the gap between philosophy and religion This is all the more understandable because he finds himself in general agreement with Voltaires heterodox views on such matters To wit I hope that by now it can be taken for granted that the accounts of creation and the origin of man which appear in the Book of Genesis are not only inconsistent but independently ridiculous that the whole of the Pentateuch is riddled with absurdities and that the best that can be said for the remainder of the Canon is that much of it like the Song of Solomon and the Book of Ecclesiastes is outstanding for its literary merit Aside from the lucid and personal discussion he offers for instance of the addition to the Philosophical Letters in which Voltaire attempted a systematic demolition of Pascals Pensees and of much of the Philosophical Dictionary Sir Alfred is at his best when he attempts a nighrevisionist reevaluation of Voltaires huge production as a historian  of Charles XII of Sweden of Peter the Great of Russia of Louis XIV of France and of world civilization in general  or when he summarizes in a lively and wellinformed manner what is currently known of what he terms Voltaires Life and Character Conversely his remarks about the plays and especially about the tales are disappointingly conventional and he has practically nothing to say about the poetry While this selective and somewhat skewed approach is logical on the part of a writer who insists throughout his book that what he admires most about Voltaire is his moral courage it fails to provide a clue to what made Voltaire the widely known symbolic figure he still is today as evidenced for example by the title given by Will and Ariel Durant to one of their volumes The Age of Voltaire Saying that the most important factor    and the one that chiefly accounts for his survival as a symbol is that he was fundamentally a man of action does little more than beg the question for it fails to indicate that the key to Voltaires effectiveness as a man of action was his reputation deserved or not as the greatest man of letters of his age Even if the 10 cantos of his epic poem La Henriade are no more often read today than his 40odd plays are performed it was because of the fame brought to Voltaire by his now neglected belleslettres that he was able to publicize and remedy some of the most scandalous miscarriages of justice of his time and that he succeeded in creating his own legend  of the frail old man whose pen proved mightier than the weapons wielded by the allpowerful Church and State SIR ALFRED may be quite correct when he states with understandable British pride The most effective counter to the superstitions of Christianity came from the discoveries of the nineteenth century In this matter we owe a smaller debt to Voltaire than to such men as Lyell Thomas Huxley and Charles Darwin Nevertheless this glosses over the fact that theirs was a more restricted audience than the one drawn to Voltaire by his reputation as one of the great writers of his time There is on the other hand no disagreement with Sir Alfreds final sentence After having cast his eye on the world around him rife with glaring instances of intolerance fanaticism and bigotry he claims We must surely conclude that we can still profit by the example of the lucidity the acumen the intellectual honesty and the moral courage of Voltaire A J Ayer deserves our gratitude He will certainly bring more readers to Voltaire thus perhaps making our world a little better
"BEHT HENLEY WRITES A 'REAL, REAL PERSONAL' MOVIE",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/movies/beht-henley-writes-a-real-real-personal-movie.html,A touring Shakespearean troupe arrives in a small town at the start of Nobodys Fool the new film written by the Pulitzer Prizewinning playwright Beth Henley The play they perform is The Tempest a choice that adroitly alludes to the theme of the movie itself The Tempest Shakespeares final play was his valedictory to the world of theater his tribute to the power of what he deprecatingly called this insubstantial pageant to elevate the human soul The Prospero of Nobodys Fool is the theaters set designer Riley who like his Shakespearean counterpart manipulates his world  by the mastery of lights booms stagecraft And the films Ariel is Cassie who is ultimately liberated by her Prospero In the hands of Eric Roberts and Rosanna Arquette Riley and Cassie also stand in for Ferdinand and Miranda the young lovers in The Tempest for Nobodys Fool equates romance with theater in its ability to deliver people from the monotony of limited lives However film critics may judge Nobodys Fool which opens Friday at the New York Twin 84th Street Six and 34th Street Showplace it seems certain to stir sentiment in anyone who ever has felt the magical pull of the stage much as Bertrand Taverniers recent  Round Midnight sweetly reminds every jazz fan of the first time he walked into the smoke and the sound of a basement club The elegiac and autobiographical mood of Nobodys Fool separates it from the wackier voice and thirdperson stance of Ms Henleys two Broadway plays Crimes of the Heart and The Wake of Jamey Foster The difference derives in part from timing  Ms Henley began writing the screenplay in 1977 before any of her plays  and in part from how closely Cassie corresponds to her creator  Nobodys Fool was real real personal to me Ms Henley said sitting for an interview in a Manhattan hotel but looking the fetching country ingenue in a polka dot dress and ankle socks Its about someone whos in despair and is looking for meanings and has made mistakes and is looking for salvation Theater is a world that understands magic and imagination Also theres the sense in theater of the family an immediate sense of belonging But a belonging where you can be different Or as Cassie puts it when she explains why she wants to take an acting class Watching that Shakespeare show got me thinking how good it would be to be someone other than me Even if it was for an hour or a half hour Ms Henley grew up in Jackson Miss her childhood dominated by severe asthma and her teenage years spent as an outsider in a high school big on drill team and cheerleaders She joined no clubs took part in no activities and was dateless on prom night When she left to attend Southern Methodist University in Dallas she carried a copy of The Power of Positive Thinking I was real zoned out Ms Henley who is 34 years old remembered of her childhood I really lived in my own world I used to come home from school every day  this is so pathetic  and go to my closet See I had moved out of the bedroom I shared with my sister and into this closet And I would sit there and cut pictures out of magazines and put them into this book Sometimes I liked the picture and sometimes I just wanted a kind of shape that would look nice in my book And I would listen to records  Porgy and Bess and some Chopin record my mother had and the soundtrack of [ Zeffirellis ] Romeo and Juliet I used to collect rocks and bottles too I wasnt a good collector because I felt sorry for rocks and bottles that werent pretty so Id keep them Id keep dead flowers because I thought just because flowers are dead you shouldnt throw them out I kept a goldfish that died once Just left it in the water with my other goldfish that was alive Course eventually it killed that one Ms Henley not only had the wild imaginative life of a loner but she loved listening to the stories family and friends told unknowingly gathering the grist for her adult writings My mother said I was the quietest child she recalled I would just sit on her lap or lay down on the couch and listen to her talk to her friends Theyd always whisper Oh thats all right she wont know what were talking about And sometimes Id pretend to sleep just so theyd keep talking From early on theater figured in Ms Henleys life and her story will be beautifully familiar to the thousands of aspiring actors who flock to New York each year from the hinterlands At age 12 Ms Henley visited Manhattan with her parents and she saw Funny Girl Hello Dolly and After the Fall Ms Henleys mother acted in an amateur theater in Jackson and as a senior in high school the future playwright began to study acting there She pursued acting rather than writing at Southern Methodist and during graduate school at the University of Illinois she spent one summer playing in the Abraham Lincoln docudrama at a state park an experience that directly fed Nobodys Fool I loved theater Ms Henley said I loved to go to rehearsals with my mother and watch everything It just killed me that these grownup people were putting on costumes and had madeup sets just so people could come sit in the dark and watch a story Magic gave way to misery however when Ms Henley tried to turn her avocation into her vocation She began writing Nobodys Fool then entitled The Moonwatchers when she was just another unemployed actress debilitated by the hopeauditionrejection cycle The initial draft reflected her anger and Ms Henley believes that the screenplay profited by not having been made in its original incarnation In the intervening years she turned to writing won the Pulitzer Prize for Crimes of the Heart and enjoyed extensive regional theater productions of The Wake of Jamey Foster and The Miss Firecracker Contest This fall her career has reached its most active point She cowrote the screenplay of David Byrnes acclaimed True Stories and also the film adaptation of Crimes which opens Dec 12 Her new play The Lucky Spot will bow on April 9 1987 at the Manhattan Theater Club and another new work The Debutante Ball is expected to premiere at the same theater next season All this success served to soften the raw edges of Nobodys Fool I just got bored of reading the script where Cassies bitching and moaning Ms Henley said I thought God get out of it So I switched the focus from Cassie wallowing in misery to how hard shes trying to get out of it It got more forgiving In the final version of the script as directed by Evelyn Purcell Cassie emerged as a classic Henley heroine Carnelle Scott of The Miss Firecracker Contest wanted to win that smalltown beauty pageant to bury the bad reputation that had earned her only the colloquial title Miss Hot Tamale Cassie too has earned scorn for both her eccentricity Miss Arquettes costumes suggest Annie HallmeetsThe Grapes of Wrath  and her sexual entanglements After her longtime boyfriend impregnates her he backs out on a promise to marry her and she decides to give up the baby for adoption As soberly as the film conveys Cassies isolation it also gives her and the supporting characters the hilarious grotesque touches that can now fairly be called Henleyisms When Cassies boyfriend offers her half the money for an abortion instead of a wedding vow she stabs him in the cheek with a fork Later that night she tries to hang herself the rope breaks and she falls into a dumpster Nobodys Fool also includes a mother with warts on her back a mentally disturbed girl who craves plastic straws and an albino womans wedding ceremony with Ms Henley in a cameo as a bridesmaid While the film is set in the Southwestern town of Buckeye Basin actually Prescott Ariz the idiosyncracies clearly mark it as part of Ms Henleys native Mississippi the setting for all her plays Critics have called her style gothic and bizarre but to Ms Henley it is plain old kitchensink naturalism It seems real to me she said I wouldnt find it interesting to be sitting around making everything up So many of my stories are from people Ive known and tales Ive heard As much as Ms Henley has made audiences laugh at comas hangings exploding pigs and other disasters she has always written with an enormous empathy In a way that recalls Douglas Ungers novel Leaving the Land or Joni Mitchells Song for Sharon she has balanced both affection for and rejection of smalltown life And she has never relied on easy targets for laughs It was hard growing up for me she said but I still love the place I came from I love the people and the way they tell stories I love the romance and the smell of the air She paused I guess its like the way I looked at rocks and bottles Its life and I hate for people to judge things I dont like sarcasm and putting people down Everyone is foolish in their own way She drew her legs up under her and smiled I mean this hotel They say Bonjour Like because they speak French its better Were not even in France Thats as foolish as anything people do in a small town Ms Henleys warmth for ordinary life makes her seem an odd collaborator for Mr Byrne on True Stories Even her musical taste ran more toward the early jazzmen Fletcher Henderson Louis Armstrong and Jimmy Noone than rockandroll As the main songwriter for Talking Heads by comparison Mr Byrne has spoken most compellingly through the characters of psychotics paranoids and the odd religious zealot here and there His take on everyday America delivered in a song entitled The Big Country was I wouldnt live there if you paid me The playwright and songwriter met through Jonathan Demme when he directed Ms Henleys teleplay Survival Guides for PBS and cast Mr Byrne as the spiteful brotherinlaw of a new bride The teleplay which also featured Rosanna Arquette has yet to be broadcast Mr Byrne showed Ms Henley the photographs that were part of his then inchoate screenplay  a little girl walking along a country road a fat woman lipsynching Then she and Stephen Tobolowsky who has directed most of her plays helped the firsttime film director shape the disparate visions into a tour of fictional Virgil Tex during its sesquicentennial I wrote kind of the Fellini version of the script Ms Henley said and he spent the next year paring it down and shaping it to his songs I see Davids stuff and feel mine is so gaudy and overstated and his is so spare Along the way the woman who knew Armstrongs Potato Head Blues learned such Byrne standards as Crosseyed and Painless I love Talking Heads now Ms Henley said more excited than at any point in the interview But the bargain seems fair A number of critics keeping in mind Mr Byrnes beginnings in the eversocynical downtown scene remarked on the suprisingly accepting spirit of True Stories While few made this point and Ms Henley herself tends to dismiss it the relative tenderness of True Stories might indicate that Ms Henley and Mr Tobolowsky exerted a tempering effect on Mr Byrne Nobodys Fool like virtually all of Ms Henleys work brands her as an optimist Which is not to say her viewpoint is at all saccharine When Cassie leaves with Riley for Los Angeles at the films end there is a final echo of The Tempest Our revels now are ended Prospero declares in the play And as the lovers are united the shipwrecked are saved and his own usurped dukedom is restored the magician at last frees the enslaved spirit Ariel
"THE REGION; Cuomo, O'Rourke Cross Swords But Shed No Blood",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/weekinreview/the-region-cuomo-o-rourke-cross-swords-but-shed-no-blood.html,It was boring as political debates go but then that was what made it interesting After months of implying dreadful things about each other Governor Cuomo and his chief challenger Westchester County Executive Andrew P ORourke said they really had not meant to I never suggested anything untoward about Mr ORourkes conduct said Mr Cuomo who had insisted only the week before that Mr ORourke had declined to list his law clients publicly because he must have something to hide Mr ORourke the Republican candidate who had tried to link the Governor with scandals involving fellow Democrats in his home borough of Queens backed off just as far What Ive said about the Governor from the beginning was not that I charged him personally with any venality Mr ORourke said I never had and I never will It was left to the third debater District Attorney Denis E Dillon of Nassau County the Right to Life candidate to point out that ethics had been a phony issue right from the start Now Mr Dillon interjected Why shouldnt the public think were crooks when we spend our campaigns calling each other crooks with no evidence Aides of Mr Cuomo and Mr ORourke said they had urged their candidates to remain on their best behavior During the 90minute session at The New York Times Mr Cuomo also declined to commit himself as to his plans for adjusting state taxes or revising rent guidelines Mr ORourke said he would like to see an inspector general at work in the school system to find out how many computers never get out of the crates how many teachers never turn up how many temporary teachers cant pass exams things like that And Mr Dillon said he thought the Governor should end public funding of abortions in this state
"MEESE, THE LAWMAN, CALLS FOR ANARCHY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/opinion/meese-the-lawman-calls-for-anarchy.html,Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d asserted last week that legislatures and government officials are not bound by the Supreme Courts interpretation of the Constitution They may contradict the Court and follow their own interpretations when enacting laws or adopting policies he said Although Mr Meeses position is untenable the reasons are more complicated than appear at first glance Mr Meese correctly observed that Congress and government officials no less than courts are obligated to decide constitutional questions Before Congress enacts a law for example it should make sure that the measure does not violate the Bill of Rights or separation of powers But this is a far cry from saying that Congress can overturn a decision already made by the Supreme Court Although each branch must interpret the Constitution as best it can the Constitution does not indicate who if anyone has the final word For this we must rely on two centuries of tradition and on what makes sense pragmatically Our tradition is unequivocal in ceding the last word to the Court  subject of course to constitutional amendment Although Mr Meese accurately cites Madison and Lincoln as saying that each branch may interpret the Constitution for itself no President or Congress since the Civil War has refused to abide by the Courts decisions Our tradition of judicial supremacy arises from the fact that the socalled political branches have not developed trustworthy procedures for assessing the constitutionality of their enactments On the contrary the Constitution has been a nuisance to politicians who want to show voters their dedication to eradicating drugs pornography and the budget deficit Indeed the pages of the Congressional Record are full of statements relegating constitutional questions to the courts The GrammRudmanHollings law is the most recent example of the political branches abdication of constitutional responsibilities Congress hastily enacted the deficitreduction bill and President Reagan immediately signed it each ignoring constitutional defects that everyone knew the law contained It required the Court which did not have to grandstand to the electorate to hold that the law transgressed the separation of powers None of this is surprising There is a familiar maxim that no person should be the judge in his own cause It is almost impossible for the proponent of a policy to evaluate its constitutionality with detachment Courts are comparatively impartial simply because they have not sponsored the laws they are required to review Of course traditions are not immutable But it takes more than the Attorney Generals assertion to change something so fundamental as the authority to make binding constitutional decisions Before Congress and the executive could even consider contradicting the Courts interpretations they would have to establish and observe nonpartisan deliberative procedures for assessing the constitutionality of their own products If the notion that the political branches could ever treat constitutional issues with judicial detachment seems implausible this only shows how far Mr Meeses proposition lies from the real world Under any circumstances the power to contradict the Supreme Courts decisions could be exercised only by the Courts two equals Congress and the President Our Federal system plainly denies such power to the states the years of massive resistance to the 1954 school desegregation decision are a grim reminder of why this must be so And within the Federal Government anarchy would prevail if every official and agency were free to disregard the Courts rulings Our tradition of according the judicial branch the last word on constitutional questions reflects our dedication to the rule of law One might therefore wonder why at this of all times an Attorney General committed to law and order would propose a policy so likely to encourage disrespect for the courts Would he have made the same speech if a majority of the Supreme Court supported the Administrations views on issues such as abortion and school prayer The transparent political motives underlying Mr Meeses radical proposal demonstrate why at least the Attorney General ought not be entrusted with the power to contradict judicial decisions
TERRIFIED AND FASCINATED BY HIS OWN LIFE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/books/terrified-and-fascinated-by-his-own-life.html,HIS WAY The Unauthorized Biography of Frank Sinatra By Kitty Kelley Illustrated 575 pp New York Bantam Books 2195 HERE is Ava Gardner bless her heart Deep down Im pretty superficial Its not every day you come across a sentence like that Kitty Kelley who hasnt got what youd call a major sense of humor solemnly reiterates Miss Gardners remark without telling us whether Francis Albert Sinatras second wife understood she was being funny when she gave utterance to this delicious sentence Thats too bad and thats Ms Kelley all over all those facts  how she loves them  and we still dont know what anyones like    Yes we do know that Mr Sinatra is no cream puff sweetie pie goodytwoshoes We didnt however need Ms Kelley to tell us that which we already surmised Ms Kelley is an evangelical writer her vocation being to pen unauthorized biographies of people she has little affection and no empathy for precisely those people who wish least to be written about and who have the power to exact silence from those who know and love or fear  them best Jacqueline Onassis Jackie Oh and Elizabeth Taylor Elizabeth Taylor The Last Star were Ms Kelleys previous marks She scribbles with what can only be called a sense of retributive getallthedamningfactsandprintem mission I have enormous respect for facts Do facts make up a life Of course not They dont even make up a story of a life Facts unsupported and uncolored by nuance wrenched out of context uninformed by lively wit intelligence or love constitute at best a story about a story  in this case a story about the story of an icon Unless one believes Frank Sinatra Jr Mia Farrow Frank Sinatras third wife and Elizabeth Taylor one of his lovers  all of whom have made public statements attributing to the author inaccuracy or cupidity  Ms Kelley is a good reporter A good reporter can tell us a lot about Angola inside trading on Wall Street the new fall fashions a good reporter unless she is capable of an imaginative leap into someone elses consciousness does not have access to the human heart one cannot apply to the Justice Department for access thereto Ms Kelley is no leaper Even if one were to suppose that facts are in and of themselves truth could one then say that Ms Kelley has command of the facts of Mr Sinatras life No Any one fact is dependent for its weight and significance on the facts that surround it And for every one person Ms Kelley interviewed  a host of scorned lovers castaside friends and disgruntled former hangerson  we may safely assume there are scores she did not Some of them might have had even uglier stories to tell about Mr Sinatra than those in His Way On the other hand it is possible that some people who chose silence or who had silence imposed on them by Mr Sinatra  who sued to keep this book from being published  might have had something good to say about him or something in healing contradiction to what is contradictory reporting by Ms Kelley We might then have been able to breathe As it is reading this recitation of one mans sins is as refreshing as inhaling carbon monoxide Not a direct word is heard from any of Mr Sinatras four wives according to the publisher Miss Gardner spoke to an associate of Ms Kelleys in London the other former wives and Mr Sinatras present wife refused to talk to the author not a word from two of his three children  indeed scarcely a word is heard about one of them Tina under the theory I suppose that what Government committees investigating Mr Sinatras mob ties had to say to and about him is more revealing than anything that could be said by or about her Kirk Douglas Gregory Peck Johnny Carson all are listed as friends and none is heard from Nor do we hear from such loyaluntodeath friends as the radio broadcaster William B Williams Remarkably few words are heard from the actors with whom Mr Sinatra made more than 50 movies Little enough is heard from musicians in general and nothing is heard from black jazz musicians How is it possible to write about Frank Sinatra in a manner that suggests his music is in some way extrinsic to him Were not after all talking about some guy with a freak voice box that emits pleasant sounds Were talking about a man whose music is theres no other way to put this  wise what he doesnt know about memory and desire yearning and hard loving tenderness and betrayal isnt worth knowing That is what his voice tells us How is it possible for Mr Sinatras life to tell us something entirely different Everything he sings sounds autobiographical    and everything he sings he sings to me How can a man I love a man my daughter loves a man my father loved were talking about three generations here by extension were talking about millions of people and were talking silk and polyester because Frank Sinatras appeal is not classbased  how can this man hang out with mobsters have his bodyguards beat up hapless fans and discarded women pimp as Peter Lawford unlovingly put it for one President and grovel to another How Why Can the Freedom of Information Act which Ms Kelley employed extensively tell me why Mr Sinatra is given on the one hand to vicious KingKong tantrums and on the other to sweet family feeling and acts of fabulous generosity It cannot Ms Kelley may be able to convince me that Mr Sinatra associated with Chicago mobsters and that he  along with Eddie Fisher Sammy Davis Jr and Dean Martin  performed at a mobowned nightclub without a fee in order to bring in the high rollers She never tells me why if they were so cozy none of these wiseguys so powerful could or did come to Mr Sinatras aid when his career was on the skids in the late 1940s and early 50s and even his agent thought he was as good as dead Ms Kelley cant in fact tell me why Mr Sinatra did anything What are his demons What terrible fear caused him to lose his voice he opened his mouth and nothing came out during the bad years and sometimes during the good years Why did he have to conquer every attractive woman on the MGM lot Ms Kelley tells us that his mother sometimes dressed him in girls clothes He had more money and toys than the other kids on the block And he was beaten and abused by his buddies when he was a teenager because of his success with women So are we to assume that the answers all lie in his childhood Are we meant to connect the dots Ms Kelley makes that difficult because her grasp of Italian immigrant life in Hoboken NJ where the air smelled of    garlic is to put it kindly unsure Mr Sinatras mother Dolly to whom he was intensely loyal was Ms Kelley alleges an abortionist as well as a big mouth and a power in local New Jersey politics What conclusions are we meant to draw from this What did Dolly Sinatras one son draw from this What does Ms Kelley make of this Does Ms Kelley not approve of abortion Or does she not approve of abortion when Mr Sinatras mother is the abortionist Ms Kelley because of her ignorance of immigrant life fails to place Dolly Sinatra in context She was profane She swore She called some of her sons women whores So exactly what Southern Italian immigrants of Dolly Sinatras generation lived dangerously the surrounding society gave them little choice Their cursing was often a measure of their affection Okay you bastards Into the kitchen Ive made some linguine Very crude and unladylike of Dolly Sinatra But ladies did not as a rule migrate to Hoboken Ms Kelley makes the assumption that quiet Martin Sinatra Frank Sinatras father was emasculated by his wife In ItalianAmerican families tough noisy women are often the rule And it is almost impossible for an outsider to locate the source of power in these families  the whole canny point being to deceive the outside world IF I were to venture a guess about Frank Sinatras demons Id say that he grew up dangerously  and in danger  and when without time to shift psychic gears he found himself elevated to an almostunheardofcelebrity he continued to live dangerously having become addicted to danger Only as our icon the boy who was once clubbed became the man who clubbed pity Humphrey Bogart whose wife Lauren Bacall had an affair with Mr Sinatra while Mr Bogart was dying of cancer  nobody in Hollywood seems to be able to control him or herself for more than five minutes appears to have come close to understanding Mr Sinatra Hes kind of a Don Quixote tilting at windmills fighting people who dont want to fight Hes a cophater If he doesnt know who you are and you ask him a question he thinks youre a cop Id say he is both terrified and fascinated by his own life from which he draws insufficient joy I was Mr Sinatra once said about his early career I was everything Happy I dont know It was the darnedest thing wasnt it There is every chance in the world that I am wrong Id like to be given an inspired explanation an evocation or an inventive exploration of Mr Sinatras life As I listen to him elegantly sing There used to be a ball park  a song that raises nostalgia to an art  I ask myself whether his life springs from one set of impulses and needs and his work from another or whether the same impulses and needs are acted out differently in his life and in his work  so radically differently as to give rise to the awful notion that Francis Albert Sinatra  a man bruised and bruising  is so divided as to be crazy To try in print to reconcile irreconcilable differences is noble work it is part of what biography is about and it is labor to be proud of Ms Kelley undertook to write a biography of a man she justly calls one of the most fascinating men in the world instead she compiled facts The facts break my heart

NATIONAL ROLE IS SEEN FOR ARIZONA NOMINEE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/us/national-role-is-seen-for-arizona-nominee.html,After a run of horrendously bad luck Representative John McCain has been blessed with good fortune of an extraordinary kind and he now seems poised to emerge as a significant figure in national politics as a member of the United States Senate Mr McCain was born to a Navy career his grandfather commanded aircraft carriers under Adm William F Halsey in World War II and his father served as Commander in Chief Pacific in the Vietnam war Mr McCain himself a naval aviator seemed sure to become the familys third admiral But even though he survived a terrible fire aboard the USS Enterprise in the Gulf of Tonkin it was not to be On Oct 27 1967 his A4 Skyhawk was hit by enemy fire over North Vietnam He ejected breaking bones in both arms and one leg and falling into a lake in central Hanoi His captors called him the crown prince smashed one of his shoulders and kept him in solitary confinement for much of the next five and a half years When he was let out according to fellow captives he was the very model of obstinacy After the war Mr McCain his hair turned silver by his ordeal and his body racked by arthritis returned to active duty for a time serving as a liaison officer in the Senate where he made friends with a crosssection of its members including William S Cohen Republican of Maine and Gary Hart Democrat of Colorado But his injuries ultimately forced his retirement He and his young wife Cindy the daughter of a prosperous Phoenix beer distributor decided to move to Arizona to start a new life Mr McCain had a general interest in politics he said the other day but no specific plans New Luck in New Life Then the lucky breaks started Representative John J Rhodes then the House minority leader decided to retire in 1982 After a close fourway primary Mr McCain was elected to succeed him He was also elected president of the freshman class in the House made friends across the aisle with such Democrats as Morris K Udall of Arizona and Paul Simon of Illinois and was marked down as a comer Then some months ago Senator Barry Goldwater a symbol of the new conservatism since 1952 the Republican Presidential nominee in 1964 a muchbeloved figure here and in Washington even among those who hated his ideology announced his retirement opening the way for Mr McCain to win the Republican senatorial nomination almost by acclamation And then Gov Bruce E Babbitt a popular conservative Democrat decided that he could better pursue his Presidential ambitions free of the burdens of office than in the Senate Suddenly five years after arriving in the state Mr McCain had a clear path to a seat in the Senate Despite a few stumbles  his handpicked candidate for Governor was beaten in the primary by the man Mr McCain describes as the Harold Stassen of Arizona politics Evan Mecham  Mr McCain has had little trouble with his Democratic opponent Richard Kimball Mr Kimball has repeatedly attacked Mr McCain as the captive of military contractors and as unfriendly to the elderly but he has made no headway A trio of recent opinion polls show the Republican with a lead ranging from 19 to 28 percentage points Reputation in the House Mr McCain who is 50 years old developed a reputation in his early days in the House as a Tipbaiter that is as a member of the group of pugnacious Republicans also including Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia who often clashed with the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr Democrat of Massachusetts They disagreed most sharply on aid to the Nicaraguan rebels which Mr McCain backs although equally vociferously reflecting his Vietnam experience he opposes the idea of sending American troops to Central America He also opposed sending the Marines to Lebanon In recent years however he has taken a much more moderate stand particularly on social issues He has worked hard on Indian affairs he applauds Representative Jack F Kemp of upstate New York not so much for his economic philosophy but because hes the one man in our party who consistently voices concern for blacks and other people who are underprivileged Mr McCain has backed sanctions against South Africa and he has voted with the environmentalists on a number of issues affecting Arizona Mr McCain says he admires Mr Goldwaters integrity and honor but he makes it clear that he has no intention of becoming the new Mr Conservative At a campaign rally in nearby Mesa on Sunday night for example Mr McCain told of a recent conversation with the Senator He assured me that if he had won in 1964 Mr McCain said I would never have been in a Vietnamese prison camp I guess thats right he said he answered alluding to Mr Goldwaters reputation for foreign policy bellicosity it would have been a Chinese prison camp On domestic matters Mr McCain said he tried to bear in mind the changes that have transformed Arizona since Mr Goldwater wrote The Conscience of a Conservative 30 years ago In 1950 Phoenix had 106000 residents now the metropolitan area is approaching a population of two million Many of those people came from California and the Midwest he said and they dont care very deeply about school prayer and abortion Theyre in favor of one and opposed to the other and so am I but what they are really concerned about is better education clean air ample water supplies and so on They arent ideologues at all If elected Mr McCain expects to devote much of his time to foreign policy He says he does not want to spend his energies just counting warheads but wants to address larger strategic questions defining what our national interests are much more carefully so we can spend our national defense dollars more intelligently People in both parties here and in Washington expect him to make a big impact Robert E B Allen Mr Babbitts closest political associate said Because of his background John will be able to take tough stands that others might be penalized for I think hes going to be an outstanding Senator

him This is their first attempt to make love We ended up in my bed together sort of spastic and looped doomed for failure like two senile inventors in an upstairs room lonely as spoons The whole business finally seemed less an expression of mutual attraction than a soft noodly act of existentialism Benna and Gerard eventually do become lovers and she sits in a rinkydink cocktail lounge where he sings and plays piano and dreams of becoming an opera star Then Benna gets pregnant the imaginary Eleanor sleeps with Gerard and Benna has an abortion Miraculously the relationship between Benna and Gerard not only survives these events but becomes a deep close friendship Throughout all of this we are treated to Bennas reflections which often take the form of quirky fond musings on words  Have fun in Tunis Id say as he disappeared off to rehearsals I liked to say Tunis It sounded obscene like a rarely glimpsed body part Words roll around in Bennas mind like Life Savers on a tongue Beneath the sweet pleasure of play however we sense her need for something else some deeper articulation that will exorcise distance bring her love and keep her from death Watching a flock of birds she muses From four blocks away I could see that the flock had a kind of grouplife a recognizable intelligence no doubt in its random flutters there were patterns but alone any one of those black birds would not have known what was up Alone as people live they would crash their heads against walls To avoid hitting the wall Benna falls in love with Darrel a black Vietnam veteran who is taking her poetry class Race is something Benna tries to avoid through her almost magical belief that whatever separates us can be overcome if we find the right words She assigns sestinas to her poetry class writing on the blackboard the end words race white erotic lost need love leave Darrel raises his hand and says thats seven words not six Benna erases love then changes her mind and erases white It is a loss in the novel that this particular relationship is not developed further Its unfortunate too that the changes of place and point of view in the beginning chapters interrupt and confuse us so that we move away from the story Some of the early chapters read almost as if they were independent entities and it may be that Ms Moores talents as a shortstory writer revealed in her collection SelfHelp tempted her in that direction These opening chapters are like a magnificent engine alone on its track We watch waiting for the hookup which we get only in the last section of the book Here we meet a wondrous 6yearold Georgianne Michelle Carpenter who is Bennas imaginary daughter And it is here that so much of the power and impact of the novel begin to make themselves felt George and Benna have a very good time a sweet happiness flows between them as they watch the news take showers together on Saturday mornings to the tunes of Broadway shows dust the living room and revel in the intimacy of sickroom caresses and goodnight kisses Benna loves Georgianne intensely and in this love which is sustained only by words we discover how much this novel is about language about the power of sounds to slice through the darkness and through meaning to join us It is a tribute to Lorrie Moores talent that the reader believes in Georgianne UNEXPECTEDLY Gerard dies a brutal blow to Benna who makes one last painful effort to connect by visiting her lost hapless brother Louis When she and Louis wind up watching a sitcom about a dog on Christmas day in a dreary Queens apartment Bennas humor erupts in a swift savage swipe Her mind wandered She thought of pets growing tired and committing suicide what notes they would leave Dear Benna Its all a crazy game Farewell Max Your Schnauzer  We think Benna may now have lost her real connections in the world But were wrong There are stronger ties still There are Bennas gifts imagination and language  and there is the child Georgianne Bennas love for this child  like Anagrams itself  is a powerful example of how imagination can save us with temporary pleasures In a Constant State of Surprise When Lorrie Moores characters want to behave in unconventional ways she gives in to their whims When you write a novel you are supposed to keep characters on a linear path But in Anagrams my characters wanted to do mutually exclusive things and since it was my novel I decided they could do anything they wanted to do said the 29yearold author in a telephone interview from her home in Madison where she teaches fiction workshops at the University of Wisconsin She insisted that her characters and situations are completely fictional But like her main character Benna she is intrigued by the power of imagination and language Overall the novel is about the enterprise of making fictions she said I was inspired by the idea of an anagram which is the rearrangement of characters to make a new word What I did was rearrange characters to make new worlds While this may sound playful she admitted that the novel has some serious concerns I think of it as a novel about solitude imagination hysteria and childlessness In each of the sections the characters confront childlessness in different ways Ms Moore seemed detached from the praise for her first book SelfHelp a collection of short stories originally written as a masters thesis Even so she confesses that the whole process of publishing is overwhelming I was surprised mostly when Knopf bought my first book  since then Ive been in a constant state of surprise Youre so alone when you write that you tend to be unaffected by reviews You only wonder whether you can write something again you can believe in  Barbara Lovenheim
GOVERNOR'S RACE TAKES TO STREETS IN THE CAMPAIGN'S LAST WEEKEND,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/02/nyregion/governor-s-race-takes-to-streets-in-the-campaign-s-last-weekend.html,Only three days before the election New Yorks gubernatorial race finally turned to some oldfashioned street campaigning yesterday Governor Cuomo urged a rally of a thousand Brooklynites to help him by electing Democratic legislators while his Republican opponent Andrew P ORourke went to Queens to say that a vote for Republicans was a vote for honesty The full day of politicking was unusual in a race in which Mr Cuomo has declined to campaign choosing instead to appear as gubernatorial as possible and Mr ORourke strapped for money and hampered by the Governors strategy has had trouble getting his message to the voters Record Margins Sought In addition to the governor New York voters will select a United States senator and other statewide officials Tuesday in an election where the major question appears to be not the outcome but how large the victory margins will be Mr Cuomo and Senator Alfonse M DAmato a Republican challenged by Mark Green are seeking record margins of victory The polls will be open from 6 AM to 9 PM Connecticut voters will choose their governor senator six members of the House of Representatives and both houses of the General Assembly Polls there will be open from 6 AM to 8 PM New Jersey voters will elect the states 14 members of the House of Representatives executives in Bergen and Essex Counties and will vote on a 200 million bond issue for toxic waste cleanup Polls will open from 7 AM to 8 PM In New York Mr Cuomo and Mr DAmato are favored by polls and politicians to win reelection handily Most incumbents are also expected to win reelection to the House of Representatives the State Senate the State Assembly county offices and judgeships from the State Supreme Court to district courts It will be the year of the incumbent said the Conservative Party chairman Serphin R Maltese echoing politicians of all parties However four Republican Representatives  Bill Green in Manhattan Joseph J DioGuardi in Westchester and Fred J Eckert and George C Wortley in central New York  face stiff challenges Mr DioGuardis opponent is Bella S Abzug who once represented the West Side of Manhattan and was considered one of the most outspoken and colorful members of the House In three of the states 34 House districts there is no incumbent In addition to the four House races Democrats hope that the trend favoring incumbents can be broken by candidates for the State Senate The party thinks Mr Cuomos political appeal may help it win control of the Senate giving the Democrats control of both the legislative and executive branches The Senate has been controlled by Republicans for decades and party leaders expressed confidence that they would survive a Cuomo tide The Assembly has been a Democratic preserve since the 1960s and even the most optimistic Republican leaders do not expect that to change The scandals and corruption indictments that have rocked the Koch administration and the Democratic Party in the Bronx and Queens are apparently having almost no effect although Mr ORourke who has fluctuated in his use of the issue made reference to it yesterday in street campaigning in Queens Targets of Inquiry Three Bronx Democrats who are targets of separate investigations are among the incumbents expected to win State Senator Joseph L Galiber currently on trial on corruption charges Representative Mario Biaggi under investigation by Federal prosecutors and Surrogate Bertram Gelfand under investigation by the State Commission on Judicial Conduct for more than a year over sexual harassment allegations A key legislative race is the effort of Democratic Assemblyman Albert Vann to win reelection on the Liberal Party line He had lost the Democratic nomination beause of faulty petitions Last year he ran unsuccessfully for Brooklyn borough president and played a leading role in the unsuccesful effort to defeat Mayor Koch More than eight million voters about half of them Democrats are eligible to vote in New York In the last three elections for governor about five million New Yorkers voted  from 71 to 75 percent of those registered New Jersey election officials say 48 percent of the states 37 million registered voters are expected to vote The turnout is expected to be highest in the two largest counties where there are races for county executive In Essex County the incumbent Peter Shapiro a Democrat faces Nicholas R Amato the Couty Surrogate who switched to the Republican party for the election Bergen County is electing its first executive Voters will chose between William D McDowell the county sheriff and a Republican and Senator Matthew Feldman Democrat of Teaneck Heading the ticket for Conneticuts 167 million eligible voters is the governors race pitting the incumbent William A ONeill against State Representative Julie D Belaga of Westport United States Senator Christoper J Dodd a Democrat is being challenged for a second term by Roger W Eddy the states Republican National Committeeman In New York Cuomo campaign strategists acknowledge that their goal is to win with at least 585 percent of the vote the record for a contest for governor set by Grover Cleveland 104 years ago Four years ago Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan established the record for a Senate candidate in the state with a 65 percent victory Those are the numbers both the Governor and Mr DAmato are reaching for The key to such a large victory for Mr Cuomo will be Republican voters just as defecting Democrats are even more critical for Mr DAmato in a state where Republicans comprise about one third of the registration Eye on White House The Governor has said he is not a candidate for President but his closest aides do not discourage the belief of other politicians that he will start running for the 1988 Democratic presidential nomination sometime next year Another potential Presidential candidate Representative Jack F Kemp a Republican is on the ballot in western New York seeking his eighth term in the House He is favored to win easily The Governor is trying to keep Republicans in his camp with a television commercial that began airing this weekend and that asks voters of all parties to support Mr Cuomo It includes a past statement by Senator DAmato that Mr Cuomo is a strong Governor Mr Cuomo is spending about 250000 on his last week of commercials more than twice what Mr ORourke and Mr Green are spending Mr DAmato is spending 600000 for television in the last week At the same time Mr ORourke is trying to shore up his Republican vote and head off a possible rout He campaigned in Republican areas of Queens yesterday and has arranged appearances in every major city in normally Republican upstate today and tomorrow A second new Cuomo commercial features the Governor appealing for voters to cast their ballots even if not for him Cuomo aides fear that a small turnout could tarnish his anticipated victory or at the very least reduce his popular vote plurality Politicians generally fear that the vote will be low because of the widespread perception that there are no real contests at the top of the ticket In the Democratic primary in September to choose Mr DAmatos opponent only 13 percent of the Democratic electorate turned out a record low for a statewide primary Also strongly favored to win are Representative Stanley N Lundine Mr Cuomos choice for lieutenant governor who has been an almost invisible campaigner and another Democrat Attorney General Robert Abrams Their Republican opponents are Ulster County District Attorney Michael Kavanagh and Nassau County Comptroller Peter T King respectively The only Republican among the state officials the Comptroller Edward V Regan is also favored for reelection However he has not been quite as strong in the polls as the other incumbents and his Democratic opponent Herman Badillo is hoping for what he calls the sandwich effect  that Democrats voting for the Governor and Mr Abrams on either side of Mr Badillo on the ballot will stay on the Democratic or Liberal Party line to support him Problem for Minor Parties A significant contest involves the gubernatorial vote of the three minor parties  the Conservative Party which is supporting Mr ORourke the Liberal Party which endorsed the Governor and the Right to Life Party which ran its own candidate for governor Nassau County District Attorney Denis E Dillon a Democrat Polls by candidates and a newspaper have indicated a Dillon vote of three to six percent or 150000 to 300000 votes Four years ago the party polled 52000 votes for governor and dropped from fourth to fifth place in party ranking on the voting machine a position that is established by the gubernatorial vote Raymond B Harding the Liberal Party leader expressed concern about the Right to Life Party showing and urged voters who are for abortion rights to express their views by voting the Liberal line New York voters will also decide on a proposed 145 billion bond issue to clean up hundreds of toxic waste dumps in the state Both the governor and Mr ORourke support the bond issue
An Incredible Endorsement for the Senate; What Is He Delivering?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/03/opinion/l-an-incredible-endorsement-for-the-senate-what-is-he-delivering-911286.html,To the Editor Your arguments against Mark Green for Senator are ironic at best You criticize him for not demonstrating support among Democrats yet he resoundingly won the Democratic primary  a stunning upset in a race in which he was outspent six to one Mr Green has also won the endorsements of key officeholders party figures and policy makers including that of his former opponent John Dyson You condemn him for not having broad support after the press displayed a near blackout on the senatorial campaign You purport to measure his qualifications but dont address much less criticize his record or positions except to praise him for advocating sensible deregulation and for not being a doctrinaire liberal You acknowledge Alfonse DAmatos acquiescence in corruption as Town of Hempstead Presiding Supervisor and his role as sole character witness for an organizedcrime figure But you quickly dismiss these infractions by confusing the issue with Mr DAmatos euphemistic slogan He delivers When the Senator obtains Federal aid for New York after voting to have it cut how much can he be congratulated What is he delivering when he votes to cut Social Security Medicare and aid and loans for New York students Whom is he representing when he is a sponsor of a bill to make all abortions a capital offense as he did early in his term How much of a clear appreciation of public outrage over drugs does he have when he votes to cut millions of dollars from antidrug programs for New York By voting consistently in correlation with his contributions from special interests totaling 13 million like the handgun lobby defense contractors and oil companies as documented in The Wall Street Journal Senator DAmato not Mark Green provokes inevitable questions about his capacity to represent all of New York ADAM R LEVIN New York Oct 29 1986
GREEN CROSSES THE STATE IN A CLOSING-DAY WHIRL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/nyregion/green-crosses-the-state-in-a-closing-day-whirl.html,While Senator Alfonse M DAmato took a respite from the campaign trail today apparently comfortable with his lead in the polls his Democratic challenger Mark Green was making a hectic lastday whirl around the state He flew into Long Island from Albany drove to Manhattan flew to Buffalo then drove by van to Rochester and on to Syracuse Ill campaign as long as its purposeful he said as the roadsides of upstate New York zipped by At every stop on the steps of the State Supreme Court in Mineola LI flanked by Governor Cuomo and 15 children at the Lenox Hill Neighborhood Head Start Program on East 70th Street outside the Erie County Hall and the Rochester City Hall and inside a hotel in Syracuse he trumpeted the same theme that he is a family Democrat committed to supporting programs and laws that benefit women and children I want a policy thats profamily not unwittingly antifamily Mr Green said at the Head Start Program He then listed a few of his opponents positions saying that Mr DAmato was against a womans right to have an abortion the proposed Equal Rights Amendment and pay equity for women I would support all of those he said Governor Cuomo urged Mr Greens election Mark Green I predict is going to shock you tomorrow with the results Mr Cuomo said But though he was surrounded by giggling singing children  and the Governor  in Manhattan Mr Green faced only a brisk wind and two television reporters in Buffalo This is the 19th time Ive come to Buffalo he said with his wife Deni Frand and their 7yearold daughter Jenya beside him If I come here anymore Ill have to pay property taxes Its a Strategy Once in Rochester he stood among a handful of supporters outside City Hall I joked at first that my goal was to peak at the wire he told them Its no longer a joke Its a strategy Once in Syracuse he again stressed his daily theme of the family Then he reminded the 100 or so supporters and local politicians assembled that he had just visited Syracuse on Saturday and he ticked off a list of seven cities he had visited in the last 24 hours I may be a senator wholl wear you out but Ill never be a senator wholl let you down he said then headed for his flight back to New York City and Election Day
COURT UPHOLDS FUNDS FOR FAMILY PLANNING CLINIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/court-upholds-funds-for-family-planning-clinic.html,The Supreme Court ruled today that states may not deny family planning grants to private groups merely because they use money from other sources to offer abortions and abortion counseling The 5to3 decision was issued without an opinion and without full briefing or oral arguments It affirmed a Federal appellate decision striking down a 1980 Arizona provision barring grants of state money that year to any groups that offer abortions abortion procedures counseling for abortion procedures or abortion referrals The United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit ruled that the Constitution bars states from denying state money to a group providing stateapproved family planning services merely because that group also provides abortion services and abortion counseling a form of free speech This was the ruling the Supreme Court affirmed Direct Financing Ban Upheld On the other hand the appellate court upheld a related provision of the Arizona law which barred use of state money to pay directly for abortions counseling or other abortionrelated services The Supreme Court did not rule directly on the constitutionality of that provision Todays action left intact previous Court decisions upholding Federal and state laws that bar direct use of public money to pay for abortions The Court has previously indicated that those decisions did not necessarily mean that states may penalize groups providing abortionrelated services by cutting off state financing for other services approved by the state Chief Justice William H Rehnquist and Associate Justices Byron R White and Antonin Scalia dissenting from todays action said the Court should have ordered full briefing and oral arguments in the case Justice Sandra Day OConnor disqualified herself She did not offer a reason In the past members of her family have worked in behalf of Planned Parenthood one of the parties in the case creating a possible conflict of interest Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall Harry A Blackmun Lewis F Powell Jr and John Paul Stevens the only members of the Court who have consistently supported broad abortion rights voted to affirm the Ninth Circuits decision Narrow Interpretation Expected While todays ruling theoretically set a precedent binding on all lower courts such summary affirmances without opinions are read narrowly as governing only situations virtually identical to the one resolved by the Courts ruling Somewhat similar state laws in Illinois Ohio Minnesota Missouri Montana and North Dakota have previously been struck down by lower courts While antiabortion groups denounced the decision Babbitt v Planned Parenthood No 86369 some abortion rights activists said they were not pleased either These five Supreme Court Justices in effect told the State of Arizona We five know we favor abortion so dont bother us with legal arguments  said Douglas Johnson legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee an antiabortion group Janet Benshoof of the American Civil Liberties Union one of the lawyers for the two Arizona chapters of Planned Parenthood that were involved in the case said Its not going to have much value as a precedent She said it was disturbing that todays action had not been unanimous A Free Speech Issue This was a free speech issue whether the state can penalize organizations that engage in speech about abortion by denying them state funding Ms Benshoof asserted She said she had hoped that even the Justices who oppose abortion rights would agree that the Arizona law violated the First Amendment right of free speech because it penalized groups that offer abortion counseling The state had argued in its appeal that the only way to make sure state money for familyplanning programs would not be used for abortion and abortionrelated services was to cut off the financing of the two Planned Parenthood chapters that provide such services in the state The appellate court rejected this argument on the ground that the state could monitor Planned Parenthoods use of state money to make sure it was spent on services unrelated to abortion
VERMONT GOVERNOR MAY FAIL TO GET MAJORITY SHE NEEDS TO WIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/vermont-governor-may-fail-to-get-majority-she-needs-to-win.html,Political experts in Vermont say Gov Madeleine M Kunin a Democrat may win the largest number of votes Tuesday but fall short of the 50 percent majority required for election by the Vermont State Constitution That would throw the contest into the hands of the Legislature It really looks like Madeleine will win a plurality but not a majority said James Welch the executive editor of The Burlington Free Press So it will go to the Legislature where anything can happen Under the Vermont Constitution a candidate for statewide office must receive at least one vote more than 50 percent or have the outcome determined by a joint vote of the two houses of the Legislature The situation is complicated by the requirement that the vote be held by the legislators who will be elected Tuesday Democrats and Republicans now hold an equal number of seats in the state House and Senate She Says She Is Confident Mrs Kunin a 53 yearold Swissborn liberal Democrat said today I am confident I can still make the 50 percent majority though it will be close Two polls conducted at the end of October for The Burlington Free Press and The Rutland Herald gave her 43 to 46 percent of likely voters Her Republican challenger Lieut Gov Peter P Smith got 31 to 32 percent and Bernard Sanders the Socialist Mayor of Burlington who is running as an independent received 11 to 12 percent The polls each surveyed 500 likely voters The margin of sampling error is four percentage points either way It is Mr Sanderss presence in the race that has hurt Mrs Kunin the most political analysts here agree because he draws votes away from her on Vermonts increasingly active left If the election is thrown into the Legislature Mrs Kunin insists she will still win since it would disenfranchise the people of Vermont if the legislators voted for a candidate who did not receive the most votes Three Times It Did Otherwise But the Legislature has three times not elected the person with the most votes And in 1976 a Republicandominated legislature chose T Garry Buckley a Republican over John Alden a Democrat for lieutenant governor though Mr Alden won a plurality in the popular election Mrs Kunin praised for strengthening Vermonts already stringent environmental laws erasing a large budget deficit and increasing state aid to education has been hurt by the energy thrown into two other elections here this fall These are the Senate race between the incumbent Democrat Patrick J Leahy and former Gov Richard A Snelling the Republican nominee and a referendum question for Vermont to adopt the equal rights amendment in its state Constitution An awful lot of people who supported Madeleine in 1984 have gone off to work for Leahy or the ERA said Garrison Nelson a professor of political science at the University of Vermont Her campaign hasnt generated much excitement this time and she has lost a lot of her volunteers Some liberals are trying to send her a message Senator Leahy appears a strong favorite for reelection against Mr Snelling a popular fourterm former governor whom the Reagan White House urged to enter the race Reagan Cancels Plan to Visit The two polls taken last week gave Senator Leahy 58 to 60 percent of the likely voters with only 30 to 34 percent for Mr Snelling Mr Snellings showing has been so disappointing that Mr Reagan backed out of a campaign stop in Vermont Mr Nelson attributed Senator Leahys success in part to a superb campaign organization the best weve ever seen in Vermont Mary Beth Cahill Senator Leahys campaign director also pointed to Vermonts tradition of not turning out incumbent senators and the negative tone of Mr Snellings campaign which people in Vermont resent At the advice of the Washington political consulting concern of Black Manafort  Stone Mr Snelling has attacked Senator Leahy as a big spender and as failing to attend meetings of the Senate Agriculture Committee of which he is a member Emotional Campaign on ERA The most emotional contest has been the state equal rights question Although the proposed amendment died as a national cause when the time for passing a Federal constitutional amendment ran out in 1982 three states short of the twothirds needed for ratification it is still alive in some states Five attempts to add an equal rights amendment to a state constitution have been defeated in the last nine years most recently in Maine where supporters were given an unexpected lashing in 1984 Nicholas Monsarrat managing editor of The Rutland Herald said he expected the amendment to win in Vermont next week but by a very narrow vote One reason is that nearly all the major candidates have voiced support for it Another is that in recent years Vermont has become increasingly liberal with an influx of people from Boston and New York who brought their political activism to the Green Mountains Increase in Immigration According to the Census Bureau the number of Vermonts 535000 residents born out of state increased to more than a third in 1980 from a fifth in 1960 The proequal rights amendment forces in Vermont have also been wellorganized to counter widespread negative ads some of which say that passage of the amendment would lead to more abortions and homosexual marriages If Mrs Kunin is reelected it is possible Vermont could become the first state in the country to have women as both governor and lieutenant governor Susan Auld a moderate Republican who is the majority leader in the state House of Representatives is locked in a close race for the lieutenant governors spot Mrs Kunins running mate who must be elected separately is Howard Dean of Burlington a Democratic member of the Vermont House
COURT WON'T HEAR 2 BUSING APPEALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/court-won-t-hear-2-busing-appeals.html,The Supreme Court declined today to resolve an apparent conflict among Federal appellate courts on how to deal with efforts by school boards to dismantle courtordered desegregation plans which could be the most important desegregation issue of the next decade To the surprise of some legal experts the Court declined to review both a ruling that allowed Norfolk Va to end its courtordered busing of elementary children and a seemingly conflicting ruling against the school board in Oklahoma City In another case the Court decided in a 5to3 ruling that states may not deny family planning grants to otherwise eligible private groups merely because they use money from other sources to offer abortions and abortion counseling [ Page A27 ] In brief orders denying review in the desegregation case only Associate Justice Byron R White said he wanted to hear the cases which the Court has been mulling for several weeks None of the Courts members wrote opinions to explain their votes Speculation on Decision There was speculation among Court observers that some Justices concluded it would be better to leave lower courts with broad discretion for the moment even at the risk of inconsistencies than to lay down a national rule specifying legal standards for ending courtordered desegregation plans Some civil rights lawyers privately indicated concern that by declining to prevent Norfolk from dismantling its courtordereded busing plan the Court might have given encouragement to other cities considering similar steps Rex E Lee a Washington lawyer who was Solicitor General of the United States from 1981 to 1985 and who represented the Oklahoma City school board in one case said that in my opinion this is the most important unresolved issue in the school desegregation area Mr Lee while expressing surprise at the Courts action noted that many times the Court feels more comfortable waiting for a time before it tackles the real blockbuster issues The Norfolk plan in ending busing assigned nearly 40 percent of black students from kindergarten through sixth grade to 10 virtually allblack schools near virtually allblack public housing complexes The United States Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit upheld this plan on the basis of a 1975 ruling by a Federal district judge that the school system had achieved unitary status or desegregation by successfully using busing and other means to end official segregation of schools there It held that this finding freed the school board to end busing and assign students to the schools nearest their homes as long as its purpose was not racial discrimination It said the plan had the legitimate purpose of producing enough schools with a majority of white students to end white flight which the courts found had been caused by busing and to attract whites back to the citys schools Appeal by Black Parents This is a case of enormous and sweeping impact lawyers for black parents said in their Supreme Court appeal Riddick v School Board No 851962 The rule of law announced by the courts below would  if followed generally  permit a very general resegregation of the public schools of the South The Reagan Administration has applauded the Norfolk plan adopted in 1983 and put into effect when schools opened Sept 2 as a model for other communities seeking to end courtordered busing The Supreme Court cleared the way in June for the Norfolk plan to go into effect this fall by refusing a request by black parents for an interim order to continue the 15yearold busing plan while their appeal was pending The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit issued a decision in June in the Oklahoma case that conflicted with at least part of the Fourth Circuits reasoning in the Norfolk case The 10th Circuit court held that a school district seeking to dismantle a courtordered busing plan must meet a heavy burden of justification regardless of its status as a unitary system The 10th Circuit court ordered further court proceedings on a challenge by black parents to the Oklahoma City school boards decision to end busing of students in grades 1 through 4 and place them in neighborhood schools The school boards appeal which the Supreme Court turned down today was Board of Education v Dowell No 86326
"THE POLITICAL CAMPAIGN; FROM GAMBLING TO ECOLOGY, VOTERS IN 43 STATES TAKE UP BALLOT ISSUES TODAY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/04/us/political-campaign-gambling-ecology-voters-43-states-take-up-ballot-issues-today.html,Voters in several states where moral opposition to gambling has been strong in the past must decide Tuesday whether to turn to it as a way to offset declining tax revenue Although governmentsponsored lotteries and other gambling have become common in many places particularly in the Northeast as an easy means of helping to finance education or other public services most inland states have held out Now however states whose economies are dependent on agriculture and natural resources or on manufacturing hurt by foreign imports have found themselves squeezed between rising demands for services and loss of tax money Largely because of this Kansas Idaho Montana North Dakota South Dakota Oregon Missouri and Florida have gambling propositions on the ballot in the general election 226 Statewide Issues Face Voters The proposals have sparked controversy A strong Montana society is built on hard work patience and sustained effort says the leader of the opposition to a Montana lottery referendum the Rev George Harper a Methodist Lotteries sell fantasy values and take advantage of human weaknesses The ballot propositions on gambling are among 226 statewide initiatives those originated by citizen petition and referendums those proposed by legislatures or other government bodies before voters in 43 states And most like the ones on gambling deal with tough emotional issues that many citizens as well as the elected representative bodies of government prefer to take directly to the electorate for a decision They include abortion toxic waste disposal tax limitation criminal punishment and educational reforms among others In addition to statewide ballot propositions hundreds of similar proposals will be decided by voters in counties or cities Increasing Use of Ballot Use of the popular vote to bypass elected officials or to relieve them of the responsibility of dealing with difficult issues has been high for close to a decade Though used often in the past the ballot proposition increased in popularity in the late 1970s according to those who have been observing the development who cite a growing distrust in elected officials Its use increased rapidly when California voters put a ceiling on property taxes in 1978 resulting in a vast reduction of local governments revenue and causing a shift to the state of many services The movement reached its peak in 1982 according to David Schmidt the director of the Initiative Resource Center a private research group based in Washington and has remained at that level since But the process seems to be more intense this year according to Kristin R Blair associate editor of Initiative and Referendum Report a monthly periodical published in Washington because of the emotional nature of the issues and the fact that interest groups promoting these direct votes are better organized The process has become institutionalized in many states There are two party systems in Massachusetts  the Democratic Party and the referendum party says a Democratic state legislator Jack Flood noting the weakness of the Republican Party there When the Democratic Party doesnt respond the referendum party takes matters in its hands They did it in 1980 with Proposition 2 12 a measure that cut local property taxes to a maximum of 25 percent of the market value of a communitys real estate And now theyre doing it with tax caps he said referring to an effort to limit growth in state tax revenue to the level of growth in residents wages and salaries Gambling Five of the six states considering lotteries  Kansas Idaho Montana North and South Dakota  have serious budget problems and have been experiencing difficulty raising taxes to pay for services In South Dakota Secretary of State Alice Kundert said the lottery proposal was closely tied to the slumping farm economy and may well pass for that reason despite strong opposition She pointed out that a vast majority in the Legislature signed the bill that placed the referendum on the ballot and said the need for new revenue was the primary reason The same motives were said to be behind parimutuel wagering propositions on ballots in Missouri and Kansas and to some extent the proposed legalization of charity raffles in Oregon where private contributions are of increasing importance in a number of depressed communities In Florida where there is relative prosperity but strong opposition to new taxes there are propositions for both a lottery estimated to bring the state as much as 300 million a year and for allowing counties to permit gambling casinos in hotels which proponents say would help the states tourist industry Casino gambling has been defeated by Florida voters in the past and Gov Bob Graham is among those organizing opposition to it this year but the lottery has the support of a number of state officials who hope to use new revenue for education Abortion The longdivisive issue of abortion is on the ballot in only four states  Arkansas Massachusetts Oregon and Rhode Island  but both sides are waging major campaigns in those states because of what the outcome may portend The immediate effect if the propositions pass would be to restrict the spending of state tax money for abortions but the measures in Arkansas and Rhode Island would make abortions constitutionally illegal if and when the Supreme Court reverses its landmark 1973 decision Roe v Wade establishing a womans right to have an abortion Reversal of that decision is a prime goal of the right to life movement and the opportunity for President Reagan who opposes abortion to appoint justices has spurred the movements leaders to prepare for the time when the states would again decide the legality of abortions The National Abortion Rights Action League which supports a womans freedom to decide about abortion says such a reversal is a grim possibility given the newly constituted Court and has poured much of its resources into campaigns opposing the propositions On the other side a spokesman for proponents of the measure in Rhode Island said approval by the voters would send the Supreme Court a message Hazardous Waste The overriding issue in Washington state is the possibility that the Federal Government may pick a site within its borders as the prime dump for nuclear waste The Department of Energy picked sites in Washington Nevada and Texas as the three finalists for disposal and the Legislature at Olympia reacted with a hastily drawn referendum that if approved would attempt to veto any decision favoring the Washington site The issue became immediately involved in the political campaigns Dan Ashburn chairman of the Washington Waste Site Study Group termed the referendum a purely political move on the part of the Democratic Governor and Legislature to put an emotional issue on the ballot to get out the Democratic vote in November Legal experts say the chances of a veto of a Federal decision by a state or its voters is at best dubious but Gov Booth Gardner the leading advocate of the measure said the referendum is the best possible weapon to show that the Federal siteselection process is a travesty There are proposals on the ballots of five other states concerning waste disposal A New York proposal would allow the state to issue 145 billion in bonds for cleaning up waste sites and closing landfills in New Jersey a similar measure would authorize 200 million in bonds as the first stage in a 600 million cleanup program over five years A Massachusetts proposition would mandate a timetable for cleanup a California initiative would require greater efforts to keep toxic chemicals out of drinking water and a proposal in Oregon would stop the operation of nuclear power plants in that state until a site for disposal of the wastes is decided Taxes Howard Jarvis who inspired Proposition 13 in California eight years ago died last August but his legacy of citizens rising up against taxes lives on in taxcurtailment propositions in five states One is Proposition 62 in California which would require a twothirds vote of a local governing body and a majority vote of the people to approve any tax increase The most stringent of the measures is in Montana where antitax forces are seeking a contitutional amendment that would abolish all property taxes and require a majority public vote for approving sales or other taxes as a substitute The Massachusetts proposal in addition to the limit on tax growth would repeal a surcharge of 75 percent on the state income tax A Colorado initiative would require public approval of any new tax or tax increase And Oregon has separate initiatives on the ballot to both reduce and increase taxes There are minor proposals concerning taxes in a number of other states but the tax revolt of earlier years appears to have lost most of its force There is strong opposition to the more stringent ones and many states have recently been raising rather than lowering taxes Other Issues There are a broad range of other issues on the ballots this year Idaho for example has become a battleground over a referendum to strengthen its law that which bars making union membership a prerequisite for employment it is the first time in a number of years that this hardfought issue has been on the ballot in the United States In California supporters of the conspiracy theorist Lyndon H LaRouche Jr have placed a proposition on the ballot that would require that anyone suffering from AIDS be placed under quarantine Public opinion polls have indicated that the measure has little chance of passage California voters will also decide whether to make English the states official language Vermont voters will weigh an amendment to the State Constitution guaranteeing equal rights for women Oregon voters vote on whether to legalize growing of marijuana in backyards and Kansans will consider removing restrictions on the sale of liquor by the drink
WASHINGTON TALK; Tactical Alliances And the A.C.L.U.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/05/us/washington-talk-tactical-alliances-and-the-aclu.html,The American Civil Liberties Union has sometimes been portrayed by its critics as a leftwing lobby that is soft on law and order and many other causes favored by conservatives But increasingly in the last two years it has formed strategic alliances with groups from the conservative side of the political spectrum Such coalitions with people ranging from bankers to gun enthusiasts have become almost essential for liberals who want to survive and remain influential in a conservative era Moreover they illustrate a tactic that lobbyists of all political stripes have refined to a high art as Congress feels increasing pressure to slash Federal spending and eliminate tax subsidies The civil liberties union helped form a coalition that included many companies from the electronics industry and together they lobbied successfully for a law to protect the privacy of communciations transmitted by computers and other new forms of technology It joined tobacco companies and producers of alcoholic beverages in resisting efforts to ban the advertising of their products It joined conservatives including Justice Department officials and some moderate Republicans in opposing legislation that would have prevented former top officials like Michael K Deaver the former deputy chief of staff at the White House from lobbying on behalf of foreign governments With Bankers Too The civil liberties union worked closely with the American Bankers Association to protect the privacy rights of bank customers in a new law designed to combat money laundering It worked with the National Rifle Association to prevent the Justice Department from putting raw unverified investigative data into a national computer information network The ACLU has long opposed such computerized intelligence files The rifle association argued that such data would be used improperly to deny its members permits to buy or carry firearms And the civil liberties union joined the National Conservative Political Action Committee in fighting a bill known as the Clean Campaign Act which would have required broadcasters to give free air time to candidates who wanted to respond to negative advertising broadcast by independent political committees Morton H Halperin director of the Washington office of the civil liberties union says the group has not become more conservative than it was in the 1970s when it was in the forefront of efforts to regulate the Federal Bureau of Investigation and the Central Intelligence Agency But he added the union is perhaps more willing to enter into coalitions with groups from across the political spectrum When Strom Thurmond is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee he explained it is hard to enact legislation that promotes civil liberties unless we have new allies and coalitions Mr Thurmond a South Carolina Republican has staunchly supported most of the conservative positions taken by the Reagan Administration on criminal justice and civil rights NotSoStrange Bedfellows Jerry J Berman chief legislative counsel for the civil liberties union said its new allies might seem like strange bedfellows to people who had a stereotyped view of the ACLU as a leftwing organization In fact he said we do not choose our clients on the basis of their political beliefs John J Byrne assistant counsel of the American Bankers Association described Mr Berman as one of the best lobbyists in town He said their alliance in opposition to the disclosure of bank customers records without a subpoena or a court order had worked out very well Some lawmakers who wouldnt listen to the banks were open to persuasion by lobbyists from the ACLU he said The civil liberties union has also formed some novel alliances on immigration proposals It joined farm organizations and conservatives such as Senator James A McClure Republican of Idaho in lobbying for a requirement that immigration officers get a search warrant before entering a farm to question a person believed to be an alien Congress adopted this requirement over strenuous objections from Reagan Administration officials who said it would cripple enforcement of the immigration law in rural areas The civil liberties union also joined conservative Republican Senators such as Gordon J Humphrey of New Hampshire and Charles E Grassley of Iowa in an ultimately unsuccessful effort to prevent the return to the Soviet Union of a Ukrainian seaman who jumped ship in October last year Wade J Henderson associate director of the Washington office of the ACLU said the treatment of the seaman Miroslav Medved by the Immigration and Naturalization Service was an alltootypical violation of the spirit and letter of the Refugee Act of 1980 which established the standard for granting asylum The civil liberties group also joined the Chamber of Commerce of the United States and several other business groups in opposing a central element of the comprehensive immigration bill passed by Congress last month penalties against employers who hire illegal aliens To be sure their motives were somewhat different Whereas businesses objected to the burden of having to verify the citizenship status of job applicants the ACLU feared the bill would encourage discrimination against Hispanic people and other minority groups But they often worked together A Central Role Michael F Cavanagh executive director of the Electronic Mail Association a trade group said the ACLU had played a central role in assembling the coalition that won approval for the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 The law updates Federal wiretap statutes to protect the privacy of cellular telephone calls computer data communications and satellite television transmissions The civil liberties union has long argued that women should have access to abortions But it has vigorously opposed the use of the Federal racketeering law to bring civil suits against antiabortion groups that demonstrate peacefully outside abortion clinics Increasingly Mr Halperin said the racketeering law has been used against political groups exercising their First Amendment rights In seeking to change the law the civil liberties union has worked with a coalition of businesses which say the law has been misused to harass legitimate companies in common commerical disputes

THE ELECTIONS: OUT WITH THE OLD; THE VOTERS PLUCK SOME NEW FACES FROM THE POLITICAL CROWD: GOVERNORS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/us/elections-with-old-voters-pluck-some-new-faces-political-crowd-governors.html,Guy HuntAlabama Republican The voters of Alabama had not given the Governors mansion to a Republican since 1874 but they did it resoundingly on Tuesday Mr Hunt a 53yearold Amway distributor and lay Baptist preacher rolled over Lieut Gov Bill Baxley by a margin of 56 percent to 43 percent Although he ran for Governor in 1978 winning only three counties he had no statewide recognition to speak of when he entered this years race So how did he win He called his election a repudiation of the poisonous competition between Mr Baxley and Attorney General Charles Graddick the rivals for the Democratic nomination The people of Alabama want a clean campaign on the issues and not a campaign of mudslinging Mr Hunt said in his victory speech Kay OrrNebraska Republican Kay Orr was elected Governor of Nebraska in a historic race For the first time two gubernatorial candidates from major parties were women But the race was in no way a feminist crusade Mrs Orr and her opponent Helen Boosalis both oppose abortion Mrs Orr is also against an equal rights amendment to the Constitution because she says although I dont differ with its goals I just feel it can be achieved without a constitutional amendment She attended the University of Iowa where she met her husband William T Orr now an insurance executive In the early 1960s they moved to Lincoln where she began her career in politics working on the 1964 Presidential campaign of Barry Goldwater Bob MartinezFlorida Republican Mr Martinez in many ways seems the embodiment of the political and demographic changes taking place in Florida He is the first Hispanic American to be elected Governor in his state and much has already been made of that But it is also significant that he switched from the Democratic Party to Republican in 1983  because he says he felt more comfortable with the Reagan philosophy  and that he is only the second Republican to win the office in this century A practical disadvantage was his lack of exposure He had been Mayor of Tampa for two terms but he faced what he called the longest trip to win statewide recognition Robert P CaseyPennsylvania Democrat Mr Casey went against the Republican tide in gubernatorial races conducting a tough campaign  some said too tough  to defeat William W Scranton 3d He sought to portray his opponent as the privileged son of a former Governor and Presidential candidate But there were lighter touches too Mr Casey called himself the real Bob Casey a reference to a race he had lost because another candidate with the same name was on the ballot Indeed he lost three contests for Governor before this year Mr Casey 54 is a classic Eastern liberal on most issues but opposes abortion He attended Holy Cross College on a basketball scholarship
"FOR WOMEN OF MEXICO, A NEW POLITICAL BEACON",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/garden/for-women-of-mexico-a-new-political-beacon.html,IT seems an unwritten rule the world over that candidates for elected office are expected to kiss babies shake hands and sometimes sacrifice their dignity But when Beatriz Paredes Rangel who at the age of 33 is soon to become the second woman to serve as Governor of a Mexican state was asked recently during the election campaign to stand inside a giant clay Mexican cooking pot called a cazuela she politely demurred Ms Paredes encountered the cazuela among a display of dozens of smaller pots at a campaign meeting of native artists from throughout the state of Tlaxcala that she had organized here One of the elders of the village where the pots are made stood in the cazuela and rocked back and forth demonstrating how strong it was Then he stepped out and beckoned the Governortobe to climb into the pot and see for herself Certainly any male Mexican gubernatorial candidate would have hopped right in and happily rocked to and fro winning votes and fostering his image as one of the boys For a fleeting moment Ms Paredes seemed about to raise her skirt and climb in too But she abruptly changed her mind diverted attention with a question and the moment passed Had she stood in the pot Mexicos small contingent of activist feminists as well as socially aware women in general would have been disappointed To many Ms Paredes candidacy in a country where women were not allowed to vote until 1953 is a symbol of how life for Mexican women is slowly changing for the better and how it might change even more Beatriz is a special phenomenon said Elena Urrutia coordinator of an interdisciplinary womens studies program at the Colegio de Mexico here and one of the founders of Fem Mexicos feminist magazine Her accomplishments are very important to us because she is so young and rose from humble origins Her origins make Ms Paredes special for many women Her father now 86 is a campesino or poor farmer in Tlaxcala where Ms Paredes was born in 1953 Although she lacks the substantial family connections that usually are necessary for political success in Mexico Ms Paredes has risen to a position of power in the ruling Institutional Revolutionary Party Her admirers colleagues and critics all agree she has done it on her own Ms Paredes who is not married describes herself as a natural leader an assessment with which her colleagues agree As a schoolgirl in a poor Tlaxcalan village she showed flair as an orator organizer and general spark plug in school life She naturally gravitated to politics We Tlaxcalans like to talk she recalled It all came very naturally to me As a teenager she became deeply involved in the problems of the campesino organizations and the affairs of the ruling political party known from its initials as the PRI By the time she was 21 she was a member of the Tlaxcala State Legislature Since then she has earned a college degree as a sociologist served as a member of the Federal Chamber of Deputies was a subminister in the Ministry of Agrarian Reform and is a power in national campesino affairs Ms Paredes has token opposition from the candidates of three other parties in the election Nov 16 But because the PRI dominates Mexican political affairs her designation last summer as the partys candidate for Governor of Tlaxcala assured that she would assume the post Ms Paredes avoids answering when asked if she is a feminist Clearly she is a politician first and foremost To say she is not a feminist would look wrong to activist women who identify with her To declare herself a feminist would risk alienation of powerful traditionalist male politicians upon whose support she must depend as she moves up the political ladder Instead she is quick to stress her interest in improving the lives of all people She is however what Mrs Urrutia calls a sensitized woman aware of womens problems There are many women who come to positions of power and forget that 99 per cent of women are not in such positions said Mrs Urrutia She cited a conference for women that Ms Paredes held recently in Tlaxcala She arranged child care for the women attending Such a thought would never have occurred to a man When Mexicos fledgling feminist movement began to emerge in the 1970s it was class conscious Its proponents were of the upper and middle classes Their concern was focused on abortion which is illegal in Mexico rape pornography and lesbianism Unnoticed was the plight of the women of the lower classes particularly of the campesino families who struggle daily with a lack of drinkable water inadequate housing and sanitary facilities poor access to education for their children unavailability of birth control information and a social order in which Latin machismo is still a dominant force At the same time a steady deterioration of the Mexican economy that began in the 1970s and has been accelerating rapidly since the Mexican debt crisis emerged in 1982 has had a profound effect on the women of Mexico Women who were traditionally housewives now must seek work outside the home to help their families survive Although figures vary sociologists and labor experts believe that in the last 10 to 15 years the proportion of women in the national work force has doubled to about 30 percent from 15 percent More than 80 percent of all women who study a profession in school are believed to enter the work force As a result the Mexican womans role in society is shifting rapidly and the nature of Mexican feminism has broadened to embrace the changes But despite rapid social changes Mexico remains a rigidly patriarchal society Politics is still a male dominion particularly in an essentially oneparty system where results at the ballot box have less meaning than do deals cut at party offices Ms Paredes knows she cannot sound too preoccupied with womens issues too strident about the need for change She chooses her words carefully The country is living in a transition period in the ways that women participate in society she said There is a whole society that has established roles and at the same time there is a new presence of professional women of working women Roles are changing Government policies must recognize this She cites Government programs created in recent years to provide child care centers for working mothers as an example Discussing politics she is careful not to use the word discrimination speaking of a series of areas where it is considered that women have less experience and less aptitude There are male politicians she said who are very determined to push women forward and respect the participation of women in political matters but there are other men who have reservations But if you consider that we barely have 12 to 15 per cent representation in the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate you can see that we do not have all the favorable conditions that are required she said But slowly the situation is changing both socially and politically It is in transformation because of the economic situation in the country and because of the large number of young women who went to school and are demanding that they participate in the productive plant in public life Ms Paredes said The first woman to serve as Governor of a Mexican state was Griselda Alvarez who became Governor of Colima on the Pacific coast in 1979 Her great grandfather had been Colimas first Governor and her father had served as Governor too She was eminently qualified to be Governor said one feminist here who asked not to be identified But she became Governor because the men in power looked around and said Its time Mexico had a woman Governor They were filling a quota State governors serve a single sixyear term When Mrs Alvarez took office she was in her 60s When Ms Paredes leaves office she will be only 39 Her youth means dynamism initiative projection said Mrs Alvarez Her youth means many things a permanent state of revolution
THE ELECTIONS: THE STORY IN SOME KEY STATES; DEUKMEJIAN AND CRANSTON WIN AS 3 JUDGES ARE OUSTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/us/elections-story-some-key-states-deukmejian-cranston-win-3-judges-are-ousted.html,Gov George Deukmejian won not only a landslide reelection victory on Tuesday but also an opportunity to replace three justices of the California Supreme Court The three were removed by voters in an emotioncharged rebellion against their refusal to uphold the death sentences of scores of convicted murderers In a tight race that was not decided until early this morning Senator Alan Cranston a Democrat won a fourth term by defeating Representative Ed Zschau a Republican who had the support of much of the states business community According to a preliminary analysis of voting patterns opposition to Mr Zschau by certain Christian evangelical groups and political conservatives in southern California who contended that he was too moderate on social issues may have been a pivotal factor in Mr Cranstons narrow victory Rose Elizabeth Bird the 49yearold Chief Justice of the Supreme Court was removed from the bench by a margin of 2 to 1 Associate Justices Joseph Grodin and Cruz Reynoso the courts first Hispanic member drew more votes than Chief Justice Bird but not enough to give them the majority needed to keep their jobs Their Last Day Is Jan 5 All will leave the bench Jan 5 when Mr Deukmejian a conservative whose views on social issues closely parallel those of President Reagan can seat three new justices on the highest court in the nations most populous state His nominations are subject to affirmation by a panel of legal experts and voter confirmation in 1988 The most likely candidate expected to succeed Chief Justice Bird is Associate Justice Malcom Lucas a former law partner of Mr Deukmejian who is also a conservative The three justices were the first ever removed from the court by voters since Californians amended their Constitution in 1934 to require appointed appellate judges to be reconfirmed periodically by voters Their defeat was the climax of a tumultuous campaign in which supporters of the justices denounced what they called a rightwing effort to politicize the court while opponents of the justices contended that they were merely applying the state constitutional requirement that justices be held accountable to voters Coalition Led Drive Chief Justice Bird who had voted to overturn lower courts death sentences in all 61 capital cases that had come before her since she joined the court in 1977 was the principal target of the campaign against the court The campaign was led by a coalition of political conservatives county prosecutors and relatives of murder victims They said the court had refused to uphold death sentences because of personal opposition to capital punishment Opinion polls had long indicated that Chief Justice Bird was unlikely to be confirmed for a new 12year term But it had been less clear that Justices Grodin and Reynoso who had voted to sustain a handful of death sentences would be turned out of office Pollsters said they believed that an unusually widespread and deepseated antipathy toward Chief Justice Bird among many voters had apparently been transferred to her colleagues in the final weeks of the campaign They said all three justices suffered from the lingering unpopularity of former Gov Edmund G Brown Jr who appointed them to the bench and from the effectiveness of television commercials in which the parents of slain children assailed the court for setting aside the death sentences of their childrens killers In conceding defeat Tuesday night Chief Justice Bird urged voters to resist what she predicted would be efforts to turn the court into a house of death because of the insatiable appetite of ambitious politicians Races for Governor and Senate In the race for governor Mr Deukmejian overpowered Mayor Tom Bradley of Los Angeles by a much wider margin than many experts had expected attracting 605 percent of the vote as against 375 percent for Mr Bradley In the Senate race according to virtually complete returns Mr Cranston received 3575436 votes or 494 percent of the total and Mr Zschau received 3458814 votes or 478 percent Mr Cranstons victory margin of less than 120000 votes led to speculation today that the effort by evangelical groups to defeat Mr Zschau because of his acceptance of abortion support for the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and his stand on other issues might have had an important effect on the race In the final weeks of the campaign a political action group called Christian Voice and other evangelical groups urged religious fundamentalists not to vote for Mr Zschau and to vote instead for Ed Vallen a candidate for the conservative American Independent Party or for the 72yearold Mr Cranston who they predicted might not live to complete a new sixyear term Although the impact of the appeal has not been measured precisely Mr Vallen received more than 106000 votes Tuesday while candidates for the conservative Peace and Freedom Party and Libertarian parties received a combined total of more than 100000 votes Californians Tuesday also voted overwhelmingly to establish English as the states official language approved a sweeping new measure regarding disposal of toxic wastes and soundly defeated a proposal by the conspiracy theorist Lyndon H LaRouche Jr that would have under some conditions allowed the quarantining of victims of AIDS Voters in Los Angeles and in San Francisco approved zoning laws designed to sharply limit construction of new highrise buildings in designated areas of the two cities
"THE ELECTIONS: DEALING WITH THE ISSUES; PROPOSITIONS: TAX CURBS, YES: ABORTION LIMITS, NO",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/06/us/elections-dealing-with-issues-propositions-tax-curbs-yes-abortion-limits-no.html,In hundreds of ballot proposals decided around the nation Tuesday voters put new but moderate restraints on the ability of states and local governments to raise taxes and expanded the use of gambling to help pay the cost of public services At the same time they apparently turned back at least temporarily efforts to write antiabortion measures into state law enacted strong environmental measures in several states and localities and dealt another defeat to the womens movement Feminist leaders hoped to establish a beachhead in liberal Vermont with an equal rights amendment to the state Constitution Rather than passing easily as expected however the proposal to prohibit sexual discrimination was defeated 52 percent to 48 percent Over all voters tended to reject extreme measures and steer a moderate course in writing directly into law a range of propositions to change policies reduce or increase taxes and to approve or reject bond issues Oregon voters for example defeated a plan to permit residents to raise marijuana for their personal use and Californians defeated a plan that could have led to a quarantine of AIDS victims One of the clearest trends was in the expansion of lotteries and other forms of stateendorsed gambling to help pay for public services This comes at a time when many state and local governments have found themselves pinched between resistance to new taxes and faltering economies that no longer bring in the revenue needed to sustain basic services Voters in Florida Idaho Kansas Montana and South Dakota approved lotteries Only in North Dakota was a lottery defeated with strong opposition by religious and political leaders Florida however defeated a proposal for casino gambling in hotels as it has repeatedly in the past Kansas on the other hand approved a plan for parimutuel betting on horse and dog races Lotteries in Majority of States The affirmative votes on lotteries mean that a majority of states now sponsor or permit them to raise revenue for public services such as education The approval of lotteries has been spreading rapidly since 1980 when only a handful of states permitted them In addition to the five approved Tuesday Indiana Lousiana Oklahoma and Wisconsin are now considering lottery proposals The antiabortion movement has made repeated efforts at measures to ban the use of state funds for abortion or declare the practice illegal in anticipation of the Supreme Court reversing its landmark Roe v Wade decision of 1973 which legalized abortions Virtually all of those proposals however have been defeated in recent years Tuesday antiabortion proposals were defeated in Rhode Island Massachusetts and Oregon The vote on a fourth proposal in Arkansas was so close that the outcome was still in doubt yesterday On taxes the following results provide a sample of the voting  California made local taxes in some cities subject to voter approval and defeated a ceiling on salaries of state employes  Colorado rejected a plan to make every state tax increase subject to voter approval  Massachusetts approved a measure that would limit an increase in state taxes to the same ratio of increase in salaries and wages  Montana approved a proposal to freeze property taxes but defeated a more stringent measure to abolish property taxes outright  Oregon voters rejected both a drastic reduction in local property taxes and a proposed 5 percent sales tax Several states took steps to clean up toxic wastes and protect natural resources California approved a measure that would prohibit companies from tainting public water supplies In Idaho there was an overwhelming vote to continue the states law barring union membership as a requirement in employment It was the first time the issue has been on a statewide ballot in several years and labor unions had spent considerable resources in an effort to repeal the law A referendum that would have moved toward creating a new city from the predominantly black sections of Boston was resoundingly defeated by black voters and by white voters in surrounding areas The proposal would have created a 125squaremile municipality that proponents said would have included more than 90 percent of the minority population of Boston The new city which was to have been called Mandela after the black leader in South Africa would have been about 84 percent minority proponents said The measure was on the ballot in 10 of Bostons 19 state legislative districts an area with approximately 120000 registered voters a little less than half the citys total The unofficial vote total was 33609 opposed and 12349 in favor according to John F Donovan chief registrar of voters Mr Donovan added that the measure had been decisively beaten in all precincts although it had lost most heavily in some predominantly black areas
AROUND THE NATION; 35 Catholics Seek Archbishop's Return,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/around-the-nation-35-catholics-seek-archbishop-s-return.html,Thirtyfive local Roman Catholics most of them priests and nuns have asked that Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen be given back all responsibilities taken away by the Vatican in a dispute over Church teachings The appeal was made in a letter to the 293 bishops scheduled to attend the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Nov 913 in Washington We believe that he is a competent Bishop the group said This is attested to by the life and vigor of the church in Seattle by the fiscal solvency of our archdiocese by the ecumenical support the Archbishop enjoys and by his loyalty to the Holy See The Vatican announced in September it was turning over many of the Archbishops duties to Auxiliary Bishop Donald Wuerl The move followed a twoyear investigation by the Vatican which said Archbishop Hunthausen had tolerated unorthodox practices Conservative Catholics had objected to the Archbishops antinuclear activism and said among other things that he let a homosexual group use a church for mass and that he would not condemn abortion
WASHINGTON TALK; . . . Capitol Hill's Day After,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/washington-talk-capitol-hill-s-day-after.html,Alice Hooker describes herself as a faithful Democrat who for six years has been an exile from Capitol Hill Today resume in hand she returned seeking a staff job with the Senate Judiciary Committee For seven years Ms Hooker was a top aide to Al Ullman when he was chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee But she lost her job in 1980 when the Reagan Revolution swept Democrats from control of the Senate and Mr Ullman an Oregonian now deceased from his House seat Being a Democrat in a Republican town I felt outraged Ms Hooker said We were pushed out of positions of any responsibility Its as if people have been waiting in the wings for six years Ms Hooker is one of scores of Democrats who are expected to take advantage of the new political landscape here with the Democrats back in control of the Senate after six years and in an even stronger majority in the House For one result of Tuesdays election will be at least 700 new jobs for Democrats all at the expense of Republicans The turnover among elected officials in Congress is nothing compared to the hirings and firings of Congressional staff members that are expected in forthcoming months The avalanche of resumes may bury Capitol Hill said Richard Mintz who works for a lobby group that supports abortion rights In addition to the Democrats who will be seeking Congressional jobs the Republicans who now have those jobs are also cranking out resumes Many want to latch onto Presidential campaigns or find jobs with Republicanconnected interest groups Those in the best position are Democrats who already have highlevel jobs on committee staffs They say they look forward to gaining more influence they also stand to gain perquisites like plusher offices The major benefit of being in the majority is that you can define the agenda you can craft the legislation said W Donald Campbell Democratic staff director for the Senate Banking and Urban Affairs Committee Its been very frustrating weve hardly had any banking legislation passed in the last six years For Republicans there is little joy This is something that we have to accept on the Hill When you get hired here they let you know you could lose their job said Mary Kinzer a Republican staff assistant on the Senate Agriculture Committee Although Ms Kinzer is not certain she will lose her job as Republicans lose control of that committee she said she was actively seeking work on other committees just in case Both Ms Kinzer and Ms Hooker wasted no time today in stopping for job interviews at the Senate Placement Office which channels job seekers to Senate office Ms Hooker started her own legal practice after she lost her Congressional job She had not thought of returning to Capitol Hill until Wednesday morning when she overheard some United States attorneys in the District of Columbia Superior Court talking about going after jobs on the soontobereconstituted Judiciary Committee The obvious new slots for Democrats will be on personal staffs of newly elected members The Democrats picked up eight new Senate seats while the Republicans lost eight Most senators have about 40 people on their personal staffs In the House where the personal staffs are somewhat smaller the Democrats won at least five additional seats More significant however are the 19 Senate committees which will now be controlled by the Democrats The dominant party in the Senate controls twothirds of each committees budget out of which staff salaries are paid As of last spring there were 1180 staff members on the Senate committees 663 were Republican appointments 330 were Democratic and 187 were not designated by party Now the Democrats can double the size of their committee staffs at Republican expense Those are figures that the Republicans do not like to hear Before 1980 they had not controlled the Senate since 1956 But in the last six years they have grown accustomed to being in charge Although Congressional offices were largely quiet this week the Senate Placement Office has been busier than ever Were exhausted said Marianne Farnsworth assistant manager of the office Democrats are coming from all over  law firms everywhere One girl came from Arkansas One guy came from Boston just for this A lot of people want to work for committees some want to work for senators and a lot of them dont care They just want to get in Miss Farnsworth said the most anxious prospective applicants were recent college graduates who come in here and think this might be their big chance for a Congressional job One who fits that category is Temple D Brown a recent University of Virginia graduate who came by the

THE ELECTIONS: ISSUES AND INTEREST GROUPS; DEMOCRAT WINS A CLOSE CONTEST FOR HOUSE SEAT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/07/us/elections-issues-interest-groups-democrat-wins-close-contest-for-house-seat.html,A Democrat was declared the winner of one of the most closely contested races for the House of Representatives today but Republicans apparently won three others That makes the probable House lineup for the 100th Congress which convenes in January 258 Democrats and 177 Republicans representing a gain of 5 seats for the Democrats It was one of the smallest shifts in history but in the 1962 election the net change was one seat Both parties claimed victory this time the Republicans because they held Democratic gains well below the average for the sixth year of a Presidency the Democrats because they padded an already big margin The Presidents popularity saved the Republicans from really taking a drubbing as they would have with an unpopular President and tough economic times said Thomas Mann executive director of the American Political Science Association In that sense its a victory for the Republicans But the fact that the Democrats picked up some extra seats puts them in pretty good shape in the face of the vaunted Reagan political machine Off the Defensive Now Representative Richard A Gephardt Democrat of Missouri said his partys control of the Senate meant House Democrats could put forward an agenda with some hope of passing measures and getting them before President Reagan instead of playing defensive baseball But a member of the Democratic leadership who asked not to be identified said it would be a serious mistake for his party to push too many programs risking once again Republican charges of tax and tax spend and spend The Democrat who finally emerged victorious almost 48 hours after the polls closed was Tom McMillen a 6foot11inchtall former professional basketball player He narrowly defeated Robert Neall the Republican minority leader in the State House of Delegates in the Fourth District of Maryland which includes Annapolis and parts of the Baltimore and Washington suburbs The seat is now held by a Republican Representative Marjorie S Holt who is retiring so Mr McMillens victory constituted a pickup for the Democrats Among Republicans who seem to have won are Representative Howard Coble in the Sixth District of North Carolina Representative Arlan Stangeland in the Seventh District of Minnesota and Representative John Hiler in the Third District of Indiana Mr Hilers Democratic opponent Thomas Ward was declared the winner late Tuesday night but an error was discovered today in the count in St Joseph County which includes South Bend The new totals gave Mr Hiler 1890 more votes and a lead of 166 Recounts are possible in all three races especially in North Carolina Robin Britt a Democrat there stressed the loss of jobs in the district because of cheap imported textiles Mr Britt who lost to Mr Coble in a close race in 1984 is trailing him this time by 82 votes In North Carolinas 11th District where imports were also an issue Representative William M Hendon a Republican lost to James McC Clarke a Democrat The two have clashed in three straight elections Mr Clarke winning in 1982 and this year Mr Hendon winning in 1984 2 Hurt by Unrest on Farms Mr Stangeland was one of two Minnesota incumbents damaged by unrest on the states farms Representative Vin Weber one of the most vocal of the young Republican rightwingers survived but only by 4000 votes Mr Stangeland one of the authors of the locally unpopular Farm Act of 1985 has a lead of only 211 votes Incumbency was once again a powerful weapon for most members of Congress A total of 392 Representatives sought reelection and only 6 lost  5 Republicans and a Democrat  for a success rate of 985 percent The Republican losers were Mr Hendon and William Cobey in North Carolina Webb Franklin in Mississippi Fred J Eckert in Rochester and Mike Strang in Colorado The only Democratic loser was Robert A Young who represented a St Louis suburban district John Buechner the Republican who beat him almost won in 1984 Farm Discontent and a Gain Incumbency apparently saved a group of freshmen Republicans the Democrats had selected for defeat It apparently saved Farm Belt Republicans including Mr Weber Mr Stangeland and colleagues in Iowa Missouri and Kansas Only in an open seat in Iowa could the Democrats make a gain as a result of farm discontent Incumbency apparently saved 81yearold Representative Melvin Price of Illinois whom many Democrats had expected would lose And it apparently saved three members involved in ethical or financial controversies Representatives Fernand J St Germain of Rhode Island Robert Carr of Michigan and Kenneth J Gray of Illinois Four women were elected as new members of the House Four others will retire next year The winners were Constance A Morella a Republican in the Eighth District of Maryland Louise Slaughter a Democrat in Rochester NY Patricia Saiki in the First District of Hawaii who will be her states first Republican member of the House and Elizabeth Patterson a Democrat and daughter of the late Senator Olin D Johnston in the Fourth District of South Carolina There will be 22 blacks in the House an increase of 2 for a new record John Lewis who had been active for civil rights will succeed Representative Wyche Fowler Jr who was elected to the Senate for the Atlanta district and Mike Espy will replace Mr Franklin in the seat that covers most of the Mississippi Delta Two other new black members replace departing ones Floyd Flake of Queens and Kweisi Mfume of Maryland All the new black members are Democrats Among Democratic newcomers given a chance to become political stars are David E Price a Duke University political scientist who beat Mr Cobey in North Carolina Ben Nighthorse Campbell who is a Cheyenne and David E Skaggs both from Colorado and Jim Jontz of Indiana who stressed jobs and trade issues to beat James Butcher a crusader against abortion and pornography Republicans are expecting a lot from Mr Buechner among others

ABORTION RULE FOR UNDER-18's UPSET BY JUDGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/08/us/abortion-rule-for-under-18-s-upset-by-judge.html,A Federal district judge in Minnesota today held unconstitutional a state law requiring women under 18 years old either to notify both parents or to obtain judicial approval before getting abortions The judge Donald D Alsop said his ruling was apparently the first examination by any court as to how such a law had worked in actual operation He suggested the evidence contradicted the Supreme Courts assumption that such laws could foster helpful consultation between pregnant teenagers and their parents The Supreme Court has cited what it sees as the benefits of such consultation in upholding laws somewhat similar to Minnesotas but it has not yet been presented with a case involving testimony about how such a parental notification law has worked in practice After a fiveweek trial the judge said the law had traumatized teenagers without serving any legitimate purpose He said he could find no factual basis for holding that the Minnesota law on the whole furthers in any meaningful way the states interest in protecting pregnant minors or assuring family integrity He cited testimony by minors single parents abortion providers counselors psychiatrists and state judges who hear minors requests for approval of abortions without parental notification The decision was dated Thursday and was made public today Law in Effect Since 1981 The Minnesota law had been in effect since 1981 The judge stressed evidence of the emotional trauma it had forced pregnant teenagers to endure and the danger that in troubled families the father if notified of a daughters plan to have an abortion might react violently Judge Alsop noted however that he was bound by Supreme Court decisions upholding some laws that require parental notification as an alternative to judicial approval of individual abortions and had therefore based his decision to strike down the Minnesota law on a relatively narrow ground The law was rendered unconstitutional even under the Supreme Courts precedents he said by its requirement that minors who do not want to go to a judge for approval notify not just one but both parents even in cases involving broken families or parents likely to react with psychological sexual or physical violence Particularly in these cases he said notification of an abusive or even a disinterested absent parent has the effect of reintroducing that parents disruptive or unhelpful participation into the family at a time of acute stress Similarly the twoparent notification requirement places a significant obstacle in the path of minors in twoparent homes who voluntarily have consulted with one parent but not with the other out of fear of psychological sexual or physical abuse toward either the minor or the notified parent A Traumatic Distraction In either case Judge Alsop added the alternative of going to court to seek authorization to proceed without notifying the second parent introduces a traumatic distraction into her relationship with the parent whom the minor has notified He stressed that state court judges who handled such requests had testified that they had approved almost all of them but felt they were serving a rubberstamp function that served no useful purpose while producing fear and tension in many minors The state served notice that it would appeal Janet Benshoof an American Civil Liberties Union lawyer representing abortion providers minors and others who sued to strike down the law said The case is a vindication of the rights of minors who have been needlessly suffering under a system designed to make political points at the expense of young womens constitutional rights Ms Benshoof said today that 22 states had some form of law promoting parental notification or consent for minors seeking abortions More than half of them are not being enforced she said either because they are in litigation or because they are clearly contrary to the Supreme Courts requirement that a judicial bypass be available The 22 states do not include New York New Jersey or Connecticut Judge Alsop who was appointed in 1975 by President Ford also held unconstitutional the laws requirement that minors seeking abortions must ordinarily wait at least 48 hours after their parents have been notified in writing by the abortion provider He indicated he might have been forced by Supreme Court precedent to uphold the law if it had required notification of only one parent in broken family situations as an alternative to judicial approval and had imposed a shorter waiting period after parental notification Court to Hear Illinois Case But his opinion strongly suggested the Supreme Court should reconsider its assumption that such parental notification laws could ever produce the kinds of benefits to the minor or the family that the Court had envisioned in the abstract The Supreme Court agreed last month to hear a case involving a somewhat similar Illinois law requiring women under 18 years old either to wait 24 hours after the doctor has told their parents of their plans or to obtain a judicial exemption from the notification requirement The Court has ruled in the past that states may not require all minors seeking abortions without exception to obtain parental consent

STUDY URGES FIGHT FOR STATES' POWER,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/09/us/study-urges-fight-for-states-power.html,An Administration report charges that the Supreme Court has systematically undermined state sovereignty for more than 50 years and proposes a strategy to correct what it calls an erroneous judicial reading of the Constitution The confidential report concludes after a 15month study that the Court has improperly preempted and invalidated the states legitimate exercise of their sovereign powers leaving them to act only as satrapies or administrative units of a virtually omnipotent national government Setting the Agenda The 90page document a copy of which was obtained by The New York Times says the Supreme Court showed indifference to the principle of federalism in 1973 when it guaranteed women access to abortion and limited the states power to regulate abortion Moreover it says court rulings on the reapportionment of state legislatures since 1962 represent an unprecedented intrusion into state affairs White House officials said the report prepared for the Cabinet by a special interagency panel would set the agenda for domestic policy in the next two years The report particularly criticizes the Courts broad interpretation of the Federal power to regulate interstate commerce and calls for litigation aimed at overturning some judicial decisions It says Congress itself should halt the practice of conditioning eligibility for Federal grants on compliance with regulations having little or no relationship to the program being funded Grants for highway construction for example have been used to require that states regulate billboard advertising hide junkyards along the road survey all their roads to identify and correct hazards impose Hatch Act prohibitions on the political activity of state employees adopt a 21yearold drinking age and comply with the now infamous 55mileperhour speed limit it continued The report was submitted this week to the Domestic Policy Council a Cabinetlevel advisory body by its Working Group on Federalism composed of officials from nine agencies Assistant Attorney General Charles J Cooper who headed the group said in an interview that the national government has been behaving without legitimate constitutional warrant in usurping state authority The report asserts that the Supreme Court has struck down state laws in cases where no actual conflict with Federal law and no evidence that Congress intended to preempt state law existed For example it said Federal judges had invalidated state divorce laws state noise regulations state utility regulations and state usury laws Congress Given Broad License By its expansive interpretation of Congresss power to regulate interstate commerce the report says the Supreme Court has given the Federal Government a virtual license to prescribe uniform public policies in an almost limitless range of areas traditionally within the province of state governments Only once during the last 50 years has the Supreme Court invalidated a Federal statute as an impermissible encroachment on the sovereignty of state and local governments the report said Even that decision involving the wages and hours of local government employees was overruled by the Court last year the report noted Several Specific Proposals The report The Status of Federalism in America makes these proposals  Before passing any bill Congress should assess its effects on federalism Congress should amend its rules to permit lawmakers to raise a point of order against bills that violate the sovereign prerogatives of the states  States should be allowed to consolidate numerous Federal grants into one lump sum with few Federal restrictions on use of the money all grants for human service programs might be thus combined  Federal agencies should not be able to preempt state laws by issuing regulations Federal laws should not be construed as preempting state laws unless Congress explicitly declared its desire to do so  The Justice Department or the Office of Management and Budget should review all proposed Federal rules to assess their effects on federalism No Mention of Reagan Criticism The report does not mention any of the Reagan Administrations own proposals that have been criticized as contrary to the spirit of federalism In April for example the Administration proposed to establish national standards of product liability superseding state laws And the Justice Department has tried to prevent state and local governments from using numerical goals to increase employment of blacks women and Hispanic people White House officials noted the strong showing by Republican candidates in gubernatorial elections Tuesday and suggested that the states might be more receptive than a Democratic Congress to President Reagans philosophy on many domestic issues
A DISSENTING VOICE: CATHOLIC THEOLOGIAN DAVID TRACY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/09/magazine/a-dissenting-voice-catholic-theologian-david-tracy.html,AS THE NAtions 293 Roman Catholic bishops gather for their annual meeting today in Washington they are intensely preoccupied with an issue that crackles like St Elmos fire around the formal agenda It is the nature of authority the popes as the head of the church theirs as teachers with him of Catholic doctrine and that of the American Catholic Church The bishops will also ponder the claims to authority of theologians particularly those like the Rev David Tracy of the University of Chicago who roam the intellectual frontiers of their discipline often returning with new interpretations of old teachings The bishops are concerned about the way in which their flocks are reflecting the theologians departures from traditional Catholic teachings on among other questions the acceptability of artificial birth control abortion homosexuality and divorce The bishops are also wary of the manner in which Vatican curial officials have reasserted control over the daytoday business of the church after an interlude of modified powers following the end of the Second Vatican Council in 1965 Pope John Paul II reports a bishop just back from Rome spends a great deal of time on foreign affairs and on the careful preparation of his many talks The bishop goes on to explain that although the Pope who faces an extraordinarily diverse congregation of nearly a billion desires unity of expression in the church curial officials have become the definers and arbiters of that unity in matters of doctrine and discipline The American bishops concerns have been heightened by two recent events The first was the stripping of his license to teach theology at a Vaticanchartered university from the Rev Charles E Curran at the Catholic University of America in Washington The second was the removal of the authority of Seattles Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen over five key areas of administration including the liturgy marriage and theology courses for priests Both men were reportedly censured for their dissent from the Vaticans views on issues of sexual morality While some powerful American prelates notably Bernard Cardinal Law of Boston and Archbishop Roger M Mahony of Los Angeles have urged their confreres to stand up and be counted with the Pope on these issues large numbers of bishops one of their leaders says feel demoralized because they are caught between statements from Rome and responses both liberal and conservative of their own priests and people They wonder if their ability to exercise their individual authority as well as that of their episcopal body the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has been seriously compromised The Hunthausen case which the bishops will review in executive session at their meeting is perceived by many as symbolic of the Vaticans readiness to ignore collegial process in dealing with the American church in order to reduce the influence of its bishops conference The problem is authority says Father Tracy the University of Chicago theologian and author box page 25 who is widely recognized as one of the most creative of American Catholic scholars But these Vatican officials he adds seem unable to understand authority except as authoritarianism exercised by them to protect the bureaucratic power of the institution This is not the same as vindicating the claims of orthodoxy Hunthausen and Curran understand authority in its essential Catholic sense rooted in the central compassionate vision of the Catholic tradition Pope John XXIII exercised effective authority because he did not try to coerce the worlds will but appealed to its imagination It is because not enough church officials understand the Catholic meaning of authority as Pope John did that the church is in trouble today In 1968 Tracy was among 22 faculty members including Father Curran brought to a twomonth trial before the Catholic University senate by that schools president on charges that they had abandoned their Catholicity by dissenting from the theological argument against artificial birth control in Pope Paul VIs encyclical Humanae Vitae issued earlier that year Today Tracy says that birth control is neuralgic as a source of continuing intractable pain for Catholics combining a reluctance on the part of authorities to let go of a certain narrow view of human sexuality The church once taught that usury was intrinsically evil but changed its stance on that It once tolerated slavery There is no reason that it cannot change on birth control Although little known outside academic circles the bearded 47yearold Tracy  a priestly Mr Chips according to his students  symbolizes the confidence and creativity of his generation of theologians even as the shadows of Vatican investigators fall across their work Tracy who insists that the prism of theological investigation necessarily refracts ambiguity and pluralism dismisses the curial desire to eliminate these qualities in their formulations of the truths of faith It is easy to get uniformity in religion he says All you have to do is to remove the mystery But if you remove the mystery you destroy religion at the same time Sounding major themes of his theological work Tracy observes that everyone recognizes Archbishop Hunthausen  who led protests against nuclear submarine facilities and withheld portions of his income tax to protest Federal spending on nuclear arms  as a classically religious person There is a real theological and religious issue here because his actions in working for peace and in being a pastor to forgotten ones including the divorced and homosexuals are in keeping with the central insight that God is love Hunthausen has risked his life on the vision Catholicism holds up to the world and he is being dealt with in the manner of Dostoyevskys Grand Inquisitor what would happen to the institution if we allowed this to continue The American Catholic Church needs its bishops to reflect on this situation religiously and theologically and to speak out about it without fear The vigor of their authority depends on their being believable in defending this believable man At the same time one of our great Catholic universities should offer Charles Curran a professorship Archbishop Rembert G Weakland of Milwaukee the most outspoken defender of American Catholicism against Vatican critics underscores the significance of thinkers like Tracy The temptation for theology today he says is to condemn everything of the present confused age and to look backward to safer theories and models Creative theology discerns what is true in the midst of the present explosion of knowledge integrates it with Christian revelation and thus makes sense out of our lives and helps construct the future Tracy and other progressive American theologians are not without strong critics in the American Catholic community Msgr George A Kelly research professor at St Johns University in New York and president of the Fellowship of Catholic Scholars says that Tracy isnt developing doctrine hes denying it The issue is really Christ and Pope John Paul II speaks for Him That is fundamental I think some of these theologians have lost the faith If I followed David Tracy and others the end would be that I wouldnt be a Catholic In fact I wouldnt be anything Tracys influence is not immediately political but will be in the long term according to the prominent Lutheran scholar and religious historian Martin Marty because he is the most original of todays Catholic theologians and the one with whom other theologians Catholic and Protestant have to reckon His ideas are widely disseminated in lectures at home and abroad through articles appearing in periodicals and through his books Tracy reaches beyond theology into the cognate sciences adds the Rev Richard P McBrien chairman of the department of theology at the University of Notre Dame and returns to theology with new questions as well as new answers He is very creative because more than any other theologian he really does understand modern philosophy literature and language and he can see connections nobody has seen before A whole new configuration of decision making is developing in the church McBrien adds In the future theologians will function freer of institutional domination Tracy is way ahead of the bishops on this By the time they understand his influence it will be too late According to Archbishop Weakland although Tracy has not spoken to that broad public that once listened to Paul Tillich and Reinhold Niebuhr he has taken theology into the current academic world of the United States and made it again respectable as an intellectual discipline OR TRACY religious faith remains essentially too powerful and mysterious to be controlled or completely contained by administrators Religions closest cousin he says is not rigid logic but art As such religion speaks to all the layers of human personality and is best understood in its classic embodiments For Catholicism these classics as Tracy terms them include the person of Jesus the Gospels the lives of the saints and the traditional symbols and doctrines of Catholicism Tracy is not interested in ridding the Catholic Church of its past but in refreshing its memory about the basic sources of its inspiration and spiritual energy With this emphasis on the classic origins of Catholicism Tracy insists that he is closer and truer to the basic tenets of Catholicism than many who style themselves defenders of the faith His claim sends shudders through Vatican officials who identify their institution with orthodoxy By affirming that theology like great art reveals lifes meaning not by offering easy certainties but by prompting an awareness of its complexities that it has to do with the finally undefinable mysteries of existence rather than their solution Tracy has not only enlarged Catholic theologys universe of interest but also lent legitimacy to new approaches in the field Avery Dulles a Jesuit and professor of theology at Catholic University once criticized Tracy for seeming to emphasize earthly existence over an afterlife but now defends him As he points out Joseph Cardinal Ratzinger Prefect of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith in Rome is a welltrained theologian who has himself been critical of neoscholasticism as the only method available to theologians He has himself emphasized the need for mystery as David Tracy does in the church Theologians function in dialogue with the pope and the bishops educating them and this is a long slow process The Rev Timothy E OConnell associate professor of theology and director of the Institute of Pastoral Studies at Loyola University of Chicago points out that Tracy is part of a long tradition marked by ambiguity and pluralism The church that contains such opposite theologians as the positive humanistic St Irenaeus and the dour somber St Augustine has never been as monolithic as some people suppose In addition to being a Distinguished Service Professor at the University of Chicago where he has taught since 1969 Tracy was the first theologian of any denomination to be invited to sit on that universitys prestigious Committee on the Analysis of Ideas and Methods He is also one of the few theologian members of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences The overlapping universes of his activity find him at home not only with Catholic theologians such as the Swiss Hans Kung the Dutch Edward Schillebeeckx and the South American liberation theologians Gustavo Gutierrez and Leonardo Boff on the board of the international theological journal Concilium but with deconstructionists and literary critics as well as with physicists in exploring the implications of the new cosmologies He also finds time for ongoing dialogues with Jewish Buddhist and Moslem scholars for editing with Protestant associates an ecumenical theology book for American seminaries and for applying theology to political issues as in his paper on human rights delivered in 1983 at a conference at Emory University Tracy is also one of the few thinkers offering a theological rather than a political or intuitively liberal refutation of the literalist claims made by the powerful American fundamentalist churches Real religion he says does not give final answers it makes us ask better questions OVER THE LAST SEVERAL months I have had many conversations with Father Tracy in various settings Now as we enter the medieval city of the University of Chicago campus the theologian turns to me and says A great temptation is to say that there is only one way to practice any religion That may sound benign he says because it simplifies things but it really leads to ban the books change the faculties in the seminaries and universities and at the limit mount a crusade In response to a question Tracy says Ive been told that I have a thick file in Rome but I havent experienced any interference with my work Some observers suggest that his theology is too subtle to be censored easily He seems unthreatened even by the possibility He smiles You know that despite everything the only people who are not afraid of the Catholic Church are Catholics When asked about terms that hover mistily over his conversation Tracy says that ambiguity is the difficulty we experience cognitively in naming the true and the false Do we read the book of Genesis as literal or as poetic truth It is also the ambiguity we experience morally in naming the good and the evil The cross for example is a holy symbol of salvation for Christians but was for medieval Jews a demonic signal of terror in the pogroms The urban inflections of Tracys New York upbringing echo in a vaulted cloister walkway as he offers a definition of the work of a creative theologian To spend your entire life reflecting on the most important questions people can ask the limit questions concerning those experiences at the boundaries of the ordinary that hint at something beyond Such questions are provoked by the reality of our death and therefore that sense of how unpredictable all other things in fact are A sunlit quadrangle opens before us These questions he continues make you pause in your assumptions and wonder if something else may not be the case He lists the signals of everyday mystery The riddles of suffering of the sudden feelings that interrupt lifes continuities and challenge our seeming security and of the boredom which can erupt into pervasive anxiety even terror in the face of some other which seems to bear down upon us at certain moments Think of our attempts to live responsibly when we cannot prove why we should be ethical at all or of why we believe in a fundamental order in reality which allows scientific inquiry Or of the nature of the universe open to us by the new astronomies and cosmologies stranger than we imagine and stranger than we can imagine And how do we understand the oppression endured by so many of the living What is the meaning in the profound love and joy we experience RACYS EYES gleam beneath his prominent brow as he reflects on his motivation for becoming a theologian I always loved cultural criticism and I received great encouragement from my mother and father Our home was filled with literary stimulation My father  a union organizer  read to us writers like Dickens and Henry Adams My parents were always bringing us to visit places like the Adams home near Boston New York had all the resources needed for cultural criticism but my religious sensibility seemed not to be a part of that critical world I wanted to think about religion and culture and about these subjects in relationship to each other Theology is what we call this attempt to think on religion culturally and on culture religiously So I moved toward this in a natural way After completing his doctoral work in theology at Romes Gregorian University Tracy taught at Catholic University There he stood trial on his beliefs about birth control which he holds is not intrinsically evil He and his codefendants including Father Curran were vindicated and allowed to continue to teach after demonstrating that theologians could dissent from certain papal pronouncements and still remain good Catholics After Currans recent censure on related accusations the norms developed following his groups faculty trial for tolerable dissent among Catholics were abrogated by the university chancellor Archbishop James Hickey Tracy has strongly defended Curran composing with other former presidents of the Catholic Theological Society of America two letters of protest one to Cardinal Ratzinger at the Vatican and a later one which attracted several hundred theologians signatures for release to the press As we enter the 1920s foyer of his apartment building near Chicagos Lake Shore Drive Tracy observes that most cultural critics dont think about religion in culture a theologian does think about religion and its resources in culture In our country writers must usually ask these theological questions because the rest of society including the clergy often does not know how to No one he says as we walk down the thickly carpeted ninthfloor hallway is better than Saul Bellow on the role of the intellectual in our society  the endless search but the difficulty of finding commitment in actions while maintaining the integrity of the self And at the end of Mr Sammlers Planet that remarkable phrase For that is the truth of it  that we all know God that we know that we know we know we know Joan Didion communicates what it would mean if we had lost a sense of the past or the future and had only the present and in most cases in her novels without healing This is a terrifying vision of the abyss that can underlie ordinary life All genuine writers always ask theological questions Tracys broadbased intellectual curiosity is reflected in the decoration of his apartment A Fellini hat sits near a Spanish pilgrimage Madonna and the tables and shelves sag under journals periodicals and books of every kind Hunching behind his desk under an oldfashioned bellshaped clock that is running three hours late Tracy explains the classics to which unanswered theological questions lead him You need a word for those epochal persons events and texts that as received in the Catholic and other religious traditions have an excess and permanence of meaning and do not yield to onceandforall explanations They resist literal oversimplified interpretation That is why they retain their mystery and power As examples of classic persons Tracy cites Abraham Jesus and Buddha Classic texts include the Bible and the Koran And among great religious events he identifies the Exodus and the Crucifixion and those events that are classic for a culture the Renaissance the Reformation the Great Depression He also includes all the great works of the human imagination  by any artist who truly touches the human spirit Tracy fluffs his grayflecked beard with one hand as he continues I explore the classics through the mode of an intellectual discourse I call conversation This technique strongly influenced by the contemporary German philosopher and scholar of interpretation HansGeorg Gadamer does not deliver easy grace It demands Tracy emphasizes a dialogue rather than an argument with other scholars who do not push an ideology or a political point but instead talk and wonder about the same profound questions You look at it this way then that observe the play of light and the multidimensional reliable astoundingly alive core truth of the classics will reemerge When asked for an example of a classic revisited Tracy responds easily The Exodus is one of the most powerful Old Testament myths the great myth then and now of liberation and oppression It is so of course for Jews Christians and for many secular radical groups as Michael Walzer  who teaches moral philosophy at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton NJ  and others have pointed out It is at the same time the major motif for the Latin American theologians of liberation and for every African nation striving for freedom Still it is ambiguous because the Afrikaners identify with it as well saying that they completed the myth and took the land from the blacks whom they perceive as the Canaanites We know from their spirituals and their blues that the black slaves in our own country had a correct reading for Exodus But a century ago the interpretation that the blacks were the Canaanites was being given in seminaries and preached from pulpits in the South As with all classics you cannot get fully behind its epochal event even in the Bible Exodus is filled with ambiguity Who were the murmurers who railed against Moses because of the length of their stay in the desert and who said to kill them God or Moses Exodus retains this ambiguous and pluralistic character and cannot be summed up easily because to read it without an appreciation of its complexity is to misread it Genuine religious experience brings you into this kind of tension in relation to mystery Essentially Tracy says a church is a community that keeps alive the dangerous memories of its classics The memory of Jesus for example disconcerts all present reality including that of the church because He essentially afflicts the comfortable and comforts the afflicted So theology makes religious institutions aware of their true spiritual resources and of their explicitly religious character And it makes the wider culture aware of the religious dimensions of life by seeking better ways to ask the religious questions This is a dangerous occupation     Tracy tackles his writing well after completing his days teaching Besides offering traditional courses on such subjects as God and Christology he emphasizes his commitment to conversation through team teaching He offers a course annually with the French philosopher Paul Ricoeur on such subjects as foundations of ethics and on Greek tragedy and Herodotus with David Grene a classicist and Wendy Doniger OFlaherty a religious historian I can get along fine Tracy says as long as I know that I will be able to get to my work by 8 PM I work through the night until 3 or 4 in the morning before retiring His major books include Blessed Rage for Order The Analogical Imagination and his new book Plurality and Ambiguity Hermeneutics Religion Hope to be published in April Does America I ask recognize the role of a theologian as it did when Niebuhr and Tillich uttered prophecies that commanded the cultures attention Those men Tracy responds quickly spoke to a more unified Protestant culture that had just emerged from two world wars and the Depression Since the 60s our culture has been richer and more pluralistic Martin Luther King Jr showed that it neednt be just a white male Protestant who spoke for or to America King used the resources of the culture the Declaration of Independence for example to which he referred with that haunting phrase I read somewhere     What we have had is a crossfertilization of tradition beneath the very gaze of our onceseparate religious establishments What this has led to is a communal rather than individual prophetic voice Its dangerous ethical voice inspired by the classic texts of the Scriptures rises from the synagogues and churches on the great moral issues of our time civil rights peace the environment the morality of nuclear arms It is frightening to think what some members of our Government would feel free to do say in Central America or in dealing with the poor if this voice which cuts across denominations and depends on the common religious impulse did not speak This voice threatens those in the establishment who want religion to endorse comfortable white middleclass values That is also a factor working against one persons assuming a truly prophetic role in our culture T RACY SITS IN THE FIRST row of the University of Chicagos Rockefeller Chapel at the side of Mircea Eliades widow Christinel He had kept vigil at the hospital bedside of the historian of religion who Tracy says profoundly broadened my sense of religious pluralism It is quite clear Tracy says that Catholicism is going through the greatest change since its passage from a Jewish sect to a GrecoRoman religion The ways of being a Catholic will necessarily multiply and the church will be more diverse pluralism in religious expression will increase not decrease At the reception afterward Martin Marty the Lutheran scholar appraises Tracy thoughtfully He is shaping the future of theological inquiry and of Catholicism because as a thinker of the first order he influences not only the seminary professors who teach tomorrows priests but also professors at secular colleges Students are being affected by his vision of theology everywhere Peter Berger however a Boston University sociologist and writer on religion objects to Tracys emphasis on secular over ecclesiastical culture And some Latin American liberation theologians including Juan Luis Segundo of Uruguay see his work as too North American in its optimism and too academic in its settings and concerns These men must know Tracy says revealing the ghost of a classic Irish temper that these are serious misinterpretations of work that is totally consistent with the traditional Catholic sacramental view of the universe As he leaves the reception Tracy comments People are really beginning to understand that the heart of the matter is mystery in any religion The Law is there for the Jew to intensify that sense of mystery not to replace it The Church is there for the Catholic to do the same The great religions draw closer and closer as they sense freshly the mystery in mystery The solemn events of the day have evoked the classic religious theme that is at the core of Tracys theology The religious event described in the First Letter of John asks the question What is the nature of ultimate reality And the answer is God And more explicitly God is love That is an extraordinary thought that ultimate reality is love It is also a terrifying thought The various portraits we get of Jesus in the Gospels are the ways in which Christians try to understand this central metaphor that God is love There is something contradictory here for we see Jesus as sometimes terrifying and as sometimes comforting Love concretely in life tends to be like that Tracy in a soft and wondering way says To think that reality is this is extraordinary If we look at the candidates for classic lives in our century we recognize Pope John XXIII as a saint He intuitively understood as Gandhi did that love is at the heart of everything When he died people of other faiths went into mourning referring to him as their Pope That shows what a man with his sense of what a pope could be was able to accomplish as a symbol of unity The reflective priest in Tracy can be heard as he concludes The religious imagination of people is touched and comes to life in these classic lives events and texts They make us aware of this great mystery  that love is the basic reality And that is what my work is all about IN THE WORDS OF DAVID TRACY IS NOT THE GOD OF the Jewish and Christian scriptures a God profoundly involved in humanitys struggle to the point where God not merely affects but is affected by the struggle Is Bonhoeffers famous cry [ referring to Dietrich Bonhoeffer a German Protestant theologian killed by Hitler ] that only a suffering God can help merely a rhetorical flourish     Can the God of Jesus Christ really be simply changeless omnipotent omniscient unaffected by our anguish and our achievements Was the magnificent move of classical patristic and medieval Catholic Christianity from    the scriptural interest in Gods relationship to humanity to    the patristic and medieval interest in Godinhimself a fully positive move Or did its impressive intellectual achievements conceal certain inherent religious and conceptual difficulties My own suspicion is that all authentic Christians live and pray and speak as if God were really affected by their action They live as if    God really were Pure Unbounded Love struggling suffering achieving with humanity Yet the question recurs Christians may live and say this but can they mean it    Can Christians mean the most fundamental religious affirmation of Christian selfunderstanding if they simultaneously affirm the usual understanding of classical Christianity that God is the selfsubsistent changeless omniscient allpowerful one who is not really    but only notionally    affected by human actions  FROM BLESSED RAGE FOR ORDER THE NEW PLURALISM IN THEOLOGY COPYRIGHT c 1975 BY SEABURY PRESS INC EINSTEIN ONCE REmarked that with the arrival of the atomic age everything had changed except our thinking Unfortunately the remark is true Perhaps contemporary reflections on interpretation with their emphasis on plurality and ambiguity are one more stumbling start across the disciplines to try to change our usual ways of thinking It is true that the point is not to interpret the world but to change it But we will change too little and that probably too late if we do not at the same time change our understanding of what we mean when we so easily claim to interpret the world Our Western dreams of domination mastery and certainty are over The hope that interpretation will show us a way to resist is a fragile hope in a nuclear age It may be less than we deserve but it may also be more than we usually allow oursleves to envision much less act upon As for the rest there is no release for any of us from the conflict of interpretations if we would understand at all The alternative is not an escape into the transient pleasures of irony or a flight into despair and cynicism The alternative is not a new kind of innocence or a passivity masking apathy Whoever fights for hope fights on behalf of us all Whoever acts on that hope acts in a manner worthy of a human being And whoever so acts I believe acts in a manner faintly suggestive of the reality and power of that God in whose image human beings were formed to resist to think and to act The rest is prayer observance discipline conversation and actions of solidarityinhope Or the rest is silence  FROM PLURALITY AND AMBIGUITY HERMENEUTICS RELIGION HOPE TO BE PUBLISHED IN APRIL 1987 REPRINTED BY PERMISSION OF HARPER  ROW PUBLISHERS INC WE CAN CONtinue to give ourselves over to the great hope of Western reason But that hope is now a more modest one as a result of the discovery of the plurality of both language and knowledge and the ambiguities of all histories including the history of reason itself And yet that hope of reason    still lives through any honest fidelity to the classic Socratic imperative The unreflective life is not worth living We can continue to give ourselves over to the hopes alive in all the great religions a trust in Ultimate Reality a hope for the ability to resist what must be resisted a hope in hope itself a hope which fights against our exhausted notions of what hope might be For most religious believers that hope arises from the belief that Ultimate Reality is graceful For nonbelieving interpreters    that hope may be glimpsed in the religious classics by sensing some enlightenment however tentative and some utopian possibility of emancipation however modest The hope proclaimed by all religious ways is well expressed by the classic Buddhist

WEST SIDE HIGH: LAST CHANCE TO LEARN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/10/nyregion/west-side-high-last-chance-to-learn.html,Edward A Reynolds  Ed to his students  does not look or act much like a normal high school principal Wearing a Tshirt blue jeans and sturdy hiking shoes and carrying a walkietalkie he roams the halls of West Side High School like a friendly commando coaxing students into class  Carol go to class  and urging them to obey the rules  Ms Luciano put that cigarette out Mr Reynolds uses nonauthoritarian and unorthodox techniques in one of 11 alternative high schools in New York City a place that tries to recapture teenagers who have dropped out of  or been suspended from the citys larger more impersonal high schools Almost a third of the 271 girls at West Side are mothers some as young as 15 Most of the 600 students have previously been chronicially truant many have attended more than three high schools Very few start out here fresh said the 42yearold Mr Reynolds who uses his walkietalkie to keep in touch with the schools security officers Usually you dont come here unless youve had trouble somewhere Sprouted in 1960s Alternative high schools sprouted in New York City in the late 1960s to serve the large numbers of teenagers alienated from school who stayed on the streets In Brooklyn the High School of Redirection grew out of a state youth grant intended to deal with students involved in summer rioting The Lower East Side Prep School in Manhattan started from an Urban League storefront West Side which opened in 1972 and is now housed in a former elementary school at 140 West 102d Street evolved from concern among local community activists They thought neighborhood teenagers needed an alternative to the overcrowded Louis D Brandeis High School at 145 West 84th Street Six of the 11 alternative high schools including West Side have nurseries where students can leave their babies while they attend class An important course at the school is one that teaches mothers fundamental facts about child development So far fathers have declined to participate in the class Under Mr Reynolds who has been the principal for 12 years the underlying premise of West Side is that the myriad and sometimes overwhelming family and social problems of the students have to be confronted before education can begin Only six students in the school  1 percent  live with both of their natural parents The school employs a juvenilejustice coordinator to help students with their court cases about 50 of the male students have spent time on the rock as they refer to the Rikers Island jail  and an employment counselor finds students jobs Mr Reynolds keeps in touch with a Harlem landlord who can be counted on in a crunch to find apartments for students A morning rarely goes by without a 7 AM phone call from a student with a crisis The other day a 16yearold student telephoned Mr Reynolds saying Hi Dad The students mother was back on the drink Mr Reynolds said and was beating the girls 4yearold twin sisters Mr Reynolds found the father of the twins and persuaded him to take them He found the students stepfather who had left the house and persuaded him to return Later in the day a 15yearold applicant to the school walked in Mr Reynolds learned that her parents both 32 were addicted to cocaine and she was working from 4 PM to 11 PM to support them and her 3yearold brother The girl along with almost anyone else who wants to attend the school was accepted A social worker was assigned to help the students mother find a job and the new student has been encouraged to work fewer hours When the kids come here I tell them they have to do four things come every day come on time every day stay the full number of periods and do all the work assigned to the best of their ability whether they feel like it or not Mr Reynolds said We say the key difference between a child and an adult is that an adult is capable of doing what is their own best interest Contractions in Class The students problems can often be overwhelming and school staff in the absence of parents fill the breach Marie Bronshvag who teaches the class on child care noticed in a recent class that one of the girls pregnant with her second child was complaining about stomach pains It soon became clear that she was complaining every three minutes Ms Bronshvag rushed the girl into a taxi and took her to a nearby hospital which diagnosed her as being well into labor But the hospital was too full to take her and the teacher and student were put in a jitney to a second hospital Some eight hours later the student gave birth to a 6pound 12ounce baby I went to see her in the hospital later Ms Bronshvag said The babys father is heavily into crack I dont know if anyone else had been to see her The girl who lives in a welfare hotel wanted to get a job as well as attend school Ms Bronshvag said I explained she just had to come to school to keep her head above water for a while the teacher said How could she have a job when she is coming to school with a stroller holding a toddlers hand and loaded down with books and diapers Teacher Is Noticed Ms Bronshvag who is to receive an award as teacher of the year at a Board of Education ceremony today tries to teach the mothers in her classes the financial realities of living on welfare She writes on the blackboard what benefits a mother and child receiving welfare are entitled to Then she asks the students to figure out their needs  housing food transportation and utilities The students usually find the results unappealing Im not going to be seeing too many places was one girls reaction Ms Bronshvag said Another commented My clothes are going to be on layaway for so long theyll be out of sytle Homework and Confidence Although many school traditions are absent at West Side traditional learning flourishes in many classes Rochelle Shereff an English teacher assigns and grades homework every night The more they write the more confident they become she said I am traditional I dont see anything wrong with learning skills And I dont see them complaining In one of her recent classes Ms Shereff gave the class of 12 students the start of a composition to be completed for homework  Are you sure thats what you want she asked was the opening line the students were to develop into a story In a discussion of the storys possible twists and turns the students personal concerns were reflected in the themes suggested the break up of a romance a discussion between a doctor and a girl over an abortion someone leaving home The school day at West Side begins with what is called family group any other schools version of home room The same students  normally about 12 to 15  meet with the same teacher eat breakfast brought in from the cafeteria and discuss whatever is on their minds In the same way the teaching staff is divided into family groups for regular meetings that allow the faculty members to solve common problems collectively Teacher morale appears high last month attendance among the faculty was 984 percent very high for the city Ed gives us latitude said Jim Murphy a drug counselor who takes his students on wilderness trips to Maine We dont have department heads breathing down our necks Student Success Stories West Side can point to success stories students who have been able to break the cycles of disfunction they brought with them One of them is Ernie Ortiz now 20 who was 12 when he was pushed out of home by his family The youngest of nine children brought up on welfare he lived in a group home and attended Seward Park High School for a while but dropped out he said because he was too shy to cope with such a large school At 15 he enrolled at West Side with the skills of a fifth grader his adviser Ann Lipson says The school found him a job at a nearby video rental store the store owner rented him a room in her house while he went to school Last week Mr Ortiz graduated after passing algebra and regularly using a thesaurus as a companion in his English classes  and plans to join the Navy In other schools the principals sit in their office in suits and with a cigar Mr Ortiz said Here Ed knows every student by name and I had an adviser who was a very sweet intelligent woman who pushed me The staff makes it work but the kids have to meet them half way

VATICAN II HELPED TRANSFORM CLERIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/12/us/vatican-ii-helped-transform-cleric.html,Two months after Raymond G Hunthausen was appointed a Bishop Pope John XXIII convened the Second Vatican Council The council which lasted from 1962 to 1965 not only transformed a firmly traditional Roman Catholic Church as no other event for centuries but it also transformed the Bishop Vatican II called us back to the primacy of love in our lives he told an interviewer in 1983 eight years after becoming Archbishop We had become overly reliant on the power of law and discipline and had put aside the very principle that undergirds the churchs existence The council and the Gospels tell each one of us to be responsible to discern as we can in the spirit of love just what God is asking us to do Now Archbishop Hunthausen the primate of the Archdiocese of Seattle may be paying the price for the Vaticans conviction that the American church has extended the councils ideas about freedom of conscience too far at the expense of discipline His authority in several areas was superseded by his Auxiliary Bishop after the Vatican found shortcomings in the archdioceses liturgy and marriage annulment procedures and in its conduct toward former priests and homosexual groups The Vatican said the Archbishop lacked the firmness necessary to govern Deeply Upset and Baffled The prelate at the center of this storm is a reflective man who intimates say is deeply upset and baffled by what has happened particularly the suggestion that he disrespects Pope John Paul II I dont know of anybody who is more respectful of the Holy Father said Bishop Nicholas E Walsh the retired Bishop of Yakima Wash who has known Archbishop Hunthausen for more than 40 years I think its the most painful period of his life Critics like Erven Park a salesman of heavy equipment who heads a conservative group Roman Catholic Laity for Truth that has spearheaded the attacks on the Archbishop disagree with such assessments He carries a double agenda Mr Park said in an interview yesterday He will make certain statements on orthodoxy and support for unity and the Holy See But in fact he totally supports those of his lieutenants who are in open rebellion with the Holy See The Archbishop first stepped into the national spotlight with his fight for nuclear disarmament early in this decade Saying that the ultimate evil is that as a nation we are willing to destroy life to protect our life style he refused to pay the share of his taxes that went toward military expenditures Friends say that reverence for life is also evident in his deep love of woods and mountains The Archbishop regularly leads fellow Northwest bishops on weeklong backpacking expeditions in the Montana wilderness where they sleep under the stars and pray in the stillness of that locales vast spaces Accomplished Skier A short sturdily built man of 65 years the Archbishop is an accomplished skier who has schussed the slopes of Aspen and Sun Valley He rides a fivespeed bicycle shoots 18 holes of golf in the middletohigh 80s and is according to Bishop Walsh an impatient fisherman Raymond Gerhardt Hunthausen known from childhood as Dutch was born Aug 21 1921 in Anaconda Mont His parents were German immigrants His father was a grocer selling goods to the mineworkers and his mothers family ran a brewery Archbishop Hunthausen the oldest of seven children remembers gatherings that bubbled with life Those were noisy happy times he said We recall them with such delight that my brothers and sisters and I will throw a family reunion at the drop of a hat The family sent the children to parochial schools and young Raymond was often chosen by the Ursuline nuns to give a speech whenever the Bishop of Helena visited It killed me he said but I did it out of duty and respect Now I realize its important to have been pushed I still feel a sense of pressure about everything He went to Carroll College a small mens school in Helena where the Rev Bernard Topel later the Bishop of Spokane gently steered him toward the priesthood Humanly speaking I didnt want to be a priest he said I was attracted to marriage and family life and I wanted to fly airplanes At St Edwards Seminary he was known as deeply spiritual although not pious yet his vocational doubts persisted until his ordination in 1946 At the moment of ordination when I heard myself promising a life of prayer and celibacy all my doubts were resolved even though other choices were finally cut off he recalled In Athletic Hall of Fame He taught chemistry at Carroll College but earned a larger reputation coaching the football basketball baseball and track teams The teams won eight conference championships and the Archbishop may be the only member of the American hierarchy in the Hall of Fame of the National Association of Intercollegiate Athletics He served as president of Carroll for five years until 1962 when he was appointed Bishop of Helena Armed with the pluralistic message of Vatican II whose sessions he attended the new Bishop gave priests and lay people a freer reign in their own parishes That attitude continued when he moved to Seattle in 1975 to take over a diocese that covers the western third of Washington although some priests complain that his loose style of management has permitted staff members to pursue their own liberal goals In 1983 the members of the archdioceses Respect Life Committee resigned out of frustration with the efforts of the Chancery staff to combat abortions But supporters are pleased that the Archbishop has made overtures to people who had often felt excluded by the church divorced Catholics women illegal aliens homosexuals They are Catholics he said of a 1983 cathedral mass celebrated for the homosexual group Dignity How could I deny them a church

Why Do Abortion Foes Make Bomb Threats?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/13/opinion/l-why-do-abortion-foes-make-bomb-threats-482086.html,To the Editor At 1130 AM on Oct 31 in my shirtsleeves I was ordered to evacuate the building where I work along with all of my coworkers and hundreds of people from a number of other floors We were told a bomb threat had been phoned in to an abortion clinic housed in the building We were out on the street about three hours until the police gave the allclear Fortunately no one was hurt and no bomb went off But people were frightened needlessly And what is most outrageous is that two pregnant women who want their babies faced the threat of injury or death at the hands of a mindless fanatic How is this person any different from the terrorists in Beirut He was perfectly willing to maim innocent people to make a point But what point That a constitutional right is not acceptable to him That his religious beliefs take precedence over human life People like this call themselves prolife They are apparently willing to kill to prove it RAY BOSSIK Merrick LI Nov 5 1986
WASHINGTON TALK; A Turning Point On the Abortion Issue?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/13/us/washington-talk-a-turning-point-on-the-abortion-issue.html,After long years on the defensive advocates of abortion rights are cheering the results of last weeks elections They say that the victory of prochoice candidates for the Senate and House of Representatives as well as the defeat of several antiabortion measures on state ballots strengthens their movement not only to resist further erosion but to regain the initiative on such issues as public financing of abortions for poor women For their part antiabortion leaders concede they have received a frustrating setback They criticize the Reagan Administration for playing down the abortion issue along with the rest of the conservative social agenda and thereby failing to motivate committed antiabortion voters to come out and vote These issues got a lot of Republicans and conservative Democrats elected in the first place said Jack P Fowler director of the Washington office of the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life an antiabortion lobbying group But for some reason the Administration and the candidates wanted to stay away from abortion this year He called the strategy a misjudgment adding It smacks of stupidity Kate Michelman executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League says the prochoice side picked up at least three seats in the Senate and five in the House while no prochoice incumbent was defeated for any Federal office The three Senate seats all won by Democrats are in Georgia with the substitution of Wyche Fowler Jr for an antiabortion Republican freshman Mack Mattingly South Dakota where Representative Tom Daschle defeated James Abdnor and North Carolina where the Senate seat was held by one of the chambers most committed abortion foes John P East until his suicide last summer Mr Easts interim replacement Representative James T Broyhill who had a generally antiabortion voting record was defeated last week by a strong prochoice candidate Terry Sanford In addition although Bob Graham the Senate winner in Florida is not firmly on the prochoice side he is viewed as more liberal on abortion than the Republican he defeated Paula Hawkins In the House four of the six defeated incumbents had antiabortion records and will be replaced by prochoice challengers who received money from the abortion rights leagues political action committee The newcomers all Democrats are Ben Nighthorse Campbell of Colorado who defeated Mike Strang Mike Espy of Mississippi defeating Webb Franklin Louise Slaughter of upstate New York defeating Fred J Eckert and David Price of North Carolina who defeated Bill Cobey Jr The league counts a second victorious North Carolina Democrat James McC Clarke as an improvement over the incumbent Bill Hendon although it did not give him money A Shot in the Arm Janet Benshoof director of the Reproductive Freedom Project of the American Civil Liberties Union thinks the most important result of the election may be to make candidates believe that being prochoice isnt death For the last decade she says the conventional wisdom has been that an antiabortion stand was the only safe one for a politician leading a number of prochoice officials to duck the issue or to hide their real beliefs This election will be a shot in the arm for people to vote their principles Ms Benshoof added The only Senate candidate to run on an overtly prochoice platform Harriet Woods of Missouri was narrowly defeated by Christopher Bond who is a strong opponent of abortion as was Senator Thomas F Eagleton whose retirement created the vacancy Richard Mintz spokesman for the National Abortion Rights Action League said Ms Woods had been trailing in the polls and improved her standing albeit insufficiently after running television spots in which she described abortion as a private matter that should be decided by each individual and not by the Government Despite the inroads last week the House retains a lopsided antiabortion majority by as many as 25 votes Two antiabortion leaders of the House Bob Dornan of California and Christopher H Smith of New Jersey both Republicans were targeted by the abortion rights league but easily won reelection But the newly constituted Senate if not affirmatively prochoice is probably now too close to call on the abortion question We can work with the Senate now Ms Michelman said We lost a lot in the past but now the momentum is shifting our way and were planning to go forward and take the offensive The abortion rights movements top legislative priority is to restore Federal funding through the Medicaid program for abortions for poor women Congress has barred Federal funding for the last 10 years although 14 states including New York have continued on their own to subsidize abortions for poor women Theyre suffering delusions of grandeur Kay James public affairs director of the National Right to Life Committee said of the abortion rights leaders plan to push for public funding But she added that given the losses in the Senate we have our work cut out for us Ballot Initiatives Defeated The sharpest losses for the antiabortion movement came with the defeat of ballot initiatives in Massachusetts Rhode Island and Oregon that would have restricted access to abortion The Massachusetts and Rhode Island measures would have given the states sweeping powers to ban abortion if the Supreme Court were to overturn its 1973 decision Roe v Wade that made abortion a constitutional right The voters in Rhode Island the most heavily Roman Catholic state in the country defeated the measure by a 2to1 ratio A similar proposal in Arkansas apparently lost by a few hundred votes but state officials there will not certify the results until next week The measure had been winning by as much as 40 percent in preelection polls until Planned Parenthood began running a television commercial that depicted a 14yearold rape victim pregnant and unable to get an abortion
VATICAN AIDES SAY BISHOPS' TALKS IN U.S. MAY MARK TURNING POINT,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/13/us/vatican-aides-say-bishops-talks-in-us-may-mark-turning-point.html,Senior Vatican officials said today that the American bishops conference might be a turning point in the difficult relations between the Holy See and important elements of the Roman Catholic Church in the United States Officials in several Vatican offices assessing the bishops meeting in Washington this week said they were not surprised by either the divisions between liberal and conservative bishops or by the resentment toward Rome felt by some American prelates The officials emphasized however that the issues were now more clearly defined and that the road had been opened for efforts to heal the rift probably including a meeting between Pope John Paul II and representatives of the American hierarchy The Vatican has not issued any statements about the bishops meeting said Joaquin Navarro Valls the Popes chief spokesman because it wants to avoid the appearance of trying to influence the meeting Vatican officials generally discussed the meeting cautiously and asked not to be identified A Focus on Allegiance A senior aide to the Pope said In the past the difficulties have been posed in terms of disagreements on several different moral issues like abortion and contraception Now everyone seems to realize that something much more fundamental is involved the structure of the church and in particular the bishops allegiance to the Pope Another aide said This could be a turning point Even though the divisions will not go away overnight the bishops are now focusing on their relationship with Rome and perhaps realizing that disagreements can only go so far The American bishops while acknowledging the dismay and confusion caused by the Vaticans decision to discipline Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle issued a statement today reaffirming their loyalty to and unity with the Holy Father Archbishop Hunthausen was censured in September for what was called divergence from church teachings Senior Vatican officials said the Pope was well aware that his authority faced a vocal challenge from a large segment of the church in the United States The degree of dissent even among the bishops is wellknown here one said So is the fact that much of that dissent is aimed at Rome The problems of the church in the United States have become the focus of increasing concern as the Vatican begins planning the Popes eightday visit to the United States in September There is every realization that this is going to be a difficult and important trip one aide said Bishop James W Malone who is stepping down as president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops suggested on Monday that American bishops meet with the Pope before the trip to work out their difficulties Several Vatican officials noted that in the past the Pope used special meetings with national hierarchies to ease tensions and to encourage obedience Thus he might meet with the Americans Commenting on the lack of official Vatican statements on the American bishops meeting the officials said the Pope had made his intentions clear in a message read at the opening session You are and must always be in full communion with the Successor of Peter the Pope said referring to himself with the papacys most potent source of authority in its direct link to Jesus Christ Some officials here viewed the Popes message as extraordinary because most of it was taken up with reminding the bishops of the papacys functions and purpose saying for instance that a Pope is the first servant of the churchs unity and universality Two cases in which John Paul met with members of a national hierarchy to contend with dissent were in January 1980 when the bishops of the Netherlands spent three weeks in Rome and last March when the Pope met with representatives of Brazils hierarchy The meeting with the Dutch prelates was called by the Pope to halt a move toward open schism between liberal and conservative Dutch Catholics and to enforce orthodoxy on such basic issues as priestly celibacy The meeting was generally considered a success The other meeting was to help mediate differences in Brazil over the degree to which the church should be involved in political action on behalf of the poor The differences were not resolved but Vatican officials said relations between the bishops and Rome were notably improved

U.S. REPORT ASSERTS ADMINISTRATION HALTED LIBERAL 'ANTI-FAMILY AGENDA',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/14/us/us-report-asserts-administration-halted-liberal-anti-family-agenda.html,A report issued today by a Reagan Administration panel on the family asserts that two liberal decades frayed the fabric of American family life bringing increased crime illegitimate birth drug use teenage pregnancy divorce sexually transmitted disease and poverty A result of a sevenmonth study by the 22member interdepartmental group the report maintains that the Reagan Administration brought to a crashing halt the antifamily agenda of preceding years initiating a defense of the family that has since become fashionable According to Gary Bauer Under Secretary of Education who headed the panel the report has been sent to the White House Domestic Policy Council which will forward it to President Reagan after study and potential revision The 64page report which Mr Bauer discussed at a news conference today is more descriptive than prescriptive and hews closely to conservative thinking on issues from abortion to welfare Role of Welfare Discussed It hails selfsacrifice selfsufficiency discipline and religion Urging less Government involvement in family life it encourages greater awareness of the possible ramifications for families of government action It also maintains welfare contributes to the failure to form the family in the first place and says the easy availability of welfare in all of its forms has become a powerful force for destruction of family life through perpetuation of the welfare culture Among its key recommendations the report says Mr Reagan should require all agencies and departments to write a family fairness statement on the impact of any new legislation or regulation on families And it advises the Treasury Department to consider increasing the personal exemption for dependents to ease the tax burden for families with children The starting point for the Government in dealing with the family should be the central tenet of the Hippocratic oath First of all do no harm the study says With that goal in mind it explains that the family fairness statement it seeks to have the President carry out should require agencies and departments to consider any new actions against eight criteria These include an examination of whether the action would lessen earned household income whether it would reinforce the marital commitment that holds the home together and whether it could be carried out by a lower level of government or by the private sector The report drew criticism from several who said the findings had been shaped to fit a rightwing political agenda The document is less a policy paper than a tantrum said Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan the New York Democrat who is an expert on welfare policy Worse it is an embarrassment Theyre not writing from facts This is just ideology Mr Moynihan whose book on family problems Family and Nation was published this year attacked the groups statement that benefits under Aid to Families With Dependent Children were indexed to provide regular increases to accommodate the cost of living Drop in Welfare Payments If you know one thing about AFDC its that it is not indexed and was bashed by the inflation of the 70s Mr Moynihan said Welfare payments declined sharply during this period so it is also illogical to suggest that welfare dependency has increased owing to increasing payments Payments have gone down because they were not indexed Mr Bauer conceded the error saying it had been caught Wednesday night too late to make any corrections Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts termed the report a smokescreen for failure Robert Greenstein director of the Center on Budget and Policy Priorities a nonprofit research organization said As a study the report is not objective or dispassionate But some of the recommendations are worthy of consideration In particular Mr Greenstein who worked in the Carter Administration praised the report for suggesting that earned income tax credits for working poor families with children might be increased with the number of children That would make the benefits of working more competitive with benefits of public assistance he said Patrick Fagan executive vice president of the Free Congress Foundation a conservative social policy organization said We like very much what Mr Bauer is saying The American Public Welfare Association a bipartisan association concerned with social welfare policy applauded the reports goal of strengthening the family But its director A Sidney Johnson 3d added While we agree with Secretary Bauers statement that public policies should do no harm to Americas families that certainly should not mean do nothing In the press conference Mr Bauer said the working group had used as its definition of family those related by blood marriage or adoption He denied suggestions that the tone of the report was critical of mothers who worked couples who decided not to have children and those who divorced The report says Intact families are good Families who choose to have children are making a desirable decision Mothers and fathers who then decide to spend a good deal of time raising those children themselves rather than leaving it to others are demonstrably doing a good thing for those children Public policy and the culture in general must support and reaffirm these decisions  not undermine and be hostile to them or send a message that we are neutral The report says single mothers who are under 21 should not be given subsidized housing if they decide to live apart from their parents It says Aid to Families With Dependent Children could be restructured in a similar way
IN THE NATION; A Good Man Going,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/opinion/in-the-nation-a-good-man-going.html,One recent afternoon not long after most members of the 99th Congress had departed to campaign or to rest Senator Charles McC Mathias Republican of Maryland was in his office pondering such details as sansserif type and boldface caps for a redesigned Congressional Record Changes in that venerable publication could cause an uproar on traditionconscious Capitol Hill But Mac Mathias as chairman of the Senates housekeeping Rules Committee could pick and choose without concern After 26 years in Congress eight in the House and the last 18 in the Senate he had decided to go home  in his case just to the Washington suburbs Any senators departure might ordinarily be less earthshaking than a revamped Congressional Record but the Mathias retirement opened his seat to the Democrats in a year when the Republicans needed to hold every one they could Barbara Mikulski a Baltimore Democrat won it by a smashing 61 percent  which only emphasizes how remarkable it was that Mac Mathias could win three Senate terms in one of the most Democratic states in the nation He did it not only by being reasonably liberal  Ronald Reagan before he began to need Senate votes accused him of not being a true Republican  but because he was fair flexible concerned able to rise above partisanship but not above responsibility His reward from his party was to be euchred out of the chairmanship of the Judiciary Committee when seniority should have brought it to him in 1981 instead conservatives persuaded ancient Strom Thurmond of South Carolina to jump from the Armed Services Committee to block him But Mac Mathias is not a bitter man He chooses to remember happier events  improving for instance the pension of a Confederate veterans widow who for years had never received the costofliving increases she was due  and larger satisfactions like the Chesapeake and Ohio Canal National Historical Park that runs through Maryland In the House in 1961 Mac Mathias introduced the legislation establishing the park then he saw action completed in the Senate in 1969 When I put that bill in he recalled old Clarence Brown [ an Ohio Congressman ] said Whoever heard of a national park 20 miles wide I told him Yes but its 180 miles long Now I like to drive along the canal and see the people out there enjoying themselves Its not well enough remembered that when President Kennedy  who was elected the year Mac Mathias went to the House  failed to submit a promised civil rights bill during his first Congress three Republicans introduced one in January 1963 before Mr Kennedy sent up what became the Civil Rights Act of 1964 They were John Lindsay of New York William McCullough of Ohio and Mac Mathias Ours wasnt as extensive as the final bill Mr Mathias conceded but it was the clear forerunner and had a lot to do with Republican support in the House After 18 years he still admires the Senate as an institution in which only collective strength  often bipartisan  makes positive action possible but one too in which only one member if he or she has the desire to do it can really slow down a freight train  for example proposals that may threaten civil liberties or constitutional rights but have the backing of a majority motivated by momentary passions But he sees the Senate functioning poorly in recent years owing to complex new problems energy the environment foreign trade the substitution of a single omnibus bill no one understands for the traditional authorizationappropriations procedure a less felicitous atmosphere among more ideological senators and contentious issues such as acid rain and abortion Which senators among all those he served with had he most respected Without hesitation he named Fulbright Javits John Sherman Cooper Cliff Case Phil Hart Mike Mansfield George Aiken Why Individual responsibility Each one of those people would take an issue on his own responsibility They wouldnt have to have the cover of some ideology Theyd simply come to the conclusion that this was the right thing for the country Such individual responsibility in his own career surely is another reason Democratic Maryland kept Republican Mac Mathias in the Senate as long as hed stay

MEESE AIDE ASSAILS THE PRESS AND LAW SCHOOLS ON COURTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/us/meese-aide-assails-the-press-and-law-schools-on-courts.html,A top Justice Department official today denounced what he called liberal media and elite law schools as propagating an overblown myth that courts should engage in liberal social reform in the name of constitutional interpretation The official Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds asserted that the elites who advocate and celebrate judicial supremacy viewed the Constitution only as what can be found in the most recent collection of Supreme Court opinions that further their liberal agenda His remarks were in a speech prepared for delivery in Chicago tonight to the Federalist Society a national group of conservative law students and lawyers A fervent conservative Mr Reynolds heads the departments civil rights division and is one of the most trusted aides to Attorney General Edwin Meese 3d While echoing many of Mr Meeses criticisms of liberal judicial activism Mr Reynolds aimed most of his fire at what he called a lack of any real appreciation for the Constitution and its history on the part of major news organizations and law schools Charges Ignorance of Law Many of the nations top editorial writers and news analysts neither very learned in the law nor at all intimidated by that shortcoming have misused their media access to foster public misconceptions about our Constitution and the proper role of the courts under it he said In addition he said The overwhelming majority of tenured professors in our law schools today are aligned philosophically with the liberal left and they view their mission much less in terms of teaching first principles than in terms of cultivating new recruits to advance their social reform agendas Mr Reynolds said it was in part to combat this bias in news organizations and law schools that Mr Meese had set out to to help educate the public about our constitutional heritage during the Bicentennial celebration For too long in this country he said we have suffered silently too many judicial emperors with no constitutional clothes These appointees erroneously regard their pronouncements from the bench as the supreme law of the land Law professors by and large  with a few notable exceptions  teach their students that this decisional law is supreme And certainly a misguided and largely untutored cabal of liberal journalists and commentators share and assiduously promote this view Cites Outcry on Meese Talk In particular Mr Reynolds assailed what he called the petulant outcry from the liberal left in response to the Attorney Generals speech at Tulane University His reference was to an Oct 21 speech in which Mr Meese said a Supreme Court interpretation of the Constitution while binding on the immediate parties to the case and any officials who must enforce the ruling was not on a par with the Constitution itself Such a ruling does not establish a supreme law of the land that is binding on all persons and parts of government henceforth and forevermore he said Mr Meeses speech was denounced by some civil libertarians liberal legal scholars and editorialists They said it seemed to encourage lawlessness and defiance of the Court akin to the massive resistance by Southern states to the 1954 decision striking down school segregation Asserting as has Mr Meese that nothing in the Tulane speech could fairly be read as calling for such defiance Mr Reynolds said today His remarks were not an attack on the Court They were instead a useful and muchneeded explanation of the judicial process For many of these elites in journalism the law schools and academe he continued no death penalty may intrude upon their world even though the framers of the Constitution found such punishment to be neither cruel nor unusual Yet they would freely permit a death sentence to be pronounced by way of abortion on the most innocent and fragile among us Their attention is riveted on rights of the accused to a degree that is a logical absurdity He said a result was that victims of crime are largely left to fend for themselves Criticizes Law School Courses Mr Reynolds said most law schools have largely abdicated their responsibility to educate the future members of our profession on the Constitution partly because courses on constitutional law focus almost exclusively on specific rulings of the Supreme Court neglecting the Constitutions text and history and the intent of the Framers Regrettably he added it has become the accepted understanding of generations of law students that the Constitution is what the judges say it is  He said most lawyers are largely indifferent to such cosmic issues that have no relevance to their more mundane but infinitely more lucrative client issues Meanwhile many activist law graduates reinforced by a liberal media were appointed to the bench by previous Administrations and have gone on to work their special brand of judicial activism Possessed of a thinly disguised intellectual arrogance that not infrequently takes cover behind the spirit of the Constitution as found in its socalled penumbra Mr Reynolds said they roam widely across the legal landscape content not only to proscribe public policy but intent on prescribing it as well He said these judges have undertaken to reshape American society to their moral liking and have created new rights where none existed in the Constitution He said they had pursued a philosophy of radical egalitarianism which Mr Reynolds ascribed in a speech last month to Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr
IDEAS & TRENDS; ARE FETAL RIGHTS EQUAL TO INFANTS'?,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/weekinreview/ideas-trends-are-fetal-rights-equal-to-infants.html,THE question of whether a fetus is a person with all the legal and civil rights that status entails is at the heart of a growing debate on the responsibilities women have to their unborn children A pregnant woman who decides not to have an abortion is obliged to care for her child that much is probably not controversial But should the state intervene if the woman fails to meet her obligation This knottier question underlies a number of recent cases in which judges have taken steps to protect the lives of fetuses In Colorado Illinois and Georgia for example women have been ordered to undergo Caesarean sections after doctors testified that fetuses were in danger The women had objected to Caesareans on religious grounds or because they were afraid In other cases judges have ordered that braindamaged pregnant women be kept on lifesupport systems  in some instances over the objection of family members  so fetuses could survive Fetuses have also implicitly been granted personhood by feticide laws that permit prosecution for homicide when a fetus is killed in a criminal attack on the mother Sixteen states have adopted such laws which have been championed by the righttolife movement But nowhere have the twinned issues of fetal rights and maternal responsibilities been raised as pointedly as in the case of 27yearold Pamela Rae Stewart Monson Mrs Monson who lives with her husband in a trailer park in the San Diego suburb of El Cajon is one of the few women in the United States to face criminal charges for the conduct of her pregnancy Last November Mrs Monson gave birth to a braindead son According to the El Cajon police she had suffered during her pregnancy from placenta previa a condition in which the placenta may separate from the uterine wall depriving the fetus of oxygen and nutrients A doctor had warned Mrs Monson that drugs or sexual intercourse could trigger the onset of the condition and had told her to seek immediate medical attention if she started to hemorrhage In the ninth month of her pregnancy according to the charges filed against her Mrs Monson ignored these warnings When her son was born physicians found amphetamines and barbituates in his blood Most important Mrs Monson had failed to get to the hospital for more than six hours after she began bleeding heavily For that failure she is scheduled to stand trial next year in San Diego Charged with a criminal misdemeanor she faces a year in prison if convicted A Troubling Prosecution Harry Elias chief of the child abuse unit of the San Diego District Attorneys office chose to prosecute Mrs Monson under a 1926 California statute that makes it a crime for a parent to willfully omit without lawful excuse necessary medical attendants for a child The purpose of the statute was to secure support payments for children including unborn ones Michael Shapiro a professor of legal and medical ethics at the University of Southern California said the California law might well apply to Mrs Monson if Mr Elias could establish a clear medical connection between her failure to follow her doctors instructions and the death of her son But he called the issue troubling on all sides adding I am concerned about the attitude of disrespect for the fetus I am just as concerned about intruding on a womans private life Other ethicists argued that cases like the one involving Mrs Monson do not belong in the criminal justice system There are a number of options besides criminal prosecution said Arthur Caplan of the Hastings Center an ethics institute in New York I dont think we want to pass laws about not getting to the hospital on time When and how the state may legitimately intervene in the relationship between mother and fetus is a question that seems likely to arise again and again The Monson case is significant said Mr Caplan because there is a large group of mothers  addicts alcoholics and others with various drug abuses  who are producing a fair number of severely ill infants Yet as Professor Shapiro put it the police cannot be dropping in on pregnant women every six weeks or executing search warrants to see if there is heroin or alcohol in the house What can the state do The real issue underlying the Monson case according to Alexander Capron of the University of Southern California is the quality of prenatal care available to poor women Most mothers who are poor want to take care of their babies he said but are stopped by financial problems and a lack of good prenatal care Mrs Monson for example did not receive medical care until her seventh month of pregnancy Moreover said Richard Boesen Mrs Monsons attorney the prosecution of a supposedly negligent mother may discourage some women from seeking prenatal care Boesen said he had received calls from pregnant drugusers who are avoiding seeing a doctor out of fear they may be subject to criminal action
NEW CONGRESSIONAL LEADERS HOPE TO CLOSE THE AGENDA GAP,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/weekinreview/new-congressional-leaders-hope-to-close-the-agenda-gap.html,SENATOR J BENNETT JOHNSTON was direct in announcing that he was withdrawing from the race for Senate majority leader I do not believe I have the votes the Louisiana Democrat said With his statement the high leadership of the 100th Congress became set Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the minority leader for the last six years is assured of winning the majority leaderhip again in elections this week In the House Representative Jim Wright of Texas will be anointed Speaker on Dec 8 succeeding Thomas P ONeill Jr of Massachusetts But while Senator Johnston withdrawing gracefully appealed for party unity he also warned his colleagues that the dangers are great in the Congress that convenes in January Indeed many Republicans seem distinctly relieved that the Federal deficit for one is now the responsibility of the Democrats I dont sense that theres much consensus on their agenda for governing the country said Senator John Heinz a Pennsylvania Republican As the Republicans found out last week there is not much consensus in either party Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina who two years ago declined the chairmanship of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee to continue as chairman of Agriculture told his colleagues that he now wants the top Republican position on Foreign Relations Senator Richard G Lugar of Indiana the outgoing Foreign Relations chairman also wants to be ranking Republican and says he will not move over for Mr Helms who has seniority The Republican members of the committee will have to choose between them in elections soon and the choice illuminates a deep fissure in Republican ranks Mr Helms represents the hard right wing of the party which identifies with antiCommunist movements from Angola to Afghanistan Mr Lugar a more pragmatic conservative believes the United States must support nationalist movements in such countries as South Africa and the Philippines A Helms victory would signify that Senate Republicans are ready for confrontation with the Democrats Mr Byrd also faces divisions among his troops Liberals are dusting off proposals for social welfare programs such as public financing for abortions More centrist legislators such as Mr Johnston are arguing that the Democrats cannot play this game of being all things to all people Roping in the Mavericks One theory holds that the Democrats large margin in the Senate 55 to 45 will cause difficulties for both parties The Senate works best when it is closely divided said Norman Ornstein a scholar at the American Enterprise Institute in Washington The mavericks in both parties are under more internal pressure to stay in check Mr Johnstons bid for the Democratic leadership had less to do with such considerations than with the concerns that prompted the unsuccessful challenge by Senator Lawton C Chiles of Florida to Mr Byrd in 1984  a belief that Mr Byrd had not propounded a coherent party strategy and communicated its message to the public Mr Johnston based his campaign on the argument that he would present a better face Mr Byrds reply was that as minority leader he had little power to set the agenda or command public attention Leading the majority requires a different style Mr Byrd said adding that while he is not a pretty face on television he would not cringe from the camera Other Democratic senators said Mr Byrd had solidified his support by promising to step down as leader in 1988 The landscape of the House has also been altered During Mr ONeills last six years as Speaker he was the most visible Democrat in the capital often serving as the partys chief spokesman With the Senate returned to the Democrats Mr Wright will have to share the limelight For the last 50 years the Democratic leadership in the House has oscillated along an Austin to Boston axis Liberal Northeasterners have alternated with moderate Southwesterners in an unspoken but powerful tradition that prevents either region or philosophy from dominating the party As Mr ONeill put it recently Mr Wright whose aspirations to the leadership Mr ONeill supported would have to start focusing more broadly Were all parochial he said but he will have to understand that he just cant talk to the oil people or the agriculture people The Texas lawmaker is known for tubthumping oratory a style that does not always play well on the home screen Many House Democrats are hoping that the new Speaker will follow Senator Byrds lead and hire a good television consultant The first fight facing the Democrats under Mr Wright is the party whip contest Tony Coelho of California who has won many friends and made a few enemies with his stewardship of the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee is running as is Charles B Rangel of New York who has strong support among liberals and would be the first black to win a leadership post Mr Wright will then have to start working with Senate Democrats forging party positions on such contentious issues as trade with Asia and aid to the Nicaraguan rebels These early tests will help indicate how effective a counterweight the new leadership will provide to the master politician who still has two years in the White House
THESE PIONEERS WANT CABLE TV,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/16/books/these-pioneers-want-cable-tv.html,THE NEW HEARTLAND Americas Flight Beyond the Suburbs and How It Is Changing Our Future By John Herbers 228 pp New York Times Books 1995 FORT COLLINS Coeur dAlene and Mountain Home may not yet be household words However these communities  in Colorado Idaho and Arkansas respectively  and others like them are among the fastestgrowing in the United States While most large cities continue to decline and many suburbs are marking time small towns and rural areas are in fact attracting people Perhaps this was bound to happen After all surveys have consistently shown that almost half of all Americans say they would like to live in such settings And as John Herbers shows in The New Heartland growing numbers are now able to realize that wish Indeed he points out in this engrossing and probing book a large proportion of Americans have never felt comfortable with the structure of the modern metropolitan area They find the suburbs sterile and cities  well theyre not even nice places to visit anymore Nor do all young professionals aspire to fasttrack careers More and more people with college degrees are opting for simplicity of life and rural atmosphere Moreover this trend has political implications notably in a fundamentalism that has an agenda for the nation as a whole Mr Herbers a national correspondent for The New York Times has visited the several dozen places he depicts in his book He also deals deftly with census figures using them to pinpoint subtle shifts in preferences and values Recent years he writes have seen a massive decentralization of industry with companies looking for lowwage areas with a ready supply of female labor Between 1970 and 1980 Fort Collins once a secluded college town grew by 50 percent after Kodak HewlettPackard and NCR decided to set up plants there Not the least of its attractions was that less than 4 percent of the local work force was unionized compared with 15 percent elsewhere in the state Increasingly insurance companies are moving their regional offices to small communities because they have a good supply of wives willing to work for supplemental salaries Even USX formerly United States Steel plans to build its new plants in semirural settings which is what Japanese firms in the United States are already doing And as towns and counties grow they hang out Help Wanted signs More than half of Coeur dAlenes police officers are alumni of the Los Angeles force If newcomers settle for smaller salaries the cost of living is lower and they seem to maintain a comfortable life Mr Herbers found a wellstocked wine and cheese store along with a New Yorkstyle deli in most smaller shopping centers Mr Herbers was raised in a small Tennessee town and has a good understanding of what the new heartlanders want These men and women he says represent a return to the philosophy of an earlier America formed before we became an urbanized nation Their philosophy may have deep roots but they want a frontier stocked with urban amenities None of the people we meet show any interest in agriculture or even fellow feeling for it Those with homes next to farms complain about the smell of fertilizer and the noise made by tractors In a chapter entitled The High Cost of Spreading Out Mr Herbers shows how the tab for living in the new heartland rises as more people move in Thus when the terrain cannot take more wells or more septic tanks waterlines and sewers must be installed And with satellite signals being scrambled we hear demands for cable television Despite all talk of selfreliance a heartland tailored to modern tastes will require subsidies APART from being blandly middleclass and enjoying the outofdoors the people Mr Herbers describes seem to lack distinctive traits or qualities Whatever ethnic backgrounds they have appear to have faded especially as distance weakens family ties This helps explain their selfcentered individualism with its strong moral tone Thus they select communities that are overwhelmingly white or in the South or Southwest areas where only whites are moving in All the places he visited voted more heavily Republican than did the rest of those states Perhaps the most important catalyst has been the activism of evangelical churches which have made a point of welcoming heartland newcomers and providing them with a readymade community The result has been to renew and broaden the fundamentalist constituency a development closely watched by the current Administration By no means do all evangelical congregations go in for faith healing or frenzied confessions Many have communicants with sophisticated tastes What they provide is the feeling that the way of life their adherents have chosen is morally and politically right Having found that path Mr Herbers goes on to suggest they wish to see those values embraced by the nation as a whole For Americans who wish to understand attacks on textbooks antipathy to abortion and the defeat of the equal rights amendment The New Heartland offers some of the best insights I have seen on the energies that fuel these campaigns

WASHINGTON TALK: BRIEFING; Bring On the Makeup,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/17/us/washington-talk-briefing-bring-on-the-makeup.html,Senator Edward M Kennedys decision to choose the chairmanship of the Labor and Human Resources Committee rather than the Judiciary Committee next year may provide a significant political assist after all for Senator Joseph R Biden Jr of Delaware who is considering a run for the Democratic Presidential nomination in 1988 A study by Stephen Hess of the Brookings Institution indicated earlier this year that Judiciary attracts more national television coverage than any other committee except Foreign Relations A new study by Mr Hess of coverage by local television stations shows the Judiciary Committee receiving nearly twice as much attention as its nearest rival the Labor Committee One of the most serious problems confronting Senator Bidens national political ambitions is that he is not well known outside his small home state He had originally entertained some concern that the judiciary chairmanship might spotlight him unduely on controversial issues but that reluctance may pass Mr Hess believes the Judiciary Committee has attracted considerable television interest because it deals with proposed Constitutional amendments on controversial issues like abortion school prayer and budget balancing not because of its oversight of Presidential judicial appointments The Brookings fellows findings on coverage of Congress by local television which has expanded considerably in recent years will be included in his forthcoming book The Main Street Senate
HEALTH CLINICS EXPAND INTO INTERMEDIATE SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/18/nyregion/health-clinics-expand-into-intermediate-schools.html,With complaints ranging from sore throats to thoughts of suicide students at Intermediate School 52 in the Inwood section of Manhattan have been flocking for the last month to a new suite of pinkwalled cubicles in the school  a modern medical clinic that contrasts with the dingy hallways and classrooms It is the only health care that many of them receive Some 80 percent of the schools 1000 students are from the Dominican Republic many of them newly arrived immigrants from rural areas where medical care is minimal The free clinic at 650 Academy Street and Broadway is described as the first comprehensive intermediateschool healthcare clinic in New York City A second such clinic is to open today at IS 164 at 401 West 164th Street near St Nicholas Avenue in Washington Heights They reflect a nationwide trend toward schoolbased health services for teenagers  most of them so far in high schools according to Judith Jones an associate clinical professor of public health at Columbia University who developed the two programs They are a response to community need in disadvantaged areas she said and I think they are an idea whose time has come The clinics in New York high schools were a subject of controversy this fall when it was disclosed that nine of them provided abortion counseling and birthcontrol information and two distributed contraceptives to students The Board of Education last month banned the distribution But contraception Ms Jones said is not a major concern at the prehigh school level Any students seeking birthcontrol devices at the clinic would be referred elsewhere she said With foundation and state and Federal financing of 18 million for five years the two uptown clinics represent a partnership of Columbias Center for Population and Family Health Presbyterian Hospital and community organizations Ms Jones said Working full time at each clinic under a pediatrician who oversees both clinics are a nurse practitioner who can write prescriptions a social worker and a health advocate whose job includes counseling The kids have a lot of problems of adjustment into a new environment Ms Jones said so there is a tremendous need for counseling Volunteers including medical students and members of the community are being recruited as tutors Students need signed parental consent to use the clinic whose services include complete physicals sex education and information on drug and alcohol abuse We hope to reduce risktaking behavior Ms Jones said We think high school is late for preventive health care
WASHINGTON TALK: POLITICS; Back Aboard the 1988 Presidential Express,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/18/us/washington-talk-politics-back-aboard-the-1988-presidential-express.html,The 1988 Presidential campaign interrupted for a few months by the 1986 elections is back on track and the likely contestants are once again fair game for those who set early expectations handicap the aspirants and write the scenario for choosing the next President Despite some evidence of public ennui given the relatively early stage of the contest the process nevertheless goes forward for the Presidential hopefuls and their strategists What are they up to now First the Democrats GARY HART  Leaving the Senate after two terms the Coloradan is joining the Denver law firm of Davis Graham  Stubbs and plans to lecture parttime at the University of Florida School of Law In the months ahead he will be honing his campaign message recharging his network of supporters in key states and trying to erase the 2 million debt he still owes from his 1984 Presidential bid Without the Senate as a forum Mr Hart will try to make the most of his position as the widely acknowledged Democratic frontrunner by pressing his rivals to begin the political debate in 1987 MARIO CUOMO  Running second only to Mr Hart in Democratic preference polls the Governor of New York continues to give mixed signals about his intentions Stung by critics in his reelection campaign who said among other things that he was too arrogant in refusing to debate his opponent for much of the campaign Mr Cuomo accused New York reporters of being biased and threatened to restrict their access to him After the election Mr Cuomo was on the telephone trying to convince some prominent opinionmakers outside the state that much of the criticism was a bum rap His reelection landslide intensified interest in both a Cuomo candidacy and his political character JOSEPH R BIDEN Jr  The Senator from Delaware is in line to become chairman of the Judiciary Committee which is likely to be a highprofile position the last two years of the Reagan Presidency Mr Biden scorns ideological politics but he could find it difficult to avoid ideological conflict as the man Democrats will be counting on to lead the examination of President Reagans nomination of conservative judges Some political experts view Mr Biden as the Democrat most likely to clash with the Rev Jesse Jackson over the direction of their party BRUCE BABBITT  The Governor of Arizona whose term ends in January already has seven major policy speeches scheduled between now and the end of the year keyed to childrens issues trade welfare revision and United States relations with Mexico Mr Babbitt who is known for his intellect and willingness to challenge party orthodoxy is intensifying his organizing efforts in Iowa and New Hampshire and cozying up to Senator Sam Nunn of Georgia who could be a key player in 1988 as a power broker in the South The Gephardt Campaign RICHARD A GEPHARDT  The Congressman from Missouri expects to hold his position as chairman of the House Democratic Caucus a leadership perch he can use to shape the Democrats legislative agenda Mr Gephardt who officially formed a Presidential exploratory committee today hopes if he runs to finish at least third in the Iowa caucuses second in the New Hampshire primary and go for a breakthrough in the South where he has been making allies as a leader of the Democratic Leadership Council A new recruit to his campaign is Richard Moe a former adviser to Walter F Mondale JESSE JACKSON  He is hoping his candidacy and agenda will be a refuge not only for blacks but also for leftist activists who have become disenchanted with the partys drift toward the political center Mr Jackson could have his greatest impact in the 11 Southern primaries in the second week of March if he won enough states in a crowded field to prevent any rival from wrapping up the nomination early On the Republican side VICE PRESIDENT BUSH  Far ahead of his rivals in the polls political organization and money Mr Bush will come under increasing pressure to define himself and his message in terms that go beyond just defending the Reagan record His loyalty to Mr Reagan is seen as a plus in his bid for the nomination but it could be a handicap in the general election campaign especially if the last two years of the Reagan Presidency are marked by economic uncertainty and foreign policy turmoil BOB DOLE  The Kansas Republican has lost his platform as Senate majority leader but his advisers say he will now be free to spend more time on the campaign trail and to develop his own political agenda Dole partisans contend that he has already gained considerable political advantage from the leadership post establishing himself as an effective lawmaker and earning points with the partys conservative wing JACK KEMP  His strategists believe the upstate New Yorker gains the most from Mr Doles demotion to Senate minority leader The 1986 election outcome left the partys conservative activists complaining that Republicans including the President had avoided issues that could have sharpened their ideological differences with the Democrats Mr Kemp who has identified himself closely with the Reagan agenda hopes to benefit from the yearning among many rightists to center the 1988 campaign on conservative issues PAUL LAXALT  His Presidential hopes appear to have been dampened by the defeat of Jim Santini a former Nevada Democrat whom Mr Laxalt had annointed as his successor in the Senate Some of his closest associates say they will be surprised if he makes the race but Mr Laxalt says the main consideration will be whether he gets sufficient financial and political commitments HOWARD H BAKER Jr  Mr Baker will meet in Tennessee on Dec 1 with his closest advisers to consider whether to crank up his Presidential campaign One potential obstacle is his wifes ill health But one Baker adviser said Mrs Bakers health was much improved making it more likely that the former Senate majority leader would run The First to Announce PIERRE S du PONT 4th  The first in either party to announce his candidacy the former Governor of Delaware is running a longshot campaign that combines a cheerleading role for Mr Reagans economic policies with his own provocative proposals Mr du Pont recently proposed a plan to augment the Social Security System a political issue on which Republicans keep getting burned PAT ROBERTSON  Political professionals say that the television evangelist cannot win the nomination but that he could be a factor in the Republican primary battle particularly in the South He will need a solid base of conservative Christians but Election Day surveys of people who voted showed members of this group splitting their votes between the two major parties and concerned less with abortion and prayer in public school than with pocketbook issues
10 Political Words That Dare Not Speak Their Name,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/19/opinion/10-political-words-that-dare-not-speak-their-name.html,Back in the early 1970s the comedian George Carlin titillated adolescents with a racy monologue about The Seven Words You Cant Say on Television Working as issues director in a recent unsuccessful Congressional campaign I discovered that politics has its own forbidden lexicon While TV taboos relate predictably to sex most but not all political taboos hark to the discredited doctrine of liberalism To spare future campaign workers my painful lesson I submit a handy guide to The 10 Words You Cant Say in Politics First comes the word liberal itself as in I am a liberal Given the aversion this word inspires in Democratic candidates future civilizations sifting through the rubble may well conclude that liberal was a euphemism for pederast or serial killer It didnt help our campaign that most members of the press suspected my candidate of being a liberal Our opponent made the most of this by sending out a directmail letter calling my candidate a liberal highlighting the Lword in bold type In fact my candidate was not a traditional liberal but leaned toward being what I would call a neoliberal However my candidate found the connotations of neoliberal too halfhearted and technocratic Even Charles Peters editor of the Washington Monthly who spearheaded the movement and coined the term concedes that neoliberalism is a terrible name My candidate who had a sly sense of humor suggested the spicier term nuevo liberal But when reporters asked Are you a liberal it was simplest to say I dont think labels mean very much Regulate is beyond the pale Writing a position paper on the environment I needed to express the importance of making sure real estate development did not endanger shoreline ecosystems I got around the problem by writing about the need to make sure that development is harmonious with environmental concerns Everyone favors this No one is in favor of regulating development which is the same thing A similar problem is posed by class Opportunities abound for politicians of all ideological stripes to play on class resentment to score points But the rules do not allow use of class Instead evoke images of greedy incompetent chief executive officers if youre a Democrat or of smug overpaid newclass Government workers if Republican Abortion and contras occupy a unique niche While most voters favor legalized abortion and oppose funding the contras what they feel far more deeply is resentment about having to think about these troubling issues at all So try not to bring them up If forced to discuss them demonstrate anguish Note this anguish must be sincere I take my cue from the National Abortion Rights Action League which in its pamphlet Winning With Choice admonishes prochoice candidates to express personal opposition to abortion only if thats what they really believe Filling out a questionnaire from the League of Women Voters I made the mistake of calling for wage restraint from both labor and management in smokestack industries This got me in trouble Instead talk about the need to save our manufacturing base Protectionist insinuations never hurt If the particular industry is beyond all hope invoke national defense Fairness has been getting bad press Voters are said to now associate it with affirmative action and other controversial policies aimed at equality Equality of course falls into the category of Dont Even Think About It But the popularity of tax reform may have helped rehabilitate the word fairness We sneaked it in here and there and it didnt seem to hurt Polls show that most citizens favor some form of compulsory national service Id like to meet these people Eager to back up inspiring rhetoric about the need for greater sacrifice and participation from all citizens in the common life of the nation my candidate called for a draft We never knew what hit us
MEESE AND THE SUPREME COURT: HE DEALS WITH CRITICS BY SOFTENING HIS REMARKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/19/us/meese-and-the-supreme-court-he-deals-with-critics-by-softening-his-remarks.html,Amid the furor that often follows Attorney General Edwin Meese 3ds critiques of the Supreme Court a pattern has emerged Critics denounce what they consider the radical implications of his remarks Aides say the critics misconstrued his real meaning And Mr Meese clarifies his remarks in ways that seem to remove some of their initial sting The most recent example is Mr Meeses speech Oct 21 at Tulane University He asserted that while a Supreme Court decision was binding on the immediate parties and on officials responsible for enforcement it does not establish a supreme law of the land that is binding on all persons and parts of government henceforth and forevermore A storm of protest ensued from critics who accused Mr Meese of stirring up defiance to Supreme Court precedents even inviting legal chaos Then last Thursday Mr Meese issued a detailed response in an OpEd Page article in The Washington Post specifically rebutting a critical editorial Contrary to what critics had said he meant Mr Meese wrote it was his view that Supreme Court decisions do indeed have general applicability and deserve the greatest respect from all Americans including officials and that it would be highly irresponsible for them not to conform their behavior to precedent The point of the speech Mr Meese said was to stress that the Constitution itself stands on a higher plane than the Courts decisions that those decisions could be wrong and that it was proper to criticize them and urge reconsideration He said this point should be selfevident but had been overlooked or denied by devotees of judicial supremacy Brown Case Is Cited Mr Meeses article also qualified his denunciation in the Tulane speech of the Courts statement in a 1958 case that its 1954 decision striking down segregation of schools was the supreme law of the land and thus binding on all states The 1958 ruling Cooper v Aaron was designed to quell massive resistance in Little Rock Ark and elsewhere in the South to the mandate of the 1954 decision Brown v Board of Education that school segregation be dismantled In the Tulane speech Mr Meese said The logic of Cooper v Aaron was and is at war with the Constitution at war with the basic principles of democratic government and at war with the very meaning of the rule of law In Thursdays article on the other hand without mentioning Cooper v Aaron Mr Meese said The general principle laid down in Brown v Board of Education governed not only Kansas whence the case arose but all other states that had segregated schools Or to use an example of a decision with which I do not agree Roe v Wade struck down Texas abortion law but also contained a principle that officials in other states were obliged to apply Terry Eastland Mr Meeses chief spokesman and sometime speechwriter said in an interview that fairly read the Tulane speech was perfectly consistent with Mr Meeses subsequent article Critics and Critiques He said some of Mr Meeses critics were quick to caricature his true meaning and score rhetorical points rather than engaging the issues that Meese raises in reasoned intellectual debate On the other hand some of Mr Meeses critics say his more provocative critiques of current legal doctrines have farreaching implications that give a truer insight into his thinking than the subsequent clarifications qualifications and amplifications Whatever the reasons the recent controversy was not the first time that Mr Meese found it necessary to quiet concerns raised by what he and his aides have suggested were misinterpretations of his public remarks In the written text of a July 1985 speech to the American Bar Association for example Mr Meese criticized the Supreme Courts doctrine that most provisions of the Bill of Rights originally applicable only to the national government were incorporated by the Fourteenth Amendment and thus applied against the states Implication of His Speech He said the doctrine rested on an intellectually shaky foundation and that nowhere else has the principle of federalism been dealt so politically violent and constitutionally suspect a blow as by the theory of incorporation But for the longestablished incorporation doctrine states might in theory be free to abrogate separation of church and state curtail freedom of speech seize private property for public use without compensation and search the homes and tap the phones of citizens without warrants But when he delivered the speech Mr Meese omitted his criticism of the incorporation doctrine And minutes after leaving the platform when asked by a reporter whether he thought the Court had gone too far in applying the Bill of Rights to the states he said No I think this is something thats been done in 1925 and I do not have any particular quarrel at this stage of the game with what the Court has done in the intervening 60 years A few months later Mr Meese said that while he questioned the historical basis for the incorporation doctrine because precedent stability and predictability are important I dont think it would be either prudent or necessary to roll back the clock On Guilt of Suspects Almost nothing has been heard from Mr Meese about the incorporation doctrine since then But his original written attack on the incorporation doctrine drew more attention than his subsequent remarks Another of Mr Meeses controversial remarks about the Constitution came in an October 1985 interview with US News  World Report explaining his opposition to the Courts curbs on interrogation of criminal defendants The thing is you dont have many suspects who are innocent of a crime Mr Meese said then Thats contradictory If a person is innocent of a crime then he is not a suspect Critics accused Mr Meese of suggesting that all criminal suspects were guilty and repudiating the traditional presumption of innocence In a subsequent news conference Mr Meese said I think its important to clarify in case there are any doubts in anybodys mind that I do not believe that simply because a suspect is being questioned or even arrested he or she is necessarily guilty That certainly is not the case and any misinterpretations of my remarks should be corrected In response to further questions he acknowledged that any misinterpretations might have been prompted by a bad choice of words on my part

returned three years ago many people worried that it might become just another of the pendulum swings that have marked Argentinas political life for half a century Believing that one reason for the countrys political misfortunes has been the absence of grassroots civic activity a fledgling womens group called Conciencia or Conscience set out to change things Literally with Constitution in hand members have established a network of women throughout Argentina who undertook first to learn the laws of the land then began projects ranging from campaigns against red tape to debates on the hottest and sometimes the dullest issues facing Congress Maria Rosa Segura de Martini the national president of Conciencia said she and other leaders were trying to combat the notion both here and abroad that participatory democracy might simply be against the Latin American grain Its the System Its true that we are Latins and we are individualists and all that she said but it seems to me for example that if immigrants to the United States from all kinds of cultures can so quickly adapt to civic life there then we ought to be able to make the system work here Its not a question of the people its the system she added Mrs Martini and the other founders are primarily affluent women from the fashionable neighborhoods of Buenos Aires with children and successful husbands Most had had little salaried work experience but had backgrounds and skills in community or charity fund raising Maria Rosas brother suggested that what we needed to do was to sell democracy like cosmetics recalled Lucrecia Bello de Royere another of the national leaders Mrs Martini said the idea the group got from her brother who had been involved in introducing both Avon and Mary Kay Cosmetics into Argentina was to work through small gatherings of no more than 10 women to gradually build Conciencia Spreading the Word It is aimed at a multiplying effect she said From one group you get others who hold similar meetings Those motivated to know more go into a higher course Those who give the courses are called divulgadoras meaning people who spread the word The religious connotation was not completely wrong she said because sometimes you think you are a missionary Since its beginning in August 1980 Conciencia has expanded to include chapters throughout the Argentine provinces and in many suburbs and neighboods of Buenos Aires rich poor and middle class With three membership categories the group has 311 actives who organize and lead conferences and other activities 8000 members who receive the literature and are invited to functions and 200 in transition between the two categories Conciencia calls itself a nonpartisan civic movement and Mrs Martini said the leaders decided at the outset to avoid anything that might make it look like a pressure group We said that the only issues on which we would take direct action would be those involving a better quality of life she said such as community cleanups health and so forth things that no one could be against We do of course deal with controversial issues such as divorce and abortion but then we organize panels or debates with people pro and con In those cases we want people to make up their own minds What we provide is information Background for Congress Among those who receive the information they have put together on various issues are members of the Argentine Congress In a country struggling with a 50 billion foreign debt congressional staffs are too small to provide members with all the background they need to make decisions Conciencia is trying to undertake both national and local projects with neighborhood leaders deciding what to do in their own areas One local project about to begin in the Buenos Aires suburb of Avellaneda will take up the work habits and manners of bureaucrats who are infamous throughout Latin America Here in Argentina they are the special object of scorn mocked in plays and movies for example for their seeming affinity for work slowdowns tea breaks paper shuffling and above all indecision Susana Llado president of the chapter in Avellaneda said her group was seeking to stop the common bureaucratic practice of elevese or passing something to the next higher up Here she continued it has always been easier to say No se puede hacer  It cant be done  rather than risk making a decision Officials Are Receptive Perhaps surprisingly she said municipal officials have been receptive to Conciencias proposed training program Avellaneda is a middleclass suburb of more than 300000 people but it is an industrial town with an identity separate from that of Buenos Aires In the 19th century before refrigerated ships it flourished as a center for plants where meat was salted down for export Later it became a center for wool processing and other industry but for the last 25 years it has been gradually losing both jobs and people The handful of women who organized Conciencia in Avellaneda did not have a solution for industrial decline but they thought they could make a contribution by helping their neighbors mobilize to do and demand things for the community The first thing we set out to do was to understand the municipal government said Alicia Festa the secretary of the chapter It was not easy she said noting that the government of Avellaneda had such a history of mismanagement that under the previous militaryrun national Government the militarynamed officials in Avellaneda were removed by their colleagues When the women went to city hall in search of information on how officialdom was organized they were given a stack of computer printouts that they claimed were several feet high They eventually turned it into an eightpage organizational chart which is intended primarily as an instruction tool for their course on municipal government and which they describe as our pride They knew they had made a breakthrough when they next visited a municipal official and he had a copy of their chart on his desk

"ONE MAN, ONE VOTE: DECADES OF COURT DECISIONS",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/21/nyregion/one-man-one-vote-decades-of-court-decisions.html,People not land or trees or pastures vote former Chief Justice Earl Warren wrote in 1964 in one of a series of cases that created the principle of one man one vote The principle was applied again Wednesday when a Federal District Court in Brooklyn ruled that the structure of the New York City Board of Estimate was unconstitutional It was unfair the court found that the boroughs with their widely disparate populations should have the same representation on the powerful board The oneman onevote concept  refined in numerous court decisions has been regarded as an important civil liberties issue aiding blacks generally and people in urban areas and as populations shifted assuring representation for those living in the suburbs Through all its interpretations the plainly articulated position of Chief Justice Warren about land trees and pastures still seems incontrovertible One of 3 Most Important Rulings Here is a set of decisions that has been completely accepted there has been almost no resistence said Henry P Monaghan the Thomas M Macioce Professor of Law at Columbia University One person one vote is a difficult premise to argue with Professor Monaghan ranked the oneman onevote decision with Brown v Board of Education in 1954 which mandated school desegregation and Roe v Wade in 1973 which legalized abortions as the three most important civil liberties decisions of the Warren Court By far he said the oneman onevote decision has proved the least controversial Until 1962 the Supreme Court declined to tackle the issue of political representation and population In Colegrove v Green in 1946 the court said that the issue was of a peculiarly political nature and advised that the courts not enter this political thicket But in Baker v Carr in 1962 the Court found that people living in cities in Tennessee had been seriously underrepresented in the state legislature GoodFaith Effort The oneman onevote language was first used in a 1964 case Wesberry v Sanders It extended the principle to Congressional elections As nearly as practicable the Court ruled one mans vote in a Congressional election is to be worth as much as anothers Later that year in Reynolds v Sims the Court applied the principle to state legislatures and Chief Justice Warren spoke of land trees and pastures In subsequent cases the Court acknowledged that it would be difficult if not impossible to achieve an exact equality for all voters but required the states to make a goodfaith effort to achieve precise mathematical equality In 1983 the Court ruled that the New Jersey Legislature had not made such an effort and threw out its Congressional district lines In general the Court has required more exact standards for Federal districts than for state and local districts allowing as much as 20 percent deviations from the standard for the states Court decisions over the last 35 years have certainly brought the country a long way from the situation in Maryland that H L Mencken once described The vote of a malarious peasant on the lower Eastern Shore Mencken said counts as much as the votes of 12 Baltimoreans

NEWS ANALYSIS; Cuomo and the Press: Time of Tension,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/22/nyregion/news-analysis-cuomo-and-the-press-time-of-tension.html,Governor Cuomos press relations have grown increasingly tense over the last four weeks according to both journalists and administration officials as Mr Cuomo has accused some reporters of intentionally distorting the truth to make him look bad In angry telephone calls morning and night to reporters and editors the Governor has called reporters names spoiled ingrates incompetent and they in turn have accused him of going beyond the bounds of acceptable criticism with some of them labeling his accusations as insults Mr Cuomos action is born not from a calculated strategy according to his aides but from anger over what he sees as inaccurate and unfairly harsh articles during and after his campaign for reelection His behavior has upset some of his advisers who fear that at a time when Mr Cuomo is considering running for President it might intensify questions already being raised in national political circles about his temperament and his ability to withstand the sometimes contentious press coverage of a race for the White House But other advisers and some independent political analysts disagree There Were No Other Issues David Garth the political media consultant who talks with the Governor from time to time argues that Mr Cuomos complaints are warranted that the press not finding any substantive governmental flaws to write about seized on the Cuomo campaign strategy unfairly criticizing it as aloof and heavyhanded I think the papers were tough on him because there were no other issues Mr Garth said Some top Cuomo aides think the Governors actions could in the end prove to be a plus They argue that the only group the public dislikes even more than politicians is journalists And they believe Mr Cuomo might be perceived by the public as courageous following his principles and taking on the press even though conventional political wisdom says it is dangerous to do so In the past the Governor has successfully defused other politically sensitive disputes  including a battle with John Cardinal OConnor over the responsibilities of Roman Catholics in government to oppose abortion  usually by confronting them head on in a speech And that is is exactly what he plans to do in Manhattan next Tuesday night on the press issue But whether the strategy will work in the press dispute which has started off on a lower namecalling level than the previous ones remains to be seen So sensitive is the issue  and so strong are the Governors emotions about it  that top Cuomo advisers who usually lobby reporters daily such as Meyer S Frucher the head of the Battery Park City Authority are refusing to comment on it The Albany press corps is particularly assertive even some of its members acknowledge although they argue it is necessary because Mr Cuomo is sometimes difficult to pin down on specific points For his part the Governor  a former trial lawyer who admits that his style can be combative  tends to argue with reporters not simply answer their questions But the relationship began to worsen this summer according to Cuomo aides after articles columns and editorials were critical of Andrew Cuomo the Governors son and his top adviser The articles which the Governor thought were unfair questioned whether Andrew Cuomos law firm was profiting indirectly  and inappropriately  because his father was Governor When you talk to Cuomo about family in a negative light he acts irrationally Jeannie Cross who covers the Governor for The AlbanyTimes Union said this week on the Inside Albany television program broadcast statewide Filling a Political Void Although the Governors reelection was endorsed by virtually all the states major newspapers many of the same editorials raised questions about his personality accusing him of being aloof and of not dealing fairly with his Republican opponent Andrew P ORourke by debating him only once He was also criticized for mobilizing his aides to knock Abraham Hirschfeld off the Democratic primary ballot for lieutenant governor In addition some reporters acknowledge that during the campaign they were particularly aggressive with the Governor trying to fill the void left by a lethargic ORourke campaign and force an airing of the issues All that came as Mr Cuomo was headed toward a recordbreaking landslide victory Aides said the Governor became convinced that the press was out of synch with the way the state as a whole viewed him Although he had often had runins with individual reporters he now began to criticize half a dozen journalists at a time sometimes bitterly even accusing some of them of conspiring against him When reporters resented it he called them thinskinned and said the press could not take criticism You Set Out to Hurt Me Reporters argue that it is not the criticism it is the way the Governor criticizes that is inappropriate They say they resent his angry phone calls and his allegations that they would intentionally distort the truth They say that if errors have been made  and not all journalists agree they have they were honest mistakes In the last four weeks Mr Cuomo has accused reporters of The New York Times The Daily News and The New York Post of collusion against him on particular issues  a cabal Daily News reporters quoted him as calling it The Governor said an editor of The Daily News  later identified as Arthur Browne the city editor  had set me up by printing comments that Mr Cuomo thought had been made in private conversation Theyll never get another call from me the Governor was quoted by The Associated Press as having said of The News They can call me from a burning building and say Youre the captain of the Fire Department and theyll have to learn how to fly One evening last week Mr Cuomo called a New York Times reporter at home saying about an article You set out to hurt me and you succeeded I hope you sleep well The next morning the 54yearold Governor called back to apologize asking forgiveness for an old man with a bad back You Made Me Look Bad The comment was apparently made in jest Mr Cuomo has repeatedly denied speculation that he was irritable because of chronic back pain which doctors said yesterday was caused by a pinched nerve In a meeting two weeks ago with reporters and editors of Rochester newspapers at which he was criticized for making himself look bad by the conduct of his campaign Mr Cuomo said Lets get it clear  I didnt make me look bad You made me look bad His Rochester comments were widely reported as being aimed at reporters for other papers as well which the Governor later said was not his intention He also rejected the assessment that he was saying some reporters were biased against him Last month the Governors press secretary Martin J Steadman wrote to the editor of The Albany TimesUnion and The Kickerbocker News accusing the papers of a campaign to punish the Governor because he had refused an invitation to debate there during the gubernatorial race Reducing Reporters Access Of the Gannett newspaper chain Mr Cuomo told a group of reporters Gannett is killing me And in a speech last week to newspaper executives in Manhattan he defended press freedoms but added that if news organizations did not curb their abuses the Supreme Court will get you in the end Mr Cuomo threatened to reduce reporters access to him by directing them to his aides In the process he appeared to criticize those aides saying Its about time the press office did some work The Governor has directed his criticism of reporters almost exclusively to those at newspapers Radio and television reporters tend to press him less on the issues and their reports tend to be made up primarily of the Governor himself speaking In his television comments on the press dispute Mr Cuomo has avoided the strident angry tone he used privately with print reporters Top administration officials said yesterday that they thought the Governors comments were merely blips in what they described as overall a favorable relationship with the press They stressed that they wanted normal relations to resume adding that they were aware what is now a story about press relations had the potential to evolve into a story about personality It feeds the impression of this prickly sensibility that keeps revealing itself said William Marshall policy director of the Democratic Leadership Council a Washingtonbased organization of elected officials most of them moderate Southern and Western Democrats Echoing comments made by other national Democratic political strategists Mr Marshall added It reflects what is in the back of peoples minds Is he too thinskinned

BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/26/books/books-of-the-times-626186.html,BACKSTORY Interviews With Screenwriters of Hollywoods Golden Age By Pat McGilligan Illustrated 382 pages University of California 2750 IN the days of silent pictures screenwriters did not exist instead an assorted gaggle of gagwriters continuity writers adaptors and titlists helped get pictures on the screen It was only after the introduction of sound in 1926 that Hollywood began importing talk experts from the East and in the late 20s writers of every sort  novelists playwrights journalists poets copywriters and press agents began making their way out west Though the pay frequently was excellent they found they held little clout in a community dominated by stars directors and producers Scenarists were banished from the sets of the movies they had written writes Pat McGilligan in the introduction to his book Impersonal or hackneyed genre assignments were doled out as a form of punishment Unbeknownst to one another writers worked on multiple or alternative versions of the same script Credits were withheld out of pique jealousy or bizarre ulterior motives Credits were summarily awarded to inlaws or mistresses Marathon working hours were requisite Writers punched in on a time clock at some studios as if they were assembling gizmos on a conveyor belt Certainly many writers  including the likes of Faulkner and Fitzgerald  couldnt stand the constraints and they left or died disillusioned and disgusted Others however managed to turn screenwriting into a substantial career  sometimes taking pleasure in the work itself sometimes using it to finance other projects And its their story that Pat McGilligan proposes to tell in this volume Included are interviews with Charles Bennett who wrote or cowrote seven early Hitchcock films including The Man Who Knew Too Much The ThirtyNine Steps The Secret Agent and Sabotage the novelist W R Burnett Little Caesar High Sierra Yellow Sky The Asphalt Jungle Philip Dunne who adapted such works as The Ghost and Mrs Muir and How Green Was My Valley and Norman Krasna who worked on Hands Across the Table and Bachelor Mother According to the author Backstory is not meant to be a scholarly or historical work a purely factual study or even a complete representation of the profession and the volume reads like an eclectic almost random collection of interviews determined largely by the availability of the subjects Such wellknown writers as Nunnally Johnson Billy Wilder and Joseph Mankiewicz are missing as are less famous but equally respected figures like Ernest Lehman Charles Lederer and Howard Koch But while little effort seems to have been made to determine the veracity of various stories  two thoroughly irreconcilable versions of the writing of Casablanca appear  Backstory stands as a lively oral history both charming and informal One of the things that strikes the reader is just how productive writers employed in the studio factories used to be The husbandandwife team Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett recall finishing The Thin Man in three weeks it was then reportedly shot in 12 days and Julius J Epstein  who collaborated with his brother Philip on such adaptations as The Man Who Came to Dinner and Arsenic and Old Lace  remembers having at least three pictures made a year by Warner Brothers And that he adds didnt even count the pictures that werent made They used to go on the principle of three scripts written for every one that was made Although there are discussions of writing technique in this volume these passages are not nearly as focused or detailed as those in John Bradys recent book The Craft of the Screenwriter What the writers here do talk about is circumventing the censors  in Ten North Frederick an abortion is turned into a miscarriage in Arsenic and Old Lace Cary Grants line Darling Im a bastard becomes Darling Im the son of a seacook  and tailoring scripts to suit certain stars The difference was entirely in the dialogue says Lenore Coffee explaining how she would alter a story for Joan Crawford or Bette Davis Bette spits out her words Joan doesnt I gave Bette short sentences short speeches Charles Bennett recalls having to simplify conversations for Gary Cooper and Niven Busch speaks of having to tailor lines to James Cagneys specifications translating his obscene dialogue into some kind of passable English In listening to these writers reminisce about the paths that brought them to Hollywood  and the adventures they had there  we also become privy to a lot of amusing stories We hear how Philip Dunne wrote the screenplay to The Count of Monte Cristo without even reading the novel and how he worked up a script for Demetrius and the Gladiators from sets costumes and characters left over from The Robe We hear how Frances Goodrich and Albert Hackett developed the idea for Its a Wonderful Life from a Christmas card And we hear Richard Maibaum explain a lesson he learned from Alfred Hitchcock As he recalls it Hitchcock told him If I have 13 bumps in a picture I think Ive got a picture A bump he explains is something like someone says Im looking for a man who has a short index finger and a totally unexpected guy says You mean like this Thats in The 39 Steps  After writing Dr No in 1963 Mr Maibaum who went on to write 10 more James Bond pictures decided to use Hitchcocks observation as a rule of thumb  except he adds he decided he wasnt going to be satisfied with 13 bumps in a Bond story he wanted 39 In themselves such anecdotes may seem trivial but as stitched together by Mr McGilligan they provide a montagelike picture of Hollywood under the studio system as well as an intimate glimpse of the anomalous craft of screenwriting  its frustrations and intermittent pleasures

KEAN AIDE TO PRESS FOR CLINICS IN SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/nyregion/kean-aide-to-press-for-clinics-in-schools.html,BECAUSE the state should help troubled adolescents cut through the social services bureaucracy by offering health care in high schools says the Commissioner of Human Services schoolbased clinics will be a priority for his administration Our fragmented scattered very narrow categorical programs with a different agency for every problem have not done a good job of reaching troubled teenagers said the Commissioner Dr Drew Altman in a recent interview in his office here Schools represent the place where you can reach the majority of teenagers but not all of them So the strategy is one of supporting communitybased organizations and asking the schools to provide space and become part of the program According to Dr Altman services offered by healthcare clinics outside New Jersey depend on community needs and include drug and alcohol counseling family planning day care psychological academic and vocational counseling and job placement Typically such clinics  there are none in New Jersey  provide referrals with parental consent to health and socialservice agencies for pregnancy testing and contraception More than 60 high schools around the country have clinics that provide comprehensive health care and at least 10 dispense contraceptives according to the Center for Population Options in Washington a group that seeks to prevent unwanted pregnancies among teenagers In New York City nine high school clinics provide abortion counseling and birthcontrol information and until October two distributed contraceptives A bill introduced Oct 27 by Assemblyman Rodney P Frelinghuysen Republican of the 25th District part of Morris County would allocate 2 million for a minimum of six clinics to help adolescents and those who have dropped out of school Most of the clinics would be in urban areas in or near schools according to Mr Frelinghuysen Dr Saul Cooperman the states Commissioner of Education said it would be premature to comment on Assemblyman Frelinghuysens proposal He and Dr Altman are expected to discuss the clinics in coming weeks according to state education officials Dr Altman said he could not expect his plan to succeed without the cooperation of the Commissioners of Education and Health And he added community support for any schoolbased clinic is vital Whether the clinics would be allowed to dispense contraceptives would be a decision left to the local school district Dr Altman said Last summer Senator Frank J Pallone Jr Democrat of the 11th District part of Monmouth County introduced a bill to block schools from dispensing contraceptives conducting prenatal testing or testing for pregnancy The bill is still in committee Before we move the bill wed have to mount a major lobbying effort Senator Pallone said adding that he would welcome a hearing on the legislation which is strongly supported by the New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents a Monmouth County group that in the early 1980s mounted an unsuccessful campaign against mandatory sex education Dr Altman insists that in his effort to set up the program he will not be held hostage by teenage pregnancy Yet judging from the hesitation on the part of Department of Education officials and the controversy generated by clinics in New York City recently the issue could also delay plans in New Jersey New York Citys Board of Education has banned the distribution of contraceptives in its schools but has allowed the nine school clinics to operate for six months while the issue is debated Were at a very early stage Dr Altman said Ive been here for five months and theres no commitment to this Before taking the cabinet post Dr Altman 35 years old was a vice president of the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation which has committed itself to move ahead on a national scale and finance 20 schoolbased healthcare clinics in the next six years The cost of an average clinic in a large urban high school staffed by a nursepractitioner social worker secretary and parttime physicians is about 100000 a year according to Dr Philip Porter codirector of the Adolescent Health Care Program at the Johnson Foundation Most clinics in other states do not dispense contraceptives Dr Porter said although some have done so Dr Porter a pediatrician on the faculty of Harvard Medical School called the clinics a very effective way of meeting the needs of adolescents who dont have a home He singled out clinics in St Paul Minn and Cambridge Mass as examples States that have supported the clinics include Florida North Carolina Washington and Oregon Dr Porter said The schoolbased approach attempts to circumvent the stigma that adolescents feel is associated with a birthcontrol clinic a drug crisis center or a mentalhealth facility We have a lot of trouble getting adolescents to go to a clinic said Jane Mattingly director of special services for the Board of Education in Elizabeth They dont feel they have the financial resources or their parents dont follow through Also theres the fear because hospitals and emergency rooms can be frightening places Healthcare professionals concede that the bureaucracy and paper work in some agencies can be a formidable obstacle especially for a selfconscious or troubled adolescent Teenagers are notoriously reluctant to seek social services even when theres a crisis or an emergency said Ann M Wilson coordinator of the New Jersey Network on Adolescent Pregnancy and a professor at the Rutgers University School of Social Work where the network is based While she has described the schoolbased approach as preventive others contend that education about birth control encourages sexual activity The United States Secretary of Education William J Bennett has argued that birthcontrol clinics encourage sexual promiscuity among teenagers According to No Easy Answers a study on adolescent pregnancy released last month by Rutgers UniversityNew Jersey Network about 30000 adolescents in New Jersey were expected to become pregnant this year About a third of them most likely the impoverished  are expected to carry their babies to term In 1984 6682 students under 18 with some as young as 10 gave birth according to the report The study recommended schoolbased clinics as one means of providing students with information for making responsible choices and for receiving health care that their families could not ordinarily afford A handful of school districts in New Jersey has expressed interest in schoolbased clinics Jersey Citys schools have invited speakers from New York to talk about their programs In Elizabeth Rocco J Colelli the Superintendent of Schools had some reservations but did not rule out the possibility of welcoming such a clinic In Perth Amboy Frank Sinatra the Superintendent of Schools said he proposed a community school with a clinic but referendums on that matter were defeated in 1979 and 1980 Perhaps the district with the most resources to develop schoolbased health care is New Brunswick world headquarters of Johnson  Johnson Elementary and secondary schools in New Brunswick have enjoyed a partnership with the University of Medicine and Dentistry of New JerseyRobert Wood Johnson Medical School as part of a fouryear grant of 339075 from the Johnson Foundation The medical school has provided staff for schoolbased care in addition to planning a community health clinic on school property The new program is to be housed in six trailers scheduled to open in January Plans include facilities for pediatric obstetric and dental services a mentalhealth facility and offices for a federally financed nutrition program for pregnant women With parental consent reproductive matters will be handled through referrals to community agencies The subject of contraceptives has come up said Ron Larkin the New Brunswick Superintendent of Schools but were not ready to deal with that one yet because of the hysteria that goes with it Some educators and healthcare professionals advocate a comprehensive approach to health care for adolescents because they say troubled teenagers are likely to experience a wide spectrum of social and psychological problems If a youngster does have a problem with alcohol drug abuse or pregnancy Mr Larkin said the family probably does have other problems Its like a onion Once you start peeling off the layers other problems on a secondary and tertiary level become apparent
A NEW YORKER UP FOR SAINTHOOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/magazine/a-new-yorker-up-for-sainthood.html,FOR MORE THAN TWO years now the letters have been trickling in at a rate of 15 to 20 a week They report in touching detail about jobs found problems solved illnesses overcome A few correspondents relate stories of extraordinary cures A retired New York City policeman whose sons eyes were severely damaged in a hockey accident writes that the boys sight is now almost perfectly restored one of the boys doctors called it unexplainable Another man reports that although his grandson had battled terminal leukemia for eight years and doctors at one point had given the boy only a few days to live he is now living the life of a normal teenager A woman dying of cancer of the intestines lymph nodes and liver writes that radiation chemotherapy and four operations had failed to halt the disease and then suddenly a CAT scan liver scan and sonogram all proved negative I felt this was miraculous she declared Like all the other correspondents some 2000 of them she attributes her success to her prayers and the intercession of Terence Cardinal Cooke the former Archbishop of New York who died of cancer in 1983 The cases are piling up says the Rev Benedict J Groeschel a broadshouldered bearded Catholic priest who is also a Capuchin friar But its up to the people We are simply waiting Waiting for a miracle  for at least three miracles to be precise The friar who wears the coarse woolen habit and sandals of a medieval mendicant monk is only one of the late Cardinals many friends in the church who believe the man they call Terry Cooke might be a saint After Cookes death these friends began to urge the archdiocese to initiate formal proceedings to give them the opportunity to prove it As a result Cookes successor John Cardinal OConnor appointed Father Groeschel in August 1984 to be postulator and promoter of the cause of canonization of Terence Cardinal Cooke Father Groeschel then quickly asked another friend of Cookes Sister M Aloysius McBride a Carmelite nun and retired head of one of the archdioceses largest nursing homes to help him set up a Cardinal Cooke Guild to promote the Cardinals canonization to pray for his help in peoples lives and receive evidence of the effect he has had  from beyond the grave  on the living So far about 10000 other admirers of the late Archbishop have contributed their support and money to the guild These are the first steps in the complex and rigorous process whereby the Pope ultimately decides if a man or woman is worthy of the veneration of the members of the Roman Catholic Church Some other Americans under consideration are described in the box on page 70 The final verdict on Terence Cookes sanctity will probably take at least 50 years some verdicts have taken 600 years In the meantime his supporters will have to prove that the Cardinal was a person of heroic virtue They will also have to show that this has been confirmed by a series of miracles proof that God too accepts the late Cardinal as a truly holy and perfect Christian That a man so recently alive and at work in New York City may be responsible for miracles seems incredible to some even to many Catholics Saints are legends of simpler times almost unthinkable in ours Besides does the Catholic church in the late 20th century with some 5000 saints already in its canon really need another Cynics and critics are inclined to see the cause for Cardinal Cooke as an effort by the church to give itself a little boost in the media capital of the world Even the hardestboiled among them might be willing to grant saintly perfection to a remarkable woman like Mother Teresa of Calcutta whose devotion to the dying and leprous of India won her the Nobel Prize for Peace in 1979 But Cardinal Cooke a tall roundfaced prelate with rimless glasses and buckteeth An administrator adept at crunching numbers Could such a shy maestro of the chancery really be a saint Or is the Cooke cause a bit of deft archdiocesan public relations to set up a man of God as a celebrity role model in an age when the public seems more attracted to the lives of the stars of Dynasty and Dallas than to the lives of the saints PR asks Father Groeschel as he lets loose a giggle of contempt Of course its PR Thats what canonization has always been about Its a humaninterest story Someone can be the holiest man in the world but without human interest hes not a canonizable saint T IS TRUE THAT THROUGH THE centuries one of the Roman Catholic Churchs most effective methods for getting its message to its people has been through the inspirational life stories of the saints the best and most visible exemplars of its teachings But now at a time when the church seems to many to resemble a multinational corporation when its liberal and conservative thinkers clash on such contemporary issues as divorce contraception abortion and homosexuality talk of sanctity seems like a throwback It is a reminder of the churchs ancient roots the mysteries of religion that have from the beginning been the attraction for converts  Credo quia impossibile est as the early Christian thinker Tertullian phrased his famous paradox I believe because it is impossible DURING HIS 38 YEARS AS A PRIEST TERence Cooke seemed an unlikely candidate for sainthood The son of an Irish immigrant who worked as a chauffeur and in the construction trades the Cardinal always claimed he had never wanted to be anything but a simple priest According to family members he set out to become one while he was still in elementary school in the Bronx Cooke was ordained in 1945 served briefly in a Bronx parish took leave to earn a masters degree in social work and returned to the archdiocese intending to pursue a career of working with children Instead the humble priest with no political ambitions was soon boosted onto the fast track by Francis Cardinal Spellman the legendary Archbishop of New York whose own power and taste for it had earned him the nickname the American pope Cardinal Spellman was always on the lookout for clever young administrators among his priests and in young Father Cooke he had hit upon a tireless manager with a phenomenal memory for figures one who soon became as some said Continued on Page 68 a cash register whose keys the Cardinal pushed After a stint as a middlelevel administrator at the archdioceses seminary Father Cooke was appointed in 1957 to the prestigious and influential post of personal secretary to Cardinal Spellman Within months Father Cooke had become Monsignor Cooke and was regularly promoted through a series of chancery positions until in 1965 he became vicar general the No 2 post in the archdiocese Spellman depended on him and so he had an awful lot to do with the daytoday running of the archdiocese the financial operations the realestate dealings recalls Bishop Patrick V Ahern now the vicar of Staten Island who became a close friend of Terence Cookes after succeeding him as the Cardinals secretary When Cardinal Spellman died in 1968 and the selfeffacing Bishop Cooke had become at 47 the surprise leader of the most visible archiocese in the Catholic church liberal priests grumbled that the appointment was Cardinal Spellmans last act of cronyism The new Archbishop had got the big job as one of Terence Cookes detractors put it because he poured Spellys Post Toasties every morning Seminarians joked that the succession was the first soul transplant on record It was the 1960s the clergy wanted more democracy Many opposed the Vietnam War which Cardinal Spellman had publicly supported After three decades of an autocratic archbishop who seemed to take the honor of prince of the church too literally younger priests in the diocese viewed their new boss as the product of a discredited system But the new Archbishop who received his cardinals red hat a year after his appointment quickly proved he was not his mentors clone by soliciting opinions from his staff on every issue And in time he solved the toughest problems While bitter liberalconservative disputes broke out in Philadelphia St Louis and Chicago over how to implement the reforms of the Second Vatican Council Cardinal Cooke kept tempers in New York cool by proving himself  friends and subordinates all echo the description  a master conciliator Bishops were shutting down schools and parishes in the inner cities all around the country But in New York by establishing interparish financial cooperation the Cardinal forced the rich parishes to contribute to the survival of the struggling ones He was a superior administrator and manager says Howard A Seitz a retired senior partner in the New York law firm of Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton  Garrison who headed the Cardinals task force on care of the elderly But I never knew him to resolve an issue in terms of the bottom line when there were other apparent or obvious human and charitable conditions to be met Still Cardinal Cooke was not perceived as a great leader His fellow bishops around the country carped about his reticence He was the perfect number two man says Msgr Florence Cohalan a historian of the archdiocese He was best at carrying out others decisions and apart from his ultimate rank he probably reached his peak as vicar general Then the Cardinal began to die and opinions changed The story first broke in August 1983 when the archdiocese announced that the Cardinal was being treated for a urinary infection and would have to curtail his normal activities A week later another press release reported his doctors discovery that Cardinal Cooke had acute leukemia The prognosis was terminal Finally the full story was told the Archbishops cancer had first been diagnosed almost 20 years before before he succeeded Cardinal Spellman The lymphoma had gone into remission until 1974 and since then he had been working at full tilt in spite of secret chemotherapy treatments and blood transfusions for leukemia The Cardinal had kept his condition secret from even his closest friends His doctors treated him clandestinely at home During his last year Cardinal Cooke attended 200 meetings even though for a time he was working as his friends were shocked to learn later with a painful open wound on his back the result of the chemotherapy In his final meeting with Cardinal Cooke Bishop Ahern expressed amazement at how the Archbishop had managed to maintain that pace I never even saw you yawn he recalls saying to Cardinal Cooke and then asked if he had been in pain and exhausted Always he answered How did you manage asked Bishop Ahern God did it said Cardinal Cooke simply and quietly as he lay motionless in the Archbishops residence I had to keep going If my illness had been divulged I would have become a lameduck archbishop and no one would have paid attention It was as if he turned the page and said what has gone up to now is over recalls Msgr Edward F OBrien rector of St Josephs Seminary who as secretary to Cardinal Cooke was one of the few outside the medical team to know how ill he was With the same concentration that had marked his career Cardinal Cooke focused on dying and its meaning In a letter to Pope John Paul II he assured the Pontiff that he accepted his illness in the spirit of the motto he had chosen as Archbishop  Fiat Voluntas Tua Let Thy will be done He wrote a letter to President Reagan asking for continued economic assistance to the poor of the third world He wrote another letter to IrishAmericans urging them to work for peace in Northern Ireland On his deathbed the Cardinal wrote to his fellow bishops that his illness is an opportunity of grace In another letter read from pulpits throughout the archdiocese the Cardinal reflected on how illness old age poverty hunger physical handicaps and loneliness actually give one a special grace to appreciate the gift of life even more After the Cardinals death on Oct 6 1983 thousands of people waited in line outside St Patricks Cathedral all day in eerie silence to pay their respects to as several told reporters at the time a good man Cardinal Cookes friend of 30 years Sister M Aloysius McBride remarked at the funeral service to another friend of the Cardinals that if this were the early church the huge crowd at St Patricks would have acclaimed Terence Cooke a saint on the spot But it is the 1980s a skeptical age and the leading skeptic in the face of the efforts to promote the canonization of Cardinal Cooke is likely to be the Vatican itself The churchs skepticism is in its own selfinterest explains Father Groeschel The process is best seen as an adversarial procedure In the eyes of the Vatican you are guilty until proven saintly Over the last 800 years the church has established a long list of regulations and requirements for canonization revising and toughening them periodically The churchs first heroes were simply acclaimed saints by the community But by the 12th century the Vatican had taken over the process to avoid the embarrassment of an increasing number of people who had by fraud gained a reputation for sanctity Traditionally a person whose Christian virtue had been confirmed by at least two miracles was first beatified  presented by the Vatican as an example for all to imitate After that proof of additional miracles was required for final canonization The latest revision in the guidelines published in 1983 hints that the stage of beatification may eventually be omitted But the new regulations impose stricter standards for reviewing medical miracles requiring if possible the patient and his doctors to testify in person on the details of the alleged cures A ND DO YOU FAther think he was a saint Benedict Groeschel was slightly taken aback by the question To find out more about the requirements of his new job as promoter of the cause of Cardinal Cooke the Capuchin friar had traveled to Rome in 1984 At the Vatican he conferred with a monsignor who has performed the role of the churchs official skeptic traditionally known as the devils advocate He was Cecil B De Milles idea of the devils advocate recalls Father Groeschel Stern bald the heavy Germanic accent Scared me to death Father Groeschel informed the monsignor that he had known the Cardinal very well and that in his opinion the Archbishop could be a saint Good because if you dont think hes a saint you endanger your immortal soul by taking on this job replied the monsignor But if youre convinced hes a saint youve taken away my job The Vaticans man advised the American priest to show caution and care and let things follow the way of God Father Groeschel is so far outside most nonCatholics image of the modern Catholic priest that he is best described by what he is not He is not above all a gent Among New York Citys Catholic clergy the gent is the Hollywood version of the priest  smooth urbane streetwise and definitely good looking enough to impress the ladies of the parish and the young ones in Sunday school The gent is Pat OBrien in Angels With Dirty Faces or Bing Crosby in Going My Way Although Father Groeschel moves in the world of the gents he tramps up First Avenue in sandals his friars robes fluttering in the wind It is not unusual for him to be found in the middle of the night bailing someone out of the drunk tank He grew up in an IrishJewish neighborhood in Jersey City and joined the Capuchins a branch of the Franciscans dedicated to working with the poor in 1951 He has somehow found the time to earn a doctorate in psychology from Columbia teach do radio and television and write six books including The Courage to Be Chaste published last year In 1973 Cardinal Cooke asked him to head the archdioceses new Office for Spiritual Development at Trinity Retreat House in Larchmont NY where priests go to focus on the spiritual side of their vocations There his office floor is filled with cartons of Cooke memorabilia More boxes occupy the Cardinal Cooke Archives at St Josephs Seminary in nearby Yonkers where Father Groeschel is assisted by the causes own archivist the Rev Terrence L Weber the assistant pastor of a Lutheran church on the North Shore of Long Island who admired the Cardinal and volunteered to help out To confirm the integrity of a candidates faith the promoter must collect all his writings even letters from childhood If he has written anything contrary to the Catholic faith Father Groeschel explains the cause is immediately suspended Father Groeschels most interesting task will be researching and writing Cardinal Cookes spiritual biography a major part of the brief for canonization This will be no traditional hagiography insists Father Groeschel It is supposed to be honest and critical In fact if there are no chinks in the armor the Vatican is likely to suspect the cause For the last two years he and Pastor Weber have been interviewing Cardinal Cookes family and friends his schoolteachers even the cop on the St Patricks beat during the Cardinals last years The two are trying to assemble all the data on a new personal computer Already the kinds of uncanny circumstances and prophetic remarks that are the hallmarks of the lives of the saints are turning up about Cardinal Cooke Following an emotional visit with the Cardinal in the hospital in 1965 shortly after he had learned he had cancer Bishop Ahern informed Terence Cookes closest friend from his seminary days Father Vincent Kenney that chances were good they were going to lose their best friend So help me God says Bishop Ahern this is what he said to me Terry Cooke is not going to die The reason is he is a saint and God has some special work for him to do Im going to die before him  Cardinal Cooke returned to work and was named a bishop that fall Within a year Father Kenney died Then there is the matter of those miracles Ive seen a few impressive cases so far says Father Groeschel who is quick to add that this does not mean they are miracles and that besides it is not his job to say so His correspondents however are certain that the Cardinal has interceded on their behalf One woman prayed to Cooke to settle a long and bitter dispute within her family When tensions eased she called it a miracle If it isnt good enough for the Pope its good enough for me she wrote The most dramatic and most promising case so far is that of a 14yearold boy who has battled fourthstage lymphomaleukemia for eight years After neither radiation nor chemotheraphy had succeeded in halting the cancer doctors tried a bonemarrow transplant a recent medical miracle that provides a new immune system Periodic examinations turned up healthy cells with no sign of leukemia The boy seemed cured But two years later doctors were shocked to find new leukemia cells a rarity This time there was no new medical miracle to fall back on recalls the boys grandfather who cares for him Worse the radiation and chemotherapy that had given him temporary relief before now damaged his liver heart and bladder A friend told us about the Cardinal Cooke Guild says the grandfather Soon guild members were turning up at the hospital to pray and visit The doctors soon informed the family that the boy had only a few days to live Last rites were administered and the family decided to bring the boy home to die The guild did not give up An old friend of Cardinal Cooke visited the boys sickbed and placed the Cardinals zucchetto the traditional red skullcap of a prince of the church on the boys stomach another turned up with Cardinal Cookes episcopal cross Within days the boy began to improve  gradually says his grandfather A few weeks later the teenager walked into the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center for a checkup  to the amazement of his doctors who concluded that the cancer was apparently and inexplicably in remission A year and a half later he is doing fine Im not sure what happened though my wife is absolutely certain his life was saved by the intercession of the Cardinal says the boys grandfather And as time goes on I must admit that Im inclined to agree For Father Groeschel it is part of a beginning the end of which he points out with some relief is likely to come long after my own death Even if the effort to canonize Cardinal Cooke ultimately fails Father Groeschel believes it will have succeeded We live in a world not only of unbelief but of disedification he explains We are surrounded by scandal and bad example These efforts on behalf of the Cardinal might bring hope to some people in an otherwise ugly world Father Groeschel also points out that modern medical advances will assure that an increasing number of us will die the kind of lingering death from cancer that Cardinal Cooke suffered His example is an inspiring one says the friar Saints by the Vaticans definition are persons of heroic virtue If in our time and place astronauts rock stars or 20yearolds blessed with the ability to throw a baseball 95 mph qualify for heroic stature why not the inspiring example of a virtuous life and death The American church has been modest about its successes although there are 52 million Catholics in the United States only three saints have been United States citizens John N Neumann a 19thcentury bishop of Philadelphia Elizabeth Ann Seton a socialite who became a nun founded the American Sisters of Charity in 1809 and initiated the nations parochial school system and Frances Xavier Cabrini the patron saint of the nations immigrants with whom she worked at the turn of the century Terence Cardinal Cooke can be seen as the icon of a later stage in the history of American Catholicism Hes one of us explains Father Groeschel referring to the millions of descendants of Catholic immigrants Hes a kid from the city with a New York accent  proof perhaps that a saint can grow up playing stickball in the streets of New York and shopping at Korvettes
ACTIVISTS ASSESS IMPACE OF RIGHT TO LIFE PARTY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/nyregion/activists-assess-impace-of-right-to-life-party.html,IN its almost eight years as a formal political party the Right to Life Party has had minimal impact on Westchesters elections according to three activists involved with the abortion issue The three disagree over why The party is irrelevant said Polly Rothstein executive director of the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion because those who favor choice are in the majority We have gained the edge in political clout Not so said Patricia W Hatcher cochairman of the Right to Life Committee of Westchester an entity separate from the Right to Life Party She said the party has had little positive impact because it runs its own candidates even when there is a prolife Republican or Democrat in the race A third interpretation was offered by Robert D McKeon chairman of the Right to Life Party of Westchester who said that the blame lies with antiabortionists like Mrs Hatcher who did not support Right to Life Party candidates Ironically they are the ones not the proabortion people who are preventing us from advancing Mr McKeon said The Right to Life Committee is a national organization that predates the New York State Right to Life Party Although both have the same objective of making abortion illegal the two groups usually endorse different candidates for office and have occasionally not seen eyetoeye on abortionrelated issues The party became a formal entity in the state after the 1978 gubernatorial election when its candidate drew more than the 50000 votes required to obtain the standing As a formal party it is reserved a row on the ballot for all races and can nominate candidates by a party convention instead of by petition only The only other formal parties in the state are the Democrats the Republicans the Conservatives and the Liberals The Right to Life Party has about 1400 enrolled voters in the county and 21606 statewide With the 1986 elections now history those involved with the abortion issue are assessing the vote and both sides find things to be pleased about The good news for the Right to Life Party is that the party with Dennis E Dillon the Nassau County District Attorney as its gubernatorial candidate drew more votes statewide than the Liberal Party which had endorsed the Democratic incumbent Mario M Cuomo This means the Right to Life Party will bump the Liberals from Line D on the next ballot The local Right to Life Committee has found satisfaction in seeing elected many of the majorparty candidates it endorsed including Representative Joseph J DioGuardi in the 20th Congressional District and Nicholas A Spano a Yonkers Republican elected to the State Senate These victories come despite financial help from the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion to the respective opponents in those two races former Representative Bella S Abzug and Andrew Macdonald both Democrats Polly Rothstein says this is a prochoice county Mrs Hatcher said Look at the people who are elected from Westchester County I dont think it bears out Mrs Rothstein in turn argued that Mrs Abzug and Mr Macdonald lost for reasons unrelated to the abortion issue and that a number of candidates who support legal abortion defeated antiabortionists in races that could have been won by either candidate These included Assemblyman Ronald C Tocci a Democrat from New Rochelle and Assemblymanelect Terence M Zaleski a Democrat from Yonkers she said According to Mrs Rothstein election trends in recent years demonstrate a dwindling support for the Right to Life Party and the antiabortion issue in general Specifically she said the average Right to Life Party candidate running for state office in the county in 1986 drew 28 percent of the vote compared with 35 percent in 1980 For countylevel races the percentage has dropped to 25 percent in 1985 from 57 percent in 1979 she said Mrs Rothstein Mrs Hatcher and Mr McKeon did have points on which they agreed including the belief that most Westchester voters do not base their vote solely on a candidates stand on abortion although this may indeed be a factor They agreed that a main reason that the Right to Life Party has received fewer votes in recent years is that many majorparty candidates who in the past had the Right to Life endorsement now either refuse it or are not offered it The only majorparty candidates to take the Right to Life line this year in Westchester races were three Republicans United States Senator Alfonse DAmato and Assemblyman Guy J Vallela both of whom were reelected and Joseph A Rauso who lost a race for Assembly In all other races the Right to Life Party ran its own candidates According to Mrs Hatcher voters are reluctant to waste their vote on a thirdparty candidate who is perceived to have no chance of winning particularly when there is a candidate viewed by the Right to Life Committee as prolife The committee usually endorses a majorparty candidate unless it considers neither of them to be an opponent of legalized abortion Mrs Hatcher said she believed that the Right to Life Party has been harming the cause by running its own candidates I think where theres a split vote theyre just helping the other candidate who is proabortion she said adding Weve seen the party as slowing down the achievements of our goal While we wouldnt cheer at its demise we wouldnt be upset about it either Responded Mr McKeon We too are working to put ourselves out of business by winning the battle to make abortion illegal In the meantime Mr McKeon said the party would continue to run candidates What is the purpose of being a political party if you dont run candidates he asked If we get the numbers if we get 10 percent of the vote he explained then the politicians would look at our line as important According to Mrs Rothstein this will never happen The majorparty candidates dont take the line because its been the kiss of death she said It hurts more than it helps The politicians who are antichoice would take it if it helped In a rare move of unity between the state Right to Life Party and the state Right to Life Committee the committee also endorsed Mr Dillon in the recent gubernatorial race However the Westchester Right to Life Committee broke from the ranks and endorsed County Executive Andrew P ORourke the Republican candidadte Party leaders misrepresented Mr ORourkes positions Mrs Hatcher said noting that Mr ORourke is a member of the Right to Life Committee Mr McKeon said he personally worked actively to convince the state Right to Life Committee that Mr ORourke was not prolife He said this conclusion had been based in part on Mr ORourkes refusal in 1983 to support a proposed county law that would have required women under 18 years of age to notify their parents before they could have had an abortion The Right to Life Committee agreed with Mr ORourkes position that such a law on a county level was unconstitutional Mrs Hatcher said We are taxpayers she said It would have been irresponsible and a waste of money to support it
THE LORD OF LA MANCHA AND HER ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/books/the-lord-of-la-mancha-and-her-abortion.html,DON QUIXOTE By Kathy Acker 207 pp New York Grove Press Paper 795  KATHY ACKERS Don Quixote is a literary trash compactor collapsing with hammer thumps and electronic whine the fictional containers  the genres stories and characters  from which we take nourishment and Ms Acker says sup poison Cervantes constructed his twovolume landfill of medieval rubbish and Renaissance life over two decades Ms Ackers 207page version is the product of the new era one of her characters in her last novel Blood and Guts in High School describes as an age when people will have to grapple with all sorts of difficult problems leaving us no time for the luxury of expressing ourselves artistically The novel begins with Don Quixote now a 66yearold contemporary woman having an abortion which maddens her She conceived of the most insane idea that any woman can think of Which is to love This ideal is crazed we learn later because most women are too intelligent to believe in romantic love but have been persuaded by men and literature that love is womans function and tragic triumph Cervantes showed what courtly love could do to a man Ms Acker sketches 350 years of sentimental history and illustrates the cumulative effects of romantic madness with Ms Quixotes wanderings through the gender wars of todays London and New York her Sancho Panza a talking dog named St Simeon Like Cervantes book Ms Ackers collects adventures authorial addresses reportage other texts anecdotes and hallucinations Subtitled Which Was a Dream Don Quixote has the threepart structure of the mythic heroic journey The Beginning of the Night is also the knights departure her futile and often funny sallies into a world controlled by two powermongers Machiavelli and Christ In the second part Other Texts Quixote has to read works by four male writers who create or unwittingly perpetuate harmful stereotypes of women These works  Belys Petersburg Lampedusas Leopard Wedekinds Lulu plays and an anonymous science fiction story Ms Acker bashes with broad parody and grotesque revision In the third part The End of the Night and knight Quixote returns from literature to save America from evil enchanters such as Richard Nixon Henry Kissinger and New York City landlords She hears voices including those of Hobbes de Sade and Puritan divines listens to a friendly dogs life story which appears to retell Quixotes own childhood wages war on Religious White Men and after death dreams of Spain where people could dream publicly which is to do art Economic and political war or control Quixote comes to believe are now taking place at the level of language or myth She also knows about the later semioticians    Derrida    Foucault But Ms Acker is no academic deconstructor Not even a maker of Donald Barthelme collages or Angela Carter rewrites Early in the novel Ms Acker plays with her name associating Kathy with catheter the tool of abortion and Acker with hack both as noun junk writer and as verb These associations which turn into fictional methods are probably why she has a reputation as a punk novelist She has also performed with the rock group Husker Du What is evident in Don Quixote as well as in Blood and Guts and another earlier novel Great Expectations is a punklike reductiveness of lexicon and texture a combination of the early Sex Pistols raging repetition and the drugged synthesizer tonalities of Laurie Andersons mantric songs The original Quixote complained that his story was told by some ignorant chatterer who set himself to write it gropingly Despite the Cervantean precedent Ms Ackers stylistic choices are I think at unfortunate odds with the sophistication of her materials The novel is eccentrically learned quite carefully constructed though it appears haphazardly plotted in control of its double and triple ironic inversions canny in its feminist critique of male and female fictions including feminist mythologies and often acute in its overheard voices But Don Quixote is much too frequently composed of banal language the stilted and formulaic highschool passion I thought Ms Acker had disposed of in Blood and Guts How to separate the trash compactor from the trash This is the challenge Ms Acker does not manage with a craft equal to her cultural range LIKE most postmodern experimenters Ms Acker includes within her novel several defenses of its alienating methods Masochism is now rebellion might explain her messedup language Ms Acker also likes to play authorial hide and seek Toward the end of Don Quixote she implies that it as well as other novels are symptoms of trauma the howl of guilt and anger inflicted by the suicide of a mother dominated by male notions of femininity Whether autobiographical fact or not this experience of selfdestructiveness supplies a powerful cause of Quixotes abortionmadness and a motive for Ms Ackers selfimploding prose Her scarified sensibility subversive intellect and predatory wit make her a writer like no other I know Monique Wittig in Les Guerilleres would be the closest At the end of Don Quixote the knight inspires females to become marauding pirates in revolt Ms Acker does mash and slash IN THE TRADITION OF CERVANTES SORT OFI think my Don Quixote is in the same tradition as the first Don Quixote  Kathy Acker said of her latest novel in which Cervantes visionary knight has been transformed into a crusading feminist crazed by the prospect of having an abortion The 39yearold American author said she became fascinated with Don Quixotes trying to transform a fairly intolerable social reality into what really is the grail this totally romantic search All sorts of feminist issues got involved  it just took off Ms Acker picked up Cervantes text two years ago she said by telephone from her London home when she was looking for something to divert her attention from her own impending abortion I couldnt keep my mind off the abortion so I started writing down what I was reading but the abortion kept getting into it When I finally looked at what I had written I said this is fabulous Ms Acker who moved to London from New Yorks Lower East Side in 1984 said she was intrigued by the Arab themes and forms in Cervantes text especially what she called the art of narrative weaving She incorporated African folk tales into her version as she did English novels American history books and German plays I write by using other written texts rather than by expressing reality which is what most novelists do Our reality now which occurs so much through the media is other texts Im playing the same game as Cervantes When I read novels now they dont seem to have anything to do with anything I cant tell where the writers guts are novels should be aimed at adding to cultural discourse  Lori Miller
I AM LAPIDARY BUT NOT ERISTIC WHEN I USE BIG WORDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/books/i-am-lapidary-but-not-eristic-when-i-use-big-words.html,ONE day in May I found on my desk my column clipped from that mornings Washington Post a red arrow  courtesy of my secretary  pointing to a footnote underneath the column It read ERISTIC i ris tik adj [ Gr eristikos d erizein to strive dispute d eris strife ] of or provoking controversy or given to sophistical argument and specious reasoning I looked up to the corresponding asterisk in the text and there saw my sentence The action by Judge Robert Carter [ in fining the National Conference of Catholic Bishops for contempt ] has brought out a lot of smiles in judicial political circles as a rule you dont step up and fine the Catholic Church  or the Protestant or Jewish churches  for failure to comply with eristic complaints The Abortion Rights Mobilization was suing to deny the bishops their tax deductibility to which end it had persuaded the judge to subpoena the bishops internal memos on abortion Meg Greenfield The Posts editorial page editor was rapping me on the knuckles a quite unusual public reproach I couldnt remember when last she had thought to help the readers of The Post to understand unusual words however much time she needs to spend explaining unusual editorial positions Dear Meg I thought The instincts of the Jewish mother just took over this time And then a week or two later another clipping on my desk red arrow footnote only this time it was The Charlotte NC Observer explaining to its readers the meaning of lapidary Their footnote Lapidary Having the elegance and precision associated with inscriptions on monumental stones I was feeling a little beleaguered and presently there appeared a letter of explanation from Mr Ed Williams associate editor of The Charlotte Observer and the challenge was now well lapidary Mr Williams wrote me I oversee the Observers daily Viewpoint page and in that capacity am in charge of preparing syndicated columns for publication in this newspaper Sometimes I insert aids to the reader such as the definition of lapidary in your recent column enclosed A fellow editor asked why I didnt also define a outrance I replied that I thought you use foreign words and phrases in your column because 1 you like to show off and 2 you take delight in irritating people Far be it for me I said to deny you those pleasures Then I realized I shouldnt presume to answer for you So let me ask Why do you use in your column foreign words and phrases and unfamiliar English words that are unlikely to be understood by the average reader or at least the average editor Surrounded by dictionaries I await your reply The point here raised  When is it OK to use an unfamiliar word When is it not OK  is endlessly argued yet even so sometimes notwithstanding the debates endlessness fresh insights and original formulations are coined One of these I think was Dwight Macdonalds distinction made in his marvelous survey of Websters Third for The New Yorker March 10 1962 between unusual words OK and words that belong in the zoo sections of the dictionary not OK I should think most people would agree for instance that arachibutyrophobia would be an example of the latter the word defines the fear of peanut butters sticking to the roof of your mouth James Jackson Kilpatrick in his book The Writers Art takes a position on the dogmatic side against the use of unfamiliar words and cites me however kindly as a prodigious offender the Lord delivered Kilpo into my hands because his proscriptive passage against long  unusual words contained four long  unusual words Mr Kilpatrick likes to quote Westbrook Pegler who denounced the use of what he called out of town words The question under the proximate prodding of Mr Williams is worth revisiting And the best way to begin I suppose is to examine the two words singled out for attention the first one  the word Mr Williams thought that courtesy required him to translate for the benefit of his readers  the second the French which he let pass as arrant and provocative exhibitionism What happens when Mr A and Ms B flatly disagree about whether a word is unusual Well there is a problem there of an obvious order namely that some words are unusual but widely recognized while others are unusual and widely unrecognized Returning to the general theme a few weeks ago Mr Kilpatrick wrote in his column The Miami Herald carried a 72 point fourcolumn head DADELAND IS DOYEN OF AREA MALLS  and said he had received a letter Mr Kilpatrick also writes a syndicated language column and serves as ombudsman on usage from a Floridian who wanted to know How many people know what doyen means Observed K The more pertinent question How many of the Heralds 450000 readers know what doyen means Ten percent 20 per cent 80 percent But Kilpatrick is a man of troubled conscience because he goes right on to say that here he himself has just finished making reference to 72 point type That is workaday prose of the JohnJaneGyp order for anyone who has ever engaged in editorial enterprises  but what about those 450000 readers Might they not have preferred K tortures himself inchhigh type Nobody is going to pay Mr Gallup a lot of money to find out how many people in Florida know what the word doyen means And not many people would be willing to come up with a threshold percentage More than X know doyen  OK to use Less than X verboten forbidden Thats on the order of defining the line where obscenity begins All of which brings me to say that I do not think of lapidary as a word so unrecognizable as to interrupt the reading flow of the average college graduate But in saying this it is important to reiterate one of the points I made in the public argument I had with Mr Kilpatrick in the introduction to his book which he assigned me to write It is quite simply this that people with vocabularies of the same size are by no means people who know the same words A while ago I reviewed a book by John Updike The Coup discovering over 20 words the meaning of which I didnt know Knocking these words around at an editors session in my office I would find that cumulatively my five colleagues knew them all So Sam Johnsons apothegm In lapidary inscriptions a man is not upon oath if it is not in the anthologies that circle Mr Williams desk ought to be But then lets take the tougher one Here is what I wrote in a column on Paul Weiss the philosopher whose 85th birthday was something of a national event At Yale [ Professor Weiss ] was the political liberal a outrance but his orderly mind made it hard for him to defend some of liberalisms zanier forms This now is concession time How many people are familiar with a outrance It is no question about it an outoftown word though Pegler certainly ran into it when he was out of town covering the war in France in 1918 where the Germans faced the French British and Americans fighting their trench warfare a outrance But the French word is given in Webster First the inquirer gets plain outrance in English the last extremity and then is invited to look at a outrance a separate entry that gives to the death unsparingly The Oxford English Dictionary also lists it in French and cites uses of it by Tobias Smollet and Walter Scott    But why should a syndicated columnist use the word I can hear Mr Williams reasking Well not really just to show off  one doesnt show off ones workaday equipment You see that word and a hundred or so others are a part of my working vocabulary even as a C augmented 11th chord with a raised 9th can be said to be an operative resource of the performing jazz pianist Are we now closing in on the question by using the exclusivist word performing Yes in a way we are I suppose Because just as the discriminating ear greets gladly the C augmented 11th when just the right harmonic moment has come for it so the fastidious eye encounters happily the word that says exactly what the writer wished not only said but conveyed the writer here defined as a performing writer sensitive to cadence variety marksmanship accent nuance and drama WHAT of the reader who misses the refinement Well what of the listener deaf to the special reach of the C augmented 11th That reader has the usual choices he can ignore the word attempt from the context to divine its meaning precisely or roughly not hard in the narrative above on Professor Weisss liberal politics or he can look it up Are these alternatives an imposition Yes if the newspapers feature that day is on how to treat a rattlesnake bite You would not instruct the reader to fight the poison a outrance But newspapers in particular in onepaper cities tend to acknowledge an obligation beyond merely reporting the news The very idea of a feature whether designed to advise Ann Landers amuse Art Buchwald satirize G B Trudeau or opine the syndicated columnist presupposes that the performer should use the full range of his relevant skills even if the percentage of readers who turn to that feature is reduced Surely there is a corner in spacy papers that carry five pages on sports for Addison and Steele It required a Pulitzer Prize to alert some editors to the very existence of Murray Kempton the most entertaining analytical belletrist in town and now we read him hungrily in The Stamford Advocate Readers have diverse interests resources skills appetites The Latin Mass Committee petitioned for the resumption of a single mass to be said in Latin in London after the postconciliar ban of 1965 and was turned down  on the ground that Latin was only for the educated few Sir Arnold Lunn said it all in a letter to The Times Surely he wrote in all her charity Mother Church can make a little room even for the educated few
THE CULT OF CEAUSESCU,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/11/30/magazine/the-cult-of-ceausescu.html,THE FIRST QUESTION PEOPLE ASK WHEN THEY hear that you have just spent an hour with Nicolae Ceausescu is How did he look So it went with the hotel concierge the restaurant waiter the taxi driver the travelagency clerk and foreign diplomats in Bucharest The implication of the question and much of what is said in the police state that is Rumania deals in implications and inferences was whether President Ceausescu has long to live A year ago he had been out of action for weeks the rumor being that he had prostate cancer But now the 68yearold leader seemed to the nondiagnostic eye more or less fit I had asked to see Ceausescu in March just 20 years after he barred me from Rumania while I was serving as Balkan correspondent of The New York Times The reason for the ban suggested but never made explicit was an article I had written based on many interviews saying that Ceausescu then in power for one year appeared to be scarcely known in the Rumanian countryside Ten years later I was readmitted returning again in 1979 and 1983 In the interim the Rumanian President had become a kind of a Communist king due in large part to the systematic development over the last dozen years of a cult of personality that has equaled or even surpassed those of Russias Stalin Chinas Mao and Yugoslavias Tito In guarded moments Rumanians refer to him as MaoCescu Ceausescu is probably the most powerful ruler in the history of the Rumanians a history he likes to trace back to the GetoDacians who stopped an invasion by Persias Darius in the reed banks of the Danube delta 2500 years ago With the placement of scores of his family members in high positions there is even the framework now for a dynasty To his subjects Ceausescu is allknowing and omnipresent The first half of the state televisions single twohour weeknight program is customarily devoted to his activities and accomplishments as are the front pages of the tightly controlled newspapers Bookstores must devote a showcase to the 28 volumes of his speeches news kiosks carry a smaller selection and music stores display records of his speeches Painters and poets are required to produce works celebrating him At the entrance to the Bucharest Fairground a new triumphal arch bears the legend The Golden Epoch  the Epoch of Nicolae Ceausescu The Ceausescu cult also requires that even highranking party officials are obliged to rise to their feet at party rallies and join in such ritual chants as Ceausescu Rumania our pride and esteem Beyond the borders of Rumania Nicolae Ceausescu is viewed more dispassionately Mikhail S Gorbachev the new Soviet leader who has shunned the semblances of a personality cult for himself appears to have adopted a scornful stance toward Ceausescu and has not accorded him more than the minimal courtesies Although the United States has developed closer ties on cultural political and economic levels there has been a certain disenchantment with Rumanias system of suffocating controls in its domestic policy One of Rumanias few distinctions has been its independent foreign policy Over the last two decades there have been moments of daring defiance of Sovietbloc policies having good relations with China maintaining ties with Israel after the 1967 war refusing to join in the 1968 invasion of Czechoslovakia not boycotting the 1984 Olympics at Los Angeles These actions undoubtedly annoyed Moscow but they were tolerated because they never constituted any real threat to Soviet national security Now with the MoscowPeking split in a healing process and talks begun between Israel and some bloc countries the uniqueness of Rumanias independent policy is fading Rumania had also become more dependent on trade with the Soviet Union The Russians are not unhappy a Rumanian foreign policy specialist observes to see a weak Rumania on their southwestern frontier Yet despite a crumbling economy Ceausescu is busily commemorating his reign with gigantic building projects Already finished though little used is the DanubeBlack Sea Canal Under way in Bucharest is an unneeded 12 billion civic center that includes a state palace for the President and a nationwide 18 billion irrigation system Under consideration is a plan  frightening to environmentalists  to fill in much of the vast Danube delta wetlands to create new farmland Construction is scheduled to begin next year on a parallel capital to Bucharest at Tirgoviste as there had been during the 16thcentury reign of Michael the Brave who first united all three Rumanian lands Walachia Transylvania and Moldavia In Tirgovistes history museum there is a new exhibition of Rumanian heroes An enormous portrait of Ceausescu gazes down on the busts of Rumanian rulers Among the venerated is Vlad Dracula the 15thcentury prince whose cruelties gave rise to the Dracula vampire legend Flanking the entranceway are huge bronze busts of Decebal the Dacian king and Trajan the Roman emperor who defeated Decebal at great cost in the second century Could it be that Ceausescu is casting himself not only as a Rumanian emperor but as a Roman one as well After all he carried a jeweled royal mace at his 1974 induction as President Roman emperor the guide snorted No he already thinks he is a god What do you mean In the newspapers they have already printed poems about Ceausescu describing him as a demigod  Although he claims Dracula as part of his political lineage it appears that Ceausescu has not allowed torture or killing to be part of his style of governance But in its 1986 report on Rumania the Helsinki Watch which monitors human rights speaks of totalitarian control as repressive as any in Eastern Europe T O VISIT CEAUSESCU as a journalist requires that written questions be submitted These are then processed by Agerpres the state press agency the Ministry of Foreign Affairs and by the Presidents personal advisers Over a period of seven months four sets of questions were submitted revised and eventually agreed upon An interview was set for the week of Sept 29 I arrived in good time then waited three days before receiving word that Ceausescu would receive me at 930 AM on Oct 2 The setting would be the headquarters of the Central Committee whose general secretary he is rather than at his presidential seat in the former royal palace An elaborate ritual ensued A foreign ministry official picked me up at my hotel at 825 AM and we walked for seven minutes in a circuitous route to the headquarters An army colonel met us at the doors two protocol officials took us to the second floor along a lengthy corridor around a corner and down to the mezzanine level where we were escorted into a 20by50foot reception room dotted with potted palms Three still photographers and a television cameraman stood by All such Presidential activities are recorded and dutifully presented in the Rumanian press and on television Ceausescu requests that his interviews with foreign reporters be published in full A compact man about 5 feet 6 inches tall Ceausescu entered walking a bit stiffly As I moved forward to shake hands with him cameras clicked and whirred Having reported on the absence of a Ceausescu cult two decades ago it occurred to me I was now participating in one Before I could pull out a notebook he shot a question at me What are your impressions of Rumania An interpreter translated It did not seem to be the moment to talk about personality cults or meat and power shortages so I replied lamely There is a lot of construction going on The President nodded with satisfaction before opening a small red folder containing my questions As instructed I said Let us proceed to the first question He spoke softly and carefully pausing to ponder each question before proceeding His responses added nothing to previous statements but they did make plain where his interests lie as evidenced in these excerpts Question    What was the most memorable event in your career Answer    I think its acme [ was ] when we turned Rumania from a backward agrarian country into a developed industrialagrarian country Q    How would you characterize Rumanias relations with the USA And the USSR A Today our relations with the Soviet Union are fine And    so are the links between Rumania and the U S    I believe things would be much better if the problem of the mostfavorednation clause [ according Rumania preferential tariffs ] did not arise every year    Q How will Rumanian society develop in the coming years A    We plan that by 1990 Rumanian industry should compare with the worlds technically and qualitatively mostdeveloped ones Likewise we plan to take Rumanian agriculture to a high development level We have endorsed a series of measures for the application of a new economic and financial mechanism of the principles of selfmanagement and selfadministration    It was all quite extemporaneous but a bit like interviewing a juke box you push a button and a record starts playing back familiar songs At the end Ceausescu permitted a few additional questions When I asked how he had been drawn into the Communist movement his face grew somber and he replied in measured tones I had a very difficult life in the village I came to the city to work and    entered into a relationship with several revolutionaries when I was 12 or 13 I began to understand that another kind of living conditions could be created I also asked if I might see his native village meet another Ceausescu perhaps his younger brother Ilie and visit Tirgoviste He spread his arms wide in a gesture of generosity and replied Poftim  Be my guest We shook hands again and he marched out It was an odd moment It did not seem as if I had been in the presence of an emperor much less a demigod or even the object of a cult more like a distracted corporate chief executive officer Then I noticed the eyes of the Rumanian aides who had remained behind They were glistening But of course the Ceausescu cult was there for domestic consumption not for people like me E XITING A FEW minutes later onto the Piata Gheorghe GheorghiuDej named for Ceausescus predecessor and mentor a striking figure suddenly appeared a tall elderly man wearing white trousers a red cravat and a black doublebreasted blazer out of whose pocket spilled a huge orangeandblack checked silk handkerchief On his head a broadbrimmed black fedora and in his hand a Malacca cane which he flourished He was a vision of the decadent past when Bucharest was a legend throughout Europe and beyond for luxury and debauchery He nodded slightly to the gawking pedestrians as he proceeded majestically on his way I raised my camera to take his picture The foreign ministry man lightly touched my elbow Please dont he said He is crazy The encounter was but one of several reminders that the Ceausescu cult despite its pervasiveness coexists with other perhaps more durable Rumanian realities It is in the everyday life of the 23 million Rumanians that the iron shoe of the Ceausescu system pinches Rumania exports large quantities of meat and vegetables to European countries while supplies at home remain critically short An item as innocuous as black pepper is prized because it is one of thousands of consumer goods no longer imported in an austerity drive aimed at liquidating Rumanias 66 billion foreign debt If you ask for sugar to go with your morning coffee in an Acategory hotel the waiter reaches into his pocket withdraws a single packet of zahar and solemnly hands it to you In a country whose wells produce 12 million tons of oil annually gasoline is periodically rationed Here again the Ceausescu shoe pinches Based on what had long been a major oil industry the present regime built a huge refining capacity Now the global market for refined products has shrunk but Rumania is still saddled with agreements to purchase Soviet oil at world prices and then turn it into gasoline that can only be sold abroad and at a loss A driver of the stateowned MaxiTaxi enterprise complains bitterly They give me a quota of 15 liters [ less than four gallons ] of gas a day which takes me about 150 kilometers [ 94 miles ]  Thats half a days driving What am I supposed to do What he and nearly all Rumanians do is to participate in a second economy in which the standard currencies are United States dollars American filtered cigarettes and Viennese ground coffee and in which bartering is the medium of trade Some of the worst shortages are in the power sector The gas supply is often so low that stove pilot lights go out During the last two winters Rumania was caught stealing power from a joint YugoslavRumanian hydroelectric station The nations first nuclear power station was supposed to have come on line last year now the talk is of 1989 Basically the outlook is pretty grim says an economist at a Western embassy in Bucharest People talk of a 20 to 30 percent drop in the living standard in the last three years Ceausescu has ruled out any economic reform whatsoever A colleague of his rejoins Given the green light they could do very well Theyve got the potential The schools are good the infrastructure good But innovators are ignored Initiative is stifled They are sliding toward being an undeveloped country reduced to dealing in commodities T HE QUESTION ON the minds of ordinary Rumanians foreign diplomats journalists and scholars is whether Nicolae Ceausescu seeks to create a dynastic succession The question takes on weight when one learns that at least 40 members of his extended family have been identified in positions of varying power in the partystate apparatus The question narrows if one considers the role of his wife Elena a chemist by training who began to appear in public 15 years ago in the role of First Lady Now at age 67 she is generally viewed as the secondmost influential person in the leadership She is a key member of the executive committee of the Central Committee in charge of personnel policy and the holder of numerous other high political posts In recent years her birthday has been marked as a state occasion For a time it was thought that the Presidents son Nicu was being groomed for succession But though appointed to high posts in the party and put in charge of the national Communist Youth Union he has preferred to indulge in fast cars womanizing and drink Of late he has become increasingly inactive and some Youth Union leaders have even dared to suggest that he be replaced The other Ceausescus including daughter Zoia Elena a director of the Mathematical Institute and an adopted son Valentin secretary of the Rumanian Institute of Nuclear Physics keep a low profile despite their Government positions As do several Presidential brothers Ion deputy chief of the State Planning Commission Florea a retired journalist Marin a trade official and Nicolae Andruta a lieutenant general in the Ministry of the Interior Some specialists have surmised that Ceausescu placed so many of his and his wifes relatives in key positions to assure personal control of crucial sectors of the Communist power structure as much as to extend his dynasty For the moment the only Ceausescu deemed strongwilled enough to try to succeed the President in the event of his death would be his wife Elena But she is so widely disliked that should she try no one thinks she would last more than a few months The day after my interview with him the President made good on his poftim I was to meet my third family member having encountered Mrs Ceausescu in Washington in 1978 A black Dacia car took me to meet brother Ilie a lieutenant general in the Ministry of Defense who is eight years younger than Nicolae balder and a charming host His official position is chairman of the armys political administration but his first love is military history I had just seen Battle From the Shadows a new Rumanian film about World War I and had recently read about Vlad Draculas military campaigns against the Turks Was my impression that Rumanian strategy had long depended on ambushes an accurate one Plainly delighted the general commenced his response with the ambush of Darius I by the Dacians in 514 BC and concluded two hours later in the 20th century It was a learned discourse presented with great verve rich details and gentle humor What did he talk about with his brother the President I asked Everything he replied No problems We get together when possible But each of us has very many activities Even our wives dont get together I asked if I could snap his picture He agreed but admonished me You may keep the photos of me on two conditions  one that you dont publish them and two that you dont publish them together with photos of my brother The following morning I drove westward to the village of the Ceausescu clan One sees the Ceausescu cult in full flower in Scornicesti which now boasts paved streets a new candy factory a soccer stadium stores with more goods in the windows than in comparable small villages a discotheque and a stone monument opposite the modest ancestral Ceausescu cottage which has been completly renovated The village has even acquired a second small Orthodox church perched on a hillside next to the marble tombs of the Presidents parents The new chapel prompted a Rumanian wit to dub the village ScornicestilesdeuxEglises as in the hometown of Charles de Gaulle ColombeylesdeuxEglises Nicolae Ceausescu was the third of 10 children seven of them sons Their father Andruta was known locally as a heavy drinker which may explain why he named two of his sons Nicolae The one who became President was sent from home in 1929 at age 11 to Pitesti a nearby big city where he was apprenticed to a shoemaker Soon after he moved to Bucharest In 1933 at age 15 he was arrested for leftist political activities and in 1936 was tried as a Communist and sentenced to several years in Doftana Prison There he met older Communists including GheorghiuDej who liked the precocious teenager and took him under their wing Party lore has it that he met Elena at the 1939 First of May celebration in Bucharest where she was queen of the workers parade They married that year He was arrested again in 1940 and spent the war years in various internment camps I departed Scornicesti still wondering about the dynasty theory Perhaps in traditional peasant fashion Ceausescu was merely taking care of his extended family members But that would still leave begging an explanation for the cult and the megalomania Those of us who watched GheorghiuDej in the early 1960s thought we were witnessing the beginning of his cult Maybe Ceausescu got the idea from him But it was GheorghiuDej who promulgated Rumanias policy of independence from the Soviet Union in foreign affairs and economic relations his successor has merely elaborated on it Rather the Ceausescu stamp is evident in the creation of monster steel and aluminum industries that work at half capacity because there is no market for their products in the gigantic irrigation scheme that lowers the water table and leaches the soil to the point of infertility and in the law prohibiting abortions There may not be individual cruelty as in the reign of Vlad Dracula but there is institutionalized misery and despair It touches the majority of the population except the police who are paid more than university professors to carry submachine guns and stand on every street in the capital and at roadcontrol points every 10 miles or so in the countryside Some Rumanians estimate that half the population is involved in the security apparatus in one way or another if only as informers When Ceausescu rides down Dorobantilor Road in his convoy of eight cars in the morning the blue militia jeeps appear at the cross streets a Bucharest woman recounts The militia lines the road one posted every few yards Plainclothesmen in black leather jackets appear among the trees ready to shoo people into the doorways Buses are drawn up to block against suicide drivers In all likelihood this is part of Nicolae Ceausescus response to a youth of rejection privation and imprisonment He implied as much during the interview in response to a question about the most significant event in his life I would say that one of the important moments was when resolved to defy any act of repression and to serve the Rumanian people I chose the path of the fight for the revolutionary transformation of Rumanian society
CHILDREN WITH CHILDREN: COPING WITH A CRISIS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/nyregion/children-with-children-coping-with-a-crisis.html,Throughout New York City everyounger girls are becoming pregnant ever more frequently Over the last five years even as pregnancies among 15to19yearolds have remained nearly steady the rate among younger girls  some not even teenagers has risen School officials offer a variety of reasons for the situation  the girls desire for respite from a grim future an ignorance of birth control and an unwillingness to postpone sex  but the officials remain perplexed as they try to keep their students lives on course The most candid explanations are offered by the child mothers themselves He Couldnt Hack It The story of Roseann Collado now a 17yearold student at Jane Addams Vocational High School in the Bronx reflects the experience of many young mothers She became pregnant at age 13 and again a year later The father of both children was a 15yearold with whom she liked to hang around and whom she hoped to persuade to marry her Instead he disappeared leaving Ms Collado alone with two children at the age of 15 He couldnt hack it she recalled I thought by giving him a kid he would stay I wanted to be out of the house I wanted to be with a guy in a house raising my own family It didnt work out that way Despite some regrets about the pregnancies Ms Collado manages a cheery countenance and determination to finish high school As to how she saw herself five years from now she said Working real hard finding a father for the kids and finishing school But for every girl who comes back to school many more drop out Many principals and teachers said it was unrealistic to expect the teaching of abstinence to have much effect on the birth rate Its a matter of the availability of sex said the principal of Jane Addams Patricia Black But we have to break this culture of the children of poverty having children Its not the middleclass kids who are having the babies They get taken care of either by birth control or abortion Last year 1084 girls under the age of 15 became pregnant in New York City an increase of 67 percent in the pregnancy rate since 1980 according to the nonprofit Center for Public Advocacy Research About twothirds of those girls had abortions said Dr Grant Higginson deputy director of the maternity services and family planning division in the citys Health Department In the 15to19 age group there were 29904 pregnancies in 1985 a drop of less than 1 percent in the rate of pregnancies since 1980 the centers figures show Nationally there are about a million teenage pregnancies each year 400000 ending in abortions The problem is clearly visible in New York Citys school system where in some high schools it is commonplace to see pregnant girls and where the School for Pregnant Teens which has been operating for 15 years has expanded to five sites last year serving 1644 girls We had one girl in the fifth grade last year she was 11 said Marie Pellegrino the assistant principal of the School for Pregnant Teens whose main site is at 22 East 128th Street She gave birth and the young mother is back in this school Principals teachers and doctors who deal with teenage mothers in the school system suggest a variety of reasons why young girls become pregnant A doctor who works at two high school health clinics Dr Alwyn Cohall said the teenagers showed little interest in postponing sexual activity He said ignorance was widespread about birth control methods and that old wives tales about human reproduction often prevail He said that health clinics in high schools should be allowed to distribute contraceptives a policy that the Board of Education has banned for six months while it studied the issue The head of the Board of Educations dropout prevention program Victor Herbert said he believed that many of the girls lead such uninspiring lives that becoming pregnant was a way of adding some interest At first they get a lot of attention Mr Herbert said Often said Mrs Black of Jane Addams High School young girls become pregnant in large part because their mothers did too at a similar age and in similar circumstances Irrational Thoughts About Pregnancy I wanted my children to have their father I didnt want them to be raised like me said Ms Collado as she told her story at Jane Addams where she is studying cosmetology Her mother was 20 when Ms Collado was born I havent seen my father since I was a baby she said noting a pattern that she said was being repeated with her own children Her 3yearold son David and 2yearold daughter Wandie know she said how to say Mummy not Daddy She realizes now she said that what she thought at the age of 13  that the father would stay around that they could hold together a family  was largely irrational I was a little child but I didnt look like 13 she said I had a body like I was older I did talk to everyone as though I was older She said she did not use birth control before her first pregnancy Afterward she took the pill but I didnt take it right She would get together with her boyfriend  he always wanted to be the best guy around the block  when his mother was out of her apartment She would go with her boyfriend and I would go to her house with her son Ms Collado recalled He had a fiveroom apartment It was real nice we had something going She said she would usually leave his house by 9 PM so she could get back before her mother then a nurses aide came home from work When Ms Collado delivered her first child her mother left work to look after him and later the second child She had to stop to look after the kids Ms Collado said Now she has arthritis My mother gets welfare for me my sister and the two babies When I get home from school I do my mothers job of looking after the kids Around her neighborhood in the north Bronx she sees little changing among her friends Basically the whole block is all young girls with kids she said Theyre all young 14 or 15 The oldest one is my best friend shes 17 with a 1yearold She did it to get out of the house The youngest girls sleep with anybody they can get To me they want to be like everybody else Some of the girls say I slept with this guy Its like they did something real big Theyre just wasting their time Whos going to want them Motherhood Gives A Reason for Living Like Roseann Collado Sherri Woodford a 19yearold student at West Side High School an alternative school in Manhattan said she became pregnant on purpose hoping that she could transform a tumultuous home life At 16 Ms Woodford was having trouble in school in El Paso Tex and her parents constantly argued My brother was into his friends she said I tried to get into trouble to get the attention of my parents She said she tried to become pregnant because I figured this would be something that could be mine  nobody could take it and I would have a little piece of me left that would give me a reason for living When she found out she was pregnant she ruled out an abortion I felt it was wrong unless absolutely necessary she said Ms Woodford decided to lie to her boyfriend I let his mother and him believe it was not his until just before I gave birth she said By that stage her mother then separated from her husband had already brought Ms Woodford and her brother to New York City where they could be close to relatives Ms Woodford gave birth to a girl Torrie over a year ago and has seen the father only once since He is now angry and confused about being a father she said I took Torrie to see him and told him he could love her and cherish her Ms Woodford said I asked him if it would be all right if he gave her his last name I havent heard back from him She was dependent on her mother she said to look after the baby for the first year Recently she enrolled the child in the day care center at West Side High School so that Torrie could be with other children Ms Woodford her brother her mother and the baby live on her mothers Social Security benefits and Ms Woodfords welfare payments Everybody wonders what would have happened if Id done it later Ms Woodford said Being on public assistance is not the easiest thing  I have to worry where Im going to get diapers clothes Its hard enough living with my mother at my age  at this age there are a lot of things I want to do as a person Ms Woodford a gregarious sometimes boisterous young woman goes to beauty school at night so I can pay for college She talks of going to Howard University in Washington If she doesnt make it she will join the military After two years she said they help me pay for college West Side High School students recently appeared in a videotape made by the Board of Education about the difficulties of being a single mother in school The tapes overriding message The experience is unglamorous a shortage of money tiring getting up early to feed and dress the baby and then going to school and often bitter no father around Ms Woodford concurs I like to party but it would be irresponsible for me to do that she said If at the end of the month I have extra money  which I rarely do  I go out and have a good time and then I come home and carry on being a mother She said warns the girls at West Side to think about the future I tell them theyre stupid if theyre having sex without birth control she said Most boys say if you love me youll have sex I tell the girls to say If you love me use a condom  A Boyfriend Becomes Disinterested At Jane Addams the principal Mrs Black says she often sees pregnant girls or young single mothers who left Roman Catholic schools after becoming pregnant One such girl Gisella Vasquez 18 the mother of a 2yearold girl came to the school pregnant and returned to classes when her daughter was 3 weeks old leaving her with her mother She has since graduated and is working at the school as a trainee teacher in cosmetology Ms Vasquez shy and soft spoken had known her boyfriend for a year before she became pregnant I was so dumb she said I didnt know how to get birth control I thought I would have to tell my mother I was just taking a risk Soon after her baby was born her boyfriend became disinterested and he has not been around since she said A lot of the girls at Jane Addams she said seem to know about birth control methods but refuse to use them Most of them know but are careless she said Other girls at Jane Addams and West Side High School offered varied reasons for becoming pregnant One Nadine Puerto a 17yearold senior at Jane Addams who is eight months pregnant and whose own mother was 17 and single when she was born said her 23yearold boyfriend was getting old It was thus time for him to be a father she said she had reasoned Several girls said they did not like to take birth control pills because as one explained there are so many diseases coming on like cancer One 17yearold girl at West Side who wanted only to be known as Cheryl  she had named her 3monthold daughter Tiffany after the star in her favorite soap opera  said her 24yearold boyfriend already the father of two other children begged her to have his child He told me it was a different kind of relationship with me she said Anyway she said by the time she was 16 she couldnt wait any longer Every time I saw a baby I wanted to hug it or play with it she recalled I took care of my brother when I was 7 years old  I changed his diaper fed him everything my mother would but she was at work Her grandmother cares for the baby during the week Cheryl and her mother take charge on weekends Hes paying off the ring and we have those plans she said of her and her boyfriends decision to be married At Jane Addams Mrs Black said she tried to explain to the girls that having children would keep them in poverty I tell them in a not very subtle way that this is a feminist issue she said that This will keep you in economic bondage  Like Edward A Reynolds the principal at West Side High School Mrs Black advocates clinics in the high schools that offer family planning along with more intensive and frequent sex education courses containing explicit information about birth control It has to be a course from day one from kindergarten on all the way through the curriculum she said Next Teenage fathers
PAPAL JOURNAL; AUSTRALIANS AT 'BARBIE' LIFT THEIR BEER TO JOHN PAUL,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/world/papal-journal-australians-at-barbie-lift-their-beer-to-john-paul.html,Pope John Paul II has been acclaimed in many ways in many places Today for the first time thousands of beer cans were hoisted high in his honor though not in his presence Most of us believe that alcohols a gift from God said the Rev Anthony Kain who organized the unusual churchsponsored love feast at which gallons of beer were downed after a papal mass in Adelaide Of course this sort of party is in the best Christian tradition said Father Kain who insisted it was a throwback to the agape love feasts conducted by early Christians The whole congregation at mass officially estimated at 183000 was invited to the giant barbie the traditional Australian Sunday barbecue About 40000 people not including the Pope turned up on a very hot sunny afternoon to lunch on grilled chops and sausages Father Kain and his party produced a lively controversy because the pinnies provided to the thirsty worshipers were not ordinary beer cans Beer With Papal Symbol In exchange for helping sponsor the picnic the South Australia Brewing Company emblazoned 100000 cans of its West End Export Lager with the official symbol of John Pauls Australian tour thus creating the firstever papal beer and a much soughtafter collectors item Justifying the deal Father Kain argued there was a historical link because the first Roman Catholic church in Adelaide was in a former brewery This left his critics unimpressed particularly those concerned that the church appeared to be condoning consumption of alcohol when alcoholism is a major problem among Australias 160000 aborigines In a televised debate in September the head of the Aboriginal Affairs Department Charles Perkins accused the church of taking blood money in the deal and asked Father Kain Why dont you get sponsorship from the cocaine and heroin dealers in Australia The Pope was unable to attend Father Kains barbeque because he had to fly here to Perth on the west coast where he said mass again and addressed a gathering of the aged on the last full day of his Australian visit At the mass here he called abortion an unspeakable crime and reiterated the churchs opposition to contraception and sterilization Early Monday he is scheduled to begin the trip back to Rome a voyage that will take 24 hours with a stopover in the Seychelles in the Indian Ocean Once the Pope is gone Australian church and Government officials will begin some careful accounting to figure out how much the visit cost and more important how to pay for it While the Government has not made the cost public the churchs initial budget called for a cash expenditure of about 35 million to be supplemented with 13 million worth of donated supplies No Shortage of Kitsch Two fundraising campaigns this year failed to meet their goals So the church hopes to net about 630000 from licensing contracts with the manufacturers of 110 official souvenirs ranging from teaspoons to big foamrubber hands of hope made for waving at the Pope One of the most popular items has been a Tshirt with the words Is the Pope a Catholic in bright lettering The usual question mark was omitted but a vendor at a mass in Brisbane was sure that it says it all With sales down by the end of the trip the price of the shirt had dropped from 10 to 650 as vendors tried to clear their stocks Glenn Wheatley a rock concert promoter who had a major role in the papal licensing deals bristled at the suggestions of excessive commercialism People say Jesus Christ never had sponsorships but he lived 1986 years ago he said The Pope rides in a bulletproof MercedesBenz Whos going to pay for that The Holy Father is generating a genuine amount of enthusiasm at the extremes said Ronald Conway one of Australias leading Catholic social critics Older conservative Catholics are attracted to the Popes message while the very young get a buzz from John Paul superstar Mr Conway said in an interview in his Melbourne home The problem lies with the big group in the middle the people now entering their 40s he said They are a likable hedonistic lot whom he has done nothing to budge It is that lot Mr Conway has studied extensively in books like The Great Australian Stupor and The Land of the Long Weekend John Paul made 35 speeches in Australia and Mr Conway said the impact had been diluted because he said too many things to too many people too briefly The ordinary people will be confused and will go back to what they were doing before he said It is sad but true that the fully secularized people are not going to kneel down and repent after watching the Pope on TV During his many hours in flight John Paul has been reading three books one in German by a Lutheran on ecumenism and two in Polish titled Theism and Analytical Philosophy and The Inspired Word Meanwhile the Vatican Secretary of State Agostino Cardinal Casaroli who would have made a very different kind of Pope was spied reading Frederick Forsythes The Devils Alternative John Paul almost left Australia without seeing a kangaroo But after he mentioned this omission on his schedule and after the photographers demanded the encounter local church officials arranged it quickly A pen was set up in a small park outside the Adelaide Festival Center where the Pope addressed a group of farmers today The handlers were worried because one of the three marsupials seemed spooked and hopped away whenever he was approached But when the Pope arrived the kangaroo stood still posed as if on cue and allowed the Pope a little petting They make their own judgments one of the Popes aides said The Pope had already given Australias koala bears their photo opportunity In Brisbane on Tuesday he visited a press center where 200 journalists were busy reporting on the arrest of a man who admitted he wanted to kill the Pope with the gasoline bombs he was carrying A horde of photographers and television crews formed a long line and the Pope holding one of the cuddly bears in his arms paraded down to the end and then back again Amid the clicking and flashing there were shouts of Down in front and Over here your Holiness Then the Pope made a speech in which he urged the journalists to realize your dignity He told them they had a responsibility not only to report good deeds but to encourage them
NOW AT 20: REASSESSMENT IN A NEW ERA,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/style/now-at-20-reassessment-in-a-new-era.html,The year was 1966 and the setting was a luncheon for the state commissions on the status of women in Washington A small group of women attending the event tried to propose a resolution calling for the enforcement of a law prohibiting sex discrimination in employment they were turned down One of them Betty Friedan scrawled on a paper napkin the words National Organization for Women and then the notation To take actions needed to bring women into the mainstream of American society now full equality for women in fully equal partnership with men Then we all put in 5 and went home to ask 10 other women to join us Ms Friedan recalled the other day Though the moment lacked fanfare she said we knew that we were doing something historic Tonight the organization which currently has 150000 members and 765 chapters will observe the 20th anniversary of its formation with a celebritystudded benefit at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion in Los Angeles The actual anniversary date was Oct 29 but the commemoration was postponed because of NOWs involvement with the national election campaign in which it helped defeat referendums against abortion in four states and campaigned for a state equal rights amendment in Vermont that did not pass As it moves into its third decade there is no doubt among friends and foes of the organization that it has been a towering presence in the struggle for womens rights and the spearhead for a significant social revolution It has defined the issues for women since the late 60s and has battled for solutions on the streets in the courts in legislatures classrooms and corporate offices Barriers Were Broken Ms Friedan said NOW went beyond our wildest dreams Our daughters take it for granted that they will play in the Little League that they can be astronauts and that they can run for President It broke through the barriers of explicit sex discrimination Elisabeth Griffith former Republican cochairman of the Womens Campaign and former vice chairman of the National Womens Political Caucus noted In the beginning there were no other such organizations so it attracted everybody who was angry It moved immediately into the vanguard set a broad agenda for a broad constituency and took on everything related to women from Playboy bunnies to demands for legislative change But NOW is also considered by knowledgeable observers inside and outside its ranks to be at a critical juncture in its history Only now is it recovering from the doldrums that followed the failure of the equal rights amendment to gain ratification in 1982 its major priority for years as well as from a divisive battle last year for the presidency of the organization No longer does it have one or two single issues around which to galvanize support no longer is it the only voice demanding equality for women How broadly  or narrowly  to focus its vision how best to campaign for its goals how much to rely on public demonstrations and how much on new approaches are questions that need to be resolved As Ms Griffith pointed out Most of the pieces of its original agenda have been taken on by other organizations dealing only with older women only with day care with welfare with pension rights The assumption about NOW is that it is having difficulty setting priorities determining which issues to focus on Some observers say that NOW has been so intent on such public issues as abortion rights job and pay equity and the equal rights amendment that it has failed to tackle in any comprehensive ways the kinds of problems women grapple with daily as they struggle to support children alone or with insufficient incomes to have children without jeopardizing their careers or to juggle needs of spouse children and community with little if any help from government or employers Some say it has not sufficiently addressed the particular concerns of minority women or in fact attracted them in significant numbers An Activist Agenda As Ruth B Mandel director of the Center for the American Woman and Politics at Rutgers University put it The biggest challenge NOW must confront is Who is the American woman of the 1980s and who is it that we are trying to represent We must rediscover her greatest needs and how to turn those needs into an activist agenda To those who contend that NOW has relegated family and child welfare issues to the back burner Eleanor Smeal its controversial and outspoken president said in a recent interview from Los Angeles where she was preparing for the anniversary celebration We have always been involved in the full range of child care and family issues in pregnancy leave issues in employment issues for lowerincome women To say that we have not always done so distorts the truth child care was in fact a part of our 1967 bill of rights For NOW to engage the next generation of leaders and activists women now in their 20s and 30s feeling is strong that it will certainly have to give these concerns a significant place on its agenda However it is not clear how many young women the organization is currently recruiting for no statistics on the ages of members are kept a spokesman said In the view of Lynn Hecht Schafran director of the NOW Legal Defense and Education Funds judicial education project the successes achieved by NOW and other organizations have made it inevitable that young women would be less involved Many people are dismayed by the fact that there are not more young women involved in clearly feminist activities Ms Schafran said But they dont need to be they are getting the education they want the initial jobs they want in their chosen professions at excellent salaries That is why we dont sense a burning need in young people At the lower end of the employment ladder Ms Schafran said Women in lowincome jobs those struggling to raise children alone or on meager incomes are also absent from the movement It has never occurred to me to become a member said Wanda Lucibello 30 years old an assistant district attorney in the Brooklyn District Attorneys office I feel a certain sense of personal accomplishment and satisfaction with my own position and with my own ways of dealing with feminist issues which dont seem to be as much of a problem as they used to be As an organization it doesnt seem to have relevancy to my life in particular Women now in their 20s and 30s feel they have gotten access to jobs and equal pay though of course the cause is not over nor is the fight According to Ms Smeal young women are not apathetic to the cause and in fact of the estimated 120000 participants in a NOW march for abortion rights in Washington early this year about onethird were college students NOW is conducting campaigns on 450 campuses to increase participation In the political sphere NOW must determine whether it intends to fit into or challenge the existing party system In its 20year life span the organization has become an increasingly influential political force and its lobbyists and 77 political action committees are taken seriously by members of Congress state legislators and other government officials as well as by candidates for office at all levels Asked to assess NOWs influence Ann Lewis former political director for the Democratic National Comittee and presently national director of Americans for Democratic Action said If I were running an issue referendum anywhere in the country I would try hard to get NOWs support because it translates into real volunteers and real commitment However because of the organizations tendency often though not always to endorse Democratic candidates and policies some observers view it as an arm of the Democratic Party Ruth Mandel explained The most visible and controversial example was the 1984 Presidential campaign which raised the question of whether NOW had become identified with one political party Ms Smeal disputed the conclusion that NOW had cast its political lot with the Democratic Party Neither party has ever given us high enough priority she said enumerating what she views as obstacles set up by both parties to keep women from running for office or from winning when they do run We are upset with both parties she continued and often when I speak people come up and quietly ask me Could we ever pull off our own political party That has increasingly become a strong undercurrent I do not say that I am for it but if I dont give voice to this feeling for a massive change in the rules and for a viable poltiical force who will Even hints of such a prospect are already arousing debate in the inner circles of NOW But meanwhile Ms Smeal who made an unprecedented return to the presidency of NOW after challenging her own handpicked successor Judy Goldsmith and who said she intended to run again next summer is generating internal controversy through efforts to bolster membership and lower the organizations debt now 15 million through direct mail campaigns As Noreen Connell president of NOW New York State which represents 34 chapters put it This is a period when not much is happening politically for women on a national level so it is a good time for us to think things through then fight them out
"Vendors: Good, Bad and Good-Bad",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/01/opinion/vendors-good-bad-and-good-bad.html,The most contentious issue in New York City is probably not capital punishment or abortion but street vendors On this issue however given a little patience its possible to achieve reasonable remedies because its possible to distinguish among vendors There are good vendors and bad vendors even goodbad vendors But so far the City Council and City Hall refuse to make and enforce the distinctions What are they afraid of Merchandise peddlers are for the most part bad vendors If confined to flea markets or traditional areas set aside for them like Columbus Avenue on summer nights they need not be bad But few peddlers are so disciplined Look down Fifth Avenue or even less soigne shopping streets and you see an array of cutrate scarves watches umbrellas gloves sold from blankets and cardboard boxes that clutter sidewalks already dense with shoppers Such peddlers interfering with traffic and blocking doorways to established stores perform no more service than parasites City Hall already has but hardly uses the power to limit their expropriation of public space for private gain A new city law might make regulation easier but the Council will not pass one until Mayor Koch shows hes strong enough to try running peddlers off with existing law Food vendors are for the most part good vendors A reasonable number of them belong in midtown They offer inexpensive fast food to those who prefer the economy and speed of hot dogs and falafel High rents have forced out most moderatepriced restaurants Food vendors cause trouble though when there are too many of them blocking movement on streets with heavy lunchtime pedestrian traffic A proposed new law would restrict each intersection to two food vendors at fixed locations That solution creates its own problem Which food vendors get the choicest locations The proposal calls for a lottery why not an auction But thats a detail the whole proposal lingers in a catatonic trance before the City Council Council members are still annoyed by the Mayors behavior last year First he asked the Council to enact a foodvendor bill then when he felt heat after the Council did that he vetoed the measure Members are reluctant to walk the plank again Hence the remedy for bad vendors and goodbad vendors depends on Mayor Koch As for the food vendors let him persuasively swear support for the measure pending in the City Council and reclaim the advocacy of willing members As for illegal sidewalk peddlers let the police remove them and confiscate their property Those merchandise peddlers are not poorbuthonest craftsmen selling artifacts because stodgy stores will not carry them They are part of a cynical rentfree retailing network supplied by truck Providing a common open space in which small tradesmen offer their wares is entirely practical as is proved by the citys public markets green markets and flea markets Other cities  Paris for instance  have stimulated such facilities gaining worldwide fame But few cities permit nontaxpaying tradesmen to set up shop in front of worldclass shops and milk the crowds attracted by renowned traditional merchants Let City Hall block the peddlers before they block everyone else
LIFE IN THE 30'S,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/03/garden/life-in-the-30-s.html,SEVERAL years ago I spent the day at a family planning clinic in one of New York Citys poorest neighborhoods I sat around a Formica table with a halfdozen 16yearold girls and listened with some amazement as they showed off their knowledge of human sexuality They knew how long sperm lived inside the body how many women out of 100 using a diaphragm were statistically likely to get pregnant and the medical term for the mouth of the cervix One girl pointed out all the parts of the female reproductive system on a placard another recited the stages of the ovulation cycle from day 1 to day 28 There was just one problem with this performance although the results of their laboratory tests would not be available for 15 minutes more every last one of them was pregnant I always think of that day when someone suggests that sex education at school is a big part of the answer to the problem of teenage pregnancy I happen to be a proponent of such programs I think human sexuality is a subject for dispassionate study like civics and ethics and dozens of other topics that have a moral component Id like my sons to know as much as possible about how someone gets pregnant how pregnancy can be avoided and what it means when avoidance techniques have failed I remember adolescence about as vividly as I remember anything however and I am not in the least convinced that that information alone will significantly alter the rate of teenage pregnancy It seemed to me that day in the clinic and on days I spent at schools and on street corners that teenage pregnancy has a lot more to do with what it means to be a teenager than with how someone gets pregnant When I was in high school at the tail end of the 60s there was a straightforward line on sex among my friends Boys could have it girls couldnt A girl who was not a virgin pretended she was A girl who was sleeping with her boyfriend no matter how longplaying the relationship pretended she was not It is the nature of adolescence that there is no past and no future only the present burning as fierce bright and merciless as a bare light bulb Girls had sex with boys because nothing seemed to matter except right now not pregnancy not parental disapprobation nothing but those minutes this dance that face those words Most of them knew that pregnancy could result but they assured themselves that they would be the lucky ones who would not get caught Naturally some of them were wrong and in my experience they did one of three things they went to Puerto Rico for a mysterious weekend trip visited an aunt in some faraway state for three months and came back with empty eyes and a vague reputation or got married quickly in Empirewaist dresses What seems to have changed most since then is that there is little philosophical counterpoint hypocritical or not to the raging hormones of adolescence and that so many of the oncehidden pregnancies are hidden no more Not long after the day at the family planning clinic I went to a public high school in the suburbs In the girls room was this graffito Jennifer Is a Virgin I asked the kids about it and they said it was shorthand for geek nerd weirdo somebody who was so incredibly out of it that they were in high school and still hadnt had sex If you were a virgin they told me you just lied about it so that no one would think you were that immature The girls in the family planning clinic told me much the same thing  that everyone did it that the boys wanted it that not doing it made them seem out of it The only difference really was that the girls in the clinic were poor and would have their babies and the girls in the high school were welltodo and would have abortions Pleasure didnt seem to have very much to do with sex for either group After she learned she was pregnant one of the girls at the clinic said without a trace of irony that she hoped childbirth didnt hurt as much as sex had Birth control was easily disposed of in both cases The pill the youngsters said could give you a stroke the IUD could make you sterile A diaphragm was disgusting One girl told me the funniest thing her boyfriend  a real original thinker  had told her they couldnt use condoms because it was like taking a shower with a raincoat on She was a smart girl and pretty and I wanted to tell her that it sounded as if she was sleeping with a jerk who didnt deserve her But that is the kind of basic fact of life that must be taught not in the classroom not by a stranger but at home by the family This is what finally I will try to teach my sons about sex after Ive explained fertile periods and birth control and all the other mechanics that are important to understand but never really go to the heart of the matter I believe I will say that when you sleep with someone you take off a lot more than your clothes
CATHOLICS MAY CUT CITY FOSTER CARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/04/nyregion/catholics-may-cut-city-foster-care.html,The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York has warned the Koch administration that because of a recent court agreement it is giving serious consideration to discontinuing the foster care it now provides to more than 3000 city youngsters The archdioceses opposition is not limited to one issue but it centers on the court requirement that foster children have meaningful access to familyplanning information services and counseling Under existing state and Federal laws and regulations teenagers receiving public assistance  which includes all children in foster care  cannot be deprived of contraception and abortion services Meeting at City Hall Msgr James J Murray of Catholic Charities the service arm of the archdiocese told the citys First Deputy Mayor Stanley Brezenoff about the archdioceses concerns at a City Hall meeting last week According to city officials and religious agencies he explained that barring a compromise the archdiocese planned to phase out the foster care it provides to up to 3200 children in group homes It would do so in the spring by not renewing city contracts that are to lapse June 30 If the archdiocese does that it could lose between 50 million and 60 million a year in Federal state and city funds and the city would either have to turn to other agencies or provide the foster care directly Mr Brezenoff has already asked officials in the citys Office of Special Services for Children to come up with contingency plans Since the City Hall meeting on Nov 25 Mr Brezenoff and Mayor Koch have been trying to find a way to keep the archdioceses services But administration officials and a lawyer for the organization that brought the original lawsuit say it will be difficult to reach a compromise There is no way out of it said Marcia Robinson Lowry director of the Childrens Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union which brought the suit that led to the court agreement Services are either going to be provided or not I dont think the city can go any further than it has Ms Lowry argued that in a sense the stipulation was already a compromise because it did not require Catholic agencies to provide any teachings they found morally offensive Instead the agreement says outside agencies can provide the familyplanning counseling to children under the care of religious agencies So sensitive is the situation now that no member of the administration or official of the archdiocese will discuss it on the record The Mayor eager to keep the churchs service and to avoid a confrontation with John Cardinal OConnor issued a statement through his press office It is of course our hope that ways can be found where we can carry out our obligations under state and Federal law and the Constitution and they can carry out their mission under Gods law because that result is in the best interest of the children whom we both serve the statement said Decision Under Review A spokesman for the archdiocese Msgr Peter Finn said The court decision is under review Eventually there is something to be said But now there is nothing to be said Bishop Joseph T OKeefe vicar general of the archdiocese and deputy to the Cardinal did not return telephone calls seeking comment About 4000 of the citys 17000 foster children are in Catholic agencies that come under the auspices of the New York Archdiocese and about 60 percent of the 4000 are cared for in group homes The rest are living with foster parents The archdiocese has no plans to stop placing children in individual homes just in group homes The court stipulation issued Oct 8 settled a 13yearold lawsuit that challenged the citys method of placing fostercare children in foster agencies In the past Catholic children were placed with Catholic agencies Jewish children with Jewish agencies and so on The suit charged that black children who are Protestant were suffering discrimination Under the settlement to be made final by the end of this month the city has agreed to place children in fostercare agencies without regard to race or religion So under the settlement Protestant children will be placed with Catholic agencies Catholc children with Jewish agencies and so on Main Tenet of Stipulation The main tenet of the stipulation approved by Judge Robert J Ward of Federal District Court in Manhattan is that fostercare agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on children in their care The agreement specifies that all children in foster care must have meaningful access to the full range of familyplanning information services and counseling Among the other matters covered in the agreement are that each agency has to provide comparable opportunities for children to practice their religion that the agencies cannot require children to attend religious observances and that the agencies cannot display excessive religious symbols Objections to Agreement Officials of the New York Archdiocese have indicated their general objections to the agreement as have other religious fostercare agencies Some mayoral advisers said yesterday that officials of the archdiocese were frustrated by what they viewed as interference in the churchs ability to run its agencies as it sees fit So far other religious fostercare agencies have not indicated how they will deal with the stipulation Frank DeRosa a spokesman for the Diocese of Brooklyn which is independent of the New York Archdiocese said he was unaware of any decision about the stipulation Jerome M Goldsmith executive vice president of the Jewish Board of Family and Children Services called the agreement highly unsatisfactory but said his organization which runs several fostercare institutions had not yet decided how to proceed This is not the first time the Koch administration has come up against the churchstate issue Cardinal OConnor has in the past objected to a mayoral executive order banning job discrimination against homosexuals arguing that the church did not discriminate but that it had a right to hire and fire as it saw fit Last May in a lawsuit now pending a former employee of a Catholic fostercare agency affiliated with the New York Archdiocese charged that she was dismissed from her job because she refused to prevent teenagers from using birth control The former employee Diane Arneth contends that the agency  the Mission of the Immaculate Virgin on Staten Island  violates the same state and Federal laws incorporated in the new court stipulation The new stipulation will be made final by the end of the month The agencies have the option according to several lawyers of fighting it in court withdrawing their services or accepting the agreement and abiding by it

PACT TO CURB FOSTER CARE UPSETS KOCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/05/nyregion/pact-to-curb-foster-care-upsets-koch.html,Mayor Koch yesterday took issue with a court stipulation on foster care  an agreement that his administration has already accepted The same court agreement is so strongly opposed by the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York that church officials have threatened to discontinue some of the foster care that Catholic agencies currently provide rather than comply with it The stipulation states that agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on children in their care and lays out a number of regulations  among them that they must give foster children access to familyplanning information services and counseling Over all the agreement states that religious agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on children in their care Koch Says Stipulation Is Bad Calling the stipulation bad the Mayor said the city had agreed to it because the alternative a court fight would probably have been worse and have led to a ban on religious agencies providing any publicly financed foster care But Mr Koch said he understood the archdioceses position and was sympathetic to it They see a movement where they are helping that they are required to be totally secular that everything that they do is attacked as wrong because it has a religious element in it the Mayor said at a City Hall news conference I dont agree with those people who want to take the religious element out of these agencies that are providing services The director of the Childrens Rights Project of the American Civil Liberties Union Marcia Robinson Lowry called the Mayors remarks offensive These agencies have children of other religions in them she said If people are concerned about religion they ought to be concerned about everybodys right to pracice their own religion and not have religion imposed on them Youre talking about the things that made people leave England and come to this country The citys Corporation Counsel Frederick A O Schwarz Jr yesterday defended the court stipulation which he helped negotiate City Lawyer Calls Pact Fair He said We believed it was the best way to comply with our obligations under the Constitution and under the law that it was fair and that failing to make an agreement of this sort a court would have held that it was not lawful to do business with religious agencies he said Asked if he considered it a bad agreement Mr Schwarz said No I believe it was a legal necessity but I would not have entered into it if I did not believe it was fair The Mayor insisted that he and Mr Schwarz the citys top lawyer did not disagree The court stipulation issued Oct 8 settled a 13yearold lawsuit which asseted that Protestant black children were suffering discrimination because the city placed children in fostercare agencies based on their religious beliefs Excessive Religious Symbols Under the stipulation children will no longer be placed automatically in fostercare agencies based on their religion In addition to the requirements for familyplanning information the agencies cannot display excessive religious symbols and cannot require children to attend religious services The archdiocese is most concerned about the familyplanning requirement because it means children receiving publiclyfinanced foster care cannot be deprived of contraceptives and abortion services The archdiocese  which cares for about 4000 fostercare children in the city 2400 of them in group homes has told the administration it is seriously considering phasing out its group care The city would then have to find alternative services for 2400 children and the church would lose 50 million to 60 million a year in Federal state and city funds Some social advocates said they did not believe the threat was real They said yesterday that officials of the archdiocese might be using this opportunity to put pressure on the city at a time when the number of foster children is growing and the city needs its help Mayor Koch disagreed pointing out that the archdiocese contributes 30 million a year to foster care

WASHINGTON TALK: CONGRESS; Positions of the Probable Speaker Can Be Volatile,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/us/washington-talk-congress-positions-of-the-probable-speaker-can-be-volatile.html,Representative Jim Wright of Texas who is expected to become Speaker of the House when Congress convenes in January has the reputation of a moderate conservative and his voting record over his 22 years in the House generally reflects this bent But on a number of issues he has changed his position through his career displaying a certain volitility He has switched on civil rights the MX missile abortion nerve gas and military spending The changes indicate it could be difficult to predict how Mr Wright as Speaker will act on some issues The Speaker usually does not vote but his role in controlling the flow of legislation can have a vast influence on the outcome in the House Mr Wrights voting ratings by various groups also reflect his volitility In 1968 Americans for Democratic Action a liberal organization reported that he sided with it on key issues 25 percent of the time That figure fell to 19 percent in 1972 rose to 70 percent in 1983 and then dropped back to 50 percent in 1985 Mr Wright has fallen from favor with the conservative American Security Council which is concerned with military issues He won a 100 percent rating in 1972 and 1974 and an 89 percent rating in 1982 But in 1984 he fell to 40 percent and this year to 13 percent Here is a summary of his votes on some important issues Civil Rights Mr Wright at first voted against the Civil Rights Act of 1957 when it was approved in the House but then voted for the conference committees final bill which went to the President The act the first civil rights law enacted by Congress since 1875 created a commission on civil rights and allowed the Attorney General to seek injunctions to keep people from being deprived of their right to vote He also voted for the Civil Rights Act of 1960 which allowed the appointment of voting referees to help blacks register and vote But he voted against the farreaching Civil Rights Act of 1964 a vote he recently said he now regrets That bill guaranted access to public accommodations and allowed the Government to sue to desegregate public

CHURCH DIRECTIVE ON SPEAKERS IS QUESTIONED,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/nyregion/church-directive-on-speakers-is-questioned.html,A prominent monsignor in the Archdiocese of New York has written an article in an influential Roman Catholic magazine that strongly questions the archdioceses policy of discouraging speaking engagements by people who differ with church teachings Msgr Harry J Byrne who was a chancellor of the archdiocese from 1968 to 1970 under Terence Cardinal Cooke and is now the pastor of Epiphany Church at 239 East 21st Street warned that the policy could revive the belief that Catholic politicians cannot be trusted to remain independent from their church The monsignor said that before the 1960 election of John F Kennedy as the nations first Catholic President many Americans believed that the church would pressure Catholic politicians to enact Catholic positions into civil law For churchmen to cross the line between on the one hand instructing and informing conscience and on the other hand trying to force a legislative position on an officeholder by a speakers ban is a very dangerous political game Monsignor Byrne wrote It can result in the nonelectability of Catholics Monsignor Byrne said he believes his stance represents the views of a segment of the archdioceses about 800 priests although he could not say how large of a segment Archdioceses Directive Challenged The monsignors article Thou Shall Not Speak was the cover story of the Dec 6 issue of America the Jesuit magazine It challenges a directive that was issued Aug 18 by Bishop Joseph T OKeefe the archdioceses vicar general The directive was criticized by Governor Cuomo who became embroiled in a public argument with archdiocesan officials Governor Cuomo a Catholic who is personally opposed to abortion has supported Medicaid funding for abortions so that poor women would not be discriminated against in obtaining a widely available medical procedure The Church has opposed such funding The OKeefe directive sent to the archdioceses priests said Great care and prudence must be exercised in extending invitations to individuals to speak at parish sponsored events eg Communion breakfasts graduations meetings of parish societies etc It is not only inappropriate it is unacceptable and inconsistent with diocesan policy to invite those individuals to speak at such events whose public position is contrary to and in opposition to the clear unambiguous teaching of the Church Responding to Monsignor Byrnes position Bishop OKeefe said that he had not read the article He said in an interview that he had never banned anybody and had urged only that care and prudence must be exercised for a speaker which is a pretty logical position Catholic politicians he said were not beholden to the Church any more than a Jewish candidate is to a rabbi This is the United States of America Bishop OKeefe and Monsignor Byrne are friends and according to Monsignor Byrne they talked about the issue before the article was written Monsignor Byrne said he had also discussed the issue with John Cardinal OConnor who has endorsed the directive I dont think there will be any repercussions the 65yearold monsignor said yesterday I didnt do it to polarize Its a discussion in the family I think in a family you can have differences on various items and these differences become subject to discussion and study In the four and a half page article the monsignor who as one of two chancellors was the archdioceses supervisor of housing job and racial justice projects argued that the directive raised many questions about how it might work For example he wrote it was not clear whether the directive could apply to nonCatholics such as Mayor Koch who differs with church policy on the rights of homosexuals or to a Unitarian minister who rejects Catholic concepts about the Trinity but wants to speak to a Catholic audience only about housing problems Partial Excommunication In light of such ambiguities Monsignor Byrne suggested it appeared that the archdiocesan policy had been aimed only at Catholic politicians Thus the impression has been created that Catholic politicians are expected to enunciate and vote Catholic positions and failure to do so is followed by ecclesiastical punishment A ban on speaking Monsignor Byrne said in the article was a sort of partial excommunication that violated the Second Vatican Councils Declaration on Religious Freedom That declaration said no one is to be forced to act against his conscience nor kept from acting according to his conscience privately or publicly Monsignor Byrne in the interview said he opposed Mr Cuomos position on Medicaid funding for abortion but felt that he should nonetheless be permitted to speak to church audiences He also noted that in its effort to put pressure on politicians the Catholic church was no different from fundamentalist Protestant or Jewish groups When proIsrael legislation is at stake he said Jewish leaders place the same kind of pressure on the conscience of legislators Bishop OKeefe has said he would not invite Governor Cuomo to speak at his parish One politician State Assemblyman John Dearie of the Bronx has been told by his parish St Raymond that he would not be allowed to speak at parish events although that ban took effect before the issuance of the directive
ADOPTION ALSO A CHOICE IN TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/06/opinion/adoption-also-a-choice-in-teen-age-pregnancy.html,To the Editor We were pleased to see Planned Parenthoods fullpage ad Nov 18 because we agree that the crisis of teenage pregnancy requires national leaders to take considered action Unfortunately the first paragraph limited the discussion to deciding between abortions or dropping out of school leaving home or becoming dependent on welfare and overlooked the adoption decision Adoption can hardly be a decision teenagers consider if society  and molders of public opinion like Planned Parenthood  do not recognize it A million teenagers pregnant out of wedlock are a national crisis and we need to focus on the problems related to that crisis But lets also keep in mind some of the solutions especially adoption if were really serious about a balanced debate and informed choice WILLIAM L PIERCE President Natl Committee for Adoption Washington Nov 18 1986
"SINGAPORE DECIDES IT WANTS LOTS OF CHILDREN, AFTER ALL",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/weekinreview/singapore-decides-it-wants-lots-of-children-after-all.html,LIKE many developing countries Singapore in the early 1970s instituted population control Boy or girl two is enough was the slogan and officials warned that the island country would run out of room if population growth was not curbed Now they say the policy may have succeeded too well Singapore has become one of the first countries outside the industrialized world whose birth rate has declined below replacement levels In reaction to that development it appears to be the first to switch from officially discouraging large families to actively promoting them People may laugh and say Ha ha look at what Singapore is doing now  said Yeo Cheow Tung Minister of State for Health but when we look at the data its a horrendous problem And its the role of a responsible government to plan for the future The little citystate of 25 million people is often admired  or ridiculed  because of the extent to which it tries to plan ahead In many respects it has been wildly successful An island with no natural resources has in one generation become wealthier as measured by per capita income than Ireland Spain or Israel Visitors sometimes complain however that Singaporeans are too docile and obedient to the wishes of the Government The campaign to increase the birth rate is likely to provide a new test of their obedience Young people seem less inclined than their parents to bend their personal lives to Government decree Whether I have two kids or three kids doesnt depend on what the Government says said Cora De Conceicao a restaurateur who is engaged to be married soon It depends on whether I can continue with my career That is the general consensus of couples nowadays Another young woman a civil servant was even more blunt Having babies is a nuisance she said You want to buy a new pair of shoes or a new gown and instead you have to save money for a child Reflecting such attitudes the reproduction rate has plunged In 1957 women had an average of 64 children in 1970 31 and last year just 16  well under the 2plus rate necessary to keep the population stable The country is still growing because most people are young and in their reproductive years But at present rates the population will reach a peak early in the next century then shrink rapidly as the young people of today die leaving fewer descendants The Government of Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew warns that this would hamper the countrys defenses Moreover a much smaller number of wageearners would be available to support those who have retired A Role for Matchmakers The campaign does not mention it but fertility levels differ by ethnic group The reproductive rate of the dominant Chinese 77 percent of the population is well below replacement level Indians a 6 percent minority are slightly below replacement level and Malays who account for 15 percent of the population are a bit above it The present trend if continued would reduce Chinese dominance and increase the proportion of Malays Mr Yeo who like most officials is Chinese acknowledged the ethnic factor but said this was of secondary importance All families not just ethnic Chinese are being encouraged to have more children he said The campaign involves several approaches It is playing a wellpublicized role as matchmaker for high school and college graduates Matchmaking agencies run parties dances and weekend retreats in the hope of finding spouses for the large number of collegeeducated women who remain unmarried a higher proportion than in the United States officials say Economic incentives also may be tried The tax system was amended in the 1970s to discourage large families abortion was legalized and contraceptives made available Now tax penalties will probably be removed and abortion may be curtailed And Government housing can be arranged so that parents can live near their adult children making it easier for grandparents to care for infants during the day Singapore and similar rapidly developing countries face some of the same economic problems as the United States where fertility is below replacement levels but high immigration keeps the population rising Taiwan South Korea and other rapidly industrializing countries may also have to encourage population growth Fertility rates in Singapore sank below the replacement level in 1975 although this attracted little attention at first In Taiwan the rates fell to replacement level this year and South Korea is about to be in the same position Singapore officials cite surveys suggesting that women still would like to have two or three children if it were not for the inconvenience and the effect on their careers The Government hopes that by reducing these obstacles Singapores efforts will succeed where Western countries have failed If we can reverse the fertility decline said Paul Cheung a demographer at the National University of Singapore well be the first country to do so
Men and Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/magazine/l-men-and-abortion-714986.html,Michael Blumenthals article comes closer to explicit details of abortion than anything I have seen If pornography in all forms can be tolerated then more accurate descriptions of the emotional and physical aspects of abortion should be available to influence teenage and adult attitudes toward promiscuous sex ERNEST ULMER New York City
MEN And Abortion,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/magazine/l-men-and-abortion-748286.html,In his article The Clinic About Men Nov 2 what is it that Michael Blumenthal refers to when he says he is learning    something of what it means to be a man Is it learning to feel ones age Is it realizing regrets about ones own life Or perhaps it is frustration at being placed at the periphery of difficult personal decisions of others we may care about If these are the things the author has learned they are not part of what it means to be a man but rather part of what it means to be alive By taking his feelings of frustration distance and regret and attaching them to the process of becoming a man the author places manhood and abortion in a conflict that as a man I find inaccurate and dangerous The issues Mr Blumenthal discusses are real and important but they should not be resolved or defined through a womans procreative choice The friend who needs an abortion does not need the additional burden of the authors hopes and regrets GARY ELKIN Brookline Mass

IDEAS & TRENDS; Catholics May Curtail Child Care,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/07/weekinreview/ideas-trends-catholics-may-curtail-child-care.html,The Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York which has often clashed with the city over issues of doctrine and legality may cut back its foster care services rather than comply with a court order requiring among other things that children be given meaningful access to birth control The warning of such a move by the archdiocese delivered to the Koch administration two weeks ago was its first reaction to a Federal District Court settlement Oct 8 stipulating that the city must place children in foster care agencies without regard to race or religion and that the agencies cannot impose their religious beliefs on the 17000 children in their care The decision resolved a 13yearold suit that contended the system was unfair to black Protestant children Among other things the agencies will not be able to deprive teenagers of the right to obtain birth control pills or abortions As many as 2400 children cared for in group homes might be affected and the archdiocese stands to lose between 50 million and 60 million a year in Federal state and local funds The church has no plans however to stop placing about 1600 children with individual families Mayor Koch who called the stipulation bad said the city agreed to it to avoid a court fight But the citys Corporation Counsel Frederick A O Schwarz Jr who helped negotiate the settlement said it was fair and the best way to comply with our obligations under the Constitution and under the law
U.S. COUNCIL URGES BIRTH CONTROL TO COMBAT TEEN-AGE PREGNANCIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/10/us/us-council-urges-birth-control-to-combat-teen-age-pregnancies.html,Contraceptives should be distributed free or at low cost to teenagers to combat the problem of teenage pregnancy the National Research Council said today The council also said in a report that teenagers should be encouraged to seek parental consent for abortions but not required to do so The report by the council a Congressionally chartered organization that is the working arm of the National Academy of Sciences was based on a twoyear study by a panel of outside experts including doctors public health experts sociologists and demographers Aggressive Public Education It concluded that the birth control pill was the safest and most effective contraceptive for sexually active teenagers and recommended aggressive public education to dispel myths about health risks for young women who use the pill The report also supported further trials of schoolbased contraceptive clinics to attack the teenage pregnancy problem a proposal denounced once again by Secretary of Education William J Bennett The report advocated moreover that condoms should be widely distributed in places where teenage boys congregate and that new methods for distributing the pill should be explored Dr Daniel D Federman a professor of medicine at Harvard Medical School and chairman of the councils Panel on Adolescent Pregnancy and Childbearing which produced the report said a million teenage girls in the United States become pregnant each year and almost half of them give birth No Coherent Policy A 15yearold American girl is at least five times more likely to give birth than are her foreign contemporaries the study said but there has been no coherent policy to deal with the issue Teenage mothers and their infants are at high risk for health complications Dr Federman said Teenage parents have severely limited career opportunities and are more likely to become dependent on public assistance Societys economic burden in maintaining these families is substantial an estimated 166 billion in Federal outlays for Aid to Dependent Children Medicaid and food stamps alone in 1985 he said Of even greater significance are the costs to those young people in lost opportunities Mr Bennett in criticizing the recommendations about schoolbased clinics said This is not the first time a prestigioussounding group has advocated a dumb policy  schoolbased birth control clinics  that will damage our schools and our children Im sure this group had good intentions I just wish it had more wisdom and common sense In the past Mr Bennett has argued that schoolbased clinics might encourage children who are not sexually active to become so and has said they tend to legitimate the very behavior whose natural consequences they intend to discourage The National Research Council includes members of the National Academy of Sciences the National Academy of Engineering and the Institute of Medicine Founded in 1916 the council serves as the research agency for the National Academy of Sciences and the National Academy of Engineering The report Risking the Future Adolescent Sexuality Pregnancy and Child Bearing cost 600000 and was sponsored by five foundations the Ford Foundation Rockefeller Foundation the William and Flora Hewlett Foundation the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation and the Charles Stewart Mott Foundation A spokesman for the council Rick Borchelt said the foundations commissioned the study and not any branch of the Government He said that beyond distributing the report the council had no plans for any followup activities The study director Cheryl D Hayes said however that in addition to the 337page report issued today the panel would publish a second volume containing statistical information and working papers early next year She noted that while the report had no Federal sponsor the panel had provided advance briefings for Dr Otis R Bowen Secretary of Health and Human Services and for the Presidents Science Adviser Dr William Graham They said they found it interesting and would take it into consideration Ms Hayes said Panel Said to Be Diverse Group She explained that members of the panel had been selected by the governing board of the National Research Council on the basis of scientific expertise not ideological perspective and represented a broadly diverse group balanced for geography race sex and age The report was done independent of any outside influence and there were no coercive efforts by any sponsors she said It went throught the academys formal review process without being subject to the influence of any political agenda or ideological perspective She added that the report was intended as a broad assessment of what we know about effective strategies to deal with the problem Dr Federman said the panel had examined existing data and conducted new analyses of previous research in an effort to review what is known We werent asked to talk about the issue and put a policy together he said We were asked to look at information and the facts and see what the review generated What we found is that there is no need to strike in the dark If we develop a national consensus the means to make things better exists Those means the panel found include better sex education with information on contraception more readily available contraceptives and access to abortion for teenagers who want it and need it Group Assails Report In criticizing the report today a spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee said the sponsoring foundations had all contributed to proabortion causes and the groups president Dr John C Willke said the study was fatally flawed by its pervasive proabortion bias This is a major proabortion document designed by abortionfunding foundations to use as a tool in their continuous efforts to influence public policy on the abortion issue said Dr Willke The cooperation of the National Research Council in such a partisan effort raises serious questions about that organizations current goals Ms Hayes she did not know whether the foundations sponsors had contributed to proabortion causes as Dr Willke asserted The executive director of the National Abortion Federation Barbard Radford said however that with society making it harder and harder for teenagers to have abortions the report came as great news Teenagers have the greatest difficulty obtaining abortions because of parental consent and notification requirements that vary from state to state she added Use of Contraceptives Is Urged Sexually active teenagers both boys and girls need the ability to avoid pregnancy and the motivation to do so Dr Federman said Early regular and effective contraceptive use results in fewer unintended pregnancies He said there was little evidence to support the view that the availability of contraceptives encourages early sexual activity Adoption services should be strengthened it said as well as services for girls who choose to keep their babies Copies of the report are available for 2195 from the National Academy

The U.N. Population Fund Needs the U.S.,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/13/opinion/the-un-population-fund-needs-the-us.html,United Nations members  developed and developing countries representing the spectrum of political and religious thought  last month pledged a record of nearly 140 million in 1987 contributions to the United Nations Fund for Population Activities Regrettably the United States which for 17 years had been the largest contributor was conspicuously absent from the list of donors The United States Agency for International Development announced in August that it would not participate It claimed that the Fund supports or participates in the management of a program of coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in China By withdrawing the United States has abandoned its leadership in an area of technical assistance it helped found The absence of its contribution will hurt population programs that the Fund supports in 134 countries The Agency for International Developments allegation is unfounded Ironically after two separate reviews of the Funds familyplanning assistance AID itself concluded that the Fund does not include coercive abortion or involuntary sterilization in its program in China or anywhere else Moreover the program in China has been approved twice by the Funds Governing Council of which the United States is a member The Fund does not in policy or practice support abortion anywhere Coercion is at odds with the principles and purposes of United Nations familyplanning efforts The Fund is explicitly charged with helping countries provide the information and means for every individual and couple to decide freely on the number and spacing of children The Funds assistance to China has included technical support for its 1982 census the largest population enumeration in history contraceptive supplies administrative training and population education At about 10 million annually the Funds program amounts to less than 1 percent of the 1 billion China devotes to its population efforts Even if Fund support amounted to a much larger proportion of the national program as it does in many developing countries the Fund is not equipped legally or otherwise to participate in managing any countrys program It closely monitors the outlays of money it provides but program management is solely the recipient governments prerogative Last months financial show of suppor for the Fund reaffirms the international communitys recognition of the strategic role of population planning in development However even the nearly 140 million pledged for next year falls far short of what the organization needs to meet the developing countries requirements for assistance Not long ago the plight of droughtafflicted subSaharan African countries where starvation was widespread made headlines Generous efforts and timely rains have mitigated the great suffering for now But without sustained longterm action a repetition of the disasters is inevitable Throughout Africa it is finally acknowledged that longterm answers must include attention to population growth  currently well above 3 percent annually in many countries A United States contribution would allow the Fund to respond more adequately to increasing African needs The Fund does not advocate any single approach to solving population problems It helps all developing countries irrespective of whether they have policies for the increase or decrease of fertility To help countries reach their own goals the Fund provides support for family planning including natural family planning mother and child health care research for safer more effective contraceptive methods education on population issues and censustaking and data analysis The Funds many successes should be put in perspective toward the middle of 1987 the worlds population will reach five billion it will reach six billion before the end of the century The United States vision and support helped launch the United Nations population assistance program 17 years ago Some of todays controversies will fade but the need for global efforts to address population problems will never be more urgent or more timely Population programs can be made more effective with full participation by the United States
ADDRESSING NEEDS OF 'AT RISK' PUPILS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/nyregion/addressing-needs-of-at-risk-pupils.html,WHEN students drop out observed Marie Ramirez executive director of the Center for Multinational and Comparative Education in Albany what do they drop into Drugs alcohol prostitution and crime Our most recent statistics on the relationship of alcohol to substance use among secondary students paints a very gloomy picture for the future of our youth When we look at students enrolled in grades seven through 12 we find that 40 percent or 601000 have used alcohol 8 percent or 122000 kids have used drugs and alcohol and 25 percent or 382000 have used both in combination destroying their lives  that is a slow form of suicide Ms Ramirez shared these statistics with about 200 school administrators during this years annual Superintendents Dinner sponsored by the Association of Women Administrators in Westchester The education official was the main speaker at the dinner which was held at the Mariott Hotel in Tarrytown Ms Ramirez a member of the National Committee on Youth Suicide Prevention and the Governors Task Force on Domestic Violence emphasized the need for guidance and counseling programs at the elementaryschool level to identify atrisk students early and help them begin to deal with a variety of complex issues that may be affecting them Among the issues she cited were poverty divorce the rise in singleparent households homelessness and teenage pregnancy She said todays youths are facing increasing pressures at earlier ages as a result of changes in society and in the family structure Referring to the 1980 census she said it showed that 17 percent of our Kthrough12 school population in the state or approximately 617000 children live in poverty Think of the needs of these children for adequate health care nutrition clothing housing and emotional support at home and at school In our state she continued we had over 10000 births last year by girls between the ages of 10 and 16 and 37000 abortions for girls ages 11 to 19 What enormous problems the young mothers face They are trying to deal with their own sexuality their own femininity their own persona at the same time theyre trying to develop parenting skills essential for nurturing their own children Directly addressing the administrators the former nun and teacher then asked How free are you as caring and concerned adults to spend time with the atrisk students in your schools to be more responsive and sensitive to their problems Ms Ramirez told the audience that she had become aware of the need for expanded guidance services for students while participating in a study on the condition of counseling programs in American schools The twoyear study and subsequent report entitled Keeping the Options Open was authorized by the College Board in 1984 and was carried out by the boards Commission on PreCollegiate Guidance and Counseling of which Ms Ramirez is a member We traveled throughout the country she recalled and held dialogues with parents students teachers counselors administrators schoolboard members and college admissions officers In every region we heard the same story concern about test scores in math and the sciences but at the same time the realization that there is no state reference point to indicate how students feel about themselves All these people know is that there are students in their schools who are hurting She said that to ask these students to wait for help until they get to high school was to offer too little too late What they need is early identification and intervention she said and closer communication between home and school between parents teachers and counselors Ms Ramirez who is a native of Puerto Rico and served on President Carters Hispanic Advisory Board said she had focused on the specific needs of pupils at risk and homeless children in New York in two reports she helped prepare for the Board of Regents one while in her present job and the other as a former assistant commissioner for general education The first report she said led to legislation passed this year that will provide more state aid to school districts for increased services in guidance and counseling The other outlined the educational needs of homeless children and urged support for a bill introduced by Senator Mary B Goodhue from Mount Kisco that would insure education and school tranportation for students from homeless families In an interview before the dinner Ms Ramirez who called her address The REAL Nation at Risk in order to dramatize the plight of pupils at risk said she felt recent national reports on education had failed to recognize that more is not better and that increasing standards will not take care of the different kinds of human needs these kids have
NEW JERSEY OPINION; FAMILY LIFE: LET TRENTON PUT ITS MONEY WHERE ITS MANDATE IS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-family-life-let-trenton-put-its-money-where-its-mandate-is.html,STATE officials legislators and the State Board of Education recently received some very important newsA poll taken in October by the independent polling firm of Penn and Schoen Associates of New York City showed sex education in the schools is now a consensus issue because it is supported by over 90 percent of New Jerseyans If this finding does not provide a sense of satisfaction to those who were involved in the passage of a requirement for familylife education in all public schools then they should consider these poll results  Sixtyeight percent recognized that familylife education was a required subject a tribute to those portions of the policy involving parents and community members in its development  Ninetyfive percent agreed that with diseases like AIDS sex eduction is more important than ever But what may come as a surprise to these policymakers and to supporters of the state requirement including the New Jersey Catholic Conference is another poll result 60 percent of New Jerseyans believe that the state should put more resources into sexeducation programs Of all the poll results this last is the most exciting and presents the greatest potential To date neither the executive nor legislative branches of government has appropriated any significant resources for familylife education The reality is that New Jersey has done absolutely nothing since it enacted the policy in 1980 and readopted it in 1985 to put its money where its mandate is Therefore with some 60 percent of New Jerseyans favoring the expenditure of more resources for the fledgling programs decisionmakers should have the impetus and the confidence to create a secondstage agenda to strengthen and enrich the program It is understandable that in the first few years following the passage of the controversial regulation politicians would be cautious about voting sizable resources After all New Jersey was only one of three states and the first state since 1970 to adopt such a curriculum requirement In many respects New Jersey education leaders thanks to the earlywarning system of a former Health Commissioner were prophets on the issue of preventing adolescent pregnancy and parenting They saw before their counterparts in other states the need to provide children and adolescents with timely and comprehensive information about sexuality and family issues to protect them from the dangers and consequences of tooearly sexual activity and pregnancy In the last few years child advocates in other states have caught up with New Jersey They were awakened to the seriousness of the problem by the publication in 1985 of a report by the Alan Guttmacher Institute revealing that the United States had higher numbers of teenage pregnancies births and abortions than most western European nations The conclusions were based on the numbers of pregnancies births and abortions to white teenagers alone The reasons for the disparity between United States statistics and those of economic and culturally comparable European nations include the lack of uniform sexeducation programs in the schools and of convenient lowcost health services for sexually active adolescents The activities of other organizations also drew the attention of state policymakers In Washington the Childrens Defense Fund the leading national childadvocacy organization undertook a fiveyear initiative to prevent adolescent pregnancy another Washingtonbased organization the Center for Population Options provided research that showed that the adolescent pregnancy problem was costing the United States more than 16 billion every year All this attention resulted in the establishment of task forces on adolescent pregnancy pregnant and parenting youth in many states including Massachusetts New York South Carolina Texas North Carolina and Missouri as well as in the District of Columbia Almost all the task forces recommended extending sexeducation programs in the schools and advocated resources for them Because of their farsightedness New Jersey policymakers received praise for their action of 1980 Lately however they have been criticized for failing to support the policy with resources The Childrens Defense Fund in a recent publication Preventing Adolescent Pregnancy What Schools Can Do called New Jerseys policy a model but then went on to say that the states Department of Education had failed to provide funds to assure widespread training for familylife education teachers Recommendations for what policymakers need to undertake next have come from other directions as well After studying the implementation of the mandate in six districts Lana D Muraskin former director of research for the National Association of State Boards of Education wrote in Creating and Implementing FamilyLife Education in New Jersey Schools If familylife education is not to become one more program that caught the brief attention of state officials and then disappeared I recommend that they consider allocating state funds and implementing these suggestions Ms Muraskin then recommended state funds for  Provision of workshops of sufficient length to build local expertise among teachers  Establishment of a recognition program to highlight exemplary practices  Provision of program expansion in communities with high rates of adolescent pregnancy and parenthood  Creation of an overall program of small grants to districts on a competitive basis to improve teachers skills and childrens learning Closer to home another recently issued report also addresses the need for more state funds for teacher training In No Easy Answers A Blueprint for Action in Working with Pregnant and Parenting Adolescents and Those at Risk published by the Association for the Children of New Jersey and the New Jersey Network on Adolescent Pregnancy the authors Louise Murray and MaryEllen Mess recommend that opportunities for teacher training be expanded and that familylife education teachers be financially supported so they can upgrade their teaching skills in human sexuality child and adolescent development and family dynamics The report also urges that the Division of Family Planning in the states Department of Health receive specific financing so that it can expand training opportunities for school staff on a county or regional basis Two small nongovernmental organizations have been taking a stab at defining a secondstage agenda and assisting teachers They are the New Jersey Network for Family Life Education which represents more than 40 statewide organizations that back the mandate and the Center for Family Life Education of Planned Parenthood of Bergen County On their own they have begun initiatives using private foundation grants Efforts include annual conferences mailing current materials and a minigrant awards program for teachers of family life in Grades K6 Both could do more if they could apply for state funds But state education leaders have not yet directly responded to these suggestions for resources for familylife education The Department of Education will soon make available a new publication to school districts Family Life Education Selected Programs and Practices in New Jersey Public Schools This is a compendium of 17 selfselected curriculum models that districts interested in improving their own familylife education programs can use However the department has not allocated any funds to assist those districts interested in changing or upgrading their programs At the moment state officials seem to be turning their backs on familylife education and focusing instead on substanceabuseprevention education The Governor has asked the Legislature to require mandatory drug and alcoholabuse education in grades K through 12 and has promised funds to those districts that adopt a stateapproved curriculum Yet when the State Board of Education passed the requirement for family life it recommmended that it be the umbrella curriculum for the prevention of all social problems If the funds promised for the improvement of substanceabuse education went instead to strengthening familylifeeducation programs the state would stretch its resources more fully and help children and adolescents understand more thoroughly the dangers of adolescent pregnancy child sexual abuse AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases as well as drug and alcohol abuse For the ultimate goal of familylife education is to help all the states young people understand responsible personal behavior and have strong bodies strong families and strong lives New Jersey took risks when it adopted the familylife education mandate now we know that voters approve of the states leadership To retain that leadership position and insure excellence of instruction policymakers and officials need to consider a secondstage agenda of training teachers and strengthening curriculums and providing adequate resources to implement it Knowing that 60 percent of New Jerseyans support such action should make the next steps far easier for them to take
IDEAS & TRENDS; A Prescription for Contraceptives,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/14/weekinreview/ideas-trends-a-prescription-for-contraceptives.html,The most promising way to prevent teenage pregnancy the National Research Council has found is contraception that is available and affordable The council an arm of the National Academy of Sciences reported last week that teenagers needed greater access to birth control services and it supported further trials of clinics providing such services in schools The council also said teenagers should be encouraged but not compelled to seek parental consent for abortions The report was most enthusiastic about the birth control pill calling it the safest and most effective contraceptive and recommending aggressive public education to dispel myths about health risks to young women taking the pill The council also endorsed the liberal distribution of condoms On the other side were among others Secretary of Education William J Bennett who denounced school clinics as tending to legitimate the very behavior whose natural consequences they intend to discourage and the National Right to Life Committee which called the report a proabortion document Dr Daniel D Federman the Harvard Medical School professor who led the panel of doctors public health experts sociologists and demographers dismissed the view that making contraceptives available encourages sexual activity He said teenage mothers and their babies were at high risk for health complications and had limited opportunities

SUPREME COURT ROUNDUP; JUSTICES LIMIT EFFECT OF ELECTION LAW,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/16/us/supreme-court-roundup-justices-limit-effect-of-election-law.html,The Supreme Court ruled today that a Congressional ban of direct corporate spending in political campaigns was unconstitutional as applied to a Massachusetts antiabortion group and other small nonprofit advocacy groups organized as corporations The 5to4 decision left intact the statutory restrictions on campaign spending by business corporations and labor unions and experts said its effect on the complex regulatory scheme for Federal elections would be slight Carving out a narrow exception from the restrictions on corporate spending the Court held that nonbusiness ideologically oriented corporations had a First Amendment right to make independent expenditures of their own money raised from donations bake sales and other fundraising events to support or oppose political candidates The decision would not allow such groups to make direct contributions to candidates however 1971 Election Law Cited Until today the Federal Election Campaign Act of 1971 barred all corporations from spending their general funds in elections while allowing them to set up separate political action committees financed by the voluntary contributions of members and subject to detailed public disclosure requirements Todays decision Federal Election Commission v Massachusetts Citizens for Life Inc No 85701 held that the small nonprofit antiabortion group could not be barred from spending its money in a political campaign or required to set up a political action committee before doing so The election agency had sought to penalize the corporation for spending 9812 to publish a special election newsletter in 1978 urging voters to support identified prolife candidates and oppose candidates who favor womens rights to have abortions The Court held unanimously rejected the groups arguments that it had not violated the statute because it had not made direct contributions to candidates and because it was covered by the statutory exemption for newspapers magazines and other publications It then divided 5 to 4 in holding the statute unconstitutional as applied on the facts of the case An Unjustifiable Burden The Court ruled that it would place an unjustifiable burden on the groups free speech to require it to comply with the complex paperwork requirements and the limitations on fundraising from members of the general public that apply to political action committees Associate Justice William J Brennan Jr wrote the majority opinion joined by Associate Justices Thurgood Marshall Lewis F Powell Jr and Antonin Scalia and in part by Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor Chief Justice William H Rehnquist dissented joined by Associate Justices Byron R White Harry A Blackmun and John Paul Stevens The vote of Justice Scalia the Courts newest member confounded predictions by some observers that he would invariably side with Chief Justice Rehnquist long the Courts most conservative member in ideologically charged cases Justice Brennan said that in cases involving small advocacyoriented corporations the paperwork requirements and restriction of solicitations from the general public that Congress has required for political action committees may create a disincentive for such organizations to engage in political speech and impose administrative costs that many small entities may be unable to bear Concentrated Corporate Wealth He said the justification for the statutory ban on corporate campaign spending was to prevent the corrosive influence of concentrated corporate wealth from corrupting the political marketplace and to prevent corporations from using assets of investors and members without their consent to support political causes Justice Brennan said these dangers were not presented by corporations formed to disseminate political ideas not to amass capital He said such groups as Massachusetts Citizens for Life would remain subject to requirements that they publicly disclose independent expenditures as little as 250 the identities of large contributors and other information Fred Wertheimer president of Common Cause a publicaffairs lobbying group that had urged the Court to uphold the blanket ban on coporate campaign spending said today that the decision would have minimal practical impact Rehnquist Cites Prior Rulings He said he was relieved by the outcome because he had feared the Court might strike down or create a larger exception to the longstanding prohibition on direct political spending by corporations and labor unions Chief Justice Rehnquist in his dissent said the decision conflicted with the reasoning of prior Supreme Court rulings upholding a broad rule against corporate campaign spending Stressing that the Court should not sit as a council of revision to modify legislative judgments he said it should leave the drawing of lines in cases such as this to Congress The Chief Justice said the law was justified as a prophylactic measure applicable to all groups that organize in the corporate form both to rid the political process of corruption and appearance of corruption that accompany contributions to and expenditures for candidates from corporate funds and to protect the interests of individuals who pay money into a corporation or union for purposes other than the support of candidates for public office The Court took these other actions today Visa Denials It agreed to hear a Reagan Administration appeal of a Federal appellate court decision slightly curbing the broad power of the executive branch to bar aliens associated with Communist or other totalitarian organizations from visiting the United States Solicitor General Charles Fried said in the Governments appeal that the decision will not only enmesh the courts in questions outside the bounds of judicial competence it will cast a chill over excecutive decisionmaking and impair the conduct of foreign policy Quoting the dissenting opinion by Judge Robert H Bork of the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Mr Fried said the appellate courts decision manifests a troubling process of judicial incursion into the United States conduct of its foreign affairs  The appeals court rejected 2 to 1 the Administrations assertion of unfettered power to bar Communist aliens from visiting the United States It ruled that if the State Department has no reason other than Communist affiliation for excluding an alien it must ordinarily recommend that the visa be granted or certify to Congress that the aliens visit would threaten national security Basing its ruling on the various provisions of the immigration statute in particular the 1977 McGovern Amendment the panel said further proceedings were necessary to determine the precise scope of the Governments powers to exclude aliens and the legality of the exclusions of the four aliens in the case before it They are Thomas Borge Nicaraguas Interior Minister Nino Pasti a former Italian lawmaker and general who belongs to a peace group that the State Department says is controlled by the Soviet Union and Olga Finlay and Leonor Rodriguez Lezcano of Cuba experts on women and family law in Cuba and who the department says are affiliated with Cubas Communist Party The appellate ruling although narrow and technical was hailed by civil liberties lawyers as a victory in their battle against the Governments frequent denials of visas to leftleaning foreign political and literary figures who want to exchange views here At the same time the appellate court said the Government had broad latitude to exclude aliens without any certification to Congress if they had affiliations with hostile governments independent of any Communist Party affiliations or would engage in activities prejudicial to the public interest while in the United States The plaintiffs in the case Reagan v Abourezk No 86656 were members of Congress and others who had invited Mr Borge Mr Pasti and the two Cuban women to visit this country to exchange views on various issues They sued to challenge the visa denials The State Department had said that denial of visas to foreign officials such as Mr Borge may be a legitimate way of expressing disapproval of the polices of their governments and of preventing them from seeking to spread a positive image of Communist regimes in the United States Invasion of Privacy The Court let stand without comment a Federal appellate ruling that a horse racing association must face trial in a suit for invasion of privacy for issuing a statement to the press exposing the identities of a couple who had assumed new names and been resettled under the Federal witness protection program The plaintiffs did not allege that the statement was inaccurate But the appellate court said the plaintiffs had a right to a jury trial to determined whether the information in the statement was sufficiently newsworthy to justify publishing it The husband Anthony Ciulla renamed Anthony Capra had been convicted of fixing horse races and had entered the witness protection program with his family after giving testimony against organized crime figures who might endanger their safety The statement was issued in connection with his wifes application for a license to race horses in California The case was Thoroughbred Racing Associations v Capra No 86238

ANTI-ABORTION CLINICS FOCUS OF HEARING IN HOUSE TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/17/us/anti-abortion-clinics-focus-of-hearing-in-house-today.html,Antiabortion centers that have caused increasing dispute in a number of cities and states will be the subject of House subcommittee hearings in Washington today Nearly a dozen have been the subject of litigation in which women who sought abortion services contend the centers misled them through false advertising or misinformation Most of the centers do not openly indicate they represent an antiabortion view Women say they have entered the centers under the impression that they can receive abortions or abortion services But once inside while awaiting results of a pregnancy test performed on the basis of a urine sample numerous women said they had been shown strong antiabortion presentations depicting the procedure as exceedingly dangerous and immoral San Francisco Center Sued I saw a slide show that made abortion out to be the worst possible horror a woman could go through said Carla Abbotts a 27yearold San Francisco woman who is expected to testify in the hearings this week She is suing A Free Pregnancy Center which she visited earlier this year The slide show had pictures of bloody fetuses in trash cans and it said abortion led to sterility death deformed children guilt and even suicide because of guilt Ms Abbotts said To some women abortion is the worst horror theyll go through said Robert J Pearson founder of the Pearson Foundation a St Louisbased antiabortion group which created the slide presentation used by many centers Many of the centers were modeled on guidelines written by Mr Pearson and published by his foundation We offer abortion information he said Everything we say in the presentations is documented All were offering is the truth Planned Parenthood and other organizations that oppose the clinics say it is not so much the message they object to but the fact that the centers are often listed in telephone book Yellow Pages under Clinic or at times under Abortion Clinics They say neither the advertisements nor receptionists at the centers give any warning to women that antiabortion views will be presented to them Were concerned said William W Hamilton Jr director of the Washington office of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America because they advertise themselves as offering medical services but then they refuse to give women objective information on medical options available to them These fake clinics are playing on the vulnerability of young women and essentially forcing them to listen to pseudomedical tirades about abortion Issue of Advertising Curtis J Young executive director of the Christian Action Council which operates a number of the centers said Its absolutely ridiculous If you look up Clinic in the Yellow Pages there are many nonmedical agencies or businesses there Mr Hamilton and other critics say that most staff members at the centers have no medical training and thus should not be listed under Clinics They also say many of the pregnancy centers look nearly identical with real abortion clinics and that many of them are situated near abortion clinics in some cases next to them We need our centers to look like the abortion clinics to reach people said Mr Pearson Theres no crime in that Were competing with them Its like a Wendys locating next to a McDonalds Mr Pearson acknowledged that the centers did not openly state that they represented an antiabortion point of view We dont hold a flag in our door saying we are prolife he said But its honest advertising Were just not saying what we dont do A car dealer when advertising does not list the things his auto wont do So why should we say we wont do abortions The number of such centers or clinics has grown in recent years Although statistics have not been compiled most experts agree that the centers have grown from a handful several years ago to as many as 2000 to 3000 today According to officials at Planned Parenthood at least 25 centers operate in Connecticut many in the southern part of the state Nearly a dozen centers exist in the New York metropolitan area including Westchester and Long Island the officials say A similar number were estimated to be operating in New Jersey The centers are usually founded by local groups at times with funds and support from religious organizations The center sued by Ms Abbotts was issued a temporary restraining order by a San Francisco court barring further advertising in the Yellow Pages unless the term abortion alternatives was printed They have not proven our advertising is false said Daniel J Grimm a lawyer for the Lourdes Foundation which operates the center Its a pretty small victory for them Texas Center Fined 39000 In another case in Texas a pregnancy center and its founder were convicted in October of deceptive trade practices and were fined 39000 These clinics practice what I would call the sins of omission said Jim Mattox the State Attorney General who helped bring the case to court The case is expected to be appealed Nearly a dozen other similar cases are still pending around the country The New York Attorney Generals office is currently conducting its own investigation of a number of the centers to determine if they are violating any of New Yorks laws according to a spokesman At the hearings today the Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights part of the House Judiciary Committee will hear testimony from women who say they were misled by the pregnancy centers Mr Pearson said he would not attend the hearings although he was invited because the deck is stacked against us They have five legislators who are very proabortion and only three at most on our side he said I feel we wont be treated fairly since they wont let us bring some girls to testify who have been helped by the centers

GORBACHEV'S GREAT PUSH AND THE RELUCTANT PUBLIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/18/world/gorbachev-s-great-push-and-the-reluctant-public.html,There is an old Russian proverb that the muzhik wont cross himself until he hears the thunder The proverb is commonly cited by way of saying that a Russian will not rouse himself to action until the last minute until the crisis is upon him This trait has repeatedly frustrated Soviet leaders who have tried to impose their will on the people and rouse them to action Twenty months ago Mikhail S Gorbachev an energetic and capable leader of the postwar generation came to power vowing to root out this trait to change the character of the muzhik  meaning in this case the average Russian  and to reverse the decline of a great and richly endowed land through a fundamental and urgent transformation in the way Russians live and work Call for Revolutionary Change Only a profound radical and even revolutionary restructuring he said again and again could check the stagnation of the economy the corruption of the political system the peoples cynicism Consolidating his power with unusual speed Mr Gorbachev immediately set about replacing the top level of the Government and party He offered some new liberties to economic managers and legalized some private services He declared war on the blight of drunkenness demanded a new openness and turned a new diplomatic face to the world No one could deny that Mr Gorbachevs changes have rumbled through the bureaucracy the press the arts and the country at large But as he approaches his second year in office it is far from certain that the muzhik has heard the thunder  that Mr Gorbachev has succeeded in convincing his nation that a crisis is upon it Contradiction and Resistance The contradictory image of a nation sorely in need of change and yet strongly resistant to it arises repeatedly as a reporter nearing the end of a sevenyear assignment to Moscow assesses the changes taking place in Soviet life The novelty of a young dynamic and attractive leader has waned and with repetition his exhortations have lost some of their urgency and impact Political anecdotes the most sensitive barometer of public opinion in a nation denied open political discussion have become potshots at the leader and his incessant calls for restructuring and intensification  perestroika i uskoreniye the new propaganda refrain One gibe making the rounds reflects a growing fatigue with Mr Gorbachevs constant sermonizing We dont drink vodka any more nor sausage do we have As soon as we come home from work we listen to Gorbachev For all his impatience he has shown himself to be realistic about his countrys capacity for change and about the character of the muzhik Talking to a group of writers a few months ago he insisted that Soviet society was ripe for change Then almost without pause he warned against expecting any quick transformation Generations must pass for us to really change he said Generations must pass The society Mr Gorbachev took charge of 20 months ago is one whose shape has changed enormously in the four decades since World War II often with results far different from those predicted by Marxist theory or prescribed by the Kremlin The villages in which more than half the population still lived as late as 1960 have been emptied The monotonous concrete tenements of the cities now house twothirds of the Soviet Unions 280 million people The urbanization and relative security of postwar years have nurtured new hungers habits needs and problems many only dimly understood and only barely acknowledged by Soviet officials Yet Soviet society remains profoundly conservative perhaps because the Russian people have been conditioned by a tumultuous history to cherish stability and to be wary of the designs of their leaders The Nations Strength And Its Weakness Russia is slow to change  the assertion recurs like a refrain as Russians talk about their country The immutability of the landscape is often noted by foreigners who return the timeless villages of log cabins listing in endless mud the rude clerks in dilapidated shops the tired faces and gray dress of Muscovites plying the streets in search of produce the dated fashions and fads To an American the resistance to change may be portrayed as a fundamental difference between the two countries and their people Anatoly N Rybakov the 75yearold novelist whose epic about the Stalin era is finally to be published next spring says to an American interviewer You must understand that our great enormous land has been shaped a certain way and change cannot take place rapidly This Soviet trait is cited as a national strength patience in the face of adversity the ability to survive the worst of times and to be grateful for small improvements the legendary tolerance for suffering and deprivation The dissident Yuri F Orlov abruptly liberated after nine years of labor camps and Siberian exile was curiously devoid of bitterness and selfpity as he flew to New York We have different criteria of whats difficult he explained We have greater endurance Shielded from the daily crises cacophonous television fierce competitiveness and the other unrelenting stimuli of Western life Russians have managed to remained an unspoiled and curious people capable of taking delight in an afternoon stroll and grateful for any cultural experience The resistance to change is also cited as a national weakness as the reason for the tenacity of habits like drunkenness inefficiency in the workplace resistance to new methods or routines innate suspiciousness of foreigners and submissiveness before authority Foreigners and foreign influences are still treated as if they are infected with a particularly deadly disease perpetuating distrust and misconceptions A New Generation Defiant and Spoiled Yet despite the innate resistance Mr Gorbachev may meet the country is in transition changing in ways that may not be as glaring or advanced as in the West yet are often as wrenching and profound in Soviet terms Longignored problems like drug abuse prostitution and teenage suicides are being openly acknowledged and alcoholism has reached the proportions of a national tragedy as Mr Gorbachev told the writers Divorce and abortion have soared In the Ukraine where the number of cities has quadrupled since the war every third marriage ends in divorce A study in one province of the Russian republic found that of 1000 first pregnancies 272 ended in abortion and that 206 of the women who had abortions were unmarried Of those who had the child 140 were single and more than 270 were married shortly before giving birth A new generation of urban adolescents is reaching maturity far quicker to pick up Western trends much less fearful of authority and far more spoiled by parents who had hoped to shield their offspring  increasingly an only child  from the hardships of their own youth Grandparents who secretly explored jazz and parents who cautiously admired the Beatles are aghast at teenagers who openly flaunt their affection for Western fads whether by strutting around Pushkin Square in punk hairdos blaring heavy metal rock on portable stereos or tooling around on primitive Jawa motorcycles Rock groups like Boris Grebenshchikovs Aquarium or Mikhail Litvins Rondo have shaped a defiant and original sound with performers indifferent to official disapproval and well versed in the latest Western music Oldtime Marxist ideology has proved woefully inadequate to the new sophistication and consumerism Newspapers regularly bemoan the growing irrelevance of the Komsomol Communist youth organization and rail helplessly against teenagers whose lives center on hanging around urban courtyards peddling rock cassettes and trendy clothes and even forming neighborhood gangs Yet their parents too have developed a new taste for high living and the chase for status symbols like video recorders cars and Western clothes has become a national preoccupation Urban Rootlessness And Nostalgia for Stalin The wane of ideology and the rise of a new urban rootlessness have often led to new searches for spiritual values Oldguard cold warriors still fulminate regularly in the press about the need to restore discipline darkly depicting the new fads and trends as ideological diversions planted in the Soviet Union by hostile forces from the West There are those who nostalgically invoke a real or imagined past of purer morals and higher ideals With every year the Soviet victory in World War II known here as the Great Patriotic War grows in legend and lore as the high point of Soviet history when the people arose in glorious unity to oust the Fascist invader Writers of the village school like Valentin Rasputin and Fyodor Abramov have gained a broad following with novels lamenting the loss of village values Many in the Russian intelligentsia have delved into the Russian Orthodox Church and Russian history in a search for spiritual roots many of them making pilgrimages to shrines and sites believed to be sacred Others have found sustenance often against stiff official repression in the exotic disciplines of Indian religions Aleksandr Germans brilliant film about the early 1930s My Friend Ivan Lapshin shot in the sepia tones and sharp contrasts of the period touched a yearning for a time when rampant poverty and hardship were still tempered by a residual revolutionary idealism soon to be smothered forever by Stalins terror A misguided nostalgia persists for Stalin himself nourished by the official falsification of his history Truck drivers sometimes sport portraits of the dictator in their cabs signs of a naive perception of his tenure as a lost era of order and discipline The Demoralized Village Mired in Backwardness Rural Russia meanwhile never recovered from the brutal devastation of collectivization The village demoralized by decades of senseless bureaucratic controls deprived of dignity by the priority given to industrialization and denuded of its youngest and brightest remains mired in backwardness and apathy The rural crisis remains probably the single greatest obstacle to any chance for serious reform of the Soviet system Perennial plans to revive agriculture have failed perpetuating the chronic food shortages that remain the Soviet Unions most glaring and painful failure Viktor I Perevedentsev a respected Soviet demographer who himself was raised in a village recently wrote that trying to stem the migration from farms in the Russian republic was no longer enough to save them Only a mass resettlement of the rural areas could return the farms to productivity he said But given the primitive condition of the village any voluntary return was described as less than likely Workers the proletariat in whose name the state purportedly rules have likewise been drained of initiative efficiency or pride in quality of production by 50 years of centrally imposed quotas and controls Alcoholism absenteeism and the habit of working only in furious spurts toward the end of a month to meet the quota have become deeply ingrained driving productivity far below prevailing levels in the West Mr Gorbachev himself deplored dismal state of affairs at his meeting with the writers earlier this year In 1969 we had a problem in Stavropol  what to do with meat and milk he said We were awash in butter Today there is nothing We have forgotten how to work People and Leader Grumbling or Thunder Raised in the Russian heartland and reared in the party Mr Gorbachev has demonstrated a keen awareness of the problems of his country and he has acknowledged them to a degree none of his predecessors dared Yet it seems difficult living in the Soviet Union to find a widespread sharing of his sense of crisis of impending thunder If the postwar years have brought new problems and yearnings they have also brought a rare stretch of peace and a steady improvement in comfort to a people who had known little but turmoil and tragedy Living standards in the Soviet Union may seem primitive to an American but most Russians remember far worse The seamy communal apartments in which so many middleaged Russians grew up are fading steadily into history Food supplies medical care and other services are inadequate and shoddy by Western criteria but many people have learned to cope and some to live downright well by using the elaborate second economy of blackmarket goods and underthetable services Though by Western standards the Soviet system remains sorely deficient in guaranteeing basic liberties and rights it has come a long way from the random terror of the Stalin era and a mighty military machine has tempered the fear of war Ironically the complacency against which Mr Gorbachev rails is also perhaps the proudest achievement of the state This complacency born of a cradletograve security may undermine initiative and competitiveness but it is also the basic bond between the people and the state Russians may grumble about the long lines and the battered cabbage they may yearn for blue jeans and video recorders they may worry about their children and bemoan their lost innocence but ultimately they need not worry about tomorrow And as long as there is no thunder Mr Gorbachev will find it hard to make the muzhik cross himself NEXT Change is welcomed in the arts but other parts of society resist
ABORTION PILL EXPECTED TO BE SOLD IN EUROPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/18/us/abortion-pill-expected-to-be-sold-in-europe.html,A French pharmaceutical company is expected to market a drug soon in Europe that a study published yesterday has shown can safely end an early pregnancy in at least 85 percent of women who take it within 10 days of missing a menstrual period The drug is not approved for sale in the United States The drug now designated RU 486 for its developer the RousselUclaf Company is also under study as a morningafter pill It acts by blocking the action of the hormone progesterone which is needed by the uterus to support the development of a fertilized egg The drug is a steroid that is closely related to norethindrone one of the oldest and most widely used synthetic contraceptive hormones No longterm risks have been associated with continuous use of norethindrone nor are any expected from brief intermittent use of the new drug An editorial in the Dec 18 issue of The New England Journal of Medicine to be published today describes the drug as a major advance that will at once provide new options yet force further difficult choices in a society already bitterly divided over the abortion issue The drug is expected to be approved early next year and to come into wide use soon afterward as an alternative to surgical abortion in France and other European countries No Marketing Plans in US There are currently no plans to seek marketing approval for it in the United States where pharmaceutical companies have encountered costly lawsuits related to reproductive drugs and where political opposition to abortion is strong However an American expert Dr Sheldon Segal director of population sciences for the Rockefeller Foundation said that after a year or so of good experience with the drug in Europe some company is likely to seek marketing approval here In the published report a research team from Bicetre Hospital in Paris and the drug company described the study of 100 women who were treated with the drug within 10 days of missing a menstrual period All were shown to be pregnant for two or four days before being given the drug Within four days of starting the medication uterine bleeding began in all the women 85 of whom were later found to have had their pregnancies terminated by the drug therapy The 15 women who remained pregnant were then given suction abortions The newly reported effectiveness is significantly better than what the researchers described last summer after the drug was tested in women somewhat farther along in pregnancy It appears to be most effective when used within five weeks of conception Side effects were described by the researchers as minimal and readily tolerated The most serious heavy uterine bleeding affected 18 women none of whom needed a transfusion or treatment to stop the bleeding A quarter of the women experienced painful uterine contractions when the abortion occurred A similar proportion reported slight nausea and fatigue The drug works by blocking receptor sites on cells where progesterone is supposed to attach Its only other known action is blockage of cortisone receptors However its anticortisone effect is much less powerful and no signs of cortisone insufficiency developed as a result of the brief treatment needed to end a pregnancy Dr Segal said the drug had other effects that could add to its marketing potential For example it might be used to treat tumors that depend on progesterone for growth such as tumors of the breast and endometrium and other cancers of the reproductive system The French researchers led by Dr Beatrice Couzinet emphasized that because some women bleed excessively and a sizable proportion do not abort as desired the drug should be used only under close medical supervision But the team concluded that even with these reservations the drug offers a reasonable alternative to surgical abortion which carries the risks of anesthesia surgical complications infertility and psychological sequelae

ALBANY COURT BARS UTILITIES' GIFTS TO CHARITIES FROM RATE REVENUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/20/nyregion/albany-court-bars-utilities-gifts-to-charities-from-rate-revenue.html,The Court of Appeals ruled today that it was unconstitutional for stateregulated utilities to contribute ratepayer money to charity saying the practice forces customers to subsidize causes they may oppose The states highest court in a 5to2 decision held that the practice which is widespread violates the right of free expression Coercion results from the fact that the state establishes the rate that the customer must pay and the rate includes an allowance for the objectedto contributions the majority opinion said Because the utility is a monopoly the customer must pay or be deprived of his right to utility service Opponent of Abortion The case involves a challenge by Joseph Cahill of Fishkill NY Mr Cahill a Roman Catholic complained that some of the money he paid in his utility bills went to groups that encouraged abortion which he found morally and religiously repugnant He said his payments were also used to support other views he opposed Unchallenged and unaffected by the decision today are charitable donations that utilities make from profits that would otherwise be paid to stockholders Also unaffected are contributions from other private businesses since they do not entail payments being compelled by government regulation Mr Cahills suit is an individual case rather than a class action and it is being returned to the lower courts to resolve the issues of Mr Cahills standing to sue whether he exhausted other remedies and whether he filed in time But Richard D Emery who represented the winning side as staff counsel for the New York Civil Liberties Union said The courts language was so broad that it effectively struck down this practice Its a ringing affirmation of First Amendment rights protecting customers from having donations extracted through government regulation against their will Even if the ruling is ultimately upheld its effect on charities in general is likely to be slight since the bulk of their income comes from individuals donations According to Giving USA the annual study by the American Association of FundRaising Counsel charitable contributions reached a record of 798 billion in 1985 and 66 billion or 827 percent came from individuals Bequests amounted to 51 billion more Foundations and corporations including all private companies along with stateregulated utilities  made up the remainder accounting for about 43 billion each New Yorks utilities give millions of dollars to thousands of charities each year A state study showed 11 of New Yorks biggest gas electric and telephone companies gave 77 million in 1984 that was charged back to customers Another 45 million was contributed from utility profits Utilities in many states make customerfinanced donations Mr Emery said About half allow it and half dont on the grounds that its not germane to providing utility service he said But this is the first ruling dealing with the issue as a First Amendment right Its very significant A possible solution on utility contributions Mr Emery said would be for utilities to offer customers a voluntary checkoff to pay above the basic rate Mr Cahill a retired manager for IBM learned of the donations by utilities in a local newspaper I was mad about being told what charities to donate to to get electricity he said I was even madder when I found out it was going to promote abortions Specifically he objected to donations to the United Way which he said encourages abortion through its member agencies counseling and referrals So he sued the State Public Service Commission and the New York Telephone Company His power company the Hudson Gas and Electric Corporation intervened in opposition to the suit Mr Cahills suit charged that the utilities commission made an unwarranted governmental intrusion into his beliefs 1970 Policy Reversal His suit cited the PSCs decision in 1970 to allow donations to charities to be charged to customers That reversed the policy that had restricted donations to funds from profits He also cited subsequent PSC rulings setting specific utility rates to finance such donations based on budget requests from the utilities Lawyers for the losing parties said they had not decided whether to appeal the case to the United States Supreme Court although Mr Emery said he expected them to do so If the ruling stands the reduction in monthly utility bills will probably be negligible utility officials said since the savings will be spread among millions of customers The New York Telephone Company which court papers said gave money to thousands of charity recipients said today it donated 72 million this year from both customer revenue and profits to a variety of welfare educational cultural and similar groups The Consolidated Edison Company reported giving 38 million last year 18 million of that paid by customers The money is donated to thousands of agencies and institutions including hospitals colleges museums and musical groups Landmark Ruling Is Cited Todays majority opinion written by Judge Stewart F Hancock Jr affirmed the State Supreme Court ruling and a 3to2 Appellate Division decision In a dissent Judge Vito J Titone joined by Chief Judge Sol Wachtler argued that the donations were the actions of a private company to which the PSC merely acquiesced The majority cited the United States Supreme Courts 1977 landmark ruling on Abood v Detroit Board of Education That decision held that school teachers constitutional rights were violated when a union contract required them to pay union dues part of which were spent for political activities that some teachers opposed Mr Emery emphasized that the Civil Liberties Union which has been in the forefront of liberalizing abortion rights does not agree with Mr Cahill on that issue but is defending his right to his own views Nor is the Civil Liberties Union opposed to charitable donations Mr Emery said adding Were dependent on contributions ourselves but theyre voluntary
THE REGION; Court Browns Out Utility Give-Aways,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/weekinreview/the-region-court-browns-out-utility-give-aways.html,It may not save New Yorkers much on their utility bills but a ruling by the states highest court last week may have calmed the pulses of a few wroughtup ratepayers The Court of Appeals declared it unconstitutional for stateregulated utilities to contribute their customers money to charity Arguing that some ratepayers are being forced to subsidize causes such as abortion  that they oppose the court held in a 5to2 vote that the widespread practice violates the First Amendment right of free expression Coercion results from the fact that the state establishes the rate that the customer must pay and the rate includes an allowance for the objectedto contributions the majority opinion said Because the utility is a monopoly the customer must pay or be deprived of his right to utility service In 1984 according to a state study 11 of New Yorks largest gas electric and telephone companies charged their customers for 77 million in charitable donations They gave away an additional 45 million from profits that otherwise would have been paid to stockholders but that practice was not challenged in the suit
A SINGER AIMS TO OPEN PEOPLE'S MINDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/nyregion/a-singer-aims-to-open-peoples-minds.html,IF pressed to describe her music Patricia Shih calls it issueoriented Its not topical said the songwriter and folk singer from Huntington who is to give a free concert at the HewlettWoodmere Public Library this afternoon at 230 Topical work tends to be fleeting  quickly dated I intend for my songs to last They may have references to current events  things like hunger womens rights or the environment for example  but theyre general general songs with meaning A professional entertainer for 18 years ever since at the age of 15 she and her singing partner in suburban Maryland talked their way into a record and performing contract Ms Shih has always believed that culture should promote social betterment By following this path she conceded that she is bucking todays trends and therefore could be considered a throwback to her comingofage days in the tumultuous 1960s when social activism ruled the nations campuses and influenced art Joan Baez Pete Seeger Judy Collins Peter Paul and Mary had terrific impact on my life Ms Shih said They broadened me and my beliefs And today just because folk music is kind of like Golden Oldies it doesnt mean its right I mean if nobody does it it doesnt get done And artists should help audiences become aware of the issues open peoples minds to different points of view Billed as original songs of love struggle and humor her music which she described as a kind of folkrock is meant to touch people If she sees her listeners cry or laugh she said or nod in agreement or shake their heads in disagreement or hears them say I felt that or I think that or I didnt know that then she has succeeded Music is not just entertainment she went on And Ive got nothing against entertainment Ive got humorous even nonsense songs in my repertoire as well as love songs But theres got to be other levels too There has to be the heavy with the light Music has to touch people in a nonthreatening way and on different levels but still with some impact So she sings of animal rights and Amerasian children and physical and mental handicaps and the brotherhood of all people regardless of color and abortion Sometimes a headline prompts a song other times the music comes first and shell hear a phrase just waiting for a lyric she said Sometimes she added the songs just come out intact  I dont recall who said it but a composer once insisted he was just a vessel for the creation of music and I feel that occasionally Naturally she said an issueoriented performer has to be sensitive to an audience and try not to offend Usually I dont although there have been times Ironically she added the biggest brouhaha I was ever involved in happened when I sang for a womens group that will remain nameless and everybody got upset about my prochoice song referring to abortion But generally people react even those who disagree with me by admitting there may be another side to an issue I mean Im always ready to listen so I hope my audiences are too Despite her devotion to music Ms Shih has divided artistic loyalties She is a visual artist as well as a performer and has had art and music tugging at me since her childhood For a while the two arts alternated Art came first for Ms Shih who was born in New York City of Chinese parents spent her infancy in Westbury and was raised in Bowie Md Music followed in her teens We Gigi and Patty were known as the female Simon and Garfunkel on the Washington DC pop music scene she said The art took precedence at 19 when after that act broke up she went to California to study painting at the San Francisco Academy of Art It was there that the art of stained glass captivated her  and where she met the man who became her husband Kenneth Ross an attorney from Long Island who was on vacation She followed him back East in 1978 and in the eight years since has managed to work out a dual professional life while living in Huntington Her energies are split between creating stained glass on order for decorators and performing either solo or with Arts With Heart a socially oriented group of local musicians With her 6string and 12string guitars her Chinese flower drum which is a nod in the direction of her origins her porcelain spoons her soprano recorder and her Marxophone an antique instrument that is a cross between a piano and a hammered dulcimer she has become a familiar figure on the Long Island pop music scene She has also done a number of folk festivals appeared in folk clubs in Manhattan and won such awards as the Cellar Doors Best of the Hoots and a New York Songwriters Showcase True there arent many folk clubs around especially on the Island she said but I think thats all changing I know Ive had a dynamite year worked so much that even my parents  both are retired but my dad was with the Voice of America and my mom was a teacher  are beginning to understand what I do Up to now they thought I was just playing around especially since my sister is a doctor and my brothers in computers and here I was a street singer in San Francisco Thats not the Chinese ethic In fact I know of only two other Orientals in folk music Theres a folk revival under way she went on Im seeing it in my audiences which are getting younger At one time I only used to see older people or people my age but lately there have been teens and college kids around This whole Live Aid We Are the World business is making music with a message respectable again and once the pendulum swings back folk music and folk musicians will be ready to fill the need that will arise
"OF CONFUCIUS, 'E.T.' AND HAPPINESS CANDY",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/magazine/of-confucius-et-and-happiness-candy.html,DURING THE 10YEAR period 196676 known as The Great Proletarian Cultural Revolution education in China came to a standstill Schools closed down teachers were persecuted and students made revolution in the streets In the last decade with the death of Chairman Mao Zedong and the ascension to power of Deng Xiaoping much of the madness has subsided On the educational front schools are open again teachers command respect students struggle to pass the college entrance examinations And as part of Dengs policy of pursuing modernization and opening up China to the West foreign teachers have been allowed to live and work there From August 1982 to July 1984 I was one of them Outwardly China has displayed an ambivalence toward this recent exposure to the West More foreign experts teachers visiting lecturers and tourists are welcomed into China every year And yet the Government remains famously chary of the infiltration of Western ideas Travel by foreigners within China is restricted and monitored this summer The New York Timess correspondent John F Burns was jailed and then expelled for making an unauthorized excursion While I was there during the 1983 Campaign for the Elimination of Spiritual Pollution Socialist Beauty Experts visited factories to discourage young men and women from dressing cutting their hair and behaving in Western style All of which is to say that we were a good match China and I both of us ambitious but uninformed naive and nervous And so we taught each other In 1982 I graduated from Yale University as a Chinese literature major I was fluent in Mandarin and nearly so in Cantonese had struggled through a fair amount of classical Chinese and had translated the works of Huang PoFei a modern poet Oddly though I had no real desire to go to China it sounded like a giant penal colony to me and besides I have never liked traveling much I applied to the YaleChina Association because I needed a job and was assigned to teach English at Hunan Medical College in Changsha a sooty industrial city of more than a million people and the capital of the southern province of Hunan When I arrived in Changsha the temperature was above 100 degrees I was 22 years old and homesick The college assigned three classes to me 26 doctors and teachers of medicine four men and one woman identified as the MiddleAged English Teachers and 25 medical students ages 22 to 28 I was entirely unsure what to expect from them the reverse I would learn was also true Their English ability ranged from nearly fluent to practically hopeless At the end of the first week the Class Monitor for the class of doctors read aloud the results of their Suggestions for Better Study meeting Dear Teacher Mark You are an active boy Your lessons are very humorous and very wonderful To improve our class may we suggest that in the future we 1 spend more time reading 2 spend more time listening 3 spend more time writing and 4 spend more time speaking Also some students feel you are moving too quickly through the book However some students request that you speed up a little because the material is too elementary We hope we can struggle together to overcome these contradictions Thank you our dear teacher FOREIGNERS WERE NOT SUPPOSED TO take showers in the public bathhouse where most Chinese bathe so the living quarters for the American teachers was equipped with its own bathtub on the second floor One day returning from upstairs with a towel around my waist I was met in my room by my supervisor from the college a 70year old woman named Teacher Wu and a thin silverhaired lady who looked about the same age Teacher Wu who seemed not to notice that I was halfnaked and dripping introduced us Mark this is Teacher Wei Since you have a background in classical Chinese she offered to teach you in case you would like to continue your study She is a very good teacher Teacher Wei shook her head and said No no Im a bad teacher Teacher Wu wanted to arrange a schedule then and there but Teacher Wei pulled her out of the room saying Hes wet now I will come again tomorrow After they left I remembered that I had met Teacher Wei before at a welcoming party thrown the day after I arrived A student had taken me aside and said Teacher Wei is a widow and has the reputation of being the strictest teacher in our college It is said that she has never laughed out loud I had no time to worry about how I would get along with mirthless Teacher Wei however That night I was scheduled to give a talk for which I had yet to prepare My predecessors at the college had begun a Wednesday night Western culture lecture series held in the largest hall in the college and open to anyone interested in learning English We usually drew a crowd of several hundred My topic was ET Before the lecture I wrote out the events of the movie as I remembered them Then I figured out what vocabulary I would have to introduce  for example spaceship alien ouch and phone home I adopted a distinct facial expression walk or tone of voice for each character and decided to alternate between narrating and acting out the scenes I worried that the audience might think this sort of storytelling childish but I did not have to worry long When I introduced ET by jumping on the table and hopping the length of it with my knees under my chin and my hands dragging the audience rose to its feet and cheered The next day Teacher Wei arrived after xiuxi the Chinese version of siesta She accepted a cup of tea put on her glasses and took a book from her cloth bag Well begin with an essay by Tao Qian she said He was a hermit and a famous drinker almost 1500 years ago Most of the great Chinese authors were drinkers and dreamers She stopped took off her glasses and looked closely at me I saw your lecture last night the one called ET You are a very naughty boy She took from her bag a small medicine jar and handed it to me I opened it and found that it contained a measure of baijiu  Chinese rice liquor Since we will be reading the works of drinkers and dreamers she said and since you are clearly an eccentric yourself I think it only fitting that you appreciate their essays like this From now on I will bring a small bottle of baijiu when I come You will finish it then we will have our lesson She reached into her bag and pulled out a container of fried peanuts still warm from the wok You must have something to eat with it of course she said I brought some peanuts for you If you dont finish the wine no lesson for you I finished the baijiu and peanuts to her great satisfaction Then she put on her glasses and began the lesson ON THE FIRST DAY of class when I asked the MiddleAged English Teachers to introduce themselves to me each chose instead to introduce the person sitting next to him Teacher Xu began Teacher Cai was a wonderful dancer when he was a young man He is famous in our college because he has a beautiful wife Teacher Cai hit Teacher Xu and said Teacher Xu is always late to class and he is afraid of his wife I am not Oh but you are Teacher Zhang pointed to Teacher Zhu Teacher Zhu was a navy man he said But he cant swim And Teacher Du is very fat So we call her Fatty Du  she has the most powerful voice in our college Fatty Du beamed with pride and said And Teacher Zhangs special characteristic is that he is afraid of me I am not Oh but you are On an afternoon some weeks later I asked them to open their textbooks to a chapter entitled War which contained photographs of World War II including one of the atomic bomb explosion over Hiroshima Teacher Zhu I said Can you tell us something about your experiences during the war Teacher Zhu an aspiring Communist Party member stood up and smiled Yes he said Then he hesitated This is a picture of the atom bomb isnt it Yes He smiled stiffly Teacher Mark  how do you feel knowing your country dropped an atom bomb on innocent people My face turned red with embarrassment at having the question put so personally but I tried to remain detached That is a good question Teacher Zhu I can tell you that in America many people disagree about this Not everyone thinks it was the right thing to do although most people think that it saved lives How did it save lives Well by ending the war quickly Here Teacher Zhu looked around the room at his classmates But Teacher Mark It is a fact that the Japanese had already surrendered to the Communist Eighth Route Army of China America put the bomb on Japan to make the world think America was the     The victor shouted Fatty Du Yes the victor said Teacher Zhu I must have stood gaping for a long time for the other students began to laugh Teacher Zhu I asked how do you know this is a fact Because that is what our newspapers say I see But our newspapers tell a different story How can we know which newspaper has told the truth Here he seemed relieved That is easy Our newspapers are controlled by the people but your newspapers are owned by capitalist organizations so of course they make things up to support themselves My mouth opened and closed a few times Fatty Du apparently believing that the truth had been too much for me came to my aid It doesnt matter Any capitalist country would do that It is not just your country My head swimming I asked her if she thought only capitalist countries lied in the papers Oh of course not The Russians do it too But here in China we have no reason to lie in the papers When we make a mistake we admit it As for war there is nothing to lie about China has never attacked a nation It has only defended its borders We love peace If we were the most powerful country in the world think how peaceful the world would be I agreed that war was a terrible thing and said I was glad that China and the United States had become friendly The class applauded my speech M Y LESSONS WITH Teacher Wei came to involve more than reading and writing assignments She was a teacher in the Chinese tradition taking responsibility for my development as a person She had advice for me concerning my family and friends my diet my clothing my study and exercise habits At times I got impatient with her and explained that in America children become adults when they leave for college and like to make decisions for themselves after that She was appalled Dont your parents and teachers care about you Of course they do but     Then how can they leave you stranded when you are only a child And how can you possibly think you understand everything You are only 22 years old You are so far away from home and I am your teacher if I dont care about you wont you be lonely She pointed out that the close relationship between teacher and student has existed in China since before the time of Confucius and should not be underestimated I couldnt help respecting her conviction and she seemed to get such pleasure out of trying to figure and then straighten me out that I stopped resisting I learned how to dress to stay comfortable throughout the year  a useful skill in a place without air conditioning or heat in most buildings  and how to behave toward teachers students strangers and bureaucrats how to save books from mildew and worms and never to do anything to excess Mark you laugh during your lectures Why Because Teacher Wei I am having fun I see Laugh less It seems odd that a man laughs so hard at his own jokes People think you are a bit crazy or perhaps choking Teacher Wei do you think it is bad to laugh No not at all In fact it is healthy We have a saying that if you laugh you will live long But you shouldnt laugh too much or you will have digestion problems T HE SECOND YEAR I was assigned to a group known as the 1983 English Medical Class Ranging in age from 17 to 20 they had been chosen from among hundreds of firstyear medical students for their superior performance on a series of English tests I gave them English names and tried to break them of the habit of learning everything by rote My favorite method was to divide them into small groups each of which had to prepare or improvise short skits based on a given situation They were terribly shy and at first things went slowly Julian you are a policeman Sinbad you are a criminal and Julian has just caught you Have a conversation on the way to the police station Silence Come on dont be nervous You can think of something Julian you start JULIAN You are a criminal SINBAD Im sorry Silence Sinbad why dont you try to bribe Julian SINBAD Do you want some money JULIAN No thank you With practice however they became quite good at this One assignment was to interview a Martian who had just landed on Earth A pair of boys decided the Martian had fled here to escape persecution A Communist he had been condemned to death by the ruling Fascist Bourgeois Oppressors on Mars He hoped that the earthlings would help him by setting him up with a human girl If he got married it would be safe to go home for on Mars he explained there is a strict law against making widows Another assignment was to invent a product then perform a television commercial for it Three girls walked to the front of the classroom all with their heads hung low One said Im unhappy Im very fat The second shook her head and said Im unhappy too Im too skinny The third blushed giggled faced the blackboard and said Im unhappy too I cant find a husband Suddenly Juliet  she had chosen her own English name after hearing my Romeo and Juliet lecture  marched to the front of the classroom with a basket filled with rolledup pieces of paper Adopting a television announcers huge smile and enthusiastic voice she said Ladies and gentlemen I am pleased to tell you about a wonderful thing It is called Juliets Happiness Candy and it is the most wonderful thing in the world In China it is customary at weddings for the bride and groom to distribute Happiness Candy  any candy preferably with the character known as Double Happiness printed on the wrapping  to their relatives and friends You must have it Juliet said This candy makes wishes come true If you are too fat and you eat it you will become skinny If you are too skinny and you eat it you will become fat If you are lonely it will help you get married Truly it solves all of your problems Guaranteed  no sad no cry The three sadlooking girls ran to the desk and asked if Juliets Happiness Candy could solve their problems Of course it can Juliet assured them but you must buy it first TEACHER MARK  CAN I trouble you I have a relative She is my wifes cousin She is a doctor visiting from Harbin She speaks very good English and is very interested in learning more Could I take her here to practice with you It would only be once or twice Because of the overwhelming number of relatives and friends of students not to mention perfect strangers who wanted to learn English I had to be protective of my time I explained this to my student and apologized for not being able to help him This is terrible he said smiling sheepishly Why I asked Because    I already told her you would I tried to let my annoyance show but the harder I frowned the more broadly he smiled so at last I agreed to meet with her once Her name is Little Mi he said much relieved She is very smart and strongwilled She was always the leader of her class and was even the head of the Communist Youth League in her school During the Cultural Revolution she volunteered to go to the countryside There she almost starved to death At last she had a chance to go to medical school She was the smartest in her class Little Mi sounded like a terrific bore I cleared my throat hoping that my student would simply arrange a time and let me be but he continued Her specialty was pediatrics She wanted to work with children When the time came for job assignments after graduation though some people started a rumor that she and some of the other English students read Western literature in their spare time instead of studying medicine They were accused of fang yang pi  imitating Westerners So instead of being sent to a good hospital she was sent to a small family planning clinic outside of the city There she mostly assists doctors with abortions That is how she works with children But saddest of all she has leukemia Truly she has eaten bitter all her life When can I bring her I told him they could come to my office in the Foreign Languages Building that evening He thanked me extravagantly and withdrew At the appointed time someone knocked I braced myself for an hour of grammar questions and opened the door There stood Little Mi who could not have been much older than I with a purContinued on Page 56 ple scarf wrapped around her head like a Russian peasant woman She was petite unsmiling and beautiful She looked at me without blinking Are you Teacher Mark she asked in an even low voice Yes  please come in She walked in sat down and said in fluent English My cousins husband apologizes for not being able to come His adviser called him in for a meeting Do you mind that I came alone Not at all What can I do for you Well she said looking at the bookshelf next to her I love to read but it is difficult to find good books in English I wonder if you would be so kind as to lend me a book or two which I can send back to you from Harbin as soon as I finish them I told her to pick whatever she liked from my shelf As she went through the books she talked about the foreign novels she had enjoyed Of Mice and Men From Here To Eternity and The Gulag Archipelago How did you get The Gulag Archipelago I asked her It wasnt easy she answered I hear that Americans are shocked by what they read in it Is that true Yes werent you Not really she answered quietly I remembered the story of her life my student had told You are a pretty tough girl arent you I said She looked up from the magazine she had been leafing through with a surprised expression then covered her mouth with her hand and giggled nervously How terrible Im not like that at all We talked for over an hour and she picked a few books to take with her When she got up to leave I asked her when she would return to Harbin The day after tomorrow Against all better judgment I asked her to come visit me again the next evening She eyed me closely said Thank you  I will then disappeared into the unlit hallway I listened to her footsteps as she made her way down the stairs and out of the deserted building Then from the window I watched her shadowy figure cross the athletic field She came the next night at exactly the same time I had brought for her a few books of photographs of the United States and she marveled at the color pictures taken in New England during the fall How beautiful she said Just like a dream I could not openly stare at her so I gazed at her hand as she turned the pages of the book listened to her voice and occasionally glanced at her face when she asked me something We talked and talked then she seemed to remember something and looked at her watch It was after 10 oclock  nearly two hours had passed She gasped suddenly worried Ive missed the last bus She was staying in a hospital on the other side of the river at least a twohour walk It was a bitter cold night On foot she would get back after midnight and arouse considerable suspicion The only thing to do was put her on the back of a bicycle and ride her That in itself would not attract attention since that is how most Chinese families travel around town I had seen families of five on one bicycle many times and young couples ride this way for want of anything else to do at night The woman usually rides sidesaddle on the rack over the rear wheel with her arms around the mans waist leaning her shoulder and face against his back A Chinese woman riding that way on a bicycle powered by a Caucasian male would attract attention however I put on my thick padded Red Army coat tucked my hair under a Mao hat wore a surgical mask as many Chinese do to keep dust out of their lungs and put on a pair of Chinese sunglasses the kind that liumang  young punks wear Little Mi wrapped her scarf around her head and left the building first Five minutes later I went out rode fast through the gate of our college and saw her down the street shrouded in the haze of dust kicked up by a coal truck I pulled alongside her and she jumped on before I stopped The street was crowded Neither of us said a word Trucks buses and jeeps flung themselves madly through the streets bicycles wove around us and pedestrians darted in front of us cursing the liumang Finally I turned onto the road that ran along the river and the crowd thinned out It was a horrible road with potholes everywhere that I could not see in time to avoid She too shy to put her arms around my waist had been balancing herself across the rack but when we hit an especially deep rut I heard her yelp and felt her grab on to me Regaining her balance she began to loosen her grip but I quickly steered into another pothole and told her to hold on Very slowly I felt her leaning her shoulder against my back When at last her face touched my coat I could feel her cheek through it We reached the steep bridge and I started the climb About halfway up she told me to stop riding that we could walk up the bridge to give me a rest At the top we stopped to lean against the rail and look at the lights of the city Trucks and jeeps were our only company Does this remind you of America she asked gesturing toward the city lights with her chin Yes a little Do you miss home Very much But Ill be home very soon And when I get home I will miss Changsha Really But China is so    no you tell me  what is China like The lights are dimmer here Yes she said quietly and we are boring people arent we Only her eyes showed above the scarf wrapped around her face I asked her if she thought she was boring and her eyes wrinkled with laughter I am not boring I believe I am a very interesting girl Do you think so Yes I think so She had pale skin and I could see her eyelids blush When you go back to America will you live with your parents No Why not Im too old They would think it was strange if I didnt live on my own How wonderful I wish my parents felt that way I will have to live with them forever Forever Of course Chinese parents love their children but they also think that children are like furniture They own you and you aust make them comfortable until they decide to let you go I cannot marry so I will have to take care of them forever I am almost 30 years old and I must do whatever they say So I sit in my room and dream In my imagination I am free and I can do wonderful things Like what She cocked her head to one side and raised one eyebrow Do you tell people your dreams Yes sometimes She laughed and said Im not going to tell you my dreams We were silent awhile then she suddenly asked me if I was a sad man or a happy man Thats hard to say sometimes Im happy sometimes Im sad Mostly I just worry Worry What do you worry about I dont know  everything I guess Mostly about wasting time How strange My cousins husband says that you work very hard I like to keep busy That way I dont have time to worry I cant understand that You are such a free man you can travel all over the world as you like make friends everywhere You are a fool not to be happy especially when so many people depend on it What do you mean My relative says that your nickname in the college is huoshenxian  an immortal in human form  because you are so    different Your lectures make everyone laugh and you make people feel happy all the time This is very unusual I asked her if she was happy or sad She raised one eyebrow again looking not quite at me I dont have as many reasons to be happy as you She looked at her watch and shook her head I must get back  we have to hurry As I turned toward the bicycle she leaned very close to me almost touching her face against mine looking straight into my eyes and said I have an idea I could feel her breath against my throat Lets coast down the bridge she said Fast No brakes I got on the bicycle Are you getting on I asked her Just a minute At the bottom Ill get off so Ill say goodbye now I should at least take you to the gate of the hospital No that wouldnt be a good idea Someone might see me and ask who you were At the bottom of the bridge Ill hop off and you turn around I wont see you again so thank you It was fun meeting you You should stop worrying She jumped on pressed her face against my back held me like a vice and said Now  go As fast as you can Copyright c 1987 By Mark Salzman
'PLEASE DON'T MAKE ME A JOKE',https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/books/please-don-t-make-me-a-joke.html,MARILYN By Gloria Steinem Photographs by George Barris 182 pp New York Henry Holt  Company 2495 ON June 1 1962 her 36th birthday Marilyn Monroe began what would be her final attempt to tell her story Lies had been told about her she insisted and she was going to set the record straight In addition to the biographical information she had contributed in interviews over the years she had launched a previous fullscale autobiography in conjunction with the novelist and playwright Ben Hecht Minus the name of its coauthor My Story as that unfinished manuscript was called was published in 1974 and reissued in paperback this year For her new venture Marilyn Monroe also had a collaborator a photojournalist George Barris Mr Barris was obviously a sympathetic coadjutant Through June and July Marilyn talked and posed  and drank champagne Mr Barris took many soft gentle pictures of her in bathing suit towels beach robe sweater But this project too was not completed On Aug 4 Marilyn Monroe died of an overdose of sleeping pills More than two decades later Mr Barris turned over his photographs to Gloria Steinem for use in her present thoughtful and absorbing biography of the actress Whether Marilyn Monroe a chronic insomniac intended to kill herself or only to get some rest will probably never be known though we learn from Ms Steinems careful investigation that Marilyns achieved death followed seven or eight near misses Still a young woman she had said of herself Yes there was something special about me and I knew what it was I was the kind of girl they found dead in a hall bedroom with an empty bottle of sleeping pills in her hand She didnt die in a hall bedroom but the empty pill bottle is everywhere in Mr Barriss pictures of her perhaps especially when below vacant eyes she forces her famous smile radiant and full of promise The sessions with Mr Barris had taken place in her new Brentwood home She had not been in it long it was still being renovated and Marilyn had only recently returned from Mexico where she had gone to buy furniture By movie star standards it was a modest dwelling Marilyn is reported to have been naively proud of having a swimming pool in her backyard But in fact she was no longer a star Worn down by sleeplessness and her dependence on drugs and alcohol unable to take direction she had been fired from a film fittingly titled Somethings Got to Give To be dropped from a film while it is being shot is not a minor event in an actresss life It had been welladvertised that Marilyn consistently arrived late on the set and that some days she didnt arrive at all We now learn that often when she did come to work she was so frightened that she threw up at the gate Her dismissal proclaimed to the world that her movie career was at an end It is questionable if Monroe had ever had a gift for acting other than as an overflow of her good humor professional opinion would seem to have been divided in the matter On the positive side according to Ms Steinems account Lee Strasberg rated her with Marlon Brando as one of his most talented pupils And John Huston said She went right down into her own personal experience for everything reached down and pulled something out of herself that was unique and extraordinary She had no techniques It was all the truth it was only Marilyn But whatever her talent or its absence  and certainly a capacity like Marilyn Monroes for selfirony is a great asset in a comedian  movies and movie making were at the heart of her life She had been born and raised in Hollywood She was an illegitimate child her father had run off before her birth  when Marilyn wanted to create this parent she visualized him as Clark Gable During the brief periods that she was able to be with her daughter before disappearing forever into a mental hospital Marilyns mother was employed in film studios Shunted as a child between orphanage and foster homes all Marilyn could turn to were the movies to instruct her in a world that offered more than barrenness AT her death people charged Hollywood with having destroyed Marilyn Monroe they accused the movie industry of ruthlessly exploiting her for its own gain It was an unjust charge or at least a muddled one The Hollywood that made Marilyn Monroe into a sex goddess the phantom object of every mans desire also gave her fragile life all the structure and substance it ever had It is a cruel paradox that this most abundantly endowed of women whose public personality spoke to us only of sunlight and joy was a creature of shadows emotionally so much adrift that she required constant reassurance of her worth and even of her existence The fact that she responded as she did to the collapse of her career can be taken I think as evidence of her insufficent sense of identity For most people autobiography is an extension and defense of the self Marilyn Monroe had little self to extend or defend In repeating the sad dull cliches of orphanage and poverty she undertook to supply the self that she lacked From bits and pieces of memory or fantasy she tried to fill the empty vessel of her being Gloria Steinems biography is a quiet book it has none of the sensationalism that has colored other purportedly serious books about the film star Norman Mailers in particular But it necessarily reports on Marilyns sexual life Although Marilyn Monroe cannot fairly be said to have slept her way to the top she did at the start of her career sleep her way to the opportunity to work After that world famous she continued to be vastly compliant she slept with men and on occasion even with another woman in order to please  perhaps also to feel herself made real by their desire for her Apparently the ability to give rather than receive pleasure in sex was the whole of her delight Practiced in the arts of accommodation she flattered many men into believing that they were the first to satisfy her It was her boast that she had never been kept But financial independence was one of her few expressions of strength Ms Steinem suggests that Marilyns loneliness in the early days when she was earning her poor living by modeling or as a starlet was caused by her great neediness the other girls were put off by the force of her emotional demand Through three marriages  the first was arranged for her at 15 by fond but incompetent guardians  and numberless sexual encounters the neediness persisted For someone who asked so much in emotional support her choice of husbands  the ballplayer Joe DiMaggio and the playwright Arthur Miller  would seem to have been unfortunate They were unable to sustain her to the degree that she required And apparently her later lovers conspicuous among them Frank Sinatra and Robert Kennedy were similarly inappropriate Delving more closely than Arthur Schlesinger does into Marilyns relation with Robert Kennedy Ms Steinem gives us a pitiful picture of Marilyn trying to convince herself that she will soon marry the Attorney General She obviously pleased Robert Kennedy just as during the 1960 Presidential campaign she had pleased his brother Jack But Marilyn Monroe was designed for wishfulfillment not for wifehood or public companionship with government leaders As to whether there was actual criminality in the circumstances surrounding her death or merely an effort to sweep the premises clean of embarrassing evidence Ms Steinem seems to be in general agreement with the original conclusions of Anthony Summers in his popular biography Goddess that no crime was committed that night but there was a highly irregular coverup of Marilyns affair with Bobby Ms Steinem could of course not know the questions about the possibility of foul play that Mr Summers raises in a postscript to the new paperback edition of his biography Nor it would appear was she designed for motherhood She longed for children and had great empathy with them perhaps this was because she was herself always a child essentially unmarked by her experience  no doubt her innocence had much to do with her unparalleled appeal to people in all walks of life Laurence Olivier who played with her in The Prince and the Showgirl said of her Look at that face  she could be five years old One of her suicide attempts followed a miscarriage during her marriage to Arthur Miller But she had had a dozen or more abortions Monroes life was one of contradiction and pathos as lives of emotional hollowness and disconnection often are One might suppose that a pathology such as hers would be especially common among actors they are in the business of borrowing personalities which they wear like clothes from a stage wardrobe But it is far from restricted to professions that live by public display It frighteningly proliferates in our time crowding out of the clinic the oldfashioned neuroses for whose treatment psychoanalysis was specifically devised In writing about Marilyn Monroe Gloria Steinem for the most part admirably avoids the ideological excess that we have come to associate with the womens movement  Monroe emerges from her book a far more dimensional figure than she would have been if she had been presented as simply the victim of a maledominated society It is only when she deals with Monroes quest for help with her emotional problems that Ms Steinem becomes incautious and passes unfounded clinical judgments That Freud regarded women as the second sex charmingly puzzling but inferior to men is scarcely arguable This sexual bias cannot be overlooked by any prideful woman but it does not account as Ms Steinem would have it do for the failure of Freudian psychoanalysis to cure Monroe Marilyn Monroe was in the care of Freudian psychoanalysts but she was not being psychoanalyzed she was in psychoanalytically derived supportive treatment The distinction is important Patients with her emotional affliction are not available to orthodox analysis Ms Steinem names Marilyns California physician Dr Ralph Greenson she omits mention of her New York doctor Dr Marianne Kris to whom she left a considerable portion of her estate for use in psychoanalytical research Were she to have been in orthodox Freudian analysis Monroe could not of course have simultaneously had two physicians one on each coast Unhappily medicine has not yet found a cure or even a confident therapy for Marilyn Monroes personality disorder Ms Steinem quotes extensively from a work by Dr W Hugh Missildine Your Inner Child of the Past it seems to serve as her psychiatric authority While these passages sensitively report on how people behave when they have been neglected in childhood they propose no method of treatment EVEN Ms Steinems wellresearched book falls short of fully documenting the role of heredity in Marilyns psychic illness It isnt only that Marilyn Monroe was manicdepressive and had a severe character disorder by her own account in My Story her mother died insane her mothers father died insane her mothers grandmother died insane her mothers brother killed himself But our culture is a blame culture It prefers to address only those ills that excite our moral indignation and to ignore the terrors of fate Marilyn Monroe didnt view herself as a tragic figure she didnt give herself that much weight But she begged to be taken seriously and to be regarded as someone with ideas and opinions worth hearing One of her most moving requests was made of an unnamed interviewer near the close of her life it was not granted but it is remembered by her press secretary Please dont make me a joke End the interview with what I believe One can wish that she had been told she wasnt a joke a sex idol who read books The truth is that she was unusually intelligent Indeed as uneducated as she believed herself to be she gave distinct signs of literary gift Professional writers might envy the terse description of her ill mother in My Story Even the sound of a page turning made her nervous or her use of telling detail when she speaks of the poverty of Aunt Grace her early guardian I remembered how she had gone with one of her lenses missing from her glasses for three months because she couldnt afford the fifty cents to buy its replacement Surely we are reminded of the everyday luminousness of F Scott Fitzgerald and the strange sorrow that overhangs his work when Marilyn Monroe remarks of herself I am not interested in money I just want to be wonderful EMBARRASSED FOR MONROE As a teenager in bluecollar East Toledo Ohio taking dance lessons as a means of dancing my way out of the neighborhood Gloria Steinem walked out of a Marilyn Monroe sex comedy because she felt embarrassment and humiliation  for her and for me Yet in writing Marilyn the 52yearold author said she felt empathy and connected to Monroe The things that happened to her were things the womens movement has tried to prevent Ms Steinem said recently in her favorite East Side coffee shop We lived through similar times and circumstances but I was luckier Like Monroe Ms Steinem comes from a workingclass background Her parents separated when she was about 9 She took care of her mother an invalid whose spirit was broken in the family home where survival depended on boarders Ms Steinem had written of Monroe for Ms magazine in 1972 noting that problems the actress saw as uniquely hers such as guilt over not having children were felt by many women to be their own a decade after her death It was this article included in a book of Ms Steinems essays that prompted Henry Holt  Company to ask her to write a text for pictures of Monroe taken by a photojournalist George Barris shortly before her death Why did she agree One aspect of writing about a woman like Marilyn is that you feel youre exploiting her all over again she said But Ms Steinem spends a lot of time raising funds for feminist causes and saw writing  something she enjoys  as a way to donate her money from the book to a new organization the Marilyn Monroe Childrens Fund within the Ms Foundation for Women Not to be presumptive I thought Marilyn would like to see the money go to childrens projects GEORGE JAMES
TEACHING THE HUMANE TOUCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/magazine/teaching-the-humane-touch.html,ON A RECENT Wednesday morning six people sat in the waiting room at the walkin clinic of the Massachusetts General Hospital in Boston A young man in a white coat a stethoscope bobbing around his neck approached one of them My name is Michael Gillette he told a patient in his mid30s whose neck was in a brace Im a secondyear medical student at Harvard and if its OK with you Id like to interview you before the doctor sees you The man was suffering from a dull ache in his back that was keeping him from his engineering job one doctor had diagnosed the problem as a herniated disk and had recommended surgery The engineer wanted a second opinion Although Mr Gillette asked several questions about his specific symptoms he focused more on the patients life at home and on the job I havent slept in my bed for several days the engineer told the Harvard student Ive been sleeping in a recliner chair in the living room As he talked the man seemed unaware of his role in Michael Gillettes unusual medical education Mr Gillette and 60 other students at the Harvard Medical School  almost onefifth of the students in the first and secondyear classes  are part of the New Pathway an experimental program designed to help students understand and utilize the influence of family society and culture in treating a patients illness Harvards yearold New Pathway program stresses medical educations traditional goals of scientific and technical mastery but it also emphasizes an untraditional humanistic approach to doctoring In addition to attending lectures New Pathway students learn basic science and clinical skills in small tutorials in which they study not only the scientific aspects of disease but its impact on patients lives In most traditional medical programs students do not meet patients until the beginning of their third year of school New Pathway students meet their first patients during the initial few weeks of classes Each student works closely with one experienced physicianpreceptor throughout the four years And weekly tutorials draw upon the social sciences and the humanities  disciplines not usually included in the medical mix  to explore issues that affect the doctorpatient relationship Harvards is one of an increasing number of programs around the country that are formalizing the teaching of social responsibility ethics and patientcentered medicine as part of medical discipline A 1985 survey by the Association of American Medical Colleges showed that 112 of the countrys 126 fouryear medical schools now require courses in doctorpatient relationships communication skills and cultural social and ethical issues The new programs are a part of a broader movement medical humanism that is gaining strength  and sparking controversy  in the medical community The debate over how to make doctors more compassionate is not new says Allan M Brandt an assistant professor of the history of medicine and science at Harvard What is new is that more and more medical schools are recognizing that it is important to specifically address this area The biomedical model that said Specific disease lets find it specific treatment lets give it has become inadequate The medicalhumanism movement stems from a belief that physicians have become distanced from their patients because of the explosion of new medical technologies the increasingly costconscious nature of medicine and the emergence of a more demanding litigious and knowledgeable breed of patient The movement rests on two premises that the expansion of scientific knowledge has left little time for compassion intuition and ingenuity  what the physician and essayist Richard Selzer calls the trinity of doctorhood  in the practice of medicine and that it is the medical schools responsibility to revive these qualities If all physicians are taught is how to pass a catheter thats all theyll know how to do says Dr August G Swanson the director of the department of academic affairs for the Association of American Medical Colleges Many of the programs dealing with humanism or humanistic studies are really directed toward broadening physicians views There is a serious and widespread debate however about whether a humanistic approach to doctoring can be taught or whether it should be a mandatory part of medical education Some question whether so vague a concept as medical humanism can be instilled in students already overburdened with courses in anatomy biochemistry and immunology You might do it to impress society but I have no use for a course in being human says Dr Henry M Seidel the associate dean for student affairs at Johns Hopkins Medical School Harvard administrators however reject the idea that scientific education and humanism are in conflict To say the New Pathway is developing more humane physicians at the expense of sciencerooted competence would be wrong says Dr Daniel C TosteContinued on Page 52 son Harvard Medical School dean We are after a better balance between the natural scientific the social scientific and the humanities aspects of medicine Mr Brandt agrees The fact is we can teach students how to communicate effectively with their patients T HE PRACTICE OF medicine has evolved dramatically over the last seven decades but medical education has changed very little since 1910 In that year Abraham Flexner an educator on the staff of the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching published a critique of North American medical schools that fostered a new system of medical education The Flexner model stressed lectures memorization and laboratory work and divided medical school into two distinct parts  the first half devoted to the basic sciences the second to clinical training As scientific discovery has filled the physicians black bag with an evergrowing cache of technology however doctors have had to narrow the scope of their expertise The consequence say some experts has been the destruction of important bonds between doctors and patients The connections that allowed physicians and patients to avoid the trap of depersonalization have been systematically severed says Dr Robert S Lawrence associate professor of medicine at Harvard and one of the original planners of the New Pathway What is more the contemporary patient is better informed about health and disease than ever before and consequently is quicker to doubt physicians approaches This has contributed to a rise in malpractice suits making doctors even more distanced from their patients So too increasing government involvement in healthcare has in the opinion of many physicians also complicated doctorpatient relationships Concern over this growing divide has impelled calls for change In a 1984 report entitled Physicians for the 21st Century for example an education panel of the Association of American Medical Colleges stated The pace of medical education and of technologys increasing permeation of patient care is such that students need special assistance in perceiving the human dimensions of choices and in developing empathy with their patients In addition to Harvard scores of other medical schools public and private are now trying to address the humanistic side of medicine Their approaches vary Some schools tackle them with single mandatory survey courses At the University of California at San Francisco for example students are required to complete a course in medical ethics jurisprudence economics and sociology Other schools such as Mount Sinai School of Medicine in New York City offer series of seminars that focus on physicians reactions to emotional and ethical issues and on the importance of psychosocial forces in medical treatment Columbia Universitys College of Physicians and Surgeons created its Center for the Study of Society and Medicine in 1982 to address the humanities gap in doctoring The centers staff includes seven historians political theorists lawyers sociologists and literature professors who teach elective courses and a course on society and medicine that all secondyear Columbia students are required to take As formally and traditionally taught medicine does not have the answers to questions it is now facing says David Rothman the centers director The center and other medicalhumanism programs are a selfconscious effort to alert students to the universe in which theyre going to practice H ARVARDS NEW Pathway which was established last year after three years of planning is one of the most structured and comprehensive efforts to teach humanistic concerns in a medicalschool setting Many educators are keeping an eye on Harvard says Dr Swanson of the Association of American Medical Colleges who heads an independent committee that is charged with evaluating the programs progress Students too are showing interest Of the 165 men and women accepted for Harvard Medical Schools class of 1989 72 asked to be considered for the first New Pathway class Twentyfour were chosen by lottery one later dropped out For the class of 1990 76 students expressed interest 38 were accepted The New Pathway departs radically from the traditional approach to medical education Although students still study basic science in large lecture courses during their first two years their time is concentrated in small tutorials of six to eight students In addition at least onethird of a students time is set aside for independent study electives and research New Pathway tutorials stress a casestudy method of education similar to the one practiced at Harvards law and graduate business schools students attempt to come to grips not only with the biological complexities of an individual patients problems but with the psychosocial aspects as well Students might consider for example the difficulties in diagnosing a hateful patient with a fear of doctors or the special psychological demands of a terminally ill patient In traditional curriculums these subjects generally are not discussed in the classroom but rather are left for students to discover for themselves during internships and residencies The casestudy method in particular is attracting widespread interest the more so because Harvard Medical Schools administrators are considering merging it with the traditional curriculum within the next several years If a faculty of Harvards reputation adopts this method across the board and shows that it is feasible says Dr Swanson it will have a major impact on other faculties The medical schools curriculum committee is voting this month on whether to allow all departments to follow the New Pathways methods In addition to tutorials in basic science the New Pathway offers other small weekly classes to discuss nonscientific issues and attitudes that affect the quality of care doctors provide Among the issues covered in these classes are the cultural differences between doctors and patients societys attitudes about AIDS abortion or cigarette smoking and the increasingly corporate structure of health care The small size of New Pathway tutorials is designed to encourage cooperation Continued on Page 55 among medical students in understanding both the medical and social complexities of patients problems Physicians will not be aware of the power of empathic behavior unless the program in which they work exemplifies that says Dr Gordon Moore the director of the program The degree to which we model partnership and participation and the students as people the more successful we will be Students say that in these classes they are able to examine the murky aspects of doctoring  attitudes and values  by drawing on the opinions of their classmates and on other disciplines such as history anthropology sociology economics ethics and philosophy You develop a healthy frustration with not knowing says the secondyear student Michael Gillette and the motivation that comes from that is amazing Students are motivated further by their opportunity to apply social insights gained in the classroom to the patients they begin seeing in their first few weeks of school When you study youre reading on paper what might walk in the door at any minute says Mr Gillette In one recent class six secondyear students considered the changing implications of treating uninsured patients After one student noted the long tradition of physicians charging welltodo patients a little more in order to subsidize their care for the needy others speculated that increasing bureaucracy in health care meant doctors were not as free as in the past to take such independent action When they became physicians several students asked would they be able to strike their own balance Forcing students to confront perplexing nonscientific questions is among the New Pathways goals The way we normally teach medicine  saying there is a body of material out there that is truth  is much more reassuring says Dr Moore But eventually students will practice in a world that is constantly confusing and messy Uncertainty is an important part of what all physicians and patients have to deal with and to do so you have to live in it and learn to be effective in that setting ONE OF THE MOST SIGnificant criticisms of medicalhumanism education is that it detracts from medical education Science is the fundamental basis of medicine and there is no way we can diminish it says Dr Richard S Ross the dean of Johns Hopkins Medical School I dont think theres time for humanities courses in medical school Some New Pathway students fear that may be true At first a lot of people talked about whether or not we would be able to pass the boards says Dawn E DeWitt a firstyear New Pathway student referring to the tests that students take to become licensed as physicians Dr Moore calls the distinction between humanities and science a false dichotomy When we define humanism as a separate entity from bioscientific competence we do ourselves a disservice he said The two are as important as the front and back of the hand Dr Brandt agrees This is not just cultural window dressing he says Instead of telling students that a humanistic outlook is important were trying to get them thinking about the clinical utility of the range of issues that will bring a patient into their offices Its a new model of effective therapeutics The model however can be faulty Even the Association of American Medical Colleges which generally supports the drive to incorporate humanistic education into medicalschool curriculums concedes that some programs particularly those that concentrate their efforts on simple elective courses may be illconceived The piecemeal introduction of courses into preclinical curricula is not likely to influence students orientation as much as programs that integrate humanistic concerns into the essential fabric of the curriculum the college associations 1985 survey concluded The survey also found barriers to the introduction of effective programs at many medical schools New programs are timeconsuming to create the most vulnerable to budget axes and not likely to be taken as seriously as established courses it said In addition the report Continued on Page 72 said many medical faculty members though paying lip service to the art of medicine act as if medicine is hard science and humanvalues education is soft and therefore extraneous Some critics like Dr Seidel at Johns Hopkins say that society plays a larger role in tempering physicians attitudes than does education Physicians should always be caring  I dont think thats an issue he says But are we a caring society All these programs wont really matter unless society changes But counters Mr Rothman of Columbias Center for the Study of Society and Medicine The message to future physicians is quite clear that mastery of technology is not the beginning and end of medical education The practice of medicine will require you to navigate in the realm of values and ultimately to respond to more than what is on the chart A T MASSACHUSETTS GENerals walkin clinic Michael Gillette felt that there might be more to the engineers back problem than what was written on his medical chart In his interview with the engineer Mr Gillette was careful to ask openended questions  New Pathway students are urged to encourage patients to explain their agenda their reasons for coming in Although any good doctor ordinarily would try to glean personal information that might pertain to a patients ailment many experts feel that the technological and financial pressures of modern medicine leave little time for this Mr Gillette however had little choice but to ask nonscientific patientcentered questions as an early secondyear student he lacked the medical knowledge to arrive at a diagnosis Compassion is all I can offer he said The engineer told the Harvard student that he had no history of back trouble but his answers indicated that nonphysiological factors might be contributing to his problem There were deadlines to meet at work and at home his wife was eight months pregnant with their first child In the end the physician serving as Mr Gillettes preceptor agreed that the engineer was probably suffering from a herniated disk but he advised the patient to consider waiting several months before having surgery to see whether his pain would lessen when his current stresses subsided Michael Gillette the New Pathway student who provided much of the background that allowed the doctor to make his diagnosis thought his lack of expertise served him well You dont have a lot of the equipment that can impede getting the patients story he said All you have is the ability to interrelate warmly and openly with people He hoped that would make him a better doctor
SING TO HEAVEN A NEW SONG,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/21/books/sing-to-heaven-a-new-song.html,WOMENCHURCH Theology and Practice of Feminist Liturgical Communities By Rosemary Radford Ruether 306 pp San Francisco Harper  Row 1695 FLANNERY OCONNOR once wrote To the deaf you must shout And to the nearblind you must draw large wild pictures Sometimes it seems as though Rosemary Radford Ruether thinks all of us are deaf and nearblind But then one must remember to whom Ms Ruether is used to talking the Roman Catholic Church  an institution not renowned as far as feminists are concerned for its ability either to hear or to see Ms Ruether a professor of theology at GarretEvangelical Theological Seminary in Evanston Ill and author of many books including Sexism and GodTalk deserves a good deal of credit for simply staying in dialogue with this church over the 25 years in which she has taught lectured and written Its no wonder perhaps that in the process she has lost a measure of moderation In the first part of WomenChurch there are two sections the first on theology the second on practice Ms Ruether articulates yet again with brilliance and sway her comprehensive feminist theology She argues broadly that the churches we have inherited have confused patriarchy and Christianity that women have been determinedly erased from religious history and that more specifically a pattern of promise and betrayal toward women has always been characteristic of religious renewal groups She calls for a new kind of community of faith  WomenChurch  to exist side by side not schismatically with parent church institutions She defines WomenChurch as an antihierarchical exodus community of liberation from patriarchy Her thinking as usual is sweeping and synthetic and her historiography is important Still I cant help feeling alienated by her lapses into the unbridled Quoting from a sermon she once delivered she writes The temples of patriarchy have disfigured and hidden our true Mother and Teacher and replaced her with a great mechanical idol with flashing eyes and smoking nostrils who spews out blasphemies and lies Ms Ruether sees her feminism like that of liberation theology as being of a piece with the prophetic tradition that serves to expose in her words the corruption of religion as a justification of oppression and as a means of ignoring the issues of justice In and of itself of course exposing oppression is a worthy undertaking Coupled as it is though with Ms Ruethers heightened prophetic metabolism  vatic blindered occasionally unhinged  it can also point dangerously to a kind of fundamentalism One measure of Catholic feminists fierce debarment from the Church actually can be inferred from how oldfashioned Ms Ruethers feminism is reading WomenChurch  particularly the section on liturgies feels almost like going back in time Where else in this country in this era of assimilation is feminism still reactive angry full of revolutionary intellectual brimstone Ms Ruethers WomenChurch is in the tradition of separatist the last shall be first as opposed to classical the last shall be integrated feminism To be sure she insists that her WomenChurch is separatist only as a stage in a process and not as an ideology But as Cynthia Ozick once pointed out Separatism quickly becomes a characteristic not a strategy of feminism The socalled temporary has an ineluctable inclination to turn into longrange habit Many of the liturgies in WomenChurch Im afraid already bear this tendency out These liturgies were written for many occasions by a variety of women Some representative texts are Ritual of Moving From an Old House to a New House Rite of Healing From an Abortion Good Friday Walk for Justice Puberty Rite for a Young Woman Earth Day Celebration and Menopause Liturgy The fact that women are taking the writing of core liturgies into their own hands  after millenniums  is in and of itself an exciting rite of passage Its fundamental then that these ceremonies be written well By and large they are not  though they do evince a challenging new sense of range for liturgy Part of the problem here is with Ms Ruether herself whose judgments in this section have only to do with the political She seems to have no interest at all in language in what Mircea Eliade calls hierophanies manifestations of the sacred or most importantly in any of the primary questions of liturgy Some of the latter  to suggest just a few  are What is the usefulness of familiar patterns in liturgy What are the problems inherent in crafting new antiques When is prayer a matter of symbolic thinking and when of cognition How does one create esthetic balance in a religious service At what point do prayers become so tailored to the self that they cease to work How is worship different from therapy The writing of good feminist texts is such a critical current religious task that its hard to imagine that a serious book of feminist liturgies has been put together without raising these questions Then too in creating new rites there are respectful questions of psychology to be broached For example how will it feel for a 12yearold to have a group ceremony celebrating her menstruation Or what are the implications of a dying persons telling others through a religious rite what to do after she is dead The results of Ms Ruethers approach in which politics is very often the doctrine for which liturgy is the vehicle a dog wagged by a tail  are more than a few ceremonies with unfortunate lines like these Rapists are the shock troops of patriarchy while wife batterers are the army of occupation from Rite of Healing for Wife Battering This is the apple of consciousness raising Let the scales of false consciousness fall from our eyes    Another knot has to do with Ms Ruethers rather narrow and strenuous definition of authentic liturgy It must be she writes done with real intentionality and meaning and requires a lot of energy    We should properly be both exhilarated and exhausted when we have truly worshiped But isnt the role of prayer  besides exhausting us  also to comfort to provide community to point quietly to eternity To help us be tender toward the smallest things To say thanks To put us in a room with our dead grandparents and the dead very distant generations Doesnt spiritual expansiveness derive often from liturgical simplicity and understatement Isnt liturgy also a matter of cosmic empathy Still despite the narrowness of the terms here there are some wonderful ceremonies among these selections including a very beautiful ComingOut Rite for a Lesbian a sensitive Rite of Healing From a Miscarriage or a Stillbirth a moving and grave Ash Wednesday Liturgy Repentance for the Sins of the Church that involves the singing of two songs simultaneously from opposite sides of the congregation The Churchs One Foundation and Were You There When They Crucified My Lord and a lighthearted Christmas processional that strikes a balance between songs liturgical candles practical information about homelessness and a rowdy party On the other hand various other ceremonies take what feels like a mixandmatch approach to rites employing one or several of the following group hugs candles circles communal baths laying on of hands lying in a circle touching one anothers stomachs sprinkling grains into a furrow around ones house moaning together Some of these ceremonies work reasonably well others dont THERE is a freefloating sense that ones gender somehow posits an intrinsic affinity for anything at all sensate and that only a woman out of touch with her estrogens would be traitorous enough to take issue I take issue not as a traitor at all but out of loyalty to feminism first because the random nature of some of these rites tends to encumber them with selfconsciousness and artificiality second because these rituals are sometimes not statements of liturgy at all but of community of tribe One doesnt create community through group hugs in fact when the community is a real one one generally gets by on much less My main concern of course is that in writing liturgical texts feminists not sequester themselves from other sensibilities from other fields of expertise or from questions of esthetics That would be giving the cause a severe blow Also wouldnt it be more profoundly clever and coherent for Ms Ruether to be arguing strenuously at this point for the aggressive drafting of men into WomenChurch For one thing this would have a prophylactic effect on the writing of rituals and liturgies a crucial endeavor For another it would accelerate bringing the movement into the mainstream  an ultimate goal Ms Ruether claims to be seeking Over this next decade the writing and rewriting of texts will be the homework for feminists in religion Rosemary Radford Ruether as usual is leading the effort There is no doubt that this volume  despite its problems  is a whole step along the way The Talmud tells the story of a student of Rabbi Eliezers who used to study silently After three years the story goes the student forgot everything he learned Fortunately Ms Ruether  though she may talk too loud or draw too large  is in no danger of doing that
AMERICA AND THE CATHOLIC CHURCH: CONFLICTS WITH ROME AND WITHIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/24/world/america-and-the-catholic-church-conflicts-with-rome-and-within.html,Long before it was popular to do so a Roman Catholic clergyman from the United States favored celebrating mass in English instead of Latin the election of the leadership of the American church by its own priests instead of its appointment by Rome and a strong role for the laity The man in question was not a latterday Catholic dissident but John Carroll the first Catholic Bishop of the United States elected by his fellow clergymen in 1789 Pope Pius VI agreed to leave the choice to them which was not unusual at the time The story of Bishop Carroll underlines the unusual role that America has played in the Roman Catholic Church and the fact that conflicts today between Rome and elements of the American church are not new Genuine Conflicts The recent struggles have been bitter however dividing the American church itself And despite the insistence of some American bishops that differences between Rome and American Catholics are exaggerated Vatican officials say the conflicts are genuine and have an importance that transcends the United States The most dramatic cases have included the Vaticans decision to take away some of the powers of Archbishop Raymond G Hunthausen of Seattle and to strip the Rev Charles Curran who has dissented from official teaching on sexuality of his right to teach as a Roman Catholic theologian These cases are only part of a broader questioning of Rome in the United States that includes sharp attacks on the allmale celibate priesthood the churchs teachings on homosexuality birth control abortion and divorce According to a New York Times CBS News Poll in November 1985 a majority of American Catholics favored permitting Catholics to get divorced and marry someone else 73 percent favored the use of artificial methods of birth control 68 percent favored letting Catholic priests marry 63 percent and favored letting women become priests 52 percent The dissent on sexual questions and especially birth control offers the most dramatic and widespread example of diasaffection among many of Americas 52 million Catholics Here in the view of the Vatican is where modernity has made great and dangerous inroads The major problem the hierarchy faces may be that Catholics simply dont believe in hell and eternal punishment the way they used to said Prof Monika Hellwig of Georgetown University president of the Catholic Theological Society of America The American laity especially the collegeeducated she said is well aware that the hierarchy doesnt have many sanctions against them Its harder to frighten them If the changes wrought by the Second Vatican Council 196265 produced ferment and turmoil all over the world the American church went through additional transformations Old ethnic enclaves slowly broke up and millions of American Catholics were shorn from roots Parochial schools tied to the ethnic parishes declined Throughout this century moreover the educational levels of American Catholics have dramatically risen leading to a more inquisitive and in some cases more skeptical flock Above all there were the cultural and sexual revolutions of the 1960s which coincided with the Vatican Council The Rev Thomas Herron of Philadelphia an official of the Congregation for the Doctrine of the Faith the Vatican body charged with safeguarding orthodoxy argued that the Vatican Councils liberalizing effects are often confused with the far broader upheaval in American society People tend to blame the council for many things that had far more to do with the counterculture he said We are still dealing with the effects of an enormous revolution that we still do not fully understand What is clear he said is that the 1960s involved a revolt against authority and few institutions had such a powerful sense of authority as the Catholic Church So the rebellion in the church may have been much stronger than against almost any other institution US Catholics More Faithful Even Vatican officials who see serious problems facing the American church today acknowledge its continued strength and the enormous energy of its members We understand that the Catholic Church in the United States is one of the most dynamic churches in the world said Archbishop Jan Schotte a Belgian who is secretary general of the Synod of Bishops and a key Vatican official Pope John Paul II who will visit the United States next year shares this view said Joaquin Navarro Valls the chief Vatican spokesman The Pope gets labeled as an antiAmerican and its simply not true said Mr Navarro a Spanish layman He doesnt dramatize the problems in the American church In a formal sense at least American Catholics are unusually faithful compared with their counterparts in many Western European countries The American church never suffered from the reactions against stateimposed Catholicism that swept many nations in Europe where the church was frequently allied with monarchy and absolutism This is one reason that the mass attendance rates among American Catholics despite a decline in the 1960s and early 1970s are still among the highest in the world Some estimates show that about half of the Catholics in America attend mass on an average Sunday At the same time the donations of American Catholics have helped to create an extraordinary network of institutions  schools and hospitals universities and publications Yet the very dynamism of the American church helps fuel the controversies within it As descendants of an immigrant minority that struggled to preserve the faith on sometimes hostile territory American Catholics are unusually fierce in holding on to their Catholic identity Being a Catholic is like being a member of a family said Lisa Sowle Cahill a liberal Catholic who is an associate professor of Christian ethics at Boston College You have to be pushed out in order to break with it Its not like any other voluntary organization James P McFadden president of the National Committee of Catholic Laymen a conservative group based in New York agrees albeit from an entirely different perspective He argues that one of the churchs gravest problems is that dissidents refuse to leave You dont need to be Catholic to be Catholic anymore he said If you dissent you dont get out Thats the problem Martin Luther looks like a prince compared to these people because he knew when it was time to go Traditionalists have been heartened  and liberals worried  by John Pauls appointments to the hierarchy of the American church symbolized by New Yorks Archbishop John Cardinal OConnor and Bostons Archbishop Bernard Cardinal Law The John Paul bishops now number about 90 and the steady appointment of more likeminded bishops is expected to push the American church in a more conservative direction However a moderate to liberal coalition led by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago still holds a substantial majority in the National Conference of Catholic Bishops One result of strong loyalties is that anger and hurt are pronounced on both sides of the battlelines in the American church Traditionalists like Mr McFadden complain that those who are less than orthodox are trying to hijack the true church liberals like Ms Cahill complain that traditionalists want to throw them out altogether Such talk underlines one point of agreement between Vatican officials and their critics in the American church that the conflict is not only between liberal American Catholics and the Vatican but also within the American church The internal divisions are clear within the National Conference of Catholic Bishops as well as at the grassroots level An American Answer Write to Rome One priest who is a close aide to the Pope chuckled recently about a letter the Vatican received from an American Catholic The correspondent reported that his parish priest had urged parishioners to protest recent Vatican actions by boycotting the Peters Pence collection that goes to support the Holy See He sent a check for 100 directly to us the priest said because he was afraid his priest wouldnt pass it on Perhaps because of the United States tradition of activism and democracy Vatican officials say traditionalist Catholics in the United States are far more likely than the faithful elsewhere to write to Rome and urge a crackdown against various forms of dissent Americans are used to writing their Congressman and getting action said the Rev Diarmuid Martin an Irishman who is an official of the Pontifical Coucil for the Family So American Catholics who are angry write the Vatican for action The Vatican has acknowledged that a high volume of complaints were a factor in its actions against Archbishop Hunthausen Liberals skeptical of centralized authority and without much hope of finding a sympathetic ear in the Vatican tend to write fewer missives though there has recently been a flow of letters of protest Some liberal Catholics worry that the traditionalists love of letter writing has given the Vatican what Ms Cahill called a distorted view of the American church because the traditionalists often focus on the most extreme and bizarre forms of dissent One Vatican official a European who reads many of the letters of complaint said he believed there was some truth to this assertion But he added that he was nonetheless surprised at some of the amazing things that seem to go on in American church He cited the example of a book used by an American diocese for preparing couples for marriage Its section on the spiritual lives of couples he said began with the question Have you ever thought of praying in the nude Is that really central to the spiritual lives of couples he asked Did it really have to be the first question Dealing With Dissent What Are the Limits The root question in nearly all the disputes involving the American Catholics is the nature of church teachings and the extent to which the church can permit dissent and disobedience The Rev Richard A McCormick a professor of Christian ethics at the University of Notre Dame warned against a static view of orthodoxy which he said amounted to faith in formaldehyde In an important statement of the liberal theological position in America the Jesuit weekly in November Father McCormick wrote One of theologys most important roles is a critical one a distancing from past formulations and the proposal of new ones more adequate to the circumstances and insights of the time Because of the United States democratic tradition and because Roman Catholics have always been a religious minority in a predominantly Protestant nation Catholics in the United States have been among the stoutest defenders inside the church of the idea of freedom of conscience The Second Vatican Councils Declaration of Religious Liberty bore a heavy American imprint notably that of the Jesuit theologian John Courtney Murray who before the council had been virtually silenced under Pope Pius XII Today liberal American Catholics like Bishop James W Malone of Youngstown Ohio a former president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops are at the forefront of the battle for collegiality a diffusion of responsibility to the bishops and the national churches And theologians like Father Curran are leading the battle for the rights of theologians to dissent The Catholic tradition has always emphasized that human reason can reflect on faith said Father Curran a professor at the Catholic University of America in Washington Any tradition that says that faith and human reason cant contradict each other has the tools to deal with these problems But to some Vatican officials as well as to many conservative Catholics in the United States the American liberals often seem intent on watering down the churchs more unpopular teachings The problem in the American church is a problem about the structure of the church and where authority comes from said Mr Navarro the Vatican spokesman The Catholic Church says the bishops get their power as successors to the Apostles and the Pope as successor to St Peter That is the central issue Rocco Buttiglione an Italian who is one of the leading thinkers of Communione e Liberazione a group that strongly supports John Pauls approach echoes the private comments of many Vatican officials when he says Americans often confuse political structures with the church Democracy is a wonderful formula for political society but the church is not a democracy he said Sometimes the church simply has to say unpopular things The Battle Over Sexuality Certainly some of the things that the church has been saying about sexuality and the role of women are unpopular among many American Many Catholics cannot understand why a more modern attitude toward womens roles would shake the foundations of the church or why the birth control pill  invented as it happened by a Roman Catholic  should necessarily undermine the entire structure of Catholic moral teaching The question of womens rights has special resonance in the United States not only because of the strength of its womens movement but also because women  particularly nuns  have played an unusually large role in building American Catholicism The American bishops have encountered difficulty in drafting a pastoral letter on the subject not only because of divisions among them but also because of fears of appearing to move beyond Vatican teaching The sexual revolution may have shaken the Catholic Church more than most other American institutions because the churchs members cleaved so faithfully  and for so long  to traditional morality especially on birth control In a study published in 1963 the Rev Andrew M Greeley the American author and sociologist found substantial acceptance among Catholics of the churchs birth control teaching But between 1963 and 1974 astonishing changes took place opposition to birth control for example fell from 52 percent to 13 percent to divorce from 46 to 25 percent The revolt against the churchs sexual teaching was paralleled by a decline in church attendance and Father Greeley argues that the churchs ban on contraception was the major cause of this disaffection In a carefully worded speech at a bishops synod in Rome in 1980 Archbishop John R Quinn of San Francisco said he supported the churchs teaching on birth control but added a pointed reference to widespread dissent Unless one is willing to dismiss the attitude of all these people as obduracy ignorance or bad will he said this widespread opposition must give rise to serious concern But most Vatican officials and especially the Pope argue that American Catholic dissenters are merely deceiving themselves by claiming that sinful acts are somehow not sinful Man commits sin without calling by name what he does the Pope said in his Easter sermon this year in a typical passage But this is not the way of liberation This is only the way of falsifying the truth A Vatican official added that the Vatican understood the deep cultural revolution that had taken place in the United States but that this only underlined the fundamental question the extent to which church is prepared to resist trends in society that it thinks are wrong Even if this involves some losses in formal allegiance the official said it might be worth some losses to preserve the church But more liberal American Catholics fierce in their identity and accustomed to due process and open debate are not likely to go quietly  if at all  NEXT A more universal church SOME CATHOLICS CALL FOR CHANGE Some say that the official position of the Catholic Church on sexual morals should bot be changed Others say that this position should be changed to reflect trends in the modern world Which point of view more closely reflects your own opinion Practicing Other All Catholics Catholics Catholics Should change 57 46 68 Should not change 36 45 26 No opinion 7 9 6 From a Gallup Poll conducted Sept 317 of phone interviews with 264 Catholics A practicing Catholic is defined as a church member who attends mass weekly and who describes religion as very important in his or her life The sample was about evenly divided between practicing Catholics and others The margin of sampling error is plus or minus 8 percentage points
THE ARTS: NEWS AND REVIEWS; RE-ENACTED RAGEDIES OF STREET LIFE BRING HELP TO JUNIOR HIGH STUDENTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/theater/arts-reviews-re-enacted-ragedies-street-life-bring-help-junior-high-students.html,THEY perform plays about cocaine incest teenage pregnancy fallen heroes and broken dreams Off Broadway No junior high schools so students can watch on stage dramas that mirror life in the streets A college basketball star smokes a crack pipe a father forces himself on his daughter a man flings his wife across the kitchen table  not ordinary fare for auditoriums in junior high schools But the Creative Arts Team a theater company in residence at the Gallatin Division of New York University is no ordinary troupe Its members work both on stage and in the classroom A week before a performance the actors conduct theaterineducation workshops in the classroom usually for seventh and eighthgraders to improve literacy skills particularly among disadvantaged youths Students write endings to different scenes they have read and the actors stay in character after performing scenes to discuss the conflicts of the drama with students Drama helps students understand the choices they face in their personal lives school officials say and helps them talk about problems they might otherwise repress The dramas are particularly helpful for poor youngsters and those from broken homes because they often think they will suffer the same misfortunes that have befallen their families and communities 12 Plays in 12 Years Drama is something very young people understand said Charlotte Frank executive director of curriculum and instruction for the New York City Board of Education Very often children cannot articulate their problems But when they see the situation on stage their lives are crystallized in that moment In its 12 years the Creative Arts Team has produced 12 plays all written in house The 30member company has contracts to perform in nine city school districts which contribute 40 percent of the groups budget The team also receives city and state money While most of the companys work is done in New York City performances have been given at the Kennedy Center in Washington and in Miami and Detroit The group estimates that 240000 students have seen it perform School officials for the city direct the company in selecting subjects for the dramas Topics have included the disintegrative effects of drugs on a family in a story inspired by the cocainerelated death of Len Bias the basketball star the cyclical nature of family violence in which victims of child abuse become perpetrators in adulthood and teenage violence and sexuality Joe Louis and Rosa Parks Two historical plays have been produced One a story of two heavyweight boxers Joe Louis and Max Schmeling depicts their lives in the Depression in the United States and in Nazi Germany It describes their two championship bouts showing exploitation of each man by his country The second was a play about Rosa Parks the black seamstress who in 1955 refused to sit in the back of a bus in Montgomery Ala defying racial segregation laws and helping spark the civil rights movement Some of the plays deal with such issues as abortion and drug use which were rarely discussed openly in junior high schools 20 years ago The scenario on the street  drugs sex teenage pregnancy  is a lot more stark than whats happening on stage said Cynthia Dantzler an official in Public School 26 in the BedfordStuyvesant section of Brooklyn Some of the principals may be taken aback by the plays at first but the kids fall right into it It is this gritty realism on stage in word and action  that draws students into the story and makes its message meaningful In the play on family violence which will be touring New York State next year a woman fends off her threatening husband with a hot iron One more step and youre pressed for life she yells I mean it Steam or dry Moments later the husband flings her bellyfirst onto the kitchen table cutting her lip Later their son describes cigarette burns he received from his mother She said she had to burn the evil out of me I love my mama Sometimes I was her darling son And sometimes her ashtray The Rape Scene In the same play which was written by James P Mirrione and Diane Houston a teenage girl in another family is raped by her father The girl is preparing for a prom in her room and the father says he wants to teach her how to slow dance After they begin he holds her closer I can feel your heart beating inside your dress he says It makes your dress move Thats because yourre not a little girl anymore  youre a real woman now The girl tries to struggle free but her father tightens his grip overpowering her He slowly pushes her down she screams Daddy and the lights go out Its chilling everytime I see it and the audience is left gasping said Mimi Flaherty the program director of the Creative Arts Team After the play she said the students are reminded that the girl was raped and that she was not at fault School officials say they know the team is effective because students approach them after a performance to discuss personal problems that have been depicted on stage Indeed even though the dramas are of despair the message to students is that they can control their own lives but that they must be willing to share their problems with others When a play is over students are asked what different choices the characters could have made to avert the trauma that occurred on stage The actors then replay several scenes based on the advice of the students The characters are given a second chance which for some students is where the drama on stage departs from life in the streets
"WIVES, MISTRESSES AND WORKING WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/28/books/wives-mistresses-and-working-women.html,THE MOTHER OF DREAMS And Other Short Stories Portrayals of Women in Modern Japanese Fiction Edited by Makoto Ueda 279 pp New York Kodansha International 1995 MAKOTO UEDA the editor of this noteworthy anthology of modern Japanese short stories has divided the book into five sections the Maiden the Wife the Mistress the Mother and the Working Woman It is an indication that the influence of roles even with the changes in postwar Japan is still felt The authors are all established among them the 1968 Nobel laureate Yasunari Kawabata and other popular writers such as Kobo Abe Kafu Nagai and Fumiko Enchi  and include an almost equal number of men and women writers Readers be warned that the table of contents lists the authors in the traditional Japanese order with surnames first The surface of these stories mostly written since World War II is often deceptively placid The writing is spare Because the stories have various translators all in fact students of Mr Ueda who teaches at Stanford University  it is hard to measure how much of the voice and style of a story is the authors own Some are smoother than others Still throughout the placid prose there is strong emotion In A Woman to Call Mother by Taiko Hirabayashi a daughters failure to visit her dying mother is an indication that their emotions were too strong By refraining from frenzied description the writer renders the drama in a story all the more powerfully The women themselves are quite powerful whether they are waitresses secretaries art dealers ballerinas or housewives Overwhelming emotion often propels them out of their roles In Ms Hirabayashis story a dancer cannot resist an affair with her daughters fiance and regrets it all her life The less dramatic actions have their own import within a womans world The wives who set aside Sunday afternoons for themselves in Sakae Tsubois Umbrella on a Moonlit Night are taking a small step by most standards but a large one for them and their families The woman in Be It Ever So Humble by Yoko Mori takes lovers in order to appreciate more keenly her life at home After the bleakness of their clandestine lovemaking it was a pleasant thought to know a husband and home awaited her no matter how small and humble that home was She even saw herself as a happy woman Overwhelmed by love these women are at their Continued on next page most fierce In Pheasant by Harumi Setouchi the heroines love sought to fulfill rather than be fulfilled Most men were unable to take on her vast love it flooded over them and they ended up being swept off their feet by its waves In the end men who were loved by Makiko all became unhappy These stories are as much about dreams as they are about women Desire suppressed finds its way into other more surreal settings into dreams The fabric between dream life and waking life is a very thin membrane People appear in dreams with as strong an assurance as they do in life sometime more A longabsent daughter first appears in the dreams of Ms Setouchis heroine before the woman actually realizes the keenness of her loss The Mother of Dreams by Shohei Ooka is simply the telling of one dream after another the repeated appearance of a dead mother in a mans dreams The images in many of the stories seem to me to come straight from Japanese paintings  mountains and clouds pebbles and rivers mist and the outline of branches The selection of details is particular and quite lovely Raindrops on a train window described by Kawabata stop momentarily move a little stop again then move again RESTRAINT is especially effective in the telling of violence The abortion in Ms Setouchis Pheasant is so gruesome it gives an observing journalist visions of expanding horror Admidst the clotting blood a white thing that looked like chicken fat suddenly came out It was a bit of the fetus In Makikos vision innumerable eyeless noseless fetal phantoms lined up in jostling heaps like the gray tombstones at Adashino making her want to scream out in terror The description of a young girls death in Kawabatas Socks is quiet as if viewed through soundproof glass and most disturbing Her body tensed her arms reached upward and her clenched fists shook convulsively When the fit subsided her head slumped to the left side of her pillow It was then that a white tapeworm slowly crawled out of her halfopen mouth I was struck by the presence of death in these stories Suicide appears frequently matteroffactly The dead do not stay in that other world In Kawabatas mythlike Beyond Death a girl a suicide strolls a golf course accompanying her beloved to his death 50 years after her own Song of a Dead Girl by Kobo Abe is just that narrated by a suicide who finds herself to her disappointment still stuck in this world sitting in a cinema with twice as many dead as there were living Then with a comic shrug If they were all to come alive again I thought the theater could really make a lot of money The satisfactions these women find have more to do with having chosen a way to live apart from predetermined roles than with having found a traditional happy way to live They have a dignity these bold ones but they pay the price for it The last story by Yumie Hiraiwa Lady of the Evening Faces ends when a woman leaves her husband the classic act of liberation She was indeed lonely but she was free From then on she would be able to live just for herself She noticed that the men and women walking about town thinking the same way were surprisingly numerous They all strutted triumphantly along the chasms of the city wearing the elegant expressions of the single nobility Mieko left in the evening and lost herself in their throng
ABOUT EDUCATION; THE YEAR FOR VALUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1986/12/30/science/about-education-the-year-for-values.html,VALUES was the buzz word of education in 1986 Stern demands for the teaching of values came from liberal Democrats like Governor Cuomo as well as conservatives like William J Bennett the Secretary of Education Why Probably because values seemed in short supply everywhere from Wall Street to Washington As usual the schools were asked to undo societys failure But they got little help in defining the values they were expected to teach Threats to the nations economic competitiveness also raised demands for a response from the schools particularly for better science teaching Ironically at the same time fundamentalists sought to elevate creationism to a science and to give it equal time with the teaching of evolution Arguments over creation science went to the Supreme Court in a suit brought by Louisianas Attorney General against the states education authorities The attorney general was supported by religious fundamentalists and conservative groups the educators were backed by many scientists and liberals A decision is expected next year Fundamentalists achieved a striking victory in Federal District Court in Greeneville Tenn when Judge Thomas Gray Hull ruled that parents of children in public schools had the right to let their children leave the classroom whenever something being read or discussed offended their religious values Among offending readings The Wizard of Oz Anne Franks Diary of a Young Girl and a chapter about the origin of tidal waves Advocates of educational excellence also took to the field Bill Honig Californias Superintendent of Public Instruction rejected many science and mathematics texts from major publishers as academically inferior A study commissioned by People for the American Way a liberal organization concerned with constitutional issues found dramatic improvements in American history textbooks Its only major criticism was that while history textbooks talk about American religious diversity they do not show it For example the study found that the books omit the role of religion in social movements such as Prohibition antiwar protests and the abortion debate In 1986 the focus of educational criticism shifted to higher education Ernest L Boyer president of the Carnegie Corporation for the Advancement of Teaching who three years ago published High School a critique of secondary education this year followed up with College The Undergraduate Experience in America He found conflict between careerism and general education faculty neglect of undergraduate teaching and excessive catering to the market place As one department chairman at a midWestern college put it Theyre trying to turn this college into a supermarket where were willing to put anything in the catalog so long as it will sell Still escalating college costs without additional financial aid to students threatens to create two categories of colleges  one for the rich the other for the rest A notable change in 1986 was a recognition that education cannot be improved by legislation alone teachers were more widely recognized as the key to better schools Their preparation the 1986 reform proposals insisted must concentrate on the subjects they will teach Pedagogy should be left largely to a years study toward a master of education and a year or two of supervised internship in the classroom Proposals by the Carnegie report A Nation Prepared Teachers for the 21st Century and others stressed that teachers must also be treated as professionals they should be allowed to reach goals set by school boards and legislatures in their own ways and with materials of their own choice As the Federal Government withdrew to the sidelines there was new activism among ggovernors who equate better schools with a better economy Dropouts remained educations dark side Lack of jobs after graduation undermined the incentive to stay in school Deficiency in reading and writing creates an unemployable underclass Teenage pregancy leads many girls to drop out of school and become dependent on welfare The year heard heated debate over the schools efforts to reduce unwanted pregnancies by providing birth control information and devices Arguments raged over behavior control as against birth control between preaching and prevention Early childhood education began to get a hearing as a partial solution Experiments have shown that a nurturing and instructive environment for 3yearolds can dramatically reduce learning problems teenage pregnancies and antisocial behavior later on Finally after college students had been targets of criticism for being selfcentered and apathetic they returned to greater activism Their protests  far milder than recent student actions in France and China over such issues as apartheid in South Africa and discrimination at home or over American foreign policies may not please campus management Still it suggests that whatever may be lacking in formal teaching values of conscience are not dead

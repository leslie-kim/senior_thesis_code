"SUPREME COURT; IN A 3-MONTH SESSION, A BUSY DOCKET",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/01/us/supreme-court-in-a-3-month-session-a-busy-docket.html,The coming of the New Year finds that the Supreme Court has barely scratched the surface of its 198283 term But while nine decisions down and perhaps 150 to go is not much of a scorecard the first three months were not idle Screening more than 2000 appeals the Justices selected 70 for argument and decision These new cases added to those already on the calendar when the term opened filled in the last available argument slots and gave the term its final shape To a docket already laden with cases in which the Reagan Administration has a substantial political stake the Court added cases on the constitutionality of a tax deduction for private and parochial school tuition on a judicial overriding of ordinary seniority rules to protect recently hired black employees from layoffs and on the Administrations repeal of the rule requiring air bags or automatic seat belts for new cars An already heavy criminal docket became weightier with the Courts announcement Nov 29 that it would decide whether to modify the rule that bars illegally seized evidence from use at trial The new cases will be argued in the spring with decisions due in July Still to come are decisions in most major cases with which the Court began the term including the legislative veto abortion cases and the socalled Bob Jones case on the tax status of discriminatory private schools Here are some highlights of the recent additions to the Courts calendar Religion The Courts ruling on the constitutionality of Minnesotas tuition tax deduction could determine the fate of the Reagan Administrations proposal for a Federal tax credit for private and parochial school tuition A Federal appeals court upheld the Minnesota law on the ground that by permitting deductions for some public school expenses as well as for private and parochial school tuition the law was nominally neutral Taxpayers challenging the law argue that because its benefits flow almost entirely to parents with children in parochial schools a result the Reagan plan would also achieve the law is a thinly disguised state subsidy of religious education The Administration will file a brief defending the law Mueller v Allen No 82195 The Court will also decide whether a legislature can constitutionally employ a chaplain to lead its members in prayer The case Marsh v Chambers No 8223 is an appeal by Nebraska where the Legislature has for years begun each days session with a prayer by a Presbyterian minister whose salary the state pays A Federal appeals court said the financial arrangement though not necessarily the act of prayer itself was unconstitutional Congress and many states have salaried chaplains and the Justice Department has joined the states appeal Discrimination A Federal judge ordered Boston to preserve racial balance won for its Police and Fire Departments when a fiscal crisis forced layoffs Some senior white officers lost their jobs while the jobs of newly hired blacks and Hispanic people were saved The Reagan Administration filed a brief supporting the police and fire unions challenge Boston Firefighters v Boston NAACP No 82185 Arizona is appealing a ruling that its state employees retirement plan violates the Civil Rights Act of 1964 by permitting the purchase of annuities that pay men higher monthly benefits than women whose policies have the same dollar value The insurance business is interested in the case Arizona v Norris No 8252 because nearly all annuities work the same way Women receive less per month on the actuarial assumption that they will live longer than men A third discrimination case involves privileges under the Federal tax laws Federal law permits veterans organizations to lobby without losing their taxexempt status but denies 300000 taxexempt charitable organizations the same privilege The Government is appealing a decision by the Federal appeals court here that the law violates the equal protection rights of the nonveterans charities Regan v Taxation With Representation No 812338 Criminal Law A gardenvariety search warrant case argued in October with minimal attention was turned into a major case a month later The Court said it would use it as a vehicle for deciding whether to modify the exclusionary rule which bars illegally seized evidence from use at trial Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Associate Justice William H Rehnquist have campaigned against the exclusionary rule for years and may finally have picked up the votes they need to overturn the Courts precedents The most likely change would be some form of good faith exception to the rule The Administration has proposed legislation to effect such a change Illinois v Gates No 81430 Federal Regulation The Court has accepted four separate Government appeals of decisions in which the Federal appeals court here refused to defer to a Federal regulatory agencys interpretation of its authority In the air bag case the Court of Appeals blocked the Reagan Administration from rescinding a rule requiring air bags or automatic seat belts on all new cars The rule was 14 years in the making Its rescission was to have been a centerpiece of the Administrations antiregulatory policy The appeals court said the action was arbitrary and capricious and ordered that the rule take effect next fall Motor Vehicle Manufacturers v State Farm Insurance No 82354 The Court of Appeals invalidated rules adopted by the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission to carry out a 1978 energy law and force utilities to cooperate in developing alternative sources of energy The case American Paper Institute v American Electric Power finds the Administration and the utility industry on opposite sides Two other regulatory cases deal with nuclear power in addition to a case on the validity of Californias moratorium on nuclear power plant construction to be argued Jan 17 The Nuclear Regulatory Commission and the utility that runs Three Mile Island in Pennsylvania are challenging the appeals courts order that psychological stress in the community must be taken into account in deciding whether to restart the Unit No 1 reactor shut down since 1979 when its twin Unit No 2 was damaged in the countrys worst commercial nuclear accident Metropolitan Edison v People Against Nuclear Energy No 812399 In the other case the appeals court invalidated the Nuclear Regulatory Commissions policy of refusing to consider environmental consequences of nuclear waste when deciding whether to license a nuclear power plant Many utilities have joined the Governments appeal Baltimore Gas  Electric v Natural Resources Defense Council No 82524
STARTING WITH EVE; BY LAWRENCE STONE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/02/books/starting-with-eve-by-lawrence-stone.html,A HISTORY OF WOMENS BODIES By Edward Shorter 398 pp New York Basic Books 2495 Up till now womens bodies have had a good press Artists have nearly always thought well of them Initially their reproductive and nurturing potentialities were stressed but more recently the emphasis has been upon the erotic aspects of the female nude This is hardly surprising given the human males hairtrigger response to visual stimuli Biologists have been equally flattering about womens bodies as reproductive machines that turn out children in such numbers that today man has crowded most other mammals off the face of the earth leaving only the insects to compete Demographers have found that womens bodies last longer than those of men that their life expectancy at birth is higher The economic historians when they stop to think about the matter also have nothing but praise for womens bodies which have adapted remarkably to the long backbreaking bending work in the fields imposed by postneolithic agriculture Finally the sexologists are falling all over themselves in praise of womens bodies Women are almost unique in the animal world in being sexually responsive at all times They may be sexually active for decades after the end of their reproductive cycle And they are endowed with a capacity not merely for orgasm not needed for reproduction but for almost innumerable multiple orgasms In this last respect women are to men as an AK47 automatic rifle is to a 16thcentury musket Hitherto only two serious criticisms have been leveled against womens bodies as designed by nature apart from the trivial one that the clitoris seems to be inefficiently sited The first is the liability of the breasts to cancer and the second is the narrowness of the pelvis The human head has become so large because of an increase in brain size that the infant cranium often has considerable difficulty in forcing its way through the birth canal The result is often excruciating pain for the mother and sometimes the death of both mother and child Bay and large however the testimony of 5000 years has been flattering to the female body Not any more Edward Shorter a historian who is largely concerned with the internal plumbing of the female body regards it as an almost unmitigated disaster area at least before about 1920 He sees it partly as one of natures botched jobs partly as a mess made infinitely worse by exploitative husbands ignorant folk customs and harmful medical interventions His picture of the traditional past is grim indeed Women were brutally treated by men whose sexual demands forced usually unwanted and always dangerous pregnancies on women and whose economic exploitation condemned their wives to endless toil in the home and the fields Mr Shorters view of Western family relationships before the late 19th century closely resembles that of the inhabitants of Tierra del Fuego when Charles Darwin encountered them Finding that in a hard winter they were in the habit of killing and eating some of their women Darwin asked one of them why they did it Why no eat dog The answer was simple Dog catch otter Woman no catch otter Woman good for nothing Man hungry Mr Shorter whose last book was The Making of the Modern Family regards even sex in this traditional pre20thcentury society as nothing more than brief and brutal coupling an outcome of ramrod impetuosity closer to rape than to an act of love Much of his book however is devoted to the horrors of childbirth and attendant gynecological disease Mr Shorter paints a terrifying and nauseating picture though he concedes that the expectation of life for pre20thcentury women was greater than that of men before the age of 16 and after 40 He claims that in womens fertile years it was 25 percent less a figure I find roughly acceptable He utterly demolishes once and for all the fashionable feminist romanticization of the ignorant old midwife of the past She would not leave well enough alone when she ought to have done so She punctured the amniotic sac with a long dirty fingernail she tore open the cervix with grubby hands she sped delivery by pressing on the stomach with all her weight Mr Shorter agrees with a description of midwives in 1690 as these great tuggers of womens bodies When things went wrong as they did in 5 percent of all cases the midwives either pulled the infant out of the womb by brute force sometimes tearing off the childs head or arm in the process or else just gave up and left mother and child to die Even more widespread was the danger of sepsis after delivery also largely caused by the dirty probing fingers of the midwives It was he argues medically trained male obstetricians with their improved forceps and greater technical knowledge who rescued women from some of these disasters Mr Shorter then moves on to another horror story that of gynecological diseases He describes in revolting detail the variety of common vaginal discharges all noisome and painful Since he claims women never washed their bodies and rarely changed their clothes the stench can easily be imagined Only after about 1930 he believes did women cease to smell bad Difficult childbirth also did awful things to some women It caused ruptures of the vagina through to the bladder or the colon Sometimes the uterus was pulled out by a midwife along with the afterbirthThe result Mr Shorter says is that women were sick most of the time and that pain was a normal part of their lives All this changed he tells us about 1920 thanks to modern medicine which provided women with antiseptic and painless delivery contraception abortion antibiotics At last women felt well and smelled good and men were even nice to thema product of the affectionate marriage As a result women were now ready to embark on the great adventure of feminism What are we to make of this ambitious and more than a little melodramatic story First we have to note that Mr Shorter takes the bulk of his data from reports by European male doctors who mostly saw the sick and not the healthy and had a professional ax to grind against midwives Moreover Mr Shorter seems to forget that in the past everyone of both sexes was far sicker and smellier than we are today Of that there is no question Both sexes were smaller more stunted more crippled more in pain they aged faster and they lived half as long as we do But the fact is that most women seem to have gone about their business despite the numerous pregnancies and that more wives outlived their husbands than vice versa Moreover Mr Shorter entirely disregards perceptions Death and disease were commonplace in traditional society and although women feared childbirth they were taught to regard it as their natural duty and accordingly were proud of it Indeed some scholars argue that menopause was psychologically far more traumatic in the past than today just because it deprived women of what they regarded as their prime purpose in life reproduction No one doubts that both the birthrate and female disease declined in the 1920s and 1930s but the role of such change as a precondition for feminism is unclear After all the first feminist movementto obtain the franchiseoccured in the first two decades of this century before the medical revolution In any case Mr Shorters singlecause explanation of the takeoff of feminism is wholly implausible since it ignores almost entirely other critical factors like the spread of ideas of equality and the moral collapse of patriarchy To conclude Mr Shorter exaggerates and distorts the extent of female disease in the past and when it comes to explaining the rise of feminism in the 20th century he fails even to mention other economic social intellectual and cultural factors He destroys his own case All that is left is something most of us knew alreadyno golden age lies out there in the past before the advent of modern science industry and medicine and a convincing demolition of the myth of the totally virtuous untrained midwife
"FOR NEW YORK'S NEW LEADER, A DAY OF FAMILY AND ROOTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/02/nyregion/for-new-york-s-new-leader-a-day-of-family-and-roots.html,For Mario M Cuomo it was a day to celebrate his family and his immigrant roots to pay magnificent tribute to American democracy and to wonder at the improbability of it all Ive been waiting for the moment of exhilaration he told reporters before he spoke the oath as Governor of New York State today Ive been waiting for euphoria Maybe it comes when you put up your hand Youre under oath You are going to make a pact with 18 million people I take a contract seriously In a private ceremony on New Years Eve and again in a tumultuous formal inauguration today with music song and poetry Governor Cuomo spoke with emotion of his parents Andrea and Immaculata Cuomo the magnificent immigrant couple who came here with nothing but aspirations and a willingness to work hard A Magnificent Tribute He said it has to be a magnificent tribute to American democracy that their son who was born behind a grocery store in South Jamaica would get to occupy the highest seat in the greatest state in the greatest nation and the only world we know Mr Cuomo bought a new blue suit for the occasion and between moments of solemnity seemed to relish his first day in office exchanging New Years greetings with state troopers and bantering with reporters who followed him everywhere And even as plants and files from the cramped Lieutenant Governors office were being moved to the Governors spacious office on the second floor of the Capitol he seemed somewhat astonished about the transformation Curiously Beautiful Thing Its a good feeling you know you can get things done he said As Lieutenant Governor his views were often overlooked he said Before when I pushed on the stone nothing happened he said Now when I push on it it moves He described the day as a curiously beautiful thing resulting from an extraordinary combination of circumstances to create a situation where I get to be Governor I wont trace back the improbability of it all he said if we consider where we came from and what we have been Mr Cuomo spoke today of the Family of New York but it was also a day for the Cuomo family As they arrived from Queens in a chartered bus his youngest child Christopher 12 years old immediately ran through the Schuyler Mansion the Governors official residence exploring everywhere Mr Cuomos wife Matilda clasped a bouquet of roses presented by the state trooper who stands watch over the mansion After a night of parties at the mansion with relatives and close friends Mr Cuomo slept for four hours dressed and strolled down the street for a New Years Day mass at the Cathedral of the Immaculate Conception His wife was at his side along with his older son Andrew 25 who was later sworn in as a special assistant to the Governor Mr Cuomos other children  Dr Margaret Perpignano who was married during the campaign last fall Maria 20 Madeline 18 and Christopher  trailed behind with a host of inlaws In church he knelt in his seat for many minutes in silent prayer with his hands clasped and folded over the front of the pew Mrs Cuomo sat silently tears glistening in her eyes in the lights of television cameras A baby cried in the background Bishop Joseph Sullivan of Brooklyn offered a prayer for the Cuomo administration  that they may be inspired to be strong and caring shepherds The Bishop listed ways he thought Mr Cuomo could use the power of the state wisely including protecting the rights of the unborn a reference to the abortion issue Nothing New in What He Said Mr Cuomo who has pledged to uphold the rights of women to obtain legal abortions said later that Bishop Sullivan was merely reiterating the views of the Catholic Conference of Bishops There was nothing new in what he said Mr Cuomo said Mr Cuomo presided over a swearingin ceremony for 18 members of his staff and then moved into the Governors office while a procession of congressmen state legislators judges of the Court of Appeals members of the Board of Regents and others filed into the New York State Convention Center As the orchestra took up Beethovens Ode to Joy from the Ninth Symphony Mr Cuomo and his wife walked side by side through the cavernous convention center There with Mrs Cuomo holding the family Bible he took the oath of office In the last few days he noted in his inaugural address many people had reminded him that he faces difficult decisions in closing a budget gap of more than 1 billion next year Yet during the morning swearingin of his staff the Governor looked across the room to his secretary Michael J Del Giudice and at the same moment they both said in mock astonishment This is tough
The Baby Dam,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/02/opinion/the-baby-dam.html,The United States enters 1983 with 234 million inhabitants Thats four million more than in 1980 births are increasing and some people think a new baby boom has begun Baloney The apt question about births at this birth of a new year is why there are so few Its true that for nine years the number of births has been inching up but thats only part of the story The number of potential mothers has been zooming up In 1960 there were 36 million women aged 15 to 44 and they bore 43 million babies Today there are about 54 million and they bore 36 million babies in 1982 In other words for every two potential mothers in 1960 there are three now Yet they are having many fewer children If their fertility rate were anything like that of their mothers births now would be six and a half million a year not three and a half million When potential mothers are up 50 percent an increase in births of barely 1 percent a year is no boom its barely a blip The arresting fact is the steep difference between those two figures  the Baby Dam Why are so many women forbearing babies instead of bearing them Or having fewer If the pattern persists as is probable what are the consequences Forecasting fertility is a chancy business All the experts were confounded by the huge baby boom of the late 40s and 50s Still there are reasonable grounds for speculating that fertility will remain low One reason is technology Contraceptives and abortion are widely available often supplemented by amniocentesis tests during pregnancy While social attitudes might imaginably change to inhibit abortions a sharp turn against contraception is well inconceivable Meanwhile the education level for women keeps improving The better educated the woman the more likely she is to work for satisfaction  and the less likely to have a large family A young woman fresh out of law school say is reluctant to leap into marriage and childbearing postponing entry into the legal job market until her training has faded from mind Personal satisfaction parallels this career reason Young men and women want sports cars home computers culture  and seem less eager for marriage and childrearing responsibilities than prior generations Charles Westoff a demographer once described this change in global terms in Scientific American Developed countries have seen a transformation in the economic value of children from a source of income in agrarian economies to a considerable drain on income in industrial and postindustrial economies Which of these factors abortion aside is likely to change None For they all turn on a factor that precedes the decision to have a child greater freedom for women There are many reasons to be glad that births are low and stable Sharp jumps in population size inevitably mean sharp competition for classroom seats then jobs then pensions they wrench a society But the best reason is that millions of women feel increasingly free to follow a variety of life models free to find fulfillment out of as well as in the nursery As long as thats what they want to do the Baby Dam will hold
LEGISLATIVE SESSION EXPECTED TO FOCUS ON BUDGET DEFICIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/03/nyregion/legislative-session-expected-to-focus-on-budget-deficit.html,The New York State Legislature returns to Albany this week to confront a faltering state economy and a potential budget deficit of more than 1 billion that will largely shape  and limit  its actions in many areas The 206th session of the Assembly and Senate which opens Wednesday will also face many other issues  from retraining laidoff steel workers to requests for increased aid for New York City to reorganizing state agencies and rebuilding roads and bridges It will be presented with a series of proposals from the new Governor Mario M Cuomo who has pledged to do more than simply balance the budget But with the state borrowing 300 million to pay its bills this fiscal year  and facing a much larger potential problem next year  the session may put Governor Cuomos pledge to a severe test PostElection Budget Blues Its going to be a very heavy dollar year said James L Biggane the Senates chief fiscal aide There may not be anything beyond that Political leaders and their aides have listed other issues the Legislature may confront this year But all will be considered against a backdrop of what one lobbyist called the postelection budget blues The following are some of the issues  The Metropolitan Transportation Authority may be abolished or substantially reshaped After approving a tax surcharge last month to save bus subway and commuter rail fares many legislators called for major changes in the management of the mass transit system to make it more accountable Governor Cuomo has long supported the move for change and one proposal under discussion would put the MTA under direct control of the State Transportation Department  Governor Cuomo has also called for changes in the way the Public Service Commission sets utility rates which have more than tripled since 1975 The Legislature may also intervene to prevent large rate increases on Long Island when the Shoreham nuclear power plant goes into full operation  New sources of financing will be sought to rebuild the states infrastructure  its system of roads bridges and water supply This could take the form of general obligation bonds taxes dedicated to road and bridge repair state appropriations or a new state authority  With the closing of the Bethlehem Steel plant in Lackawanna NY and the loss of 7000 jobs attention has been focused on job retraining and economic development programs Financing for joint stateprivate high technology centers at colleges in the state is planned and the Assembly has proposed a system of aid to retrain workers who have lost jobs in declining industries  The death penalty and proposals to ban Medicaid financing of abortions will be back But Governor Cuomo has pledged to veto death penalty legislation as Governor Carey did before him and civilliberties groups are predicting that support for these causes has diminished in the new Legislature  The Legislature is facing a deadline this spring on pension plans for 300000 state workers Newly hired state and local government employees contribute to their pensions and receive fewer benefits than older workers under a formula that unions say is unfair The older workers do not contribute Government and business groups favor the current system Last year with the Legislature unable to solve the dispute the plan was extended for one year  To close his own budget deficit and prevent the layoff of 6600 city workers Mayor Koch is counting of 300 million in new state aid including increases in education aid and the state takeover of Medicaid costs In addition the Mayor has proposed a menu of 14 taxes a combination of which is needed to raise 300 million to close next years city budget deficit Most of these will require approval of the State Legislature  Efforts to restore the J51 housing program are expected The program which provides tax benefits for rehabilitiation projects expired last year after a dispute between the city and Democratic Assemblymen over its use in the development of luxury housing These issues will be considered by a Legislature whose power structure is little changed by the November elections The Republicans remain firmly in control of the Senate while the Democrats in the Assembly sharply increased their majority in the 150seat house to 98 from 88  the largest Democratic majority since 1913 The biggest change is of course in the Governors office Legislators are hoping that proposals that had been opposed by Gov Hugh L Carey will get new life These include barring mandatory retirement provisions for all workers and reductions in paper work requirements for small businesses At this point we want to hear what the new Governor has to offer said a spokesman for Warren M Anderson the Senate majority leader But before most other issues are reached the Legislature must grapple with the budget which is being hit by what Ralph Laws the Assemblys chief fiscal aide called an extraordinary set of events The recession has cut into tax revenues and the state must pay for the current fiscal years deficit of about 300 million 485 million in salary increases for state employees and 200 million in increases in education aid approved last year In addition a partial takeover of local Medicaid costs also approved last year would cost 360 million The takeover would bring the states potential deficit to more than 1 billion Governor Cuomo has been a leading proponent of the state takeover but has said he is not sure the state can now afford it Balancing the budget will require either new taxes cuts in state programs or local aid or a combination of the three Governor Cuomo has opposed raising the income sales or business taxes but legislative fiscal aides say he may have little choice Last year the Legislature overrode a series of vetoes by Governor Carey and the states budget was not approved until after the formal dedline had passed Few legislators expect the April 1 deadline to be met this year Among other issues the Legislature is expected to face are the following Criminal Justice Governor Cuomo and key legislators are all talking about improving coordination of the courts police the prison system probation and parole Under an Assembly plan a Criminal Justice Agency would be set up to coordinate the budgets and rules of 10 state agencies The Legislature is also expected to take up several plans to change the sentencing system Under the plans judges would be given statewide guidelines for giving criminals a fixed sentence for a particular crime The Legislature is also expected to grapple with the problem of housing a rapidly growing prison population The Environment The law requiring a 5cent deposit on bottles of beer and soda sold in New York State takes effect July 1 and supporters are expecting the industry to put forward proposals to change the law and delay its implementation Court of Appeals A proposal to change the way candidates for the Court of Appeals are nominated is expected from Governor Cuomo The proposal would increase the number of nominees a nominating panel can submit to him and would change its voting procedures Mr Cuomo is expected to name five new Court of Appeals judges during the next four years
98TH CONGRESS OPENS WITH CALLS FOR BIPARTISAN EFFORT ON ECONOMY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/04/us/98th-congress-opens-with-calls-for-bipartisan-effort-on-economy.html,The 98th Congress opened for business today and leaders from both parties called for greater bipartisan cooperation to deal with the countrys economic problems I will do everything I can to prevent a stalemate from happening in the 98th Congress said Representative Thomas P ONeill Jr the Massachusetts Democrat who was reelected Speaker of the House The American people want action not partisan bickering Republicans said they would extend an olive branch to the Democrats and they hinted that President Reagan might also be ready to make compromises on economic matters Contrary to popular belief the President is flexible said Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader But the spirit of comity did not last long as House Democrats pushed through new parliamentary rules designed to tighten party discipline and increase the power of the Speaker New Rules Denounced Most Republicans and a few Democrats denounced the changes which were described by Representative Robert J Lagomarsino Republican of California as an attempt to run roughshod over the rights of individual members of this body on both sides of the aisle whenever they disagree with the views of the leadership The Democrats decided to discipline Representative Phil Gramm Democrat of Texas by throwing him off the influential Budget Committee Many Democrats considered Mr Gramm a traitor for helping plan President Reagans budget strategy in the last Congress and he did not help his party standing today by voting against the rules changes The only other Democrat to break ranks was Representative Larry P McDonald of Georgia The decision on Mr Gramm was made by the Steering and Policy Committee a panel of leading House Democrats that decides all committee assignments for the party The vote was 26 to 4 against the Texas Democrat who has said he might consider switching parties if the Democrats punished him The days events signified how far the Congressional mood has shifted since two years ago when the 97th Congress opened riding the crest of Republican triumphs and itching to enact the Reagan economic program of lower taxes smaller social programs and bigger military buildups 26 More House Democrats The House members sworn in today included 269 Democrats and 165 Republicans an increase of 26 Democrats over the 97th Congress There was one vacancy because John L Swigert Jr a Republican from Colorado died last week before he could be sworn in The Republicans retained their 54 seats in the Senate but to many lawmakers the November election registered a vote of no confidence in the Presidents program and lawmakers from both parties say they are determined to seek changes in the Governments economic strategy Congressional leaders attended a White House dinner with President Reagan tonight and they made it clear today that they were taking the President a grim message as he tries to formulate a budget for the fiscal year 1984 which begins in October Speaker ONeill noted that the unemployment rolls had increased by four million since the last Congress took office and he said in a pointed jab at the Reagan program It is time to stop waiting for an economic theory to work and instead to do what we have done before  stimulate the economy Representative James R Jones the Oklahoma Democrat who is chairman of the Budget Committee said Mr Reagan should submit a real budget that does not have an overly optimistic economic forecast Mr Jones said he favored doing something to rebuild the revenue base and he suggested postponing the new Reagan tax cut that is to go into effect in July Appropriations Rules Changed The new rules adopted by the House would change the way Congress appropriates money Now the process requires two steps one to authorize expenditures and the other to allocate the money In the past lawmakers could attach riders to the allocation bills and the process has been used recently by conservatives to inhibit school busing and Governmentfinanced abortions The Democraticsponsored rules would make it much harder for legislators to attach such riders to the spending measures Other rules changes would give the Speaker authority to dispense with timeconsuming procedural votes Another would provide that when a lawmaker switches parties existing committee assignments are automatically lost The argument behind most of these changes is that current rules slow down the legislative process and give too many opportunities to small groups working for special interests But even some Democrats who voted for the rules package fear that it will inhibit free expression in the House Were doing away with license for the little guy the maverick to make waves said Representative Don Edwards Democrat of California One suggested change to make it much more difficult to force a floor vote on a constitutional amendment was shelved by the Democrats in the face of widespread unhappiness in their own ranks Last summer supporters of a constitutional amendment requiring a balanced budget forced a floor vote by gathering 218 signatures on a discharge petition The rejected change would have increased the requirement to 290 votes The critics of this change pointed out that a discharge petition was used to gain floor consideration of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution in the early 1970s Coincidentally that amendment was reintroduced in the House today by a majority of the members The amendment which would ban discrimination based on sex was ratified by 35 states but when time ran out last spring it was three states short of the number needed
SURVEY FINDS HISPANIC CATHOLICS FOLLOW OWN RULES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/06/nyregion/survey-finds-hispanic-catholics-follow-own-rules.html,Hispanic people in the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York strongly profess central Christian beliefs and at the same time engage in religious practices that often differ markedly from the habits and customs of previous waves of Catholic immigrants according to a study released yesterday by the archdiocese The archdiocese is increasingly populated by Catholics with their own concept of religious involvement that is deeply personal highly committed to the central beliefs of Catholic theology but largely unaccustomed to attending mass and following regulations laid down by the Vatican the study shows The survey of religious attitudes of Hispanic residents shows a pattern of spiritual observance among Spanishspeaking people that is far less rooted in formal activities in the church and more infused with folk religion than that of Catholics whose ethnic origins are European Some Appeared Confused The overwhelming majority of those surveyed about 85 percent said they were Catholic about 93 percent said they were Protestant Some appeared to be somewhat confused about their religious identity Ruth Doyle director of the study called it the first empirical examination of the contemporary religious experiences of the Hispanic community She said the purpose of the study was to better serve the needs of the Hispanic community and to recognize the contributions that Hispanics have made Members of the survey committee said the findings presented a challenge to the wider church to accept forms of Catholic practice and piety that have been largely unfamiliar to those raised in a North American Catholic setting that emphasized rites and parish life Among the goals church planners said was to find a means to better grasp the value distinct spiritual traditions brought to this country by Hispanic people A lack of awareness of certain key aspects of Catholicism was evident in several of the findings Twothirds of the Catholic respondents could not name a single sacrament and the same proportion had never heard of the Second Vatican Council The overwhelming number had been baptized but in a manner that stressed family and folk custom more than church ritual How Marriage Is Regarded Likewise the sacrament of marriage was seen by a large majority as a human ceremony rather than a church rite Greater awareness has been found in recent polls of other Catholics At the same time the respondents showed overwhelming faith in such central dogma as the existence of a loving God belief in Jesus as the Son of God and the Resurrection Elements of folk religion such as festivals wearing medals burning incense and setting up altars in the home were shown to blend with more formal aspects of churchgoing Results Seen as a Blessing The Rev Raul del Valle chairman of the steering committee that helped design the project said the results were a blessing for the church and a tremendous challenge The most positive sign Father del Valle said is that Hispanic people are holding on to the faith and making a contribution to a richer mixture in the church On the morality of abortion the findings varied widely according to the respondents experience in the United States Thirtyseven percent of those born in this country said abortion was wrong while 67 percent of those who had arrived here after the age of 8 said so Most Spanishspeaking people in the archdiocese trace their origins to the Caribbean region The distinction between them and other American Catholics becomes clear at many points in the survey Figures on churchgoing provide one measure of difference The new study found that 31 percent of Hispanic Catholics attended mass weekly A recent Gallup study showed a weekly churchgoing rate of 53 percent by Catholics nationally Hourlong Interviews Held The 1980 census showed that 850000 Hispanic people lived in the archdiocese which comprises Staten Island Manhattan the Bronx Westchester County and six upstate counties In 1970 the total was 700000 Hispanic residents now make up 35 percent of Catholics in the archdiocese and officials estimate that the figure will climb to 40 percent by 1990 Half live in the Bronx Terence Cardinal Cooke seeking more knowledge about the beliefs and practices of Hispanic people gave approval in 1979 for the survey Over a 12month period starting in June 1981 the Office of Pastoral Research conducted hourlong interviews in person with 1000 Hispanic people from scientifically selected samples The Rev Joseph P Fitzpatrick a Jesuit professor of anthropology at Fordham University who worked on the study said the results posed an opportunity for the archdiocese Hispanics may not always feel its necessary to be present at the Sunday mass Father Fitzpatrick said but they still believe firmly in the basically principles of the faith This presents a great deal of hope if we can respond in terms of the pastoral care they need HISPANIC TYPE Catholic Hispanic Mass Attendance Figures are percentages of the total number of Hispanic Catholics in the survey

THE DEMOCRATS GET EVEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/09/weekinreview/the-democrats-get-even.html,WASHINGTON WHEN the 98th Congress opened its doors last week Representative Doug Barnard Jr a fourterm Democrat from Georgia bid for a seat on the prestigious House Appropriations Committee Mr Barnard had a good case since the slot had been held by a fellow Georgian It went instead to Representative Bill Boner a moderate from Tennessee That small decision told a lot about the new tenor on Capitol Hill Mr Barnard is a purebred boll weevil one of the twodozen conservative Democrats who often provided President Reagan with his margins of victory With 26 more Democrats in the House that leverage is gone The Democratic leadership lost no time in demonstrating it Once the lawmakers were sworn in a series of rules changes were swiftly propounded to speed up the legislative process and reduce the ability of the minority to hinder the majority The rules gave the Speaker greater authority to waive certain procedural votes and made it much more difficult for members to offer amendments to appropriations bills once only used to set spending levels In recent years conservatives have attached amendments pursuing causes from bans on federally financed abortions to prohibitions against school busing Supporters of the new rules argued that they promoted efficiency while thwarting the guerrilla tactics of the right wing But many Republicans and a few Democrats denounced them as a hypocritical attempt to run roughshod over the rights of individual members After all the critics maintained antiwar legislators had once used riders on appropriations bills to bar funding for the Vietnam war The tactics of diehard conservatives also provoked a reaction in the Senate where leaders announced formation of a bipartisan panel to recommend changes in the filibuster rules to prevent a small band of dissenters from tying up the chamber The House leaderships influence was further enhanced by organizational efforts Representative Phil Gramm of Texas the most ornery of the boll weevils was ousted from the Budget Committee he promptly announced that he was resigning his House seat and running again as a Republican Other boll weevils suffered lesser chastisements John B Breaux of Louisiana failed to win a spot on the Budget Committee and Roy Dyson of Maryland on the Appropriations Committee GV Sonny Montgomery of Mississippi was reelected chairman of the Veterans Affairs Committee but lost 53 votes in the party caucus The vote he said was a way for his colleagues to let their frustrations But conservatives he conceded would likely be more cooperative with their party leaders in this Congress
New Birth Control Rule Near,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/11/us/new-birth-control-rule-near.html,Richard S Schweiker the Secretary of Health and Human Services today recommended a rule requiring family planning clinics supported by Federal money to notify parents of minors who receive birth control pills diaphragms or intrauterine devices The Planned Parenthood Federation of America saying the new rule would threaten the health and wellbeing of teenagers and their families immediately moved in Federal District Court to block implementation of the rule on the grounds that it violated family planning statutes and the US Constitutions guarantee against invasion of privacy The still must be approved by the Office of Management and Budget Mr Schweiker said in a statement This Department has a deep responsibility to protect the health and safety of minor adolescents who are given prescription birth control drugs and devices paid for with taxpayer dollars He cited the 1981 budget act in which Congress encouraged parental participation in a teenagers use of family planning services which receive Federal funds However critics said the rule would not promote parentchild discussion about sex These regulations are not going to strengthen family communication they are going to endanger the health and safety of thousands of young people said the American College of Obstetrics and Gynecology We are afraid that the minor will simply proceed to have sex without protection and the result would be unwanted pregnancies leading to abortion or outofwedlock pregnancies that the minor would not be able to handle said Eve Paul Planned Parenthoods vice president for legal affairs Under the proposed rules family planning agencies would be required to notify a parent or guardian within 10 days after a minor receives a prescription contraceptive or device Clinics would advise minors of the notificaton requirement prior to providing the service Notification would have to be made through certified mail or in some other form that could be documented It has been estimated that about 668000 teenagers visit family planning clinics each year The Department said more than 120000 public comments were received since the rule was first published in the Federal Register last Feb 22 The rule will become final 30 days after it is published in the Federal Register
SCHWEIKER RESIGNS POST IN CABINET TO JOIN AN INSURANCE ASSOCIATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/12/us/schweiker-resigns-post-in-cabinet-to-join-an-insurance-association.html,Secretary of Health and Human Services Richard S Schweiker has resigned to take a job with the American Council on Life Insurance an industry trade association the White House announced tonight Formal letters of resignation from Mr Schweiker and acceptance by Mr Reagan are to be made public Wednesday a White House official said White House officials said they would have no comment on the resignation which took several of them by surprise But theysaid Mr Schweiker had not left for policy reasons Reagan Told 10 Days Ago A White House official said Mr Schweiker informed Mr Reagan about 10 days ago of his desire to take the lucrative job as president of the life insurance association The resignation from the Cabinet was the fourth in the Reagan Administration and the second in a month Alexander M Haig Jr resigned as Secretary of State last June Energy Secretary James B Edwards resigned in November and Transportation Secretary Drew Lewis resigned in late December Last week Mr Reagan selected Elizabeth H Dole a White House assistant for liaison to constituent groups to replace Mr Lewis Like Mr Lewis Mr Schweiker is a Republican moderate from Pennsylvania Mr Reagan could therefore be under some pressure to replace him with someone from the Northeast and from the moderate wing of the party perhaps a woman Speculation on Mr Schweikers successor immediately focused on Margaret M Heckler a former Republican Congresswoman from Massachusetts who was defeated for reelection in November Mrs Heckler like Mr Schweiker opposes abortion a policy issue of concern to the department Mrs Heckler who declined through an intermediary to talk with a reporter was described by her aides as interested in the Cabinet post At the same time there was a possibility that her nomination could face opposition from the conservative elements in the Republican Party She generally voted with the Reagan Administration but under challenge from a liberal Democrat Barney Frank during the election campaign she sometimes voted against the Administration on budget matters for example Mr Schweikers resignation comes after a series of battles over programs with the Office of Management and Budget which had proposed to make further deep slashes in department programs White House aides have been saying that Mr Schweiker won most of those battles and was able to win approval to restore most of the proposed cuts He did very well in the appeals process and was able to head off most of the cutbacks a White House official said An Administration official said for example that David A Stockman the budget director had agreed to Mr Schweikers request not to try for the third year in a row to eliminate a key nutrition program for pregnant mothers and infant children Nevertheless Mr Schweiker departs at a time of certain confrontations in Congress over programs in his area Administration officials have observed that he has had less than complete control over the Presidents position in these areas Proposed revisions of the Social Security system for example were taken from Mr Schweikers jurisdiction after proposals he made in 1981 were rejected in Congress Similarly a task force under White House control has been working on proposals to contain the cost of health care and has recommended that Mr Reagan seek to impose an income tax on employee health insurance benefits Mr Schweikers resignation came as a surprise to key Senators as well as to members of his own staff Dr Robert J Rubin the Assistant Secretary of Health and Human Services for planning and evaluation said he was shocked to learn of the resignation Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah chairman of the Committee on Labor and Human Resources said he had received no hint that Mr Schweiker was about to resign He said he would be upset if Mr Schweiker did leave because he had been a splendid Secretary Mr Schweiker a former Senator from Pennsylvania was considered a Reagan loyalist by many White House officials In 1976 when Mr Reagan was challenging President Gerald R Ford for the Republican presidential nomination he surprised politicians by announcing that Senator Schweiker was his choice for Vice President Mr Schweiker a Republican moderate who had been supporting Mr Ford then switched his allegiance to Mr Reagan After Mr Reagans election in 1980 Mr Schweiker became an immediate favorite to join the new Cabinet As Secretary he ran the biggest agency in the Federal Government with a budget of nearly 300 billion this year The largest component is Social Security
REAGAN CHOOSES EX-REP HECKLER TO BE THE NEW SECRETARY OF HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/13/us/reagan-chooses-ex-rep-heckler-to-be-the-new-secretary-of-health.html,President Reagan announced today that he would nominate Margaret M Heckler a former Representative from Massachusetts to succeed Richard S Schweiker as Secretary of Health and Human Services If confirmed by the Senate Mrs Heckler would head the largest Cabinet department which spent more than 275 billion last year In her bid for reelection last fall in a reapportioned district Mrs Heckler was defeated by a Democratic incumbent Representative Barney Frank who portrayed the election as a referendum on President Reagans economic and military policies Mr Reagan also announced today his intention to nominate John A Svahn the Commissioner of Social Security to be Under Secretary of Health and Human Services Mr Svahn who is 39 years old served as director of the California Department of Social Welfare when Mr Reagan was Governor in the early 1970s If confirmed as Under Secretary Mr Svahn would succeed David B Swoap who returned to California this month to join the Cabinet of the states new Republican Governor George Deukmejian Second Woman for Cabinet Mrs Heckler 51 is the second woman named to President Reagans Cabinet in a week He chose Elizabeth H Dole a White House assistant for liaison to special interest groups as Secretary of Transportation replacing In Congress Mrs Heckler a moderate Republican supported the proposed Federal equal rights amendment Government programs for Vietnam veterans and Federal day care subsidies for working parents But she disagreed with many womens groups on the abortion issue voting against using Federal money to pay for abortions For that reason the National Womens Political Caucus supported Mrs Hecklers Democratic opponents in 1980 and 1982 even though she helped found the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues in 1978 After serving in the House for 16 years she had more seniority than any other woman in Congress In an exchange of letters and in a brief ceremony in the East Room of the White House today Mr Reagan and Mr Schweiker praised each other as Presidents and departing Cabinet officers often do In the letter accepting his resignation Mr Reagan said More than anyone else you have been responsible for honoring my firm commitment that societys safety net be maintained so that Americans who require our help in times of need will receive it The President said Mr Schweiker the fourth member of his Cabinet to resign had performed with unexcelled competence and compassion Mr Schweiker who served in Congress for 20 years is leaving the Government to become president of the American Council of Life Insurance the trade and lobbying organization for 572 life insurance companies The council is involved in a wide range of tax and pension issues pending in Congress state legislatures and Federal and state regulatory agencies At a news conference Mr Schweiker said he was not leaving because of dissatisfaction or disagreements with the Administration Referring to his job offer from the life insurance industry he said This was a very rewarding unique opportunity that probably will not occur again Mr Schweiker had apparently been given a secondary role in deliberations on Social Security and the budget for his department next year but he denied that he had been excluded from the inner circles at the White House and the Office of Management and Budget In terms of politics and dollars the biggest issues that will face the new Secretary are Social Security and Medicare the health insurance program for the elderly  He will have to defend President Reagans budget proposals in Congressional hearings At the news conference today Mr Schweiker was repeatedly asked about the ethics of leaving his present job to work for the life insurance industry which is heavily involved in writing health insurance As Secretary Mr Schweiker was responsible for Medicare the nations largest health insurance program Mr Schweiker portrayed the health and life insurance industries as separate entities saying Health policies are none of the life insurance industrys business Provide Much Health Insurance In fact a large share of private health insurance for Americans is provided by life insurance companies according to a reference book published by the American Council of Life Insurance In 1981 life insurance companies received 318 billion or 295 percent of their premium receipts from health insurance and most of the big life insurance companies offer health insurance too according to a council spokesman Organizations concerned with national health policy expressed reservations about the abrupt shift at top levels of the Reagan Administration The American Medical Association said major groups involved in the delivery of health care should have been consulted The association in a statement said its officers were surprised and deeply disappointed at the process but eager to know Mrs Hecklers views on health care Dr Anthony Robbins president of the American Public Health Association which includes many state and local health officials said Its hard to believe the change could come at a worse time It takes a new Secretary a long time to decide which programs she wants to defend This will provide an opportunity for the White House and the Office of Management and Budget to get the upper hand
SUSAN SARANDON'S ROUGHEST ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/theater/susan-sarandon-s-roughest-role.html,At about 4 oclock most weekday afternoons Susan Sarandon starts feeling a little sick to her stomach Curtain time is just four hours away for a drama in which she plays what she considers to be her most difficult role to date She portrays a woman assaulted in her home by a wouldbe rapist in William Mastrosimones Extremities at the Westside Arts Center on West 43d Street a performance that has brought her critical praise Miss Sarandon  who got an Oscar nomination for her performance in the 1981 film Atlantic City and acclaim for A Coupla White Chicks Sitting Around Talking Off Broadway two seasons ago  overpowers her assailant in Extremities by spraying insect repellent in his eyes She ties him up and imprisons him in a fireplace One reason the part is difficult is physical She is battered during the assault scene  nightly from Tuesdays to Fridays and twice a day on weekends  and bears bruises One finger is in a splint for a chipped bone I have problems with my neck and my back she said Ive had bloody noses and just got over a black eye Other reasons have to do with the portrayal You feel vulnerable she said And you have to reveal a dark side of your nature which is not a pleasant sensation Enraged and terrified that her captive assailant will go unpunished  since he did not actually rape her  and that he will return to maim or kill her the character Marjorie decides at one point to kill him defying two roommates who try to dissuade her Association With Greek Tragedy The character Marjorie is in effect the plot Miss Sarandon said She hasnt much personality and no sense of humor Shes relentless And to orchestrate the rage is difficult I dont think most people would admit you can feel that much hatred This play is like Greek tragedy in which people felt these enormous emotions and acted on them  Extremities is a metaphor about the animal in you she continued And its about power Not sex thats not what rape is about its the rage a rapist feels and the power he is exercising Shes learning from him about power The play is about the contagion of violence Sipping a vodkaless Bloody Mary and looking refreshed after washing off the mud that is smeared on her hands and feet during much of the performance the actress said the plays intensity carried her along But there is one point at which she sometimes evokes her own life to inspire needed emotion The actress who was the oldest of nine children pictures a knife that she finds concealed on the man as being used against one of her sisters Its easier to imagine getting angry about someone else someone you love she said Auditioned by Accident Born in New York and raised in New Jersey Miss Sarandon became an actress almost by accident She majored in drama at the Catholic University of America in Washington but it was an academic pursuit she minored in philosophy and English as well as military strategy  I guess to balance the philosophy  and graduated in 1969 Her stage career began when her husband Chris Sarandon whom she married while in college  they were divorced in 1979  asked her to play a scene with him in an audition for an agent The agent then asked to represent both of them After summer stock in Washington in 1970 she moved to New York and five days later was offered a part as a troubled teenager in the film Joe Roles came quickly afterward and have not let up She was in a television soap opera A World Apart which she said taught her technique the way B movies have taught other actors She also worked on films including Lady Liberty 1972 with Sophia Loren The Front Page 1974 with Jack Lemmon and Walter Matthau and The Great Waldo Pepper 1975 with Robert Redford In 1976 she appeared in The Last of the Cowboys with Henry Fonda which she also coproduced and the cult movie The Rocky Horror Picture Show for which she had to learn to sing I had never even hummed out loud she recalled I was terrified And so the role qualified as the kind she seeks Since Im basically lazy she said I try for parts that frighten me or seem impossible So to survive I will have to learn something and overcome it Its like singing at an audition you can belt a song all right but if you try for a ballad your voice shakes constantly Even Miscasting May Help The challenge of the film Pretty Baby 1978 she said was acting the part of a mother to Brooke Shields The challenge of King of the Gypsies in the same year she mused was being miscast I was too small too young and too white bread for the part she said She was seen most recently in Paul Mazurskys Tempest 1982 for which she received the bestactress award at the Venice Film Festival And she recently completed The Hunger with Catherine Deneuve and David Bowie and The Buddy Stystem with Richard Dreyfuss and Jean Stapleton Miss Sarandon has spoken out on a number of issues in favor of nuclear disarmament and the equal rights amendment and for First Amendment and abortion rights But she said I wouldnt consider myself political Im only active in things that affect me Im just a frightened person who wants to live in a free country Acting and living which she says are inseparable have taught her compassion You realize that given certain circumstances you can do or feel things you thought you were not capable of she said And you become less quickly judgmental of other people Thats something you probably dont get in a lot of other professions
ABORTION: THE COURT WAS RIGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/opinion/abortion-the-court-was-right.html,The 10th anniversary of the United States Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion on Jan 22 arrives with the prospect of more years of turmoil The drive to overthrow the decision has become a major social issue of our time The struggle has hamstrung Congress disrupting its legislative schedule and exhausting its energies Although the Roman Catholic hierarcy the Moral Majority and other groups achieved nothing in the last Congress having diluted their campaign by backing different bills to outlaw abortion the danger remains that all opponents will unite against their common target They probably would favor Senator Orrin Hatchs proposed Human Life Federalism Amendment Giving each state and Congress concurrent power to restrict and prohibit abortion it sounds innocuously like a states rights measure but it could gut the 1973 decision Another choice is a revision of Jesse Helmss bill putting sweeping restrictions on Federal funding of abortion A further danger is the rise of fanaticism that may push antiabortion campaigning into violence New Right extremists have become desperate Abortion clinics have been burned down or damaged in the last year A doctor and his wife directors of an Illinois clinic were kidnapped for more than a week last August To protect churchstate separation the Internal Revenue Code bars religious institutions from spending taxexempt money to support or attack political candidates Still as the Abortion Rights Mobilization and other plaintiffs allege in a case before the Federal district court in New York the Roman Catholic hierarchy has openly flouted the law in a number of states for several years and up through the November elections For example admitting that the Internal Revenue Service had warned taxexempt religious newspapers to obey the tax code Todays Catholic organ of the San Antonio Tex archdiocese still attacked Presidential Senate and House candidates in 1980 with an editorial headlined To the IRS  NUTS When the antiabortion drive was the cutting edge of rightwing strategy two years ago the Rev Jerry Falwell the Moral Majoritys leader predicted that the 97th Congress would quickly pass a constitutional amendment outlawing abortion Many believed him Opposition to abortion bound the Catholic Fundamentalist and Mormon right wings and all conservatives into a common front But even with the threat of a unified antiabortion drive in the new Congress the New Right has lost glamor No amendment or bill to outlaw abortion passed the Senate last fall Of 19 senators who were up for reelection and who voted against Mr Hatchs antiabortion amendment and were leading hitlist targets only one was defeated When the National Abortion Rights Action League put money and forces behind controversial candidates last November 71 percent were elected in the House 66 percent in the Senate The decline in antiabortion strength can be measured best in Suffolk County New York long a rightwing bastion The combined Conservative and RighttoLife Parties both oppose abortion  reached their peak there in 1979 when the county treasurer won 35567 votes While Lewis E Lehrman ran a close gubernatorial race in 1982 his Conservative vote combined with the RighttoLife Partys candidate dropped to 30081 in Suffolk In fact the RighttoLife Party drew only 7275 votes for governor there and only 54512 in the state out of 5124745 cast Consequently abortion rights forces have the added burden of complacency With veterans dropping out a key problem is to recruit youths who have only a dim memory of prelegal kitchentable abortion Broader constituencies have to be converted to militancy on the model of the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights The American Medical Association and American Bar Association as a result of increased activism are involving more men Abortion rights can no longer be considered mainly a female responsibility If the drive to overthrow legal abortion is to be decisively blocked members of Congress must be convinced that hardcore antiabortionists no longer threaten their reelection When the RighttoLife Party in archconservative Suffolk can draw only 4 percent or less in most districts even rightwing members of Congress must realize that the effective answer is to make every child a wanted child through family planning rather than through fanatical attacks on the Supreme Courts abortion decision
A DECISION NEEDING UNDOING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/14/opinion/a-decision-needing-undoing.html,A decade after the United States Supreme Court tried to settle the abortion issue it is plainly evident that it did not The Court failed politically It failed socially It failed legally And it failed medically Because of these failures the American righttolife movement remains alive and determined The landmark abortion ruling in Roe v Wade failed politically because it was extreme With it the Court struck down the abortion laws of all 50 states Before Roe those few states that permitted elective abortions at all allowed them only early in pregnancy After Roe each was required to permit abortion on demand through the second trimester of pregnancy Roe requires states to allow an abortion even after the point at which the fetus becomes viable outside the womb when the mothers life or health would be endangered by a live birth In a companion case Doe v Bolton the Court defined health so broadly as to include threats to emotional wellbeing Such a sweeping frustration of the legislatively expressed will of the people of every state was bound to produce a fierce political reaction and did Though many observers expected it to be almost wholly impotent by now the righttolife movements Washington lobby remains an uncommonly significant influence on the Congress Indeed last March it produced a majority vote by the Senate Judiciary Committee to reverse Roe v Wade by means of a constitutional amendment The decision failed socially because it struck at the heart of societys traditional reverence for the sanctity of all human life By declaring that the unborn child is not a constitutional person the Court divorced the concept of personhood from that of humanness In spite of the decree many Americans passionately continue to hold that all humans regardless of the stage of their biological development are persons who have the most basic right to live These righttolifers are a sociological phenomenon because they constitute a rare social activist group  one that does not have its own selfinterest at stake Roe is a legal failure because it engendered the nearly universal scorn of constitutional law scholars from across the ideological spectrum Solicitor General Rex Lee was charitable recently when he told the Court in a brief that the Roe right to an abortion was constructed on a foundation of constitutional shadows There is no support whatever for the notion that the framers of the 14th Amendment even remotely considered abortion much less intended to guarantee access to it yet that part of the Constitution is where the Court claimed that the right to abort is grounded What the Court in its 72 decision did was to impose a model abortion statute formulated on the basis of the social economic and political views of seven men But the Court is not a legislature When it acted as if it were it committed an abuse of power that undermined its integrity and its standing as a democratic institution The Courts medical failure lies in its putting the medical profession at war with itself At a time when the development of fetal monitoring and intrauterine treatment techniques are enabling doctors to consider the fetus a patient others in the profession work to perfect abortion methods so that no unwanted child will emerge alive Whether the doctor will heal or kill the unborn child in a given case is solely the mothers choice which reduces the physician to a mere technician Perhaps more ominous Roe v Wade gave rise to the wrongful life theory of legal action which is enjoying increased acceptance in Federal and state courts This development gives the parents of a handicapped child the right to sue the doctor who attended the pregnancy when they can show that he should have discovered the defect so that an abortion could have been obtained The resulting pressures on physicians encourage infanticide as doctors seek to avoid potential financial liability for children whom they negligently caused to be born alive The Declaration of Independence holds that the right to life is the inalienable right of every human being Ten years after the Supreme Court alienated just that right of the youngest of Americans it ought to seize the opportunity presented by the three abortion cases now on its docket to admit the fundamental failures of Roe v Wade and restore the rights of personhood to the full scope of humanity Until that is done the righttolife movement will not be silent and will not die

ABORTION RULING: 10 YEARS OF BITTER CONFLICT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/style/abortion-ruling-10-years-of-bitter-conflict.html,Ten years ago next Saturday the United States Supreme Court ruled that the decision to perform an abortion would be a private matter of concern only to the woman and her physician and that only in the later stages of pregnancy was the state entitled to any voice in the matter With that decision abortion became a constitutionally guaranteed right but the furor long generated by the issue has hardly been subdued and the national schism it has caused remains as wide as ever That the dispute would continue was not the widely held view at the time As Alfred F Moran executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York recalled Most us of really believed that was the end of the controversy The Supreme Court had spoken and while some disagreement would remain the issue had been tried tested and laid to rest An EverWidening Schism With its landmark 1973 decision in Roe v Wade the Supreme Court set in motion tumultuous often painful conflict that has divided political leaders scholars scientists theologians and ordinary citizens Today those camps are if anything larger more vocal and more politically sophisticated than they were a decade ago Opponents of the right to abortion members of the socalled righttolife or prolife movement are bent on overturning Roe v Wade preferably by a constitutional amendment that would codify the concept that the fetus from the moment of conception is a full human being entitled to constitutional protections Supporters of legalized abortion who call themselves prochoice are equally committed to preserving what they regard as the legal right of a woman to control her reproductive life and to the belief that government intervention violates a womans constitutional right of privacy The abolition of abortion they say would impose one religious view  that the fetus is a human being  on all Battle on Many Fronts The battle has been waged on many fronts from the doorstep of the local abortion clinic where opponents try to send patients home and even on occasion engage in violence to local and state legislatures Congress and the courts The issue has been a driving force in politics and candidates for public office are often judged by the stand they take For most of the 1970s the strategy of the opponents of abortion rights was not to tackle the principle itself but to seek to curtail access either through regulatory restrictions or through limitations on governmental funds Despite numerous legislative efforts only one the socalled Hyde Amendment which permits states to refuse to fund Medicaid abortions made a significant dent The measure named for its author Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois was struck down by a Federal district judge in Brooklyn and then upheld by the United States Supreme Court by a vote of 5 of 4 Although indigent women were in effect excluded from governmentally funded abortions those who favor choice on the issue do not consider the measure as devastating as they had expected William W Hamilton director and chief lobbyist in the Washington office of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America explained Fifteen states plus the District of Columbia have continued to pay for Medicaid abortions and those states account for 75 to 85 per cent of all abortions However the antiabortion movement gained considerable strength in 1980 with the election of Ronald Reagan an avowed foe of abortion to the Presidency and the defeat of several leading senators who were supporters of abortion rights along with the resurgence of conservatives as exemplified by the rise of the New Right movement Human Life Amendment Last year a socalled human life amendment and a human life statute both declaring that life begins at the moment of conception and is entitled to constitutional protection attracted significant interest in Congress The statute got out of a subcomittee but faltered after that so its sponsor Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina standardbearer of the movement rewrote it and got it onto the Senate floor A lengthy filibuster ensued before the matter was tabled by a vote of 47 to 46 Another measure given serious consideration a socalled human life federalism bill was introduced by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah and another leader of the antiabortion forces It provided that both Congress and the states were entitled to pass laws limiting or prohibiting abortion with the more restrictive to prevail That proposal was withdrawn with a promise that it be reintroduced for floor debate during the next Congressional session Scientific Evidence Cited Another bill has already been introduced Sponsored by Representative Hyde and called the respect human life bill it declares among other things that scientific evidence demonstrates the life of each human being begins at conception If passed it would give permanence to the Hyde Amendment which has been attached to annual appropriations bills and would also allow challenges to certain proabortion measures to go directly to the Supreme Court Experts who have been following the controversy expect that the spotlight will be on the Supreme Court rather than Congress The court will render decisions in the spring on cases involving laws passed in Virginia Missouri and Akron Ohio that involve such restrictions as requiring parental consent for minors confining secondtrimester abortions to hospitals imposing a 24hour waiting period before an abortion and requiring definitions by physicians of the fetus as a human life along with descriptions of its anatomy and ability to feel sensation Although none of these or other provisions would abolish abortion or even strike at its legal essence they are considered important because they will set the tone for further action If the court upholds them according to Judy Goldsmith president of the National Organization for Women we will see a spate of attempts to introduce restrictions all over the country And if it does not we will see more activity in the Congress said John P Mackey Washington representative of the Ad Hoc Committee in Defense of Life Access questions are very significant said Nanette Falkenberg executive director of the National Abortion Rights Action League If you have to drive 500 miles to get to a clinic if you have to go through a picket line when you arrive if you hear a doctor say that what you are about to do is killing someone and if then you must go home for a 24hour waiting period that is simply an unfair emotional burden In her view they are trying to take out from the back door what they cant get out the front As the scenario shifts back and forth from the legislative to the judicial forum it is clear that neither side will bend to compromise As Jeannie I Rosoff president of the Alan Guttmacher Institute the educational and research organization concerned with familyplanning and population issues said You could put both sides in one room for 50 years and no one would change positions We operate from totally different views of the world views that are more complex that abortion itself involving a philosophy of life ones approach to God and religion Indeed new philosophical questions are being attached to the controversy especially by opponents of abortion principally contentions that permitting abortion has opened the door to infanticide in the form of withholding treatment from defective babies and that euthanasia will inevitably follow Were creating new categories of wanted and unwanted life said Richard Doerflinger legislative assistant for the National Conference of Catholic Bishops Committee for ProLife Activities The conference recently took a strong stand against the use of nuclear weapons How can we say it is wrong to target and kill masses of innocent civilians to solve our defense problems and not take the same view of abortion Mr Doerflinger asked To those who believe that women should have a choice on the matter such reasoning is specious and muddies the waters of debate The law must make what can appear to be arbitrary distinctions and the most fundamental of categories the law has chosen to observe is the difference made by the fact of birth said Harriet Pilpel who has served as counsel to the city national and international organizations of Planned Parenthood and the American Civil Liberties Union Birth is the significant factor in terms of defining the human being If birth is not a meaningful distinction warranting differential treatment before and after it occurs then almsot every other category created by the law would be subject to objection How the debate has touched American beliefs and attitudes remains to be seen though it clearly continues to inflame the passions of those who believe in the righteousness of their cause Though most polls indicate that a large majority of the population firmly favor rentention of legalized abortion some critics of Roe v Wade say the findings have not been properly interpreted Question of Hard Cases Citing an overview of a number of polls Dr JC Willke president of the National Right to Life Committee said About 25 percent of the people are solidly prolife and another 25 percent are comfortable with abortion Of the 50 percent in the middle many may approve of it for hard cases such a rape and incest or fetal handicap but diapprove of it for social reasons such as poverty or unwed motherhood Dr Daniel Callahan director of the Institute of Society Ethics and the Life Sciences a research organization that is conducting an analysis of the ways supporters and opponents relate abortion to other values said For the activists on both side this is a permanent cause But they are a minority in terms of intensity on the issue Most Americans fall into the ambivalent middle category sufficiently uncertain about the moral issues to be willing to take either side Most people still wont go in one direction And that is more or less what the Government has done so far he said It has taken the position that it will not abolish abortions but neither will it pay for them he said
A BACKDOOR ASSAULT ON FAMILY PLANNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/opinion/l-a-backdoor-assault-on-family-planning-164457.html,To the Editor Thank you for your editorial Dec 19 about the guidelines proposed by the US Department of Health and Human Services regarding familyplanning clinics that also provide abortion services he Reagan Administration is attempting to achieve through these guidelines what it cannot achieve through Congressional action or the rulemaking process Frustrated in its attempts to gut the nations familyplanning program and to restrict a womans right to abortion it is using this avenue to continue its attacks on the rights of women to make decisions about their childbearing The great tragedy is that it is the poor and defenseless who will suffer the most By requiring separate facilities staffs supplies and equipment the guidelines will make familyplanning and abortion services less accessible to those who need them most The guidelines are part of an organized effort to make a constitutionally protected right semicriminal Since they are only now being circulated in draft form within the Health and Human Services Department we are hopeful that the Administration will reconsider its intention to issue those guidelines FAYE WATTLETON President Planned Parenthood Federation of America Inc New York Dec 22 1982

A LEGISLATIVE BATTLE IN PENNSYLVANIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/15/style/a-legislative-battle-in-pennsylvania.html,The legislative battle on abortion crosses national state and local lines What has happened to a piece of legislation in Pennsylvania basically typifies how the dispute over abortion is waged both by those who favor freedom of choice in the matter and by those who advocate what they term the right to life The sequence of events was described by Morgan Plant executive director of Planned Parenthood affiliates in Pennsylvania the description was concurred in by Molly Kelly executive director of the southeast chapter of Pennsylvanians for Human Life In July 1981 Representatives Stephen Freind and Gregg Cunningham introduced in the state General Assembly four bills called the Pennsylvania abortion control act They were voted down in committee but then one that contained most of the restrictive provisions was attached by the Assembly to a Senatepassed measure known as the tough guy bill which sought to prohibit amateur prizefights on stages In December 1981 the omnibus bill was passed by the Assembly by a twotoone margin and went back to the Senate which also adopted it Gov Dick Thornburgh vetoed it explaining that he thought it would hamper physicians but he indicated that he would be willing to consider a revision The bill was redrafted voted again and signed It requires a 24hour waiting period medical consultation including detailed descriptions of the fetal anatomy consent by one parent for a procedure to be performed on a minor information printed in English Spanish and Vietnamese distribution of printed lists of alternative services hospitalization for secondtrimester procedures the attendance of a second physician in cases where the fetus might be viable quarterly reports on in vitro fertilization procedures and prohibitions against the use state funds for abortions except when life is endangered and against insurance coverage in state policies for employees A coalition of 14 organizations favoring choice filed suit in Federal District Court asking for an injunction and a ruling that the act was unconstitutional The day before it was to go into effect an injunction was issued involving only the provision for a 24hour waiting period The rest of the law went into effect for just one day Dec 8 1982 after which it was put in abeyance by being taken to the Third Circuit Court of Appeals

a position to get somewhere President Reagan said Meeting with reporters for the first time since he ordered the dismissal of Eugene V Rostow as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Mr Reagan said that as a result of his military modernization program he had regained leverage over the Soviet Union and that Moscow now had an incentive to bargain seriously Page 1 Column 6 Moves on

WOMEN SEEK ABORTION LOANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/nyregion/women-seek-abortion-loans.html,AN increasing number of the women seeking loans for abortions through a new fund set up by the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut are not teenagers but adults league officials say many of them are no longer able to afford the average 200 cost because of unemployment Yet despite an apparent growing need for such financial assistance the loans are interestfree  leaders of the league are troubled because they suspect that fewer people than should be are taking advantage of the fund They contend that this may be because an element of fear has crept back into the abortion process Many pregnant women especially the less knowledgeable ones may believe they are breaking the law by seeking an abortion league officials suggest Some say that theyre afraid they may jeopardize their Medicaid if its known theyve applied for an abortion said Lea Berliner coordinator of the fund known as Women Against Discrimination in Abortion Others are worried that their welfare benefits will be taken away from them Theres a lot of confusion Maryalyce Lee the executive director of the 18000member Connecticut Right to Life Corporation refutes this argument When you show people theres a human being growing inside them she said they start to say Hey wait a minute Its education not fear thats become the deterrent Planned Parenthood leaders say the situation is especially disquieting because they have been able to raise more money than they originally anticipated Some 164000 has been collected in less than two years Some of the 135 contributors to the fund could give no more than 5 or 10 each But they were very emotional about giving said Joan Babbit executive director of the Planned Parenthood League of Connecticut They would send us a letter with their donation or tell us why they thought this sort of fund was important to support So far 1728 women have used the fund borrowing a total of 93000 The average loan has been 85 with the rest of the cost made up in cash The swing toward more adults rather than teenagers seeking abortions is reflected in the most recent statistics available from the State Department of Health Women 19 years and younger comprised 308 percent of the women seeking abortions in 1979 dropping to 297 percent by 1981 the latest year for which figures are available Abortions during that time rose from 13784 in 1978 to 16565 in 1981 According to Jean MacDonald director of the Hartford chapter of Planned Parenthood applicants seeking financing through the fund cover a broad range of society  single parents women living alone as well as an increasing number of married women One womans husband had been laid off by Pratt  Whitney four months earlier said Mrs MacDonald And although she would have been the sort who would have been able to pay in the past she did not have that kind of cash anymore A majority of clinics and physicians require an immediate cash payment for this sort of procedure said Mrs Berliner In some instances it is still possible to have an abortion paid for through Medicaid But constantly changing guidelines has been one of the factors she maintained that has made some lowincome women uneasy about even applying Many women make a special effort to pay back the loan league officials said One woman who borrowed 100 in September has been paying us back with 2 a week ever since said Mrs MacDonald There is no means test income ceiling or need for collateral in order to obtain a loan And applications can be made at any of the leagues 18 offices around the state
"WITH BUDGET AXES ALL ABOUT, SCHWEIKER PREFERRED A SCALPEL",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/weekinreview/with-budget-axes-all-about-schweiker-preferred-a-scalpel.html,A paradox ran through the tributes paid to Richard S Schweiker after he offered his resignation as Secretary of Health and Human Services last week to become the chief lobbyist for the life insurance industry For to the extent that he was well regarded by President Reagan it was because he loyally carried out the Presidents policy of reducing Federal outlays or the growth of Federal outlays for health welfare and social service programs And to the extent that he was admired by special interest groups and constituents served by his department it was because he defended these programs Mrs Hecklers Choices Obviously it is difficult to assign credit to one person for cutting and defending the same programs at the same time  unless as Mr Schweiker would argue his achievement was to make cuts in the most judicious manner possible But for two years as head of the largest Cabinet department Mr Schweiker did have it both ways He portrayed himself as a loyal servant of the President never speaking out in public to criticize the White House and never permitting his aides to engage in the timehonored Washington game of bureaucratic backbiting Similar choices await Margaret M Heckler whom Mr Reagan selected to succeed Mr Schweiker The eightterm Republican Representative from Wellesley Mass was defeated last November Her record as a moderate and her sex made her politically attractive to the President who is eager to shore up his standing among women and among centrists in his party But Mrs Hecklers standing with the White House is likely to vary inversely with her popularity among public health and welfare advocates Her record in Congress suggests that she will be more outspoken than Mr Schweiker who rarely evinced strong feelings about any issue Indeed he was so taciturn that his own politics remained something of an enigma and he was not completely trusted by either conservatives or liberals Mr Schweiker had been one of organized labors closest allies in Congress until 1976 but he was moving to the right even before he joined Mr Reagan as his Vice Presidential candidate that year In Congress Mr Schweiker opposed gun control supported school prayer and was against the use of Federal money to pay for abortions He was being true to his conservative instincts when he announced last week that he had approved a rule requiring certain family planning clinics to notify the parents of young women who received prescription contraceptives The Planned Parenthood Federation of America immediately filed a lawsuit seeking to nullify the rule One of Mr Schweikers major embarrassments on Capitol Hill arose from his effort to reduce the regulation of nursing homes in keeping with President Reagans goal of regulatory relief for private enterprise Congress twice passed laws blocking any change The department under Mr Schweiker never figured out precisely how public health should be weighed in the calculus of costs and benefits In an era when the spirit of Government and the nation has grown less generous Mr Schweikers achievement seems to consist more of harm averted than acts of beneficence He helped preserve funding for Head Start which provides preschool services for poor children But his first love was the National Institutes of Health the worldfamous biomedical research complex Mr Schweiker constantly resisted cuts in the NIH budget continuing a campaign that he began as a member of Congress where he developed a strong interest in medical issues He had been the ranking Republican on the health subcommittees of both the Appropriations Committee and the Committee on Labor and Human Resources Mrs Heckler brings little of that detailed knowledge to the job She served on the Science and Technology Veterans Affairs and Joint Economic Committees Not having been extensively involved in health or income security matters she has much to learn Social Security by far the biggest program in the department is so politically explosive that key policy decisions when they are made come from the White House Mrs Heckler cannot hope to play more than Mr Schweikers secondary role on the issue If she can master the intricacies of Medicare the health insurance program for the elderly in less than one year she will have proved a rapid learner Inherited Issues and Aides As Secretary Mr Schweiker devised an elaborate proposal for paying hospitals fixed rates set in advance for treating all Medicare patients with a particular diagnosis Whether Mrs Heckler or anyone else in the Administration will push for that proposal is unclear The White House stipulated that she should not publicly discuss her priorities before her confirmation hearings In an effort to keep medical expertise at the top of the department Mr Schweiker urged President Reagan to promote Dr Edward N Brandt Jr the Assistant Secretary for health to the secondranking position Instead Mr Reagan chose a loyal conservative Californian John A Svahn to be Under Secretary For the last two years Mr Svahn has been Commissioner of Social Security dealing with an issue that will surely dominate the departments agenda in the next two years In an analysis of Mrs Hecklers voting record the American Public Health Association an organization of 50000 health professionals gave her a 65 percent rating She agreed with the association on 13 of 20 votes involving health issues She disagreed on bills involving abortion and health spending In general she has been a strong supporter of womens rights but she opposes the use of Federal money to pay for abortions Mrs Heckler usually supported the President on budget questions But last September she joined 80 other Republicans in voting to override his veto of a 141 billion supplemental spending bill The House vote represented the first major breakdown of Republican unity on fiscal votes in the last Congress
COMPLICATED FRIENDSHIPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/books/complicated-friendships.html,DIFFICULT WOMEN A Memoir of Three By David Plante 173 pp New York Atheneum 995 AN American young man a novelist settles in London in the early 70s and pursues the friendship of much older women who are either themselves literary or have entree to the literary life It is a given that these women will be complicated stubborn strongwilled and that the relationship between each of them and the novelist will be tricky even suspect If this were the 1870s the circumstances would provide a Jamesian subtext fulfilling only very slowly some psychologically unforeseen purpose but as it is the 1970s the entire matter is at once laid selfconsciously before us and we are free to decide how much or how little it all means David Plante has known with varying degrees of closeness Jean Rhys Sonia Orwell and Germaine Greer Difficult Women is a series of memoirs of the three linked together by Mr Plantes idea that his own complicated motives in devoting himself to these friendships is part of the story he has to tell The idea however is a suggestion not an intrusion Mr Plante is too good a writer to lose his balance or his subject the spectacular exaggerations of will and character the three women embody The memoir of Jean Rhys  already famous having been published originally in The Paris Review  is a remarkable achievement Rhys was in her 80s when Mr Plante met her a tiny woman hunched over with arthritis drunk by lunchtime wearing flowered dresses brim hats and makeup applied with a shaking hand Determinedly infantile and made even more so by years of enforced solitude and obscurity Rhys was literally carried about by people who knew enough to revere the famous forgotten novelist locked up inside the helpless old lady Mr Plante readily became the last of these people He visited Rhys daily at her London hotel talked with her drank with her and set out to help her write her autobiography He also moved her from bed to bath to chair and in the most notorious incident in the memoir rescued her when she fell into the toilet But Mr Plante never forgot who Jean Rhys really was and what made her valuable so that while he captures neatly the shabby dishevelment of the narcissistic girlwoman fallen into confused old age he also achieves full recognition for the writer whose eloquence and maturity are endlessly redeeming Here are two moments typical of the entire memoir Rhys is sitting drunk in her chair with Mr Plante beside her She seemed suddenly to rouse herself internally and she shouted Oh David Im unhappy You be happy Im so unhappy all my life Ive been so unhappy Its unfair Im dying I want to die Its unfair Im dying my bodys dying and inside I think its unfair Ive never lived Ive never lived  Within a few minutes of this dismaying outburst Rhys says Listen to me I want to tell you something very important All of writing is a huge lake There are great rivers that feed the lake like Tolstoy and Dostoevsky And there are trickles like Jean Rhys All that matters is feeding the lake I dont matter The lake matters You must keep feeding the lake It is very important Nothing else is important If you wish you may remember Jean Rhys falling into the toilet but David Plantes memoir is constructed to honor the woman with a vision of writing as a huge lake Although Mr Plante tells us often enough of his worldly ambition and that his own emotional avarice makes him anxious Why am I here he asks continually What do I really want from her inevitably we are disarmed by his openness But with Sonia Orwell one is inclined to agree with rather than indulge the selfaccusation Sonia Brownell married George Orwell a few months before his death and became the heir to Orwells literary estate Out of this circumstance she made a profession A minor literary salonkeeper she died in 1980 at tHe age of 63 Sonia Orwell was a compulsive manipulator of literary and intellectual people intensely invested in therapylike intimacies with writers and painters She emerges in this memoir a cold angry restless woman murderously defensive a dinner party drunk possessed of no redeeming gifts of mind or spirit Throughout the memoir one feels Mr Plante sighing wordlessly How did I get myself into this Unfortunately the reader can all too quickly supply an answer to that question and respond with Yes but why drag us into it as well With Germaine Greer however not only are we back on solid ground all the strands of psychological insinuation are pulled together we know what Mr Plante is doing here and brought into vivid relief through a realized portrait of the largest figure of all Germaine Greer is the most wonderfully exaggerated difficult woman anyone might ever want to know A cross between Margaret Sanger and Brendan Behan the celebrated feminist speaker and writer seems all crude appetite and missionarylike responsibility A large blowsy woman not beautiful in the parts but spectacular in the sum Greer eats drinks and lusts after men with a heartiness that feeds her compulsive sociability Mother to the world she is always in the company of the helpless and the hopeless whose problems preoccupy her continuously Greer herself though is anything but helpless Educated to live in the world she knows really knows  how to build a house fix a car plant a garden drive tirelessly cook brilliantly And everyone around her knows that she knows As Mr Plante observes shrewdly Everyone listened to her with such attention because she had a command of whatever vocabulary happened to be appropriate to the problem At the local garage in Tuscany where Greer has a house and where much of this memoir is set the mechanics are mesmerized by her They had never known a woman who could swing her hips from side to side and clasp her hands to her breasts and pucker her mouth and know as much as they did about shock absorbers Greer commands the room wherever she is Repeatedly she takes the conversation by main force and delivers a passionate speech on whatever is currently on her mind  female circumcision in Africa practices of abortion and contraception around the world whatever She is able to do this because no one in the room cares about what they care about as much as she cares about what she cares about The intensity of her engagement is the source of her power it is selfgenerating and to a large degree selffeeding she does not really need any of the people who are listening to her she only needs people to listen This is true of her when she is with one friend or at a dinner party for six or at a microphone facing 500 MR PLANTE understands this about Greer thoroughly Listening one night as she tells him vivid stories of her early sexual experiences he thinks I felt that I was being taken into her confidence into her private world that is I was taken into the private world of a public woman where I learned something about her no one else knew But I also felt that she was not talking to me but to anyone and what I heard anyone could hear Her only secret was this she would not reveal how she had become Germaine Greer how she had learned everything she had to learn to become the person she was That Mr Plante admires and loves the person she was is not in question Tough singleminded unbelievably appropriating Germaine Greer emerges at the last as warm funny generous and very intelligent a demanding and altogether worthwhile presence Mr Plantes relationship with Greer is the most extensive of the three  he is her guest in Italy they visit each other in London travel together in the American southwest  and it is with her that his internal carryingson about what he an open homosexual is doing with these strongminded women is most fully articulated When he says I liked to be with Germaine because she was  unpredictable in her reactions  Though this frightened me in that I ran the constant risk of saying or doing the wrong thing I was excited he is speaking for what he feels with Sonia Orwell and Jean Rhys as well They all gave him something promised him something that made him cleave to them With Germaine Greer the mysterious something is out in the open In her company he shivers with excitement imagines her taking him into her capacious body loves falling asleep feeling safe and happy because Germaine is in the next room watches her in her bath in Italy as a child peeking through the halfopen door might watch guess who Difficult Women is the result of a psychological fixation that illustrates delightfully what might be called adaptive neurosis Mr Plantes preoccupation with the meaning of his attachment to Rhys Orwell and Greer neither distorts his subject nor pushes his prose out of shape it only indicates the source of his engagement and reveals his wholly admirable ability to convert necessity into virtue by bringing these extremely interesting women to brilliant mythic life His special intensity leads us to something of larger importance as well THERE is a profound sense of homelessness attaching to all four  the homosexual man and the difficult women Because Mr Plante is open  to the women and to himself  he neither idealizes nor patronizes the condition he simply captures it perfectly The people in this book act as though home is to be found in the connection they make with themselves in each others presence The complicated seriousness with which friendships are taken is finally what this book is all about At a moment in social history when marriage is so problematic for so many such a contemplation touches a live nerve Difficult Women is moving intelligent and very much of its time
"NEW JERSEY OPINION;
WHY THOUSANDS WILL MARCH TO END ABORTION",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/nyregion/new-jersey-opinion-why-thousands-will-march-to-end-abortion.html,COME next Saturday thousands of New Jersey residents will get out of bed in the dark board a bus before dawn and ride to Washington There they will probably stand around in the cold for an hour or two listening to speakers And then these businessmen from Bergen County these students from Douglass Princeton and Seton Hall these young girls from Cape May and these notsoyoung girls from Clinton and Elizabeth  all will join with thousands of others from every state in the union in the annual March for Life to protest the legalization of abortion in the United States Later at about 5 PM they will climb back on their buses and probably pray that they will not have to return to Washington next year But they will if they have to And theyll keep going there in larger numbers each year until a Human Life Amendment restores the right to life to the unborn child Today 10 years after the Supreme Court decision that gave women the right to abortion for any reason throughout the entire pregnancy people are beginning to understand that what is destroyed in an abortion is an innocent human life No one really argues this much anymore Not when we can look inside a womans womb by means of computerized cameras and watch a tiny male or female human only 8 weeks old when most abortions are done suck its thumb grasp an instrument placed in its hand and swim freely about with a natural swimmers stroke Not when we can listen to its heartbeat and measure its brainwaves And not now when according to Dr Thomas Verney founder of the Toronto Center for Psychotherapy and Education we can start communicating and influencing a babys personality by talking reading and singing to them while they are still in the womb People are also beginning to question the argument put forth by those who advocate the right to have abortions Make it illegal again and thousands of women will die from backalley abortions Will this be the case Not so says Dr Bernard Nathanson a former director of the New York Center for Reproductive and Sexual Health the largest abortion clinic in the world Writing in Aborting America he comments in part The practice of abortion was revolutionized at virtually the same moment that the laws were revolutionized through the widespread introduction of the suction curettage in 1970 One can expect that if abortion is ever driven underground again even nonphysicians will be able to perform the procedure with remarkable safety No woman need die if she chooses to abort during the first 12 weeks of pregnancy The fact is that fewer women die today from abortion legal or illegal but they do die from it because many abortions are performed in the second trimester 10 percent and the third trimester 2 percent They die from it because it is not as safe as childbirth another false claim and they still die from criminal abortions in spite of its being legal This is documented by Dr Thomas W Hilgers in a landmark study New Perspectives in Human Abortion Using data compiled by the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta and comparing mortality from induced abortions with that of pregnancy for the fiveyear period 197277 he found When proper comparisons are made the data demonstrates that pregnancy is clearly safer than abortion in both the first and second 20 weeks of pregnancy with abortion proving to be twice as dangerous to the life of the mother in the second 20 weeks In analyzing the trend in maternal deaths due to induced abortions it has been shown that while maternal deaths from criminal abortions appear to be decreasing they have been replaced almost one to one by maternal deaths due to legal abortions Abortion figures are hard to come by because most states do not require strict recordkeeping Many like California require none at all Which is why the official figure given for abortion deaths in 1978 is 50 the same year that The Chicago SunTimes uncovered 12 unreported deaths of young women just in Chicago clinics The best estimate of the number of abortions performed annually in the United States before legalization is 90000 Since legalization the yearly total has soared to between 2 million and 25 million The unwanted child argument is based on the assumption that every child who is unwanted will end up abused or a drain on society Never mind that many studies have disproved this notion Maybe we should ask ourselves why after getting rid of approximately 15 million unwanted babies since 1973 child abuse has tripled in the United States Why has child abuse reached epidemic proportions in New Jersey The Governors Commission on Childrens Services reported last February that child abuse in the state had risen by 1000 percent in the last decade alone Is it possible that the abortion mentality is beginning to affect the way we view our wanted children And what are the reasons for 2 million abortions annually In testimony given before the Senate Dr CEverett Koop the United States SurgeonGeneral said Reasons given include preserving the life of the mother expectation of a defective child rape and incest Even if these were valid reasons they would account for only 3 percent of all abortions A full 97 percent occur for matters of convenience and economy In arguing a recent case in Boonsboro Md against a husband who tried to stop his wife from having an abortion Barbara Mello a lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union objected to questions concerning her clients reasons for having the abortion The lawyer contended that the wifes reasons were irrelevant since she could have an abortion for frivolous reasons or for no reason at all She based her argument on the Danforth v Planned Parenthood decision which denied a husband any say in an abortion decision Are we the only ones who are appalled at the idea that if youre unwanted youre better off dead Any one of us could find ourselves in that category and the only thing that could protect us would be our blessed constitutional right to life This is the protection that the Supreme Court decision of 1973 took away from the unborn In its place under the guise of a right to privacy women were given the right to choose The fruits of this newly discovered right are sober indeed Last April a boy born in Bloomington Ind with Downs Syndrome needed a simple surgical procedure performed on his esophagus so that he could swallow His parents chose to refuse this treatment for him  Although 10 other couples volunteered to adopt infant Doe as he was called the Indiana courts gave the hospital permission to administer a strange new Orwellian medical treatment called nontreatment Food and water were withdrawn and six days later the little wasted form of Baby Doe died of starvation and dehydration On Feb 6 1982 workers repossessing a 20footlong metal shipping container from the posh Woodland Hills home of a Los Angeles pathologist made a gruesome discovery The container was stuffed with 17000 aborted fetuses each packed tightly in its own plastic container Autopsy reports disclosed fetuses as old as 30 weeks In 1977 the Federal Environmental Protection Agency approved a 300000 contract that used 100 fetuses to test the effects of pesticide A January 1980 issue of the magazine Chemical Week had an article describing the Eli Lilly Pharmaceutical Companys experiments with a compound using virusinoculated nasal passages of freshly aborted fetuses The research was directed toward knocking out viruses causing common cold Worst of all fetal tissue is being used to make cosmetics An advertisement for a product called California Beauty which is made by Rene Ibry of Cannes France reads Exclusively taken from fetuses the young cells applied to old tissues are able to regenerate the latter These cells are all the more effective because they are living It isnt 1984 yet Its only 1983 10 years since the 1973 Supreme Court decision on abortion Those of us going to Washington next Saturday urge that we all pause and think again about this subject and where it is leading us
STYLE; THE JUNIOR LEAGUE TAKES OFF WHITE GLOVES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/style/style-the-junior-league-takes-off-white-gloves.html,Beverly Brooks is the deputy superintendent of a dingy womens prison on 11th Avenue that houses felons who have committed crimes from arson to murder Many of them are 90 days away from release When Mrs Brooks heard the New York Junior League wanted to start a program at the Bayview Correctional Facility she said she thought What would they do here And why would they come She said she regarded league members as whiteglove uppermiddleclass women who dont do anything That was in 1978 Carol Bellamy a former State Senator and president of the City Council since 1977 has worked with the league in helping to achieve reforms in government services She once thought of the Junior League as sheer fluff I always pictured them as having something to do with flowers  you know garden shows and arrangements she said the other day from her City Hall office Well both women have changed their minds Warmth and Sincerity On first meeting with the league volunteers Mrs Brooks said she was astounded by their openness their warmth and sincerity Now almost five years later their consistency practicality and followthrough impress her too They are always at Bayview on the same night every week offering the inmates a supermarket of experts to help them cope with the outside world The workshops include how to write job resumes dress for job interviews shop with food stamps find New Yorks freebie goods events and services get the most food value for the least money learn the subway system and the facts on breast selfexamination for cancer They may come from the other side of the tracks but the women trust them said Mrs Brooks Trust is very difficult to establish in prison and consistency is the key A Word for a New Guide Miss Bellamy has also corrected for herself the commonly held and what she called an inaccurate perception of what the New York Junior League really is The reality is for example not flowers she said but the leagues new Access Guide to the city which helps disabled people take advantage of all the diverse activities offered here The league has a national membership of about 145000 A candidate must be proposed by a local league member and then present three letters of recommendation two of them from league members After an admissions interview a successful candidate becomes a provisional member which involves four months of weekly courses learning about the city and the league The sole criterion for membership according to the New York leagues president Katherine Sincerbeaux is an absolute commitment to volunteerism  not the way you look She pointed out that there are benefits for members as well New members learn much more about their community she said and acquire new skills and make friends  of particular importance for those coming to New York from other parts of the country They must also devote a certain number of hours a week to the leagues voluntary services Annual dues are 240 for actives and 205 for provisionals with an added onetime provisional fee of 150 The league is housed in a superb neoGeorgian mansion on East 80th Street that was built for Vincent Astor Traditionally it has helped children and old people sent food and clothing to the poor and the sick and provided guides for museums The league began to undergo dramatic changes about a decade ago when the emphasis changed from Lady Bountiful projects benefit balls and bazaars to social activism For the first time the New York League put itself on public record with the overwhelming support  indeed insistence  of its members on such issues as abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment Volunteers now also staff projects for victims of rape and incest and answer questions on venereal disease on a hotline at league headquarters 2127346010 They go into jails to educate male and female prisoners on alcoholism and its linkage to crimes Volunteers are being trained for a speakers bureau on the myths and facts of rape under the sponsorship of St LukesRoosevelt Hospital Center Miss Bellamy commented that the New York Junior League  founded in 1901 and the oldest league among more than 250 in the United States Canada and Mexico  has met the challenge of seeking and obtaining volunteers during a time of great crisis in volunteerism when enormous numbers of women have left home to enter the labor force But so have the members of the league Eightyone percent of the New York leagues members work full or part time The headquarters is now virtually empty until 6 PM when the members finish their paid jobs Of the 1900 New York league members more than half are active and thus must put in their quota of volunteer hours They contribute 150000 hours of trained service each year Projects and the attitudes toward them were different in the old days Eleanor Roosevelt was quoted in 1948 as she described her experiences with the league when she was 19 Untrained she said I plunged into teaching calisthenics and dancing to little girls from the East Side As I look back the results were sometimes quite ludicrous The New York league which does not include the less traditional Brooklyn Junior League founded in 1910 continues to be criticized for not reflecting the racial ethnic and religious diversity of the city Then there are the benefit society events of the New York league which are not entirely a thing of the past Among them are the Christmas bazaar and the Thanksgiving Eve Ball where debutantes come out into society Dont call them debutantes league officers invariably say Call them college provisionals At the Plaza Hotels cream and gold Grand Ballroom always the scene of the annual dance and presentation to the adult world there is a stag line of young male relatives in white tie tails and white gloves and Lester Lanins dance band playing bouncy melodies on stage Flanked by two escorts the debutantes curtsy rockily to the leagues president and the ball chairman Tom Barton whose wife has served as president and whose two daughters are league members hasnt missed the Thanksgiving Eve Ball in the last 30 years I love it I love it he said as he spun a partner around with dizzying enthusiasm You know the world may be a more serious place than it was in 1952  but its good theres some glamour left in it too
PRESIDENT SEEKS TO GAIN SUPPORT FROM MINORITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/16/us/president-seeks-to-gain-support-from-minorities.html,At the urging of advisers who fear that his reelection may be in jeopardy President Reagan has begun a series of program changes and initiatives to shore up his low political standing among blacks the unemployed and especially women White House officials said in interviews this week for example that Mr Reagan planned to assail discrimination against women in pensions and insurance and to seek tougher measures against delinquency in child support and alimony payments in his State of the Union Message Jan 25 According to these officials the President is studying the possibility of legislation in these areas which have received little attention from him in the last two years Incentives for Businesses Mr Reagan was also reportedly studying the possibility of seeking new incentives for the employment of displaced homemakers or women who are suddenly thrust into the job market after being widowed or divorced In addition the President is expected to call for incentives for businesses to hire the longterm unemployed unemployed young people and those thrown out of work because of declining industries in the Northeast and Middle West The most visible recent action directed at women was the selection of the Administrations first two women to head Cabinet agencies The two were Elizabeth H Dole a White House assistant for liaison with constituent groups who was appointed Secretary of Transportation and former Representative Margaret M Heckler of Massachusetts appointed as Secretary of Health and Human Services Today the President devoted his weekly fiveminute radio address to a tribute marking the 54th birthday of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr In another gesture to blacks the White House announced earlier this week that Mr Reagan would revisit a predominantly black parochial school in Chicago on Wednesday Bigotry and Injustice Remain In his radio address Mr Reagan reviewed highlights of Dr Kings life and said the slain civil rights leader awakened the moral sense of an entire nation but added Fifteen years after Martin Luther Kings death traces of bigotry and injustice still remain So let the anniversary of this courageous Americans birth be for us both a time of thanksgiving and a time of renewal Mr Reagan continued Let us be grateful for the Providence that sends among us men and women with the courage and vision to stand peacefully but unyieldingly for what is right The Presidents initiatives come at a time of rising concern by his aides that he is losing ground among key constituent groups whose support he needs if he decides to run for reelection A close political adviser to Mr Reagan said his support among workingclass voters was scattering Others pointed with alarm to recent polls showing that his approval ratings among women had plummeted Gallup Poll Results Cited A new Gallup Poll released today shows that only 36 percent of the women surveyed approve of the Presidents job performance Various poll numbers for single women and working women are sharply lower than this and Republican strategists believe that the low numbers cost the party several key elections last November Page 15 White House officials attribute Mr Reagans low ratings among women to many factors Several noted polls showing that women were more sensitive to the issue of war and peace Others acknowledged that the Administrations sharp cutbacks in social programs such as nutrition and health had hurt women disproportionately Several White House officials said they feared that Mr Reagans failure to move faster to strengthen his support among women and bluecollar workers was being seen among Republican Party professionals as a sign that he might not run for reelection We have got to retrieve the perception that Ronald Reagan cares about working people a White House aide said That perception is what elected him President in 1980 and without it he doesnt have a chance in 1984 Disappointment Over Budget A key aide to Mr Reagan indicated that there was disappointment among several aides that the Presidents new budget for the fiscal year 1984 which is to be made public Jan 31 does not contain more initiatives to help those without jobs But the aide said he and others were encouraged in particular with the initiatives for women in the pension insurance and workers rights area which are a product of a coordinating group headed by Mrs Dole The appointment of Faith Whittlesey now Ambassador to Switzerland to the White House liaison post held by Mrs Dole is regarded as encouraging by Reagan aides Mrs Whittleseys selection was said to be significant in another way she believes women have the right to have an abortion a belief that White House aides said would probably have prevented her from getting the job two years ago Opposition to Rights Amendment Mr Reagans strong opposition to both abortion and the Federal equal rights amendment are acknowledged by Reagan aides as a significant reason for his low ratings among women These aides said Mr Reagan would not change his view but one added Sometimes I think that if the women want the ERA so badly we should let it pass The Administrations answer to the proamendment forces has been to study laws and regulations on the Federal state and local level and repeal discriminatory provisions But little has been done in two years Legal equity is important but economic equity should be the area were focusing on now said Mrs Dole Look at whats happening in the work force today Theres been a revolution out there and we have to recognize it Accordingly Mrs Dole has recently stepped up contacts with womens groups to find what could be done In meetings at the White House these groups have recommended changes in the pension and insurance areas to protect the rights of women Although Mr Reagan does not normally review briefs to be filed by the Justice Department White House officials said he was given a review of the departments likely position in a recent case involving pensions In that case Solicitor General Rex E Lee told the Supreme Court last Tuesday that most pension plans illegally discriminated against women by paying them lower benefits than men simply because they lived longer Kathy Wilson director of the National Womens Political Caucus said she detected a real shift at the White House Its clear there is some movement over there she said A lot of credit should go to Elizabeth Dole who was just stonewalled over there for the first 18 to 20 months In the appointments area Helene Von Damm the White House personnel director said 94 of Mr Reagans Presidential appointments or 13 percent had gone to women Thats higher than it was for President Carter she said although womens groups maintain that women generally had more influential positions under Mr Carter Democratic Response to Reagan WASHINGTON Jan 15 UPI Representative Charles B Rangel a Manhattan Democrat said today in response to the Presidents weekly radio speech that Mr Reagans words of praise for Dr King conflict with policies that seem bent on rolling back civil rights efforts Mr Rangel a black whose district includes Harlem said in his own radio speech that Mr Reagans fine words were in conflict with those actions that his Administration has taken regarding the civil and human rights of many in this country Where is his support for Dr Kings legacy in the actions of an Administration that seems bent on rolling back civil rights efforts and deliberately alienating minority groups Mr Rangel asked

FERTILIZATION CLINIC OPEN IN NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/17/style/fertilization-clinic-open-in-new-york.html,The Presbyterian Hospital has established what is believed to be the first in vitro fertilization program in New York City and has selected 25 women as potential mothers of socalled testtube babies The women chosen from 150 applicants will undergo the treatment next month It involves removing several eggs from their ovaries in a surgical procedure called a laparoscopy fertilizing the eggs in a small glass Petri dish with their husbands sperm and returning the fertilized embryos to their wombs Multiple embryos are usually transplanted to increase the chances of a successful pregnancy The odds that a pregnancy will occur in such an attempt are about one out of five said Dr Raymond L Vande Wiele director of the obstetrics and gynecology service at the Presbyterian Hospital at 622 West 168th Street and codirector of the in vitro fertilization program If a pregnancy doesnt result on the first attempt a couple will be allowed to repeat the procedure several times he said This is a formidable procedure he said one that lasts 18 19 or 20 days and is trying to the patients It is also expensive he added with each fertilization and transplantation attempt costing around 5000 most of which is not reimbursible by insurance companies So far he said about 50 babies have been born around the world as a result of in vitro fertilization with a significant number of pregnancies The first baby to be born was Louise Brown on July 25 1978 in London The first American in vitro in glass fertilization program was started in 1980 at at Eastern Virginia Medical College in Norfolk Va and similar programs have sprung up at the University of Southern California the University of Texas Medical Center in Houston the University of Pennsylvania and at Vanderbilt and Yale universities In vitro fertilization is also being done in Melbourne and Sydney Australia Several other medical centers in this country have programs that are in the formative stage Others are not seeking publicity for their programs because of possible critical community reaction Plans to establish a clinic in Buffalo were canceled in December 1981 a few days after Bishop Edward D Head of the Roman Catholic diocese of Buffalo opposed the procedure as depersonalizing Some religious and righttolife groups equate the procedure with abortion because only those embryos that appear to be developing normally are transplanted to the womb The rest are discarded Dr Vande Wiele said that in setting up the program he had encountered no negative reactions from either the hospital fellow obstetriciangynecologists or Community Board 12 whose approval he sought He said he thought the hospitals attitude toward the program was one of enthusiasm Women who will be given priority in the program he said are those who are 40 years of age and under legally married childless and who have no Fallopian tubes or whose tubes are diseased One of those accepted for the program is a 36yearold New Jersey woman who did not want her name used She said she and her husband had been trying to have a baby for eight years Her Fallopian tubes are blocked she said despite microsurgery to try to correct the problem This really would be the last chance for my husband and me to have a baby she said Our doctors have said This is it  Peace of Mind She said that if her first attempt at becoming pregnant by in vitro fertilization did not succeed she would try two more times If these attempts are unsuccessful she said at least she and her husband would have peace of mind One of the most important things is knowing youve done everything you can and that theres nothing more you can do she said Another member of the program a 35yearold elementary schoolteacher from Long Island who has been trying to become pregnant for five years shrugged off the high cost of the program saying If you really want something you can always find a way to pay for it And what if she fails to become pregnant Then well think about adopting she said A woman accepted for treatment in the Presbyterian Hospitals program is told to notify the hospital when her menstrual period begins Between the fifth and 15th days of her cycle she will be treated with hormones to stimulate the production of eggs by her ovaries Around the 15th day the eggs are removed from the ovaries and fertilized in a Petri dish Two days later they are transplanted into the womans uterus She returns home the same day then waits until the end of her cycle to see whether she gets her next menstrual period When a pregnancy does result what are the chances that an in vitro baby will be malformed About 3 per cent the same as in normal births said Dr Georgianna Jagiello an obstetriciangynecologist and geneticist who is codirector of the program Dr Vande Wiele said a specially trained team that includes several gynecologists a urologist an ultrasound specialist a biochemist and a psychiatrist would conduct the program at the hospital Many of them have observed the in vitro fertilization program in Norfolk he said The End of the Line The psychiatrist is needed as part of the team according to Dr Elynne Margulis an obstetriciangynecologist who is medical coordinator of the program because patients who come to the program see this as the end of the line Ive had patients in other infertility programs say its like death when they dont become pregnant and they see their menstrual period she said Asked about the future Dr Vande Wiele said he thought that his team would one day have to face the implications of the question Can you make a boy or a girl The answer to that question he said is Theoretically yes Within 10 years he said doctors should be able to reach the ultimate goal correcting a familys genetic defects outside the womb

BLACKMUN ACCEPTS AFTERMATH OF WRITING ABORTION OPINION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/18/us/blackmun-accepts-aftermath-of-writing-abortion-opinion.html,Author of the abortion decision Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun said softly and slowly as if restudying the phrase We all pick up tags Ill carry this one to my grave When the Supreme Court legalized abortion 10 years ago it used Justice Blackmuns words carving his niche in American history I knew it was a nowin case but I didnt ask for the assignment Justice Blackmun in a rare ontherecord interview said recently of how he came to write the opinion I am mildly annoyed at those law professors included who personalize it the Justice said of the landmark ruling in Roe v Wade It was a decision of the court not my decision There were seven votes Still Receiving Letters Nevertheless most of the estimated 45000 letters delivered since the decision to the Supreme Courthave been addressed to Justice Blackmun We still receive 8 9 or 10 letters a day he said Some are very supportive very lovely messages But most are very abusive The more recent ones are as abusive as the initial ones Ignoring the advice of fellow Justices against reading such mail Justice Blackmun says I want to know what the people who wrote are thinking They have called him a murderer a butcher even Pontius Pilate They have compared him to the Nazi overseers of genocide On occasion as recently as last year on the campus of the University of Georgia his speaking appearances have been picketed Tells of His Feelings A devout Methodist Justice Blackmun has read letters of condemnation sent to him by Methodist clergymen Id be less than candid if I said it does not hurt but not as much anymore he said People misunderstand I am not for abortion I hope my family never has to face such a decision Justice Blackmun is convinced however that the Supreme Court was on solid legal ground when it ruled that a womans constitutional right of privacy includes the right to end an unwanted pregnancy I still think it was a correct decision he said We were deciding a constitutional issue not a moral one Justice Blackmun is an unlikely target of moral outrage He neither smokes nor drinks and adheres to an oldfashioned morality Viewed as an Independent Justice Blackmun Mis genuinely wellliked by those who work for him At one time ridiculed for what was taken as dependence on Chief Justice Warren E Burger he has been recognized in recent years as an independent force on the court Blackmun appears committed to viewing litigants before the court as real persons rather than legal abstractions an academician said of him adding he has an intense almost tangible concern that justice be done Justice Blackmun said he could not estimate how much time he had devoted to the ruling on Roe v Wade which was announced Jan 22 1973 A lot he answered when he was asked the question More than any other case Ive ever handled He said he could only guess why Chief Justice Burger picked him to write the decision and he asked that his thoughts on that topic not be made public For the record he acknowledged that for many his role as author of the abortion decision will overshadow the rest of his work in a Supreme Court tenure dating back to 1970 In a voice betraying neither rancor nor remorse Justice Blackmun said So be it

COAST NOW LEADER INDICTED IN '65 SLAYING IN NEW ORLEANS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/19/us/coast-now-leader-indicted-in-65-slaying-in-new-orleans.html,The president of the California branch of the National Organization for Women was indicted in a New Orleans suburb today in the robbery and murder of a French Quarter bar patron 17 years ago The indictment was returned against Ginny Foat 41 years old after one of her former husbands John Sidote appeared before a grand jury in Jefferson Parish The Louisiana authorities had said the case depended on his testimony Mrs Foat issued a statement in Los Angeles saying I believe with all my heart that a political climate of violence and degradation of women is in a test stage with me as its first victim She added that the only killing in my life was the death of a passive woman named Ginny Foat before the birth of a strong feminist by the same name In New Orleans District Attorney John Mamoulides said Mr Sidote would be granted immunity from prosecution in return for testifying Mr Sidote told the authorities earlier that Mrs Foat played a role in the 1965 slaying of Moises Chayo a 62yearold Argentine businessman visiting New Orleans According to the Jefferson Parish authorities Mr Sidote said that he and Mrs Foat working as a bartender and barmaid robbed Mr Chayo of 1400 before he was beaten to death with a tire iron Mrs Foat was arrested by the Los Angeles police a week ago on a sixyearold fugitive warrant At a hearing in California Superior Court here after the indictment she was denied bail and a petition for a writ of habeas corpus filed by her lawyer Marcia Brewer was rejected Mrs Foat was then returned to the womens jail here to await a hearing Feb 11 in her fight against extradition Her arrest produced outrage and charges of political harassment in the feminist and liberal political circles in which Mrs Foat had gained prominence in Los Angeles San Francisco and Sacramento Several supporters of Mrs Foat including other NOW members said she had not hidden the fact that she had been implicated in crime They said that she had talked of a former husbands making accusations against her in Nevada and Louisiana but that she thought she had been cleared when the charges were dismissed by a Nevada judge in 1977 for lack of evidence Sheriff Harry Lee of Jefferson Parish said today that Mrs Foats identity and whereabouts were brought to the attention of the Louisiana authorities early this month by a national board member of the feminist organization Shelly Mandell who was screening Mrs Foats background for a possible nomination to the Los Angeles Human Relations Commission In a statement released today through the Los Angeles NOW chapter Mrs Mandell said she had been led to believe that Foats past problems were resolved She added that she sought verification of that resolution through a discreet inquiry in order to prevent possible embarrassment to either Mrs Mandells employer City Councilman Marvin Braude or to Mrs Foat Sheriff Lee said Mrs Mandell had described Mrs Foat by her maiden name Virginia Galluzzo the name on the fugitive warrant When we put Virginia Galluzzo into the computer it hit he said It also gave her aliases  Virginia Foat Faulk Folk Folke We never did know that the woman known now as Virginia Foat was Virginia Galluzzo until we got this inquiry Mr Sidote had been convicted and served four years in a Nevada prison for another murder that he said he and Mrs Foat committed in 1965 at Lake Tahoe He said they had robbed a casino patron Donald Fitting a San Francisco hotel employee whose body was found later near the resort The authorities said they had had no suspects in either the New Orleans or the Lake Tahoe murder until Mr Sidote confessed to the police in upstate New York in 1977 after he was arrested on charges of assaulting a local woman Sgt John Salters of the New York State Police at Highland who described Mr Sidote as a heavy drinker recalled We brought him into the barracks He was going through the shakes had the DTs I bought him half a pint of vodka because he was gonna fall apart on me He started telling us about two homicides that had been committed by him and Galluzzo He had just had it According to him it was on his conscience Confession Wasnt Recanted Sergeant Salters said Mr Sidote did not recant the confession when he sobered up but rather repeated it several weeks later in a formal statement that was witnessed by the Ulster County District Attorney Michael Kavanagh Mr Sidote was then extradited to Nevada where the authorities said he agreed to testify against Mrs Foat in return for a lighter sentence He pleaded guilty to manslaughter in the Fitting murder but reneged on his promise to testify when he was sentenced to 25 years to life rather than 10 years officials said His former wife meanwhile had been arrested in the Los Angeles area on a Nevada fugitive warrant By this time she had remarried and was living with her new husband Raymond Foat A Nevada judge dismissed the charges against Mrs Foat and she was released because of the lack of testimony or any other evidence Mrs Foat returning to the Los Angeles area became active in NOW She was elected state president in 1981 Her supporters and NOW colleagues say little is known about Mrs Foats early life that would have pointed readily to her becoming a political activist and eventually a top feminist leader Involvement in King March The Ginny Foat Defense Committee which was formed last week said she had been an organizer of Dr Martin Luther Kings march on Washington but did not know whether she was officially working with Dr Kings Southern Christian Leadership Conference or was involved more casually said Jeanne Cordova a committee leader and NOW officer According to the committee Mrs Foat became active in the Los Angeles chapter in 1977 was soon elected vice president of political action and in 1979 organized NOWs annual national conference In 1980 she worked in the Illinois campaign for the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution and moved into the larger political arena to be elected a Kennedy delegate to the Democratic national convention She was a floor whip among the most vocal said Miss Cordova who was a delegate with Mrs Foat She and her organization just worked around the clock We were worried then about the Democratic platform position on prochoice and funding for abortions She was a leader Mrs Foat primarily earned her livelihood as a caterer first in Vancouver British Columbia and later in Orange County and Canoga Park in southern California Miss Cordova said Mrs Foat was born in Brooklyn in 1941 Acquaintances said she studied business and psychology at City College of New York without earning a degree The college however was unable to locate any record of her attendance Her friends say she has been married four times She has no children Authorities View of Her Life In contrast to the feminist leaders who knew an idealistic compassionate leader the lawenforcement authorities describe a Virginia GalluzzoFoat who had a darker side to her life Lieut Robert Garner a spokesman for the sheriffs office in Jefferson Parish said that while she lived in New Orleans Ginny Foat was employed as a barmaid at a bar near the waterfront According to the sheriffs office Mr Chayo the man she is accused of killing had come to New Orleans from Buenos Aires to visit a son who was being treated at a hospital According to Mr Sidotes confession to the New York police Jefferson Parish detectives have said Ginny Foat met the victim in the bar and enticed him to her car while Mr Sidote hid in the trunk She drove him to the isolated area released Mr Sidote from the trunk and there was a struggle Lieutenant Garner said Mr Chayos body in an advanced state of decomposition was discovered by a passerby on Dec 11 1965 in a weedy patch in the thenundeveloped area of Metairie Mrs Foats extradition would have to be approved by Californias new Governor George Deukmejian a Republican who pledged in his campaign to be more cooperative in granting extradition than was his Democratic predecessor Edmund G Brown Jr

"MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY; Budget or No, Reagan Keeps The Show Going",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/weekinreview/major-news-in-summary-budget-or-no-reagan-keeps-the-show-going.html,As White House budget hands scurried about backstage last week trying to find the right numbers their principal was front and center looking to set the right tone To mollify party moderates President Reagan journeyed to Chicago for a fundraiser for Republican Senator Charles H Percy where he promised new proposals for job training for the unemployed On the way he dropped in on a nearby allblack parochial high school where as if to reassure traditionalists he emphasized the link between education and employment At a cheerful news conference he celebrated the second anniversary of his inauguration with a review of the accumulated damage in economic and international affairs he had inherited and the progress he had made Yesterday he covered his social agenda promising in his weekly radio address to press for Congressional action on tuition tax credits for private schools school prayer and abortion In short he was campaigning hard Bits and pieces of the fiscal year 1984 budget he will present to Congress next Monday are said to be still going to the printer But according to the best estimates its projected deficit wont come below 185 billion and then by means that will please no one Last weekends Social Security compromise would bring some 10 billion in savings 3 billion to 4 billion could come through a freeze on spending of various kinds including the Federal payroll and retirement programs Defense costs though higher than last years are reportedly trimmed by 8 billion to 10 billion from earlier balance sheets Domestic programs seem unlikely to escape without a proposed reduction of another 25 billion to 30 billion If that is Congress accepts the White House blueprint which seems more unlikely The Pentagons budget at least rhetorically is considered fairer game by the legislators and a nervous Repubican leadership says the bottom line on much social spending may have already been reached Of the 100 billion worth of domestic prgrams the White House wanted pulled back in 1981 and 1982 Congress gave it nearly 60 billion Then there is fiscal 1985 and beyond  the key to the Presidents public appearances last week and to the White Houses private calculations The budget for that year will be before Congress during the 1984 Presidential campaign The urgency for the longer term is shared by the business community Its latest exhortation was an impressively endorsed Bipartisan Budget Appeal to cut defense and raise taxes more lest the recessions of the 80s make the slumps of the 70s look good The document signed by five former Secretaries of the Treasury was released the day the gross national product was reported to have declined at an annual rate of 25 percent in the last three months On paper on the tax side at any rate President Reagan may comply To reassure Wall Street that declining interest rates will not be inflated by ballooning deficits the Administration is considering a 135 billion package of contingency tax increases and tax restructuring perhaps via a flatrate tax or a consumption tax a tax on spending rather than income Mr Reagans strategists find the idea attractive for two reasons It can be called tax reform and the White House can project steadily receding deficits The increases would be automatically triggered if Federal red ink rose above 100 billion in 1985 Pretty much everyone expects that it will As if in dress rehearsal for next years battles the President returned to blaming Congressionally forced compromise for crimping his success in hastening recovery and the White House released a midterm report By the end of 1982 its otherwise exultant 118 pages acknowledged grave problems of unemployment remained Reduction in inflation consumer prices dropped 03 percent in December it was also reported last week led the list of Two Years of Progress
Abortion at 10,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/opinion/abortion-at-10.html,Ten years after the Supreme Courts judgment to legalize abortion the right of a woman to terminate her pregnancy is recognized by most Americans and still bitterly disputed by a minority It now appears that in 1973 the high court led rather than followed the election returns The righttolife movement failed last year to undo the decision in Congress and in attempts to punish supporting legislators at the polls Still constitutional liberties are not supposed to depend on their popularity and a debate still rages over the rulings legitimacy Even some who favor the result harbor misgivings about the Courts use of judicial power Looking back with an open mind we find ourselves satisfied that the Court acted judiciously as well as courageously The Court held in Roe v Wade that abortion in the early stages of pregnancy is a decision to be made by the woman in consultation with her doctor not by government It refused to recognize any constitutional right of personhood in the fetus It did allow some limitation on abortion in the second trimester of pregnancy and quite severe limitation in the third But the Court denied that it was thus choosing among rival theories of when life begins it was only recognizing the growing potential of life The justices have been richly abused for this close but practical reasoning Critics say they cant find the womans right in the Constitution and complain that the judges were legislating not interpreting the law Justices White and Rehnquist the two dissenters said the majority exercised raw judicial power But Justice Harry Blackmun persuasively found the womans right in 14th Amendment concepts of personal liberty and privacy And more Americans now understand what he meant in saying that the womans rights are at stake because her pregnancy involves both her body and her burden It taxes her physical and mental health she usually must raise the child often alone she takes the brunt of a familys distress when it cant support a child or the stigma of unwed motherhood What does liberty mean if society gives her no choice about bearing such burdens Justice Blackmuns delineation of the trimesters of pregnancy was no act of intellectual usurpation it is a plausible summation of medical knowledge and allows an increasing government interest as the fetus comes to resemble a baby It was a creative and also conciliatory legal rendering The righttolife movement now seems in disarray it acrimoniously upbraids its own leaders No constitutional amendment forbidding abortion seems likely even though meanspirited people persist each year in wanting to punish the poor by denying them governmentfinanced abortion American law cannot reach the private or religiously derived philosophies of its citizens no American is being forced to practice abortion But when philosophy divides society so sharply no law should impose one groups view on everyone else In this sense the abortion decision was not only fair it was brilliantly American
DEMONSTRATIONS MARK 10 YEARS OF LEGAL ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/us/demonstrations-mark-10-years-of-legal-abortion.html,About 26000 people marked the 10th anniversary today of the Supreme Courts decision legalizing abortion by marching on the Capitol to demand legislation overturning the ruling President Reagan called the Courts decision a tragedy and in his weekly radio address said he would continue to support legislation to end the practice of abortion on demand Mr Reagan made the broadcast from Camp David the Presidential retreat in Maryland as the antiabortionists marched past the White House to the Capitol The United States Park Police estimated the crowd at 26000 people Im here to fight against abortion said Gail Buss a mother of four from Springfield Va They should realize people mean business Abortion in effect legalizes killing she said This is just a beginning killing an unborn child Just where do you draw the line Would you also kill the very old and sick Abortion Supporters Meet At the same time a coalition of groups supporting the right to have abortions pledged to carry on with their cause All day long there were rallies fundraisers and news conferences marking a decade of legal abortion It happens we represent the point of view of a majority of Americans said Faye Wattleton president of Planned Parenthood Federation of America Mr Reagan simply has said that he cares not to hear about their point of view She was joined at a news conference by representatives of the American Civil Liberties Union the National Organization for Women and the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights The groups said they planned to fight attempts in the new Congress to place a permanent ban on Federal financing of abortion That stipulation has been attached to budget bills every year since 1978 Prayer Starts Demonstration The antiabortion demonstration began with a prayer by the Rev Thomas Welsh of Arlington Va We are here to urge the elected officials to redress the tragic mistake of the Supreme Court Mr Welsh said In a message read to the crowd Mr Reagan said We have waited 10 years for Congress to remedy this tragedy After reaching the Capitol the demonstrators said they would try to lobby the offices of their Congressmen and senators for passage of what they call the Human Life Amendment We are opposed to taking life Gov J Joseph Garrahy of Rhode Island told the crowd It is a very basic and important issue this nation must face The Governor who is a Democrat said 500 people had come from his state to take part in the demonstration Others came from Ohio and Kentucky as well as neighborhing Virginia and Maryland Will we maintain our committment to human life the Governor asked Yes the crowd roared back  President Renews Pledge WASHINGTON Jan 22 AP The President said in his weekly radio address that he had always believed that Gods greatest gift is human life and that we have a duty to protect the life of the unborn child Until someone can prove the unborn child is not a life he said shouldnt we give it the benefit of the doubt and assume it is Thats why I favored legislation to end the practice of abortion on demand and why I will continue to support it in the new Congress On Friday Mr Reagan met with more than a dozen leaders of the movement against abortion to underline his personal backing of their cause and urge them to unite behind a single piece of legislation Mr Reagan devoted his fiveminute broadcast to issues that affect families and said he would address the serious and painful problems of the economy and unemployment Tuesday when he delivered his State of the Union Message Watching the Football Game At Camp David Mr Reagan was working on drafts of the annual speech to Congress as he watched the Washington RedskinsDallas Cowboys football playoff Mr Reagan also reaffirmed in the broadcast that he would continue his backing of school prayer and tuition tax advantages for parents with children in private schools Senator Max Baucus of Montana giving the Democratic response to Mr Reagans address did not talk about abortion but urged Mr Reagan to stop claiming victory and start leading on the economy
EX-GOV. MILLIKEN FINDS BASIC CHANGES ARE NEEDED IN MIDWEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/us/ex-gov-milliken-finds-basic-changes-are-needed-in-midwest.html,The files are still unpacked The floors remain bare The fumes of fresh varnish linger around the new bookshelves And the desk rests uncluttered by the broad window overlooking the stormy green bay Its beautiful isnt it he said to the days visitor the only item on a neatly typed daily schedule that used to be so full of items it took two pages and a cluster of aides to whisper discreet reminders in his politically attuned ear The shelves desk and view belong to William G Milliken whose agenda for 14 years was running the government of Michigan in what turned out to be a period of economic decline throughout the industrial Middle West Now 18 days into voluntary retirement the 60yearold moderate Republican has the time to survey his past life and his new life from a new chair in his old hometown only three blocks from where the family department store is holding January sales Im just delighted to be out of the Governors chair now he said just because there are times to move on to turn a new corner and begin a new life Joins Chryslers Board The agenda for the new life is filling quickly for the wavyhaired popular Governor who dominated the politics of his depressed state and became an outspoken advocate a kind of elder statesman for the economic cultural and environmental causes of the troubled Middle West Last week Mr Milliken joined Chryslers board of directors Earlier he was named to head the new Center for the Great Lakes in Chicago He does not rule out the possibility of returning to politics or becoming an ambassador someday And several more board memberships will be announced soon I have plenty to do said the former Lieutenant Governor who replaced George Romney as Governor when Mr Romney joined President Nixons Cabinet in 1969 But these days when Mr Milliken looks out his new office windows he sees a far different Middle West The last two years were clearly the most difficult time I ever had he said With the highest unemployment rate of any industrial state Michigan shared the deep convulsions of the automobile industry the heart of Michigans economy and the driving force for much of the regions economy There were increasing demands on the states and their financial resources he said just at the time they were least able to help The pressures were unbelievable In the last two years Mr Milliken proposed state budget cuts of 18 billion nearly 20 percent dropping 15000 state employes You see people losing jobs in all sectors he said You could see the anxiety spreading and then its direct relationship to increases in public assistance the prison population alcoholism drug addiction wife abuse emotional health care needs all at the very moment the states ability to help is declining We tried to build a budget stabilization fund a kind of rainy day fund We had 250 million But under all those pressures it was gone virtually overnight The Good Life Fades Mr Milliken saw some of his regions brightest citizens migrate to the booming Sun Belt states in search of jobs and the good life better than their parents life that everyone once expected But that is no longer valid anywhere he said The Sun Belt  I call it the Parched Belt  is not and never was the utopia it seemed he went on Hundreds have come back to the Midwest quite disillusioned by the mushrooming problems down there the lack of services jobs inadequate water and rising tax rates The former Governor sees the need for basic structural changes in the Middle West He thinks many institutions especially primary schools must quickly create curriculums emphasizing computers and the kind of hightechnology training he sees replacing only some of the regions lost jobs We are going to need an entirely new sophisticated and highly trained work force he said But the terrible tragedy right now is that the labor force left behind has thousands of productive middleage men and women who worked hard and did everything we ever asked them to But they will simply be unable to acquire the necessary new skills of the future So in many cases their future is not very bright Calls Change Bewildering The first step toward a solution he maintained is to understand what is happening But this is very difficult when bewildering change is swirling all about us The next step he said is to abandon the traditional adversarial relationship among management labor and government and to build a new economy based on the areas strengths which he regards as its people its universities and its priceless water The Great Lakes is the worlds largest collection of fresh water he said and water will be for the Midwest almost like oil is to the OPEC countries It is vital to life and agriculture and attracts industry and tourism He said how the Great Lakes were used would affect the entire future of the countrys midsection a theme he will pursue through the new Center for the Great Lakes which is sponsored by the Joyce Foundation Mr Milliken said the future must also see an end to the days of industrial raiding when one state sought to lure factories from another It pays dividends in the short term he said but it is counterproductive in the long run He says he already sees signs of increased regional cooperation on protecting the Great Lakes and resisting its waters diversion elsewhere Inevitably this must expand to other areas he said There is no reason why every Midwestern state needs a forestry school or its own network of teachers colleges or expensive medical schools or mental health care facilities he said We cant afford it So lets share the load regionally more efficiently We shouldnt have to reinvent the wheel over and over again Limit to What We Can Do He said new forms of government must also develop Hard times bring new definitions he said Many government programs have gone on because they have gone on In the regulatory field for instance do we need or can we afford government regulation of things like watch repairs Let the marketplace handle that Government is to provide services for those who cant provide them themselves There is a new limit to what we can do But he is concerned with deteriorating faith in politics and government People can expect honesty and integrity he said but not miracles People now seem so eager to judge us by one single narrow issue like say abortion or taxes Your stand dooms you forever in their eyes But what about societys broader good But even given all the woes present and future the former Governor is confident The good times will come back he said But they will be very different good times leaner tougher more competitive Then Mr Milliken went out into the blowing snow and drove himself home from the office for the first time in 14 years
PREGNANT AND GOING TO SCHOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/nyregion/pregnant-and-going-to-school.html,IUSED to walk in the hallways of my other school real terrified Its more comfortable here Were one big family And I dont have to worry about crowded hallways or kids looking at me funny said a 16yearold girl her hands resting on her slightly rounded stomach just beginning to stretch the boundaries of a maroon sweatsuit She was six and a half months pregnant and unmarried She dropped out of her regular high school in midSeptember and at the urging of her guidance counselor has been attending the Boces 2 Vocational Educational Program in Bellport ever since She was one of about 20 girls between the ages of 15 and 17 enrolled in a special class for teenage expectant mothers  the only one of its kind on Long Island designed to provide both academic skills and occupational training to pregnant teenagers Barbara Strongin executive director of Suffolk County Planned Parenthood called the program truly a model adding Outside of New York City there is nothing like it downstate in occupational education The 18monthold program was started in response to an increase in teenage pregnancies especially acute in Brookhaven and Islip Towns served by the Boces 2 vocational program Boces 2 is an acronym for the Board of Cooperative Educational Services covering school districts in the second supervisory district According to Suffolks Department of Health Services there were 3890 teenage pregnancies in the county in 1981 resulting in 1292 live births compared with 2828 pregnancies in 1980 leading to 1217 births More than 700 of the births in 1980 the most recent year for statistics listed for the individual towns were in Brookhaven and Islip Towns combined Socialservices and familyplanning professionals who work with pregnant teenagers say that the high rate of pregnancy in those areas is due to a variety of factors They say many of the girls who gave birth came from impoverished families with limited access to medical services insuring early detection which would allow the opportunity to choose abortion The experts also cited the growing acceptance of unmarried motherhood among both black and white socioeconomic groups And some family planners blame the school districts for failing to offer adequate sex education courses that would better enable teenagers to make knowledgeable decisions about their futures Once a teenager becomes pregnant the likelihood of her ever finishing high school diminishes educators and familyplanning experts say that pregnant adolescents account for the largest percentage of the high school dropout rate Pregnancy gives them an excuse not to stay in school Mrs Strongin said They may not be interested in staying in school in the first place and if they are not up to capacity once they are pregnant they just drop out Since 1976 when Title IX of the Federal 1972 Education Amendments went into effect public schools have been required to continue educating pregnant students If a girl does not wish to stay in her regular school and most do not  she may also opt for home tutoring in which a teacher visits the house once or twice a week The advantage of the Boces program over home tutoring according to Beverly Jefferson health coordinator and assistant principal at the Bellport school is that here they have some interaction with their peers rather than staying home with television and junk food  They can share their experiences and discuss their problems with a support group Mrs Jefferson said Not only is the program designed to keep pregnant adolescents in school but also since most of them are keeping their babies we encourage them to develop some skills so that they can support a child Mrs Jefferson said At Boces half of the day is spent on required academic subjects and the other half on learning a marketable skill Although the students are steered toward less traditional areas such as electronics word and data processing and welding many choose courses in cosmetology or the health professions preparing for jobs as nurses aides or medical assistants The program is financed under a State Department of Education grant but because the class is underutilized by the school districts future funds at least from the state may be in jeopardy Twentythree high schools and 28 school districts are eligible to use the program free of cost but only eight high schools are doing so Students are referred to the class by school nurses and guidance counselors and although they are a link to the kids we are not 100 percent sure they all know about the program Mrs Strongin said Many school administrators she contends refuse to admit that there is a teenage pregnancy problem I talked to one district superintendent who said his district had only one or two pregnancies a year  and I know for a fact that there were at least 30 Mrs Strongin said We know the numbers are there we just have to figure out a way to reach them Meanwhile the program has the support of the teachers and administrators It would be prehistoric to abolish the program at this point  its absolutely essential that the program continue said Linda Einhorn who teaches the class English and social studies One alternative to the state funds may be for the districts to pay for the class directly instead of paying for home tutoring considered the second best option by the programs supporters With home tutoring the girls are taught in isolation Miss Einhorn said They dont get child care information or peer group counseling where they can talk openly about anything and everything Jeffrey Sardegna a math and science teacher added We need the support of all the high schools to survive Theyve only recently been giving the girls home teaching Instead of paying for that the districts could pay for this The districts have to pick it up or it will die
DIOXIN'S PERIL TO HUMANS: PROOF IS ELUSIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/23/us/dioxin-s-peril-to-humans-proof-is-elusive.html,The deadly chemical dioxin an unwanted byproduct of herbicides pesticides and other industrial products is raising increasing concern among government agencies scientific researchers and people who may come in contact with it Communities from New York to Oregon have reported human health problems that they fear are linked to exposure to dioxin although the links have not been proved scientifically Officials in Missouri say the number of sites there believed contaminated by the chemical has risen to about 100 and Gov Christopher S Bond has asked his Legislature to set up a special fund to help clean them up Dioxin he said could lead to public hysteria if not handled properly Accord on Animal Research Research biologists and environmental scientists generally agree that in laboratory experiments on animals dioxin has more harmful effects and in smaller doses than any chemical man has produced Twentyfive millionths of a gram is known to be potent enough to kill a twopound animal There are 28 grams in an ounce But scientific proof of the effect on humans has been elusive Conducting tests of toxic chemicals on people is ethically unacceptable and establishing epidemiological proof by looking for correlations between exposure and effect on a given population is not always possible In some cases cancer may not develop for 30 years after exposure to a chemical carcinogen Among the other unknowns about dioxin is how much of it there is in the country and how much is being produced Dioxin is nearly insoluble in water but it clings tightly to soil particles and dissolves in organic solvents like alcohol or oil It can enter the body by direct skin contact ingestion or inhalation Dioxin was contained in oil sprayed almost a decade ago as a dustcontrol measure at horse stables and along roadsides throughout eastern Missouri In recent months concern has arisen about dioxins longlasting effects on residents of Times Beach Mo and other areas and state and Federal officials have been finding more and more sites at which the chemical was dumped Dioxin was among the hazardous chemicals found in 1978 at the Love Canal near a residential neighborhood of Niagara Falls NY and it has been found at individual dump sites elsewhere in the country It was also a chemical contaminant of the defoliant Agent Orange used in Vietnam Humans who have been exposed to it near Love Canal in Vietnam or in situations such as train wrecks or factory explosions have suffered a variety of severe health problems including kidney and liver ailments birth defects and cancer But whether it was the dioxin that caused the ailments among the humans exposed to it has not been determined to the satisfaction of medical researchers The Veterans Administration which has said it will seek to determine whether a link exists among Vietnam veterans has relinquished control of the project to the Federal Centers for Disease Control Scientists Are Progressing Only in recent months have scientists begun to make what they now regard as an important breakthrough They believe a clearer understanding of the effect of dioxin on health is emerging Not until recent years were many physicians even trained to recognize symptoms of socalled chemical diseases Moreover scientists underscoring the frequent difficulty in proving cause and effect in medicine emphasize that it took 40 years to establish a link between cigarette smoking and lung cancer even though the evidence seemed to point that way all along Now in a series of experiments reported most recently in last Novembers issue of the scientific journal Nature a member of the dioxin group of compounds one called 2378Tetrachlorodibenzenepdioxin or TCDD has been shown to be what is called a potent tumor promoter in rats and mice According to the paper by Dr Alan Poland and others at the University of Wisconsins McArdle Laboratory for Cancer Research the model of tumor production derived from these experiments is relevant to humans because the excessive multiplication of cells in the skin of mice is strikingly similar to that evoked by TCDD in human skin Dr Poland said TCDD did not appear to be a complete carcinogen by itself But he said it enhanced morbid growth in cells already exposed to potential cancercausing agents that is exposure to TCDD in conspiracy with other environmental factors brings on the cancer Basic Mechanism Is the Same There is no question that dioxin plays a role in tumor formation in animals and almost certainly has the same action on human cells said Dr Howard Eisen a medical officer at the National Institutes of Health The basic mechanism is the same TCDD is the variety of dioxin found in Agent Orange which is a mixture of 24D and 245T herbicides and the variety confirmed in Missouri soil by the Environmental Protection Agency Members of the dioxin family known as polychlorinated dibenzodioxins or PCDDs are byproducts not only of herbicides and pesticides but also of dyes pharmaceuticals wood preservatives and other products known generally as chlorinated phenols In general these synthetic organic compounds are formed by adding chlorine to hydrocarbon molecules that are derived from petroleum Two decades ago commercial 245T often contained as much as 70000 parts per billion of TCDD and sometimes more But manufacturers say current techniques can reduce it to a level of less than 10 parts per billion The industry maintains that it can assure safe products especially since the material sprayed on fields is heavily diluted What Spraying Might Do If the TCDD content of commercial 245T is 100 parts per billion for example a single spraying might cause surface soil concentrations of 002 parts per trillion Estimates of TCDD soil contamination from Agent Orange in Vietnam are about 008 parts per billion Spokesmen at the Dow Chemical Corporation said that by testing their output of the dichlorophenol herbicide 24D nine times every 24 hours they make sure dioxin contamination never exceeds 1 part per billion Although 24D is closely related to 245T it is not generally contaminated with TCDD It does contain other less toxic dioxins though there has been almost no research on the effects of these substances The possible risk posed by even that level of dioxin must be weighed industry spokesmen say against the enormous economic value of the products Industry specialists say they believe further that the risk is not so high as to require special precautions other than those always taken in handling hazardous substances like herbicides and pesticides Advice From Disease Agency Assessing that risk is of course part of the problem Researchers say the risk begins to appear in animals with exposure in the partsper1000billion range The Centers for Disease Control have advised Missouri officials that materials containing more than one part per billion of TCDD should be removed from residential areas But that figure itself has caused some confusion Dr Renate D Kimbrough of the Federal disease agency expressed annoyance with some news accounts that reported incorrectly that the agency considered dioxin concentrations below 1 part per billion in soil to be safe Although this is the detection limit being used in soil tests at residential areas in Missouri she said it represents a compromise between health concerns and cleanup practicalities Dr Kimbrough said exposure to lower concentrations over extended periods could still present health risk In one area of Missouri the Environmental Protection Agency said dioxin was found last fall in surface soil concentrations of 300 parts per billion The Federal agency calculates that exposure to this soil presents an added cancer risk for children who ingest it regularly of as much as 35 percent That is these children have a 35 percent greater chance of contracting cancer in their lifetime than those who do not ingest the soil This is regarded as above the approximately 30 percent risk of cancer that all Americans face The special properties of chlorinated phenols of which dioxins can be a byproduct are what make them so useful to an industrial society But those properties such as heat resistance and electrical resistance insolubility in water and chemical durability are also what make the phenols biologically threatening Among other things the substances may collect in living organisms at higher concentrations than in the surrounding ecosystem a process known as bioaccumulation Problem With Enzymes In virtually all types of tissue in every animal species tested Dr Poland of the University of Wisconsins laboratory said in an interview TCDD induces the production of enzymes that are the organisms attempt to metabolize or render harmless the chemical irritant But the enzymes are now often thought of as a doubleedged sword because organisms that have a high capacity for producing them are more susceptible to tumors at the spot where a carcinogen is administered while those with a low capacity show distant cancers such as leukemia or lymphomas Dr Daniel Nebert the branch chief of developmental pharmacology at the National Institutes of Health who is also active in dioxin research concurred with Dr Polands findings calling them a major breakthrough Other scientists generally agreed with that assessment According to Dr Nancy Kim of the New York State Department of Healths toxic substances assessment unit TCDD fits into one of two major cancer theories In the first the hypothesis is that merely one foreign molecule attaching to DNA can set off the cancer process Because TCDD does not bind appreciably to DNA it does not match this scheme But its ability to cause excessive cell multiplication known as hyperplasia does fit the second theory that cancer is caused by repeated irritation of tissues Although scientists believe that current laboratory work showing the similarities in animal and human cancer mechanisms has taken the research a crucial step forward such theoretical work is only half the puzzlesolving process The other half is human epidemiology a tedious timeconsuming matter hindered by all the realworld ambiguities that laboratory work can filter out Study of Chemical Plant Workers Scientists at the National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health are studying an unusually high incidence of softtissue sarcomas among workers exposed to dioxin at two chemical companies in Michigan and West Virginia In a letter to the medical journal Lancet for the January 1981 issue the researchers reported that three of 105 workers who died suffered from the rare cancer This was 29 percent of the deaths in the group the general population would be expected to show only seven onehundredths of one percent The study might provide the first international confirmation of a 1977 report from Sweden suggesting that forestry workers exposed to 24D and 245T have a roughly fivefold higher incidence of softtissue sarcomas In addition several studies have revealed an increased incidence of Hodgkins disease in lumberjacks and woodworkers A Lancet editorial noted last year that any change in the pattern of sarcomas even in small numbers of cases might strengthen the causative association with dioxin Studies by Dr Bertram Carnow an occupational health consultant and editor of the Journal of Occupational Medicine examined a group of 47 men from 1980 to 1982 who had been exposed to dioxin after a railroad accident in 1979 In an interview Dr Carnow said the exposure varied from 8 hours to 90 days at concentrations in soil or liquid runoff of about 30 parts per billion Five of the men or 106 percent have developed skin cancers the expected incidence in the general population is about 017 percent a year A significant number of other disorders was also observed The only safe level of dioxin is nondetectable said Dr Carnow whose medical practice in Chicago has treated nearly 300 cases of dioxin exposure Besides the role of TCDD in causing cancer the other great area of medical concern regards apparently related fetus damage and other reproductive problems For animals the evidence is straightforward and overwhelming TCDD injures or kills animal embryos at

HISTORIC REVISION OF CATHOLIC LAWS SIGNED BY PONTIFF,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/26/world/historic-revision-of-catholic-laws-signed-by-pontiff.html,Pope John Paul II signed a new code of canon law today that incorporates many of the historic changes brought about by the Second Vatican Council and other reforms that flowed from it The new code will not officially take effect until Nov 27 but most of the changes have already been put into practice by the clergy and the 750 million Roman Catholics around the world The signing ceremony symbolized the closing of an important chapter in the churchs modern history which began on this date 24 years ago when Pope John XXIII announced his intention to summon the first ecumenical council of the 20th century to discuss church doctrine Era of Debate Was Opened It was a decision that set in motion events that after his death led to Vatican II in the mid1960s a council that liberalized the church and its rituals and ushered in an era of debate among the clergy and the laity We recommend ourselves to the mercy of God because this is a historic event and it is up to those who come after us to judge what we have done Pope John Paul II said at the signing ceremony The new code sweeps away vestiges of authoritarian church law broadens the role of the laity and decentralizes the church by extending more authority to the bishops Yet it also upholds traditional church law on issues that are of great interest to many Catholics particularly womens rights advocates Abortion Penalty Retained For instance it retains the penalty of automatic excommunication for undergoing or performing an abortion reserves the right of ordination into the priesthood for men only and leaves unchanged the churchs bans on contraception and divorce On the last issue the revised code places limits on an experimental program among American Catholics that made it easier to obtain annulments of marriages from the church The old code rewritten in 1917 named 37 offenses that resulted in immediate and automatic excommunication which bars a person from receiving the sacraments of the church That list has been reduced to seven Code Must Be Translated The text of the Popes official statement on the signing of the code will not be released until Wednesday the Vatican announced The code is not expected to be made public until next week when copies will be distributed in Latin Then begins a ninemonth effort to translate it into many languages and distribute it around the world for Catholics to discuss It is not expected that the actual promulgation of the code will directly affect or influence Catholics in a major way since most of the changes have been introduced in a piecemeal fashion over the last two decades by church decree or accepted practice A document that would have been considered revolutionary 20 years ago actually contains very few surprises today said the Rev Vincent OKeefe former president of Fordham University in New York and now a senior official with the Society of Jesus headquarters in Rome Its been talked about for nearly a quarter of a century and now that its here everyone is looking ahead to the unfinished work of Vatican II the reorganization of the Curia and the intellectual and spiritual formation of seminarians In a Vatican news conference today summaries of the code were presented by canon law experts and others who had a hand in its preparation One unexpected change came in the details of the expansion of the laitys role at the parish level In a departure from previous practice it will now be possible for lay people men and women alike to fill some priestly duties in parishes where there is a shortage of priests according to Bishop Jose Rosalio Castillo Lara head of the Vatican commission that has been working on the new code for 17 years He said lay people could be granted permission by the episcopal authorities to manage a parish perform weddings officiate at funeral rites and take charge of religious training They will not however be authorized to say mass or hear confessions he said The code also formalizes other advances already put into practice that were not available to women when the code was last rewritten For example women can now become diocesan chancellors auditors assessors financial administrators and seminary board members They can also serve on diocesan annulment tribunals More Parity for Couples In addition husbands and wives are treated with greater parity and womens religious orders are given more administrative autonomy than in the past The 1917 code had 2414 canons or articles of law contained in five books The new one has 1752 canons in seven books Among the old laws extensively altered were the ones that dealt with acts that result in excommunication The seven remaining excommunicative offenses are abortion violation of the confidentiality of confession absolution by a priest of a person who has committed a sin with the priests assistance profanation of the consecrated communion host consecration of a bishop without Vatican approval a physical attack on the Pope and heresy and abandoning the faith which in 1949 Pope Pius XII interpreted as applicable to active members of the Communist Party Several Italian cities today are controlled politically by Communists including Rome Florence Naples and Milan Ban on Political Office In political matters the code retains a law that excludes priests and nuns from political office except in special cases and also bars them from leadership roles in labor unions They must favor peace and accord based on justice Pio Ciprotti an expert on canon law said at the news conference But they cannot assume political office or leadership roles in labor unions unless local bishops decide otherwise for the common good or defense of the church Among former church laws dropped in the new code are restrictions against cremation marriages with nonCatholic Christians and membership in the Masons unless these acts are done expressly to defame the church and its teachings Also discarded were old laws carrying the penalty of automatic excommunication that proscribed the publishing of books defending heresy reading such books without the express permission of the church or making false relics for sale

STUDY FINDS FEWER FRESHMEN IN COLLEGE LOOK TO TEACHING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/29/us/study-finds-fewer-freshmen-in-college-look-to-teaching.html,College freshmen today are less interested in becoming teachers than at any time in the last 17 years according to a national survey sponsored by the American Council on Education and the University of California at Los Angeles Further the survey indicates that freshmen are more materialistic and show less social concern than in past years consistent with a trend that began in the middle 1970s At the same time an increasing percentage of freshmen say they approve of sex if people like each other believe abortion should be legalized and favor a national health care plan The profile of the freshman class is produced annually by the education council and researchers at UCLA providing a yardstick against which changes in the attitudes and characteristics of college students can be measured Providing Reflection on Values Information on career interests is considered especially important because it reflects the values of students and predicts rises and declines in the popularity of certain professions Since 1966 when 217 percent of the entering freshmen were planning careers as schoolteachers student interest has declined steadily to the point where only 47 percent of the 1982 freshmen aspire to teaching careers says the report on the survey The American Freshman National Norms for Fall 1982 The eroding interest in teaching seems to hold unfortunate consequences for elementary and secondary education in the country coming at a time when education officials say that fewer and fewer good candidates are entering teaching programs An especially serious shortage of teachers has developed in certain fields such as mathematics and science and further disenchantment on the part of college students seems to pose problems for school systems trying to fill vacancies A Grim Outlook Is Seen When these trends are viewed in the light of other recent data about prospective school teachers the outlook for our educational system is grim said Alexander W Astin director of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program at the university which conducted the survey Since recent studies of college admissions tests show that education majors have much weaker academic skills than students majoring in most other fields Dr Astin continued it appears that we are headed for a crisis not only in the quantity but also in the quality of persons who want to teach in our elementary and scondary schools The fields whose popularity is rising among freshmen who in many cases start the major area of study upon entering college are business engineering and computer programming The percentage of freshmen choosing these three fields as career choices reached a record in the 1982 survey Business has shown the sharpest rise of all capturing the allegiance of 202 percent of the freshmen in 1982 as against 116 percent in 1966 Better Pay as a Lure The move toward betterpaying professions seems to be an important factor in the decline of interest in teaching More than twothirds of the freshmen 689 percent said that being very well off financially was an essential objective This was a goal of 652 percent of the freshmen last year and 435 percent in 1967 At the same time to make more money was a reason very important in deciding to go to college for 698 percent of this years freshmen as against 67 percent last year and 499 percent in 1971 The altruistic goals embraced by so many college freshmen in the late 1960s and early 1970s when the campuses become centers of dissent against the Vietnam War are less and less evident according to the survey Students placed less importance than in other recent years on cleaning up the environment helping people in difficulty promoting racial understanding and developing a meaningful philosophy of life This would appear to be a general societal phenomenon said Dr Astin A Crowded Middle of the Road In identifying their political orientation 18 percent called themselves far left 189 percent were liberal 598 percent were middleoftheroad 184 percent were conservative and 1 percent were far right The attitudes of the freshmen on a number of social issues were mixed As against a year ago fewer freshmen favored abolishing the death penalty or giving preferential treatment to the disadvantaged And more thought criminals had too many rights and were against the legalization of marijuana At same time however more approved of school busing to achieve racial balance and fewer would prohibit homosexual relations The survey report is based on the responses of 188692 fulltime freshmen with the results weighted to reflect a representative national sample Dr Astin was assisted by Margo King Hemond and Gerald T Richardson of the Cooperative Institutional Research Program Copies of the report are available at 750 each from the Cooperative

LEARNING FROM DISNEY AND DICKENS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/books/learning-from-disney-and-dickens.html,The following essay which he titled Cartoons was one of the last works of the novelist short story writer and essayist John Gardner who died in a motorcycle accident last September at the age of 49 It forms part of a forthcoming book of essays by diverse writers In Praise of What Persists edited by Stephen Berg TRYING to figure out the chief influences on my work as a writer turns out to be mainly a problem of deciding what not to include I grew up in a family where literary influence was everywhere including under the bridge on our dirt road where I kept my comic books My father is a memorizer of poetry and scripture a magnificent performer in the old reciter tradition I once did a reading in Rochester NY near Batavia where I grew up After Id finished several people remarked that I was a wonderful reader  though not quite up to your father of course He did readings of everything from Edgar Guest to Shakespeare and The Book of Job at the monthly Grange meetings in schools churches hospitals While he milked the cows my mother whod once been his high school English teacher would read Shakespeares plays aloud to him from her threelegged stool behind the gutter and he would take yelling from the cows flank whatever part hed decided on that night  Macbeth King Lear Hamlet and so on My mother was a wellknown performer too except that she mainly sang She had one of those honeysweet Welsh soprano voices and sang everything from anthems to the spirituals shed learned from an old black woman who took care of her during her childhood in Missouri Often my mother performed in blackface with a red bandana a practice that may sound distasteful unless you understand that she wasnt kidding she was authentic flatting quartertoning belting it out She was amazing They frequently worked together my mother and father and were known all over western New York Sometimes they were in plays  my mother often directed  and wherever they went riding around in the beatup farm truck or just sitting in the kitchen they sang always in harmony like crazy people The house was full of books very few of them books that would now be thought fashionable aside from the Shakespeare and Dickens My parents read aloud a lot  the narrative poems of Scott miles of Longfellow spooky stories by Edgar Allan Poe the poems of Tennyson and Browning also rather goofy religious writers I loved them what did I know like Lloyd C Douglas and some woman whose name escapes me now who wrote Jesusfilled love stories with titles like A Patch of Blue My grandmother who was bedridden through much of my childhood was especially fond of this religious lady and one of my more pleasant chores was to read her these tender little novels The climax was always the moment the boy shyly touched the girls hand Ive never found anything more sexually arousing than that Jesusfilled longdelayed touch I mean it was smut it nearly made me a pervert and not a court in the land could nail her My favorite authors at least when I was between the ages of 8 and 18 were in what might be described as the nonrealistic tradition God Dickens and Disney One of my less pleasant chores when I was young was to read the Bible from one end to the other Reading the Bible straight through is at least 70 percent discipline like learning Latin But the good parts are of course simply amazing God is an extremely uneven writer but when Hes good nobody can touch him I learned to find the good parts easily some very sexy stuff here too and both the poetry and the storytelling had a powerful effect on what I think good fiction ought to be Dickens I ran into when I was in my early teens when I began to find the Hardy boys tiresome and unconvincing I never liked realism much but the irrealism of two boys having long conversations while riding on motorcycles I was big on motorcycles myself was more than I could put up with Running across Dickens was like finding a secret door I read book after book and when Id finished the last one I remember feeling a kind of horror as if suddenly the color had gone out of the world then luckily I discovered that when you went back to one of the ones you had read first you couldnt remember half of it you could read it again and find it even better so life wasnt quite as disappointing as for a moment Id thought For me at that time Disney and Dickens were practically indistinguishable Both created wonderful cartoon images told stories as direct as fairy tales knew the value of broad comedy spiced up with a little weeping I have since learned that Dickens is occasionally profound as Disney never deigns to be but that was never why I valued Dickens or have now a bust of him in my study to keep me honest Unconsciously without ever hearing the term in fact  I learned about symbolism from Dickens and Disney with the result that I would never learn to appreciate as I suppose one should those realistic writers who give you life data wihout resonance things merely as they are Dickenss symbolism may never be very deep the disguised witches and fairy princesses Uriah Heep and his mother flapping around like buzzards or all the selfconscious folderol of A Tale of Two Cities  but in my experience anyway it spoils you forever for books that never go ooboom There were other important influences during this period of my life probably the most important of which was opera The Eastman School of Music presented operas fairly often and of course played host to traveling opera companies including the Met From Dickens and Disney not to mention God it took no adjustment to become operaaddicted The plots of most operas not all heaven knows are gloriously simpleminded or to put it more favorably elemental the stage is nothing if not a grand cartoon Wagners mountainscapes and gnomes Mozarts crazies Humperdincks angels the weirdness and clowning that show up everywhere from La Boheme to The Tales of Hoffmann I was by this time playing French horn and of course Id always been around singing So I got hooked at once  hence my special fondness now for writing librettos By the time I reached college my taste was Im afraid hopelessly set Predictably I was ravished by Melville  all those splendid cartoon images for instance Ahab and the Chinese coolies hes kept hidden until the first time he needs to lower away after whale  and of course by Milton who must be considered one of the alltime great cartoonists as when Satan Puts on swift wings and toward the Gates of Hell Explores his solitary flight sometimes He scours the right hand coast sometimes the left Now shaves with level wing the Deep then soares Up to the fiery concave touring high Its true Miltons a little boring now and then and Milton teachers often dont properly value the cartoonist in him and want to know things about Paradise Lost that only some kind of crazy could get seriously interested in but never mind Im afraid the embarrassing truth is that the whole literary tradition opened out for me from Disney and his kind I got caught up in the mighty cartoons of Homer and Dante much later Virgil and Apollonius the less realistic 18thand 19thcentury novelists Fielding Smollett Collins and the rest the glorious mad Russians Tolstoy Dostoyevsky Bely and those kinds of poets who fill ones head with strange intense visions like Blake Coleridge and Keats FOR me the whole world of literature was at this time one of grand cartoons I thought of myself mainly as a chemistry major and took courses in English just for fun I guess I thought literature was unserious like going to the movies or playing in a dance band even an orchestra It did not seem to me that one ought to spend ones life on mere pleasure like a butterfly or cricket Beethoven Shakespeare Richard Strauss Conan Doyle might be a delight but to fritter away ones life in the arts seemed well not quite honest Then I came across the New Criticism At the first college I went to for two years Id read nearly all of the Modern Library partly for fun partly because I felt ignorant around my fellow students people who could talk with seeming wisdom about Camus and Proust Nietzsche and Plato  I soon discovered they hadnt really read what they claimed to have read theyd just come from the right part of town  but Id never in any serious sense studied literature I took a couple of courses where one was examined on what Carlyle and Cardinal Newman said without much emphasis on why or to whom But when I moved to Washington University in St Louis I got a whole new vision of what literature was for  that is the vision of the New Criticism Like the fanatic Ive always been I fell to analyzing fiction digging out symbols and structural subtleties learning about levels and so on I dont say this was a foolish activity  in fact I think the New Critics were basically right Its much more interesting and rewarding to talk about how literature works than to read biographies of the writer which is mainly what the New Criticism replaced Working with the famous books by Cleanth Brooks and Robert Penn Warren I began to love things in fiction and poetry that Id never before noticed things like meaning and design and like all my generation I made the great discovery that literature is worthwhile not a thing to be scorned by serious puritans but a thing to be embraced and turned cunningly to advantage I learned that literature is Good for you and that writers who are not deeply philosophical should be scorned I began to read realists  two of whom Jane Austen and James Joyce I actually liked  and I began to write serious fiction that is instead of writing pleasant jingles or stories I desperately hoped would be published in The Saturday Evening Post or maybe Manhunt I began shyly eyeing The Kenyon Review With a sigh of relief though Id enjoyed them in a way I quit math and science and signed up instead for courses in philosophy and sociology and psychology which I knew would make me a better person and perhaps a famous writer so brilliant and difficult that to get through my books you would need a teacher This period lasted longer than I care to admit On the basis of my earnestness and a more or less astonishing misreading of Nietzsche I was convinced that he was saying that only fiction can be truly philosophical I won a Woodrow Wilson Fellowship to the University of Iowa where I meant to study in the famous Writers Workshop but soon ended up taking medieval languages and literature the literature God had been nudging me toward all along Beowulf The Divine Comedy the Gawain poet and Chaucer The scales fell from my eyes My New Critical compulsion to figure out exactly how everything works how every nuance plays against every other had suddenly an immense field to plow I continued to read and think about other literature  I went through a Thomas Mann phase a Henry James phase and so on  but I found myself spending more and more time trying to figure out medieval works IT seems to me that when I began working on medieval literature in the late 50s and early 60s scholars knew very little about even the greatest works in that literature No one had really figured out the structure of the works of the Gawain poet not to mention Beowulf or the poetry of Chaucer People were still arguing about whether or not Beowulf is a Christian poem people were still trying to shuffle around The Canterbury Tales The usual New Critical method which is to stare and stare at the work until it comes clear was useless on this material because again and again you found yourself staring at something that felt like a symbol or an allusion or felt that maybe it ought to be some kind of joke but you couldnt see the humor To figure out the poem you had to figure out the world it came from  read the books the poets knew try to understand esthetic principles abandoned and forgotten centuries ago One had no choice but to become a sort of scholar Literary detective work is always fun for a certain kind of mind at least but the work I did on medieval literature then on later classical literature was for me the most exciting detective work Ive ever done or heard of The thing was not only did you solve interesting puzzles but when you got them solved you found youd restored something magnificent a work of art  in the case of Beowulf or The Canterbury Tales  supremely beautiful and noble One unearthed tricks of the craft that nobodyd known or used for a long long time tricks one could turn on ones own work making it different from anybody elses and yet not crazy not merely novel I think every writer wants to sound like himor herself thats the main reason one sees so many experimental novels And of course the risk in the pursuit of newness is that in refusing to do what the socalled tradition does one ends up doing exactly the same thing everybody else trying to get outside the tradition does For better or worse Im no longer much concerned about whether its better or worse I joined up with an alternative tradition one with which I felt almost eerily comfortable My churchfilled childhood delighted in discovering a Christianity distant enough  in fact for all practical purposes dead enough  to satisfy nostalgia without stirring embarrassment and annoyance as modern Christianity does For instance when one reads about ensoulment in a medieval book  that is when one reads arguments on precisely when the soul enters the fetus and the argument comes from someone of the 13th century  one can read with interest but when one hears a living Christian hotly debating ensoulment hoping to be able to support abortion without feelings of guilt one shrinks away tries to get lost in the crowd I found in medieval culture and art in other words exactly what I needed as an instrument for looking at my own time and place I of course never became for a moment a medieval Christian believer but medieval ideas and attitudes gave me a means of triangulating a place to stand And needless to say medieval literature had built into it everything Id liked best from the beginning back in the days of God Dickens and Disney of grotesques cartoon people and places noble feeling humor God was perhaps a little short on humor and real storytelling I said earlier that Im no longer much concerned about whether the work Ive done and am doing is for better or worse That is not quite as true as I might wish Egoistic ambition is the kind of weed that grows out of dragons blood The more you chop it away the more it flourishes But its true that at a certain point in ones career one begins to face up to ones limitations and the way to stay sane at such a moment is to soften ones standards a little  find good reasons for approving lumpy but wellintentioned work ones own and everybody elses TO put all this another way when I think back now over the influences which have helped to shape the way I write I notice with a touch of dismay that they were as much bad influences as good ones I wont criticize God anyway Hes almost certainly been misquoted but clearly the influence of Dickens and Disney was not all to the good Both of them incline one toward stylized gestures Instead of looking very closely at the world and writing it down the way James Joyce does brilliantly getting down say the way an old man moves his tongue over his gums or the way a beautiful woman idly plays with her bracelets a writer like me seduced by cartoon vision tends to go again and again for the same gestural gimmicks a consistent pattern of caricature compare the way doors in Dostoyevsky are forever flying open or slamming I look over my fiction of 20 years and see it as one long frenzy of tics  endlessly repeated words like merely and grotesque a disproportionate number of people with wooden fingers and a dreary penchant for frowning thoughtfully or darting their eyes around like maniacs I seem incapable of writing a story in which people do not babble philosophically not really because theyre saying things I want to get said but because earnest babbling is one of the ways I habitually give vitality to my shortlegged overweight twitching cartoon creations And needless to say from artists like Dickens and Disney I get my morbid habit of trying to make the reader fall into tender weeping The whole New Critical period I went through and the scholarly period that followed it betrayed me I think into an excessive concern with significance Its probably the case that novels and stories are more interesting if in some sense or another they mean something But it has begun to dawn on me that  in fiction as in all the arts  a little meaning goes a long way I think what chiefly made me notice this is the work of my creative writing students Until about five years ago I never taught creating writing only medieval literature and now and then a little Greek When I began to look hard and often at student writing I soon discovered that one of the main mistakes in their writing is that students think probably because theyve taken too many English literature courses that fiction is supposed to tell us things  instruct us improve us show us In a sense of course theyre right but only in a subtle and mysterious sense When one has analyzed every symbolically neat detail in a story like Death in Venice or Disorder and Early Sorrow  when one has accounted for every verbal repetition every pattern and relationship and set down in alphabetical order every thought to be lifted or wrenched from the story  one discovers that when you come right down to it Mann has told us nothing we didnt know already More by my writing students early bad examples they later get better than by all the good literary examples I ever read Ive come to see that fiction simply dramatizes It gives importance to ideas it seems to me pretty much in the way the string on which a handful of pearls have been strung gives a kind of importance to the pearls When I read my earliest most ingeniously constructed fictions The Resurrection and Grendel I find I can no longer figure the damn things out  would that Id kept all my charts Insofar as such books are interesting for me at least theyre interesting because I like the characters and hope as I reread that life the rest of the book wont treat them too badly I dont mean of course that I intend never again to use symbols or to design my stories so that the reader has the kind of experience William James described with such delight There goes the same thing I saw before again What I do mean is that when I was 3 or 4 or 12 or 13 I understood fiction more profoundly than I understood it through most of my writing years I understood that a story like a painting or like a symphony is one of the most wonderful one of the most useless things in the world The magnificence of a work of art lies precisely in the fact that nobody made the artist make it he just did and  except when ones in school  nobody makes the receiver read it or look at it or listen to it he just does The influence of my writing students has been to lead me to understand or imagine I understand that arts value is not that it expresses lifes meaning though presumably it does as do butterflies and crickets but that it is simply splendidly there I THINK of the performances my mother and father would sometimes do at for instance the monthly meetings of the Grange The way the night would go is this First everybody would crowd into one immense room with trestletables and whitepaper tablecloths the tables all loaded down with food all the redfaced farmers and their plump wives and children finding folding chairs near friends and somebody would tap a water glass with the side of his spoon and would say a quick selfconscious prayer and then everybody would eat It was a wonderfully pleasant social time lots of jokes and stories and abundant country food but it wasnt a time they chose solely for its pleasantness If you wanted to get farmers to come from all over the county late at night after chores you had to feed them Then theyd all go into another room and have their business meeting how much or how little they should organize how to keep the feedmills the truckers and the United States Congress in line Nobody much cared for the business meeting though sometimes somebody would get off a good one as they used to say Then when the work was done my mother and father would stand there in the middle of the big bright room and say poems or sing How strange it seemed to me that all these serious hardworking people should sit there grinning for an hour or more listening for instance to my father telling them an endless pointless story of a ghost in armor or a ship rescued by pigeons or somebody called Dangerous Dan McGrew It was absurd I wasnt just imagining it The whole thing was deeply weirdly absurd Clearly if one is to devote a lifetime to doing something as crazy as that one had better do it well  not necessarily because there is any great virtue in doing it well but only because if one does it badly people may wake up and notice that what ones doing is crazy
THE NATION; Birth-Control Rule Challenged,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/30/weekinreview/the-nation-birth-control-rule-challenged.html,Whether its Secretarydesignate was ready or not the Health and Human Services Departments disputed rule on contraceptives for teenagers got into the Federal Register and into Federal court  last week The rule is due to take effect Feb 25 unless blocked by the courts It requires that parents be told when children under 18 receive prescription birth control products from federally subsidized clinics A spokesman said that Margaret M Heckler nominated to succeed Richard S Schweiker as Secretary has not been involved in any review of the regulation Last year when still a member of the House she signed two letters opposing it Since then what objectors dubbed the squeal rule has become one of the departments more controversial initiatives When Mr Schweiker proposed it last Feb 22 he said it would encourage family participation in the provision of contraceptive services Some 5000 clinics that provide birthcontrol pills intrauterine devices and diaphragms would have to notify parents within 10 working days keep records of all notifications and make those records available to the Government on request Opponents say the rule would not improve family relations and in the words of Faith Johnson a United Church of Christ official would likely result in more unintended adolescent pregnancies births and abortions One of the first suits to hit the courts was filed by New York Attorney General Robert Abrams in Federal District CourtJudge Henry Werker set a hearing for Thursday and ordered Mr Schweiker to answer the charge that the rule was unconstitutional The American Civil Liberties Union and the Planned Parenthood Federation are among other plaintiffs in various suits
DIOXIN'S EFFECT IN ITALY LESS SEVERE THAN HAD BEEN FEARED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/01/31/us/dioxin-s-effect-in-italy-less-severe-than-had-been-feared.html,On a clear July day seven summers ago a quiet Saturday in the Lombardy region of northern Italy just an hours drive from the Alps a soft explosion at a small chemical plant at Seveso sent a column of smoke and particles of debris mushrooming into the afternoon sky The cloud trailed south over the town and nearby villages before slowly dissipating against the horizon Children reported playing in the snowlike crystals that filtered down from the sky Within weeks Seveso was known to scientists around the world as the poisoned city and some compared its inhabitants to the victims of Hiroshima and Nagasaki fatally exposed to a frightening manmade element A byproduct of the production of fertilizers at the chemical plant was dioxin one of the most toxic substances known to science so powerful it was reported that a few drops in a water reservoir could kill all the inhabitants of a large metropolis It is the same substance that contaminates at least 15 sites and perhaps as many as 100 in Missouri Children Developed Rash It was said here that at least 22 pounds and perhaps as much as 132 pounds of dioxin had escaped in the explosions cloud Children who had frolicked in the poison crystals developed an ugly red rash chloracne Pregnant women were counseled to have abortions The center of town was evacuated Seveso it was said was a valley of death and would become a desert None of the worst predictions have come true The city with its narrow crooked streets and earthcolored buildings about 10 miles north of Milan looks no worse for wear than other aging northern Italian communities that have made uneasy accommodations with industry Nearly everyone agrees that the original estimates of how much dioxin escaped into the environment was exaggerated HoffmannLaRoche the Swiss company that operated the plant places the figure at less than onehalf pound Others believe it was higher but nowhere near the amount perhaps more than 50 pounds that was part of waste oil sprayed to contain dust at the Missouri sites a decade ago No new cases of chloracne have been recorded here since 1979 according to a group of scientists who continue to monitor the aftereffects of the explosion on the region encompassing 220000 residents Little Evidence Found This study has produced evidence that there was a slightly elevated incidence in birth defects in the two years after the explosion but Italy lacks reliable data on birth defects and scientists are not sure that a similar investigation of new births in any other urbanindustrial population in northern Italy would not produce the same deviation Lancet the respected medical science publication last fall reported that with the exception of chloracne there was no evidence of substantial dioxin poisoning at Seveso And the publication also reported the established cases of chloracne were relatively mild ones suggesting at most a low level of dioxin poisoning instead of a catastrophic one It said that only a few patches of ground close to the explosion site ever registered dioxin levels approaching those at the contaminated sites in Missouri All these findings have reduced but not eliminated the sense of doom in Seveso The shadow of the 1976 cloud still lingers in the minds of scientists and townsfolk I trust in God the worst is over and we can go on with our lives and not worry anymore said Vittorio Chiapinni a factory worker who lives inside the monitored danger zone We are tired of doctors and technicians invading our homes and inspecting us like laboratory animals What will happen has happened Still Unanswered Questions The future however holds the biggest unanswered questions In terms of chronic disease like cancer or cirrhosis of the liver we still dont know if something important has happened at Seveso said Dr Ericcaldo Stringini of the Istituto Tumori in Genoa We will have to wait another 10 or 20 years A report at the end of this year is expected to show that the region has not suffered a significant increase in leukemia a type of cancer that is expected to appear within three to four years after exposure to dangerous levels of dioxin Other cancers however have much longer periods of latency While work continues on removing topsoil from Zone A the area extending southward from the chemical plant that is considered the most contaminated and burying it in impermeable containers elsewhere there are allegations that the zones were fixed more by guesswork and political pressure than by the more reliable indicators of reported cases of chloracne and animal deaths There is also concern that the authorities do not know how much dioxin has been concentrating in fields where produce is now being grown for Italian markets and how much of the substance has collected in waterways Only One Autopsy While such fears are discounted by the Government an incident that took place in 1980 shows that the dread of dioxin reaching out from the earth to kill suddenly is never far away from the minds of the people A local farmer discovered one morning that his flock of 200 sheep died after grazing in a field that had been barred to livestock since the contamination A chill went through the population especially the 800 people who had been permitted in 1977 to return to homes in the contamination area after being evacuated for a year But it was proven to nearly everyones satisfaction that the flock died from eating a grass high in water content that is known to be fatal to sheep and no unusual traces of dioxin were found by autopsies according to Franco Nelo a biologist But there is no clear understanding of how much dioxin may be collecting in the tissues of the living residents Only one autopsy has been performed on a human being exposed to the fallout from the explosion an elderly woman who had already been suffering from cancer of the pancreas The autopsy found significant levels of dioxin in her organ tissues according to Mr Nelo But he said the existing cancerous condition of the woman may have increased the accumulation of the toxic material in her body Local religious traditions and customs have made it difficult to get permission to perform autopsies on others he added It is just one of many mysteries of Seveso he said Only time will solve them
ROE V. WADE: 'GOOD INTENSIONS RUN AMOK',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/01/opinion/l-roe-v-wade-good-intensions-run-amok-201111.html,To the Editor The recent hoopla over the 10th anniversary of the infamous abortion decision Roe v Wade has raised enough rhetorical and ideological dust to all but obscure some of the more important  and most divisive issues raised in that case To refer to Justice Blackmuns opinion as not only fair but judicious courageous and brilliantly American Abortion at 10 editorial Jan 23 only contributes to the public confusion over the constitutional issues First things first To speak of the constitutional right secured by the Roe decision is to deny a fundamental constitutional fact The allegedly constitutional right expounded in Roe is not in any meaningful sense a constitutional right at all The decision in Roe allowing abortion could only be found in the 14th Amendment once Justice Douglas had planted the right to privacy there In Griswold v Connecticut interestingly enough a birthcontrol case Justice Douglas searched the cracks and crevices of the Constitution to find a right to privacy growing out of the penumbras and emanations of the specific guarantees of the Bill of Rights Douglas never one to pull his juridical punches confessed that the right he had pulled out of his judicial hat was indeed a right older than the Bill of Rights But as no less a constitutional authority than Thomas Jefferson knew to speak of rights that antedated the Constitution but were not explicitly confirmed in that Constitution was not to speak of constitutional rights To Justice Black Douglass opinion in Griswold was the result  could only be the result  of an unhealthy judicial reliance on a mysterious and uncertain natural law concept Strictly speaking then the right to abortion like its jurisprudential forebear the right to privacy is an example of judicial whim becoming constitutional obligation This is hardly the stuff of limited popular government The second point lost in the recent celebration of Roe v Wade is that abortion is a tough moral problem Decent people are to be found on both sides of the issue While one may hold an opinion as to whether abortion is right or wrong one cannot know with any degree of certainty that that opinion is true Given the divisiveness that such questions inevitably generate in a popular scheme of government it is best to leave such questions to political deliberation And in our Federal scheme of popular government that means to leave it to state choice or to Congressional judgment For when push comes to shove federalism has a constitutional status the socalled right to privacy cannot begin to equal The essence of good government our founders thought would come from the free exchange of ideas Since we are incapable of knowing what justice is republican government offers an acceptable alternative institutional deliberation and popular consensus As long as all sides to the issue have a chance to be heard that is all that is required In a system of government based on majority rule there will always be as the late constitutional scholar Alexander Bickel reminded us a losing minority To attempt to solve a tough moral and political problem by judicial decree is to preempt the essential processes of popular government The issue of abortion is more a social and political one than a constitutional one Roe v Wade is a clear example of good intentions run amok As an effort to settle the public debate the Court stumbled into what Justice Frankfurter once called the political thicket The Court did this once before on an equal scale with much the same result Roe v Wade has done for the moral problem of abortion what Dred Scott v Sandford did for the moral problem of slavery And in both instances what was sacrificed was the Constitution GARY L MCDOWELL Carlisle Pa Jan 24 1983 The writer assistant professor of political science at Dickinson College is codirector of Dickinsons Center for the Study of the Constitution

"MADRID FACING FIGHT FROM RIGHT ON ABORTION ,",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/world/madrid-facing-fight-from-right-on-abortion.html,The new Socialist Government is facing its first major battle with the rightwing opposition over the legalization of abortion in Spain The prospective change in the penal code would be limited compared with the laws in force in many other European countries It would permit abortions only in cases of rape a malformed fetus or when the life or health of the woman was in danger while retaining severe penalties for abortions performed for other reasons Nonetheless a recent announcement that the Government of Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez was going to fulfill a campaign pledge and push ahead with the measure has caused an uproar among conservatives in this predominantly Roman Catholic country The Popular Alliance the opposition party of the right in Parliament has said it will fight the proposed legislation However the Socialists with 202 of the 350 seats in the lower house command enough deputies to gain passage On Wednesday the Cabinet approved the text of the new code which will now go before Parliament and is expected to become law by June To make it more acceptable the Government also approved measures to increase the availability of information on family planning birth control and steps to take to insure the health of the fetus Strong antiabortion legislation was one of the hallmarks of the dictatorship of Generalissimo Francisco Franco whose moral absolutism on this and other issues insured church support for his rule The penal code provides for a variety of prison sentences ranging from six months to six years for a woman who willingly undergoes an abortion to between six years and 20 years for a doctor who performs one The law is enforced Two weeks ago magistrates in Barcelona imposed a 37year sentence on an elderly intern found guilty on seven counts of performing abortions and another sentence of 29 years on a second intern The arguments on abortion are similar to those raised in other countries Many antiabortion groups equate abortion with murder and find support in a forceful antiabortion sermon delivered by Pope John Paul II to a crowd of more than a million people in central Madrid on Nov 2 Every conjugal act must remain open to the transmission of life the Pope said Nothing can legitimize the death of an innocent Feminist groups and those who favor legalizing abortion argue that every family has the right to determine the number of children it wants They point out that family planning programs lag in Spain and that contraceptives while available from some private doctors are rarely prescribed under public health payments so that birth control is not accessible to many women Figures on the number of illegal abortions performed annually in Spain are debatable and debated One study estimated that 300000 abortions were performed 10 years ago Those who favor legalizing abortion contend that about an equal number of abortions were performed last year What is not debated is the number of women who travel abroad for abortions mostly to England where 18000 to 20000 went in 1980 A pledge to legalize abortion under certain circumstances was in the program of the Socialists who won a landslide victory in the October general elections But the issue remained in the background until two weeks ago when the new Health Minister Ernest Lluch Martin told a Catalan newspaper that the Government was planning a draft to make abortion available under the public health system Although the church is expected to take a forceful position against abortion in public sources within the Socialist leadership said they believed that the campaign would be mainly pastoral and would not constitute an allout political offensive against the Socialists One Cabinet minister said the Government was forced to seek a liberalization Its impossible for a Socialist Government to preside over such a set of antiabortion laws he said

ARTICLE ON ABORTION DRAWS READERS' REPLIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/nyregion/l-article-on-abortion-draws-readers-replies-203088.html,The article distorts the real issue To state that no one argues much any more over whether an innocent human life is destroyed in an abortion ignores the fact that no one today can claim on a scientific basis that at conception or at any particular point in time an individual human person comes into existence All scientists agree that there is a continuum A living cell a sperm and a living egg join and through cell division a fetus gradually develops The decision as to when a person comes into existence is a philosophical and religious question not a scientific one Because it is a religious question about which there is vigorous disagreement for the government to impose one theological viewpoint that claims personhood for a fertilized egg would be a clear violation of the Constitution depriving those who do not share this theological view of their rights under the Constitution Throughout New Jersey more and more religious groups and individuals are coming to recognize that their freedom is under attack by the socalled right to life movement and through the Religious Coalition for Abortion Rights and other groups they are quietly rallying to support religious freedom Protestants Jews and even many Catholics who refuse to agree with the present stand of the hierarchy are united in this movement None of us in the coalition would attempt to force Mrs Dermody or any of her allies to violate their conscience and have an abortion Why cant they have the same respect for the majority of New Jerseyans who hold to a different belief THE REV FSANFORD CUTLER Chair New Jersey Religious Coalition For Abortion Rights Morristown
PROTECTING THE ADVERTISER: A DILUTION OF THE FIRST AMENDMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/06/nyregion/protecting-the-advertiser-a-dilution-of-the-first-amendment.html,THE United States Supreme Court is likely to rule in favor of a New Jersey drug companys freespeech case against a Postal Service regulation that prohibits the unsolicited mailing of advertisements for contraceptives Mores the pity if it does Based on similar cases in recent years there is good reason to believe that the Court will continue to emasculate the First Amendment by extending constitutional protection to commercial advertising when it decides Bolger v Youngs Drug Products The company is based in Piscataway and has a plant in Trenton The Postal Service is challenging the decision of a Federal District Court that held that the regulation was consitutionally impermissible because it was more extensive than necessary to serve governmental interest in protecting the privacy of individuals in their homes The Court went on to say that whether the First Amendment protects commercial speech depends upon the nature both of the expression and the governmental interest served by its regulation According to Robert D Joffe a New York City lawyer who represents a number of health and familyplanning groups that have filed a joint brief in support of Youngss position the case is a classic one of free speech and peoples right to obtain information versus the Governments right to regulate the information that people receive  The case may well be important but not for these reasons only Hollow rights have long been advocated on behalf of citizens to justify governmental controls on speech That in a nutshell is what is more bothersome than either the Youngs right to free speech or a persons right to privacy While the Youngs position may be supportable I would rather see the final legal word based on the oldfashioned natural right that any speaker possesses instead of this disturbing preferred speech concept Shifting the right from the speaker to the listener  the righttoknow concept implies little more than a governmental right to restrict For many years the prevailing legal doctrine was that advertising had no First Amendment protection although such private activity was entitled of course to due process If a particular expression of fact or opinion were labeled commercial speech it could by definition be suppressed by law This meant that advertisers were subject to governmental supervision without the protection or guarantees that the Constitution afforded most other kinds of speech The freespeech clause of the First Amendment was never intended to protect commercial messages because as a rule they do not affect the political process contribute to the exchange of ideas or enhance individual selfexpression That all began to change in the 1970s when the Supreme Court enunciated a series of decisions establishing varying degrees of First Amendment protection for commercial speech For nearly 30 years beginning with Valentine v Chrestensen 1942 the Court had based its decisions on a hierarchy of expression a preference for political rather than commercial speech In New York Times v Sullivan 1964 the Court went to great length to explain that the libelous matter in question was contained in an idea advertisement not one purely for a commercial product or service But the chink in the armor was apparent nonetheless In 1973 the Court again denied First Amendment protection to commercial speech but mainly because the Help Wanted advertisements in The Pittsburgh Press were unlawful in that they discriminated by sex The newspaper argued that the ruling would restrict its editorial judgment and thus violate the First Amendment  Chief Justice Warren Burgers dissent was prophetic It launches the Court on  a treacherous path of defining what layout and organizational decision of newspapers are sufficiently associated with the commercial parts of the papers as to be constitutionally unprotected and therefore subject to governmental regulation Two years later in Bigelow v Virginia the Supreme Court ruled that newspaper readers had the First Amendment right to receive advertised abortion information In the Courts majority opinion Justice Blackmun said The advertisement published in appellants newspaper did more than simply propose a commercial transaction It contained factual material of clear public interest  This differed from The Pittsburgh Press case because the activity was legal A devastating blow to the old commercial speech doctrine was dealt by Virginia Board of Pharmacy v Virginia Citizens Consumer Council 1976 in which the Supreme Court overturned Virginias state laws against advertising the prices of drugs Emphasized once again was the First Amendment right to receive information But the Court also said that governments still had the right to control advertising that is for example false and misleading or purely commercial Especially revealing is the dictum that  the greater objectivity and hardiness of commercial speech may make it less necessary to tolerate inaccurate statements for fear of silencing the speaker Meanwhile the Supreme Court continued to expand First Amendment protection of commercial speech in a series of cases but not without some qualification A For Sale sign on a home warrants protection as does the advertising or display of contraceptives and the advertising of legal services and fees Justice Rehnquist who dissented in Bates v State Bar of Arizona 1977 stated I continue to believe that the First Amendment speech provision long regarded by this Court as a sanctuary for expressions of public importance or intellectual interest is demeaned by invocation to protect advertisements of goods and services A number of conclusions are apparent and will no doubt affect the Courts ruling in Bolger v Youngs When commercial speech is lawful and truthful restriction is permissible if the Governments interest is deemed substantial Also such regulation must directly advance governmental interest and should not be overly broad in fulfilling that interest Where issueoriented advertisements are involved the Court has developed a balancing test restriction versus interest The latter noncommercial speech rule is akin to the protection guaranteed most other Constitutional rights If the advertising of goods and services were treated as a form of speech beyond Constitutional protection but not without legal due process the right to speak would at least retain some of its original vitality Regulation by time place and manner of speech is reasonable so long as freedom is accorded the speaker first and foremost However recent Supreme Court decisions clearly indicate that the rights of listener are more important the usual justification for restrictions on speakers Yet even the listeners are restricted by a third party such as a Government regulatory agency which decides what listeners need to insure an informed citizenry After all the right to hear is derivative of the right to speak and free speech is precisely the right to speak
Spanish Bishops Fight Abortion Law Changes,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/07/world/spanish-bishops-fight-abortion-law-changes.html,The church has declared its opposition to easing Spains strict antiabortion laws setting the stage for a showdown with the Socialist Government Spanish bishops in a strongly worded document issued Saturday night said abortion under any circumstances was murder and called proposed legislation to legalize abortion gravely unjust and totally unacceptable In the document issued by the Episcopal Conference the bishops vowed to oppose moral degradation and urged believers in this predominantly Roman Catholic country to express disagreement and refuse to cooperate in the practice of abortion The proposed law would allow abortion in cases of rape malformation of the fetus or where the mothers life was in danger The Socialist Government is relying on its parliamentary majority to push through changes mild by West European standards in Francoera abortion laws that provide for long prison terms The new law would require two specialists approval for abortion in cases of malformation of a fetus or danger to the mothers life

CHINA'S POLICY ON SIZE OF FAMILIES IS EXTENDED TO INCLUDE MINORITIES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/10/world/china-s-policy-on-size-of-families-is-extended-to-include-minorities.html,China has begun closing a conspicuous loophole in its nationwide birthcontrol program by restricting the number of children that some of its minorities may have On the island of Hainan in the South China Sea the native Li and Miao minorities have been limited to four children per family since last July This number has been further reduced since October to two or three children per family in an informal measure that is being drafted into legislation in Guangdong Province which governs Hainan Wang Yuefeng director of the LiMiao Autonomous Prefecture which covers more than half of Hainan said A similar policy is being applied to the minorities as to the Han majority The only difference is a greater number of children The prefecture includes 750000 Li and 30000 Miao in its total population of nearly 19 million Until recently Chinas 55 minorities had been exempted from its stringent family planning rules which restrict Chinese couples to a single child or in some rural areas to two children Rapid Growth of Minorities The result is that the minorities have been growing much faster than the Han majority though they still account for less than 7 percent of Chinas population of more than 1 billion people The national census taken last July disclosed that the minorities had increased by 684 percent since the previous census in 1964 while the Han majority grew by only 438 percent With nearly a quarter of the worlds population and only 7 percent of its arable land China has instituted radical measures aimed at reducing its population growth to only 95 percent annually in the rest of this century The Government has exempted the minority nationalities to avoid the kind of ethnic frictions that developed during the Cultural Revolution when those in power suppressed the traditions and dress of the minorities in an effort to assimilate them within the Han majority The loyalty of the minorities is far more important to Peking than their size would suggest because many of them inhabit strategically sensitive border regions like Xinjiang Inner Mongolia Tibet and Yunnan Yet their freedom from birth control has annoyed Han Chinese who want more than one child too Last December Bo Yibo a state councilor declared that the birth control exemptions granted to Chinas minorities did not necessarily mean ignoring practical conditions His remark suggested that Peking was reviewing its position on exempting the minorities Mobile Birth Control Units Chinas population growth has been estimated at 135 percent last year But in Hainans mountain town of Tongza Mr Wang disclosed that his prefectures population grew by 19 percent The population of the Li grew by 36 percent and the Miao by 41 percent Mr Wang said that preparations were being made to send 13 mobile birth control units into the countryside to distribute intrauterine devices and birth control pills to insure a better success rate Our principle here is that if a couple have children up to the limit we encourage them to undergo sterilization Mr Wang said He said that abortions a standard means of holding down births on the mainland were not common in his prefecture There have been unconfirmed reports that the Government is encouraging family planning among other larger minorities such as the Dai in Yunnan and the Zhuang in Guangxi but the subject remains sensitive Mr Wang whose political loyalty as the highestranking ethnic Li official has earned him an alternate seat on the Communist Partys Central Committee rejected suggestions that the impetus for the new birthcontrol policy had come from Peking or Canton Family planning is not an idea of the Han people to be applied to the minority peoples Mr Wang told a group of visiting foreign correspondents It is an outcome of an idea among the minorities themselves Its fully democratic and the will of the people who ask for family planning Wont Hamper Unity This application of family planning wont hamper the unity of the minorities because they got the idea among themselves at the grassroots level Mr Wang said He did not say how the idea could have arisen spontaneously in a rugged region where the inhabitants are dispersed in isolated villages and nearly a third are illiterate In one such Li village Huang Qingxiang the leader of the Maoli production team understood that we are allowed to have four children but no more than four Mr Huang a slender young man who leads the other villagers in tending the surrounding rubber trees and rice paddies said that any family that had a fifth child now would be penalized It must pay 220 pounds of unhusked rice and 50 yuan  nearly 26  every year until the extra child is 14 years old The villages per capita income last year was 180 yuan  about 93 Eighteen of his villages two dozen families already had more than four children Mr Huang said but they were born before the new regulations were announced so no one was fined

THE SQUEAL RULE',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/opinion/the-squeal-rule.html,I didnt plan to fix the day so indelibly in my mind but I can pinpoint exactly the first time I went to the doctor to see about birth control It was my 17th birthday a milestone that entitled me to that most important of suburban rites of passage a driving permit Spurred perhaps by that one small step into adulthood to venture another I took a drive with my boyfriend to the Planned Parenthood office in a neighboring town my novice driving skills made even shakier by the nature of our trip My recollection of that day now more than seven years ago is prompted by a new regulation of the Department of Health and Human Services due to take effect later this month Under that regulation the socalled squeal rule any federally subsidized clinic that dispenses prescription birth control to a patient under 18 will also have to send a registered letter to her parents informing them of that fact The supposed rationale of the rule is to encourage family communication about sex and birth control and to protect the health and safety of minor adolescents according to the departing Secretary Richard S Schweiker If the squeal rule had been in effect when I was 17 I never would have driven to the clinic It wouldnt have stopped me from having sex I was already doing that stupidly unprotected in the blind belief that it couldnt happen to me The rule simply would have prevented me from receiving a reliable method of contraception Why couldnt I just tell my parents that I loved my boyfriend thought I was old enough to have sex and wanted to take the responsiblity that accompanies it It wasnt that my parents had unshakeable religious or moral convictions opposed to premarital sex or to birth control It wasnt that they were unable even to discuss the issue My mother had explained all the technical details long before It wasnt that my father was going to beat me or lock me in my room or forbid me to see my boyfriend But I knew my parents would disapprove I knew that their disapproval wasnt going to make me stop no matter how much family communication we had And I didnt see any reason to throw my actions in their faces to create the discord that would have followed such a revelation There was also the matter of my privacy I didnt want my sex life to become a matter of dinner table debate Perhaps in the best of all possible worlds we would have talked about it Family communication is the sort of thing like apple pie that no one is against But it is a rare adolescent who lives in an ideal world at least where parents are concerned I didnt I wasnt going to tell my parents no matter whether that decision was wise or not And I wasnt going to have that decision forced on me by some Government regulation Neither are the the teenagers who will be subject to the squeal rule There I was supposedly smart  at the top of my high school class on my way to a prestigious Ivy League college perfectly aware of the importance of contraception  still having sex without any protection What of teenagers with less knowledge of birth control or a more abiding trust that beginners luck will protect them from pregnancy If my mother had found my diaphragm the worst consequence that would have ensued would probably have been a nasty fight What of teenagers with more to risk than mere disapproval if a clinic had to notify their parents The squeal rule is going to backfire It is going to promote pregnancy not family communication Instead of encouraging teenagers to use birth control the rule will force them to turn away from clinics and to use less reliable methods or none at all Supporters of the squeal rule may like to comfort themselves with the belief that teenagers denied access to reliable birth control will do the rational thing and simply abstain But sex is not a subject that provokes the most rational decisions at any age and the facts suggest that expecting abstention would be sheer fanatasy A 1981 study of 1200 teenagers visiting familyplanning clinics found that 86 percent were already sexually active the average time before coming in for birth control was one year Teenagers affected by the rule are not going to stop having sex because of it And some of them  too many of them are going to get pregnant There were more than one million teenage pregnancies last year more than 450000 of those teenagers had abortions Those numbers are a tragedy that the Government should be doing something to prevent Instead it has issued the squeal rule which will push the numbers even higher And contributing to the problem rather than working to solve it is the greatest tragedy of all  The writer requested anonymity

WHEN THE POPULAR WILL CHOOSE TO OPPRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/opinion/l-when-the-popular-will-choose-to-oppress-225814.html,To the Editor Prof Gary L McDowells Feb 1 letter attacking the basis of the Supreme Courts landmark abortion ruling in Roe v Wade seriously misrepresents what Justice Douglas said in his Griswold opinion and calls for nothing less than a total abdication of judicial responsibility when divisive issues are raised Far from searching the cracks and crevices of the Constitution Justice Douglas simply argued that certain rights in the Bill of Rights very clearly imply the existence of other rights In particular he pointed out that there seems little reason for the Fourth Amendments prohibition of unreasonable searches and seizures if it is not to protect privacy McDowell clearly does not care for Justice Douglass style and his use of the term penumbra or emanation One might agree that the Justices choice of words was unfortunate But no one should allow himself to be distracted from the real substance of what is said by the manner in which it is said What I find even more disturbing than McDowells disingenuous reading of Douglas is his view of the proper role of the Court He suggests we ought to leave divisive issues to political deliberation that such questions are not the proper concern of the Supreme Court One wonders of course what would be the present legal status of black Americans had the Supreme Court of the 1950s left the divisive issue of civil rights to the whims of legislatures Even the most superficial study of American history makes clear that representative government too often has chosen to oppress those who were not in the majority More often than not it has been the Supreme Court that has said no to the will of the people that has protected those rights the Constitution seeks to shield from the vicissitudes of popular will In short it is precisely when the political system confronts divisive issues that the Supreme Court has made its most important contribution to democracy To disqualify the Court from so acting is to surrender to the basest desires of the political process RICHARD J DEL GUIDICE Potsdam NY Feb 2 1983 The writer heads the Department of Political Science at the State University College of Arts and Science in Potsdam
THE SENATE; A MOVEMENT TO DO SOMETHING ABOUT FILIBUSTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/11/us/the-senate-a-movement-to-do-something-about-filibusters.html,The rules of the Senate were not chiseled in stone on Mount Sinai It just sometimes seems that way Accordingly it is a matter of some note on Capitol Hill when the Senate contemplates a change in its traditional methods of operation And right now a panel of lawmakers is examining ways to limit the use of the filibuster and accelerate the pace of legislation through what is often called the worlds greatest deliberative body Indeed senators worry that their procedures are so deliberate that they approach paralysis Were really concerned said an aide to the Senate leadership that the rules have gotten to the point where theyre somewhat cumbersome What we need to do is preserve the traditions of the Senate but not leave the Senate as an archaic institution as it sometimes appears to be The panel charged with examining the rules is headed by Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr Republican of Maryland who hopes to have a recommendation ready by midMarch The first item on the agenda is a phenomenon called the postcloture filibuster an esoteric procedure that can have a profound effect on the laws that eventually emanate from the Capitol Principle of Unlimited Debate Current Senate rules embody the principle of unlimited debate That means that any senator can try to kill any piece of legislation by seizing the floor and talking indefinitely in other words by staging a filibuster The filibuster can be shut off only if 60 members of the Senate vote to do so a procedure known as cloture The filibuster has been hotly debated many times Historically a twothirds vote was required to conclude debate The 60vote or threefifths rule was instituted in the 1960s to strengthen the hand of the majority But whatever vote was needed to adopt cloture Senator Daniel K Inouye Democrat of Hawaii noted the general understanding throughout Senate history was that once it passed the lawmakers would proceed rapidly to a final vote on the merits of the bill That unwritten rule changed in 1969 when Senator James B Allen Democrat of Alabama came to Washington and virtually invented the postcloture filibuster An expert in parliamentary procedure Senator Allen who has since died discovered that by various delaying tactics he could keep a filibuster going long after cloture had been invoked His pioneering work was embroidered upon by Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio and former Senator James Abourezk Democrat of South Dakota who staged a long postcloture filibuster against a rise in natural gas prices in 1977 Breaking Point Reached The issue came to the fore in the postelection session of Congress last year when a small group of conservative Senators tried to thwart a bill raising the gasoline tax to pay for highway and mass transit improvements The filibuster was eventually defeated after numerous latenight sessions but Senate leaders decided that a breaking point had been reached I think most members of the Senate and a high percentage of the general public perceived that the Senate was unable to cope during the lameduck session said Senator Mathias who is chairman of the Rules Committee If we were to continue as an effective institution something had to be done Under current rules once cloture is voted the Senate can debate a bill for 100 hours one hour per member But the chance to offer amendments is almost endless and procedural matters such as rollcalls do not count against the time limit Some of the proposals under discussion would reduce the total postcloture debate to say 50 hours or severely limit the right to offer amendments once cloture was voted Very Delicate Balancing Act The rules of any legislative body always constitute a very delicate balancing act in the words of Senator Mathias As Senator Russell Long Democrat of Louisiana put it The whole thing is a constant tradeoff of rights the right of the majority versus the rights of the minority And any time you give a benefit to one group you cost the other group When used properly Senator Mathias said the filibuster is a very important right because it forces the Senate to stop and think But he believes that the rise of the postcloture filibuster has tilted the delicate Senate balance in favor of the minority Having stopped and thought he added you have to have the ability to move on and get a decision If you prevent yourself from being able to do that youre crippling the whole process of government Some senators are worried however that the Senate leadership is overreacting to the gasoline tax filibuster The problem with that whole thing is that it occured right before Christmas said one Republican staff member and all their wives were telling them to go home Concern Over Punishment Senator John P East the North Carolina Republican who helped lead the opposition to the gasoline tax worries that the rules might be changed to punish him and his allies I think that if the reason for doing it is parochial or provincial that would be unwise Senator East said Filibusters are staged by various groups of all kinds In fact while the filibuster was originally perfected by Southern conservatives fighting civil rights legislation it has been used recently by hardcore liberals to bury such issues as abortion and school busing And while liberal leaders like Senator Metzenbaum favor changes in the filibuster rule they want assurances that any new procedure protects the rights of the minority to be heard a spokesman for the Senator said Legislation Glut Cited Moreover Senator East asserted the gasoline tax was a good case study of a bill that was pushed through too quickly and that more reflection and deliberation might have been appropriate If the rules are changed to make filibusters more difficult the Senator warned the stop and think function of the minority might be undermined Senator East insists that it is unfair to ascribe the Senates problems to the filibuster rule The real issue he says is that Congress has ventured into many areas where it does not belong and produced a glut of legislation that cannot be swallowed What makes matters worse much of the legislation is crammed into the final weeks of a Congressional session and is not spread evenly over the year You kind of squeeze out deliberation said the North Carolina Republican It boils down to pressure and shoving and pushing It is one thing to talk about changing the postcloture rules quite another to find a workable alternative And given the Senates penchant for obstreperous behavior whatever rules changes are proposed could always be subject to a filibuster

D'AMATO: AT HOME IN THE SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/magazine/d-amato-at-home-in-the-senate.html,Tom Goldstein is a writer specializing in legal and political affairs Day after day night after night the debate over legislation to raise the gasoline tax dragged on Conservatives filibustered against the measure which was intended to create a public works program The Administration also disliked the plan but gradually gave ground as Christmas approached While larger political and economic issues were being played out around him Alfonse M DAmato New Yorks junior Senator was keeping watch over a more parochial issue  the preservation of operating subsidies for public transportation a matter of paramount importance to his constituents This was his issue the issue he had picked after his election two years before as a means to make his mark in the Senate Now the Administration was trying to eliminate the subsidies which helped pay the daytoday costs of mass transit in New York City and keep the fares down DAmato seldom left the Capitol Late one night he pulled off his trousers to preserve the crease put on sweat pants and managed to get 25 minutes sleep on a couch in his office before he was awakened for a vote on the Senate floor During another allnight session aides wheeled in an upright piano they had discovered in the hallway and for nearly an hour the Senator broke the tension by playing three songs  Heart and Soul Its a Sin to Tell a Lie and Blue Moon  over and over again DAmato was signing papers in his office one afternoon when the debate on the floor which he was monitoring on a squawk box unexpectedly turned to mass transit It sounded like trouble and DAmato grabbed an aide and a jacket and dashed down the long hallway to an elevator a balding 45yearold echo of the highschool hurdler he had once been Minutes later breathing hard he rose on the floor to defend mass transit funds I am arguing equity here he said For years my state has been hurt by inequitable formulas I cannot stand idly by and watch this occur again The speech was a turning point An amendment to greatly reduce funding for mass transit was narrowly defeated Largely because of his persistence his horse trading with colleagues his refusal to compromise at a time when others were caught up in the larger drama DAmato emerged victorious He fought like a tiger says Richard Ravitch chairman of New Yorks Metropolitan Transportation Authority He was indispensable The gratitude is understandable Under the measure DAmato attached to the gasoline tax bill the MTA will receive an extra 1 billion in Federal aid over the next four years DAmato did not hesitate to claim credit It demonstrates to some people he said that instead of being an ultraconservative philosophical demagogue I can be conscientious to detail I can build coalitions that can pass important legislation When he bid for the Senate DAmato was presiding supervisor of Hempstead a Long Island town that is actually a collection of small communities He ran a shrill rancorous campaign that left many voters with the image of a brash unpolished kneejerk conservative He seemed to his critics to lack the understanding of world and national issues displayed by his predecessors Robert F Wagner John Foster Dulles Herbert H Lehman and for 24 years Jacob K Javits During the campaign there were published reports questioning his integrity His victory was widely attributed to the split of the moderate and liberal vote between his two opponents and to Ronald Reagans unexpectedly strong race in New York Today after two years in the job many of the concerns about him seem wide of the mark Al DAmato has not turned into a picturebook Senator His grammar remains imperfect his voice high and scratchy Hes never lost the habit of greeting strangers Hi babes But he has by most accounts done a credible job In part that reflects a change in the man in his adaptation to a new world In part it reflects a public misunderstanding of who he is and of the Senate There was a time when the upper house of Congress had some of the elements of an aristocratic club No more The aura of collegiality has faded When Senate staffs were small senators dealt directly with each other but that changed when the staffs grew large Today turnover among senators is high and the newcomers arrive with less experience in government than was once the case Political uncertainty is a particular problem for the 18 Republican senators who were swept into office in the Reagan landslide Like many of them DAmato has been putting some distance between himself and a President whose ratings in the polls have been sliding DAmatos term is up in 1986  a year when there is no Presidential election  and he will have no ones coattails to hang on to At least a dozen Democrats have already expressed interest in challenging him His strategy is to be a tenacious booster for New York State  getting Federal help for subways and senior citizens housing and small businessmen  and by letting people know just how hes doing The 1980 Republican Senate primary was a most strident campaign In one debate Javits told his opponent Youre a young man in such a big hurry to get yourself elected that I dont know what youd stop at DAmato questioned whether Javits one of the last survivors of the progressive Republican tradition in New York would live through another sixyear term After his victory DAmato went on to win the general election defeating Javits who ran on the Liberal Party line and Representative Elizabeth Holtzman the Brooklyn Democrat in another bitter personal campaign DAmato relentlessly attacked her votes in Congress against defense appropriations and in behalf of ineffective social welfare programs On the evening of his victory DAmato was overheard telling supporters that Representative Holtzman had used gutter tactics He referred to his enemies saying We know who they are and were going to get them The tone of the comments fed fears about DAmatos ethics and judgment There already had been rumors and newspaper stories questioning his honesty Finally there were three investigations The Nassau County District Attorneys office explored DAmatos role in the awarding of a cable television contract when he was presiding supervisor The Federal Bureau of Investigation looked into the terms DAmato had received on campaign loans from a bank in which he had deposited taxpayers funds The Organized Crime Strike Force in the Eastern District of New York explored charges that he had been involved in payoffs for construction contracts at the Town of Hempsteads garbage recycling plant In all three investigations the Senator has been exonerated Not a single charge stands up to any scrutiny says DAmatos lawyer Michael F Armstrong former counsel to the Knapp Commission which investigated corruption in New York City a decade ago But damage had been done and DAmato has been trying to build up his reputation ever since The most important appointments a Senator influences are Federal judgeships which are for life Following Senator Daniel P Moynihans example he appointed a judicial screening committee that recommends candidates He has nominated more than a dozen judges and prosecutors and their place in the political spectrum has ranged from conservative to moderate The best is how the Senator describes his picks but the general feeling in the legal community is that while the candidates as a group approach the intellectual and legal quality of those chosen by Javits they are not as distinguished as those nominated by Moynihan Al wants to show he is a class act says Michael Armstrong who is a member of the screening committee To appoint good judges and prosecutors is to show he is not a political hack As expected the Senator has become a champion of some conservative positions DAmato opposed Medicaid payments for abortions for victims of rape and incest He has favored restrictions on the ability of Federal courts to order busing He supports a bill that would bar challenges to voluntary schoolprayer programs DAmato has also generally favored reduced Government spending a balanced budget and deregulation But as his colleagues in the Senate have discovered DAmato is more pragmatic than ideological To build a record DAmato says is to do little things day by day DAmatos voting record in the first third of his term has reflected a greater concern with satisfying his New York constituents than with distinctions of right and left People expected someone fighting on issues like busing instead of mass transportation he says Then he adds There are more important things than busing Senator Alan J Dixon an Illinois Democrat who has served on two committees with DAmato has noticed the change From the campaign Dixon says I got the impression he was an extreme right winger I have found him more moderate After the 1980 election The Rochester TimesUnion editorialized New York has two US Senators with brains beliefs class and clout They are Sen Jacob Javits and Sen Daniel P Moynihan Next year it will have one Fourteen months later the paper suggested that while DAmato needed a sense of history about foreign affairs he seemed genial hardworking and eager to learn There was New York milk along with New York eggs New York potatoes and New York beets and sauerkraut There were ducks from Long Island and wine from upstate Al DAmato was the host as dozens of senators and representatives stopped by the Senate Caucus Room reception to celebrate New York Farm Harvest Day Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina arrived early and sampled egg cookies apples and a blend of New York milk and Kahlua the sweet coffee liqueur Hey said DAmato They got a special cow in New York who does Kahlua in his milk Thurmond seemed impressed I did not realize New York was a farming state he said I never would have known this had not Senator DAmato sponsored this The freshman and the 28year veteran of the Senate bantered and embraced and a photograph was snapped Anything he wants I try to give him said Thurmond Thats right responded DAmato he gives me my judges Thurmond is chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee which must approve nominations for Federal judgeships As the lawmakers drifted back to work they were given a bushel of New York agricultural products Favored legislators like Strom Thurmond also received a jug of cider or a wheel of cheese Al DAmato knows how to cut a political deal a skill he picked up during nearly two decades as a local official and he sees it as essential to the performance of his new job Not enough of us he told a recent Senate committee meeting have been smalltown mayors or supervisors The controversial TennesseeTombigbee Waterway does not seem to be a matter of much consequence to a New York Senator DAmato voted to continue funding the project he says in return for Southern support for a bill he was pushing that would provide funds to clean up a radioactive waste dump at West Valley near Buffalo In addition to his dealmaking abilities DAmato has brought great energy and doggedness to his new job Paula Hawkins Republican of Florida another firstterm Senator who sits behind DAmato in the Senate chamber says Hes terrific Hes a sleeper You should see him on the floor He wont take no Hell take them all on He really cares Hes really sensitive Maybe its because hes Italian One of DAmatos proudest achievements was his winning battle to preserve nearly intact industrial revenue bonds The bonds which are used by many New York communities make taxexempt financing available to small businesses as a way of creating new local jobs Last summer he introduced two amendments on the floor one at 3 oclock in the morning and shepherded them until they were passed DAmato really was one of the one or two key participants says a former staff member of the Small Business Committee on which DAmato serves He was tremendously effective and this is very important to New York In his Washington office where photographs of his wife and their four children share space with a bust of Lincoln and some partially filled bookshelves the theme of helping New York is constantly heard One afternoon his highpitched voice rose even higher and his hand sliced down as though he was practicing a karate chop on the arm of his chair as he ticked off recent accomplishments for New York We saved 37 million for senior citizen housing Then he added If I dont do it who will Theres a new instrument landing system for Chemung Airport And again the refrain If I dont do it who will Therell be a bicycle trailway in Rochester Pause If I dont do it who will Was that refrain an oblique reference to Senator Moynihan Unfair question DAmato replied I wont answer that Publicly the two men speak about each other in platitudes Oh Patrick is an absolutely marvelous engaging person says DAmato And Moynihan says He is a fine colleague We work well together They have a polite but uneasy relationship Their staffs cooperate when necessary Al DAmato was born in Newark in 1937 and when he was 7 years old the family moved to Island Park a closeknit largely Italian community in Nassau County near Kennedy International Airport DAmato still lives there today around the corner from his parents It is the second poorest in Long Island he says People find that incredulous Since his election the Senator has traveled widely  to Lebanon Tokyo Taiwan and Panama as well as to the three Is that are obligatory stops for a New York politician Ireland Israel and Italy But DAmato always returns to his roots in Long Island to the splitlevel shrimppink Cape Cod with the wroughtiron eagle on the front door The fourbedroom house on a small lot shows family wear and tear the Senator apologized to a recent visitor because a part of the door to one of the bathrooms had been scratched away by a family dog now dead 1st JUMP DAmato earns 60662 as a Senator and last year he received an additional 50000 for speaking engagements  an amount that puts him in the top ranks of his senatorial colleagues Adding in his wifes salary as a teacher income from her inheritance and some income from investments he estimates the total at 140000  but he says he still had to borrow money last year to pay his taxes When the Senate is in session he stays in a condominium he recently purchased in Virginia During one of the Senators visits to Island Park he carried out the garbage and chatted with the sanitation men then dropped into his favorite chair in the living room He was somewhat groggy feeling the aftereffects of a whirlwind trip abroad Over the course of the morning several old friends from the neighborhood visited From across the room Michael Masone superintendent of public works for 20 years volunteered that the Senate had not changed DAmato Hes still the same Tippy to us said Masone DAmato blushed at the sound of the nickname and at first refused to tell how he came by it Finally he relented Alfonse he squealed Growing up with that I needed a nickname His relatives found one calling him Tippy after the familys active and excitable pet dog The Senator is the oldest of three children His brother Armand 37 years of age a State Assemblyman lives a few miles away His sister Joanne Ribiero 35 is married to a concert violinist and lives in Florida DAmato attended Syracuse University first as an undergraduate then as a law student working part time as a janitor At Syracuse he met and married Penelope Collenburg and moved back to Island Park after graduation Through a friend of his father he got the clerks job in the town attorneys office and he has not been off a government payroll since In 1977 DAmato became Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead a political entity of 840000 people He held the most heavily weighted vote on the countys Board of Supervisors but he did not have administrative responsibility over the police and fire departments or health services Two years later he recalls he decided to make a bid for the Senate I was fairly certain Javits would be vulnerable to a primary The Republicans felt estranged from him After his victory DAmato found himself an outsider in an insiders city On his first trip to the capital after the election he brought along just one adviser  Thomas A Bolan a founder of the states Conservative Party and an early and influential Reagan supporter but a man DAmato hardly knew The two have since become close Bolan a law partner of Roy M Cohn serves as a middleman between the Senator and Reagan aides Some of these aides now feel that DAmato rode the Presidents coattails to victory in 1980 and has not shown the proper gratitude As chief of his staff of 50 people DAmato chose John R Zagame a friend of Armand DAmato and a former State Assemblyman from Oswego Zagame ran for Congress in 1980 and was defeated in the Republican primary His only previous experience in Washington was as a Congressional page On many levels the Senator has worked hard to adapt to his new job His clothing for example Hes more spruced up says his brother Armand Hes not as Long Islandy The suits come from a factory outlet but they tend to be darker more conservative As a freshman Senator his most important adaptation DAmato says has been what he calls a more balanced viewpoint He explains I am much more willing to listen I dont cling tenaciously to the thought that I know everything The Republican leaders in the Senate feel he has done what they require of a freshman Senator that he has voted with the party on most key issues In the beginning he made some embarrassing mistakes The worst he says was his proposal that Federal housing funds be denied to those cities that refused to phase out rent control The plan died and DAmato reaped nothing but ill will among the thousands of his constituents who live in rentcontrolled housing I opened my big mouth before I understood the facts he says When he headed the Appropriations subcommittee that supervises the District of Columbia DAmato endorsed a candidate to become police chief in the District This breach of etiquette  it was not within the subcommittees purview  particularly irritated the local political establishment because his man who happened to be of Italian extraction was the only white candidate in the field The Senator eventually won praise for his work on the subcommittee from The Washington Post and from local leaders including Mayor Marion S Barry Jr DAmato learned another lesson in the ways of Washington when he prematurely disclosed to the press that President Reagan had agreed to name John L Behan a Vietnam War amputee who lived on Long Island to head the Veterans Administration There had been a struggle over the appointment and the early disclosure so embarrassed the White House that Behan was never given the post The education of Al DAmato who had spent his life as a local politician in a narrow corner of Long Island resembles a cram course He suddenly found himself involved in large complex issues without a full briefing from his predecessor a standard procedure in the Senate According to Javits after the election he offered DAmato the assistance of his staff and access to background papers to provide the newcomer with an education in national issues But the offer was never accepted On the Appropriations Committee DAmato votes on the allocation of funds for programs approved by all other Senate committees On the Banking Housing and Urban Affairs Committee he faces a host of complicated questions What did I know from GlassSteagall or Steuben Glass asks DAmato The Banking Committee has been reviewing the GlassSteagall Act which governs how commercial banks may go about their business Now says DAmato There are few people who know more about it than I do A lobbyist from a major bank however says of the Senator He is not to be confused with gang busters but he is not all that bad He has shown a willingness to learn The leaders of Wall Street have been trying to prevent commercial banks from gaining the right to underwrite securities and as head of the securities subcommittee DAmato has been under pressure from both bankers and brokers Both groups are heavy campaign contributors DAmato expects there will be some legislation this year Ill try to be fair he says Whats going to happen Both sides will be annoyed In the beginning DAmato was an unquestioning supporter of the Reagan Administration at least on economic matters In an admiring OpEd article in The New York Times in March 1981 during the battle over the Presidents first budget the new Senator pleaded Let us not pick the Reagan package to pieces and counseled that unless even some meritorious programs were cut from the budget no significant change in our present economic morass will be possible His first break with the President came over the Administration proposal to sell Saudi Arabia an 85 billion package of military equipment including AWAC radar aircraft DAmato who received only 4 percent of the Jewish vote in 1980 placed himself firmly in Israels corner from the start By early 1982 he was labeling President Reagans proposed 1983 budget an absolute disaster and later in the year he joined 20 other Republicans in voting to override a Presidential veto of a 141 billion supplemental spending bill  despite an 11thhour telephone call from the White House The President told him DAmato says that a defeat on the budget would send the wrong signal to the financial markets about Congresss determination to control Federal spending According to DAmato he told the President that Republicans were starting to lose the support of middleclass people He says he warned Mr President were going to divide this country Since then the Senator has taken pains to separate himself from the President on a variety of issues Dont lock me in with President Reagan DAmato told one audience The Reagan military budget particularly raises his hackles You do yourselves a terrible disservice he says if you say the military is sacrosanct Any jackass who says you cant make cuts in a 250 billion military budget is a jackass Thats where this Senator is coming from The President and the Senator see each other only on formal occasions and DAmatos contacts with the White House staff are limited Given the new budget presented last month by President Reagan their relationship is not apt to improve quickly The President wants to trim 1 billion in funds for mass transit DAmato said they were more drastic than the cuts sought by the Administration in 1982 and that he looked upon them with disdain In general DAmato sees himself as a mainstream Republican The President he says is a little more to the right and Javits is well to the other side That leaves the Senator a long distance from the ultraconservative many New Yorkers thought they were voting for or against in 1980 Today Al DAmato is still finding his way around Washington Rushing from meeting to meeting cheerfully greeting policemen and perfect strangers he occasionally makes a wrong turn and must ask for directions But as he sits in his office there is a certain sense of comfort and confidence DAmato is a man of many moods and they shift like mercury as his staff moves easily in and out of his office many of them without knocking One moment he snaps at a secretary for not removing empty coffee cups fast enough the next moment he may be hugging her One day DAmato complained to Ed Martin his 28yearold press secretary that he disliked the italic typeface used on some press releases I hate this typewriter said the Senator with no trace of humor in his voice I have such a hard time reading this he added No wonder they dont use the releases The typeface remains unchanged On another afternoon the Senators mood was buoyant as he leaned back at his desk and spoke on the telephone with Michael Armstrong The previous day a growth which was found to be nonmalignant had been excised from DAmatos chest The dressing protruded a few inches and earlier this day it had been removed The Senator made a sexual wisecrack as he had several times earlier in the day about the missing bump on his chest He laughed at his remark then looked around the room to make sure the aides and friends gathered there were laughing too The phone conversation ended and then Tanya Metaksa the chief legislative aide walked into the room A quiet efficient woman she had worked for the National Rifle Association before joining DAmatos staff Good news she said Prospects looked promising for a DAmato amendment that would allow Federal funds to flow without interruption to seven new housing projects in New York State Some technical work needed to be done on the amendment and the gathering in DAmatos office broke up Soon the Senator would be on the telephone to three radio stations in Poughkeepsie to announce that rehabilitation could begin on 58 units of Federal housing in that city DAmato spends part of most days on the phone gossiping with local and state political leaders back home Many of the conversations center around Joseph M Margiotta the Nassau Republican leader who had given DAmatos career several key boosts While appealing a conviction on charges of mail fraud and extortion Margiotta still holds his powerful party post DAmato is intensely interested but he wants to stay out of the cross fire over whether his former mentor should resign He prefers the role of mediator For example when Anthony Prudenti Suffolk County party leader and George L Clark Jr state party leader were feuding DAmato invited them to dinner and patched it up The Senator insists he wants no formal role in state party politics and says he is content to let others vie for statewide leadership Potential leaders include Buffalo Congressman Jack F Kemp Lewis E Lehrman who lost a bid to be Governor last fall Warren M Anderson majority leader of the State Senate and State Comptroller Edward V Regan I want to be Senator says DAmato I dont want to be state party chairman He does however want to keep his homestate image polished When Congress is not in session DAmato is traveling around the state During last falls recess when a third of the Senate was running for reelection his schedule was so full it seemed that he too was running In one 26hour period in Buffalo he met with Mayor James Griffin and more than two dozen civic and business leaders  held a press conference about the meeting  took an unscheduled tour of a new housing project for the elderly  kissed women customers during a tour of the Broadway Market where Polish is the first language  spoke at a lunch in his honor at Andys Lounge on Buffalos West Side a predominantly Italian neighborhood  visited the site of another housing project for the elderly  met with executives of The Buffalo News  taped a 30minute television interview  met with local political leaders  responded to questions for 90 minutes at a town hall meeting in Amherst an affluent suburb of Buffalo  returned to Andys Lounge for a fundraiser for the local sheriff  slept for five hours  spoke at a breakfast of local Republicans  appeared on a live local television talk show  taped a radio show At stop after stop his message was the same Im a smalltown boy I understand the needs of neighborhoods and communities Unfortunately people become insulated and isolated in Washington One local official after another praised the Senator for the Federal money he had steered to this decaying industrial city on the shore of Lake Erie At lunch the Senator sat next to Representative John LaFalce a respected young Democrat DAmato does well here LaFalce said He pays attention to Buffalo This is the time it counts when it is not an election year Jack Javits wouldnt do this kind of stuff He was a national legislator There are lots of things I did when Carter was in office I cant do now with the Reagan Administration When I need help for my district I call Al

PUTTING HEALTH CARE BACK 25 YEARS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/nyregion/putting-health-care-back-25-years.html,AS A physician I am deeply concerned about the Federal regulation due to go into effect on Feb 25 that says that all clinics receiving Federal funds must notify the parents of women under 18 years of age when birth control pills or other contraceptive devices are prescribed for them This  the socalled snitch rule promulgated by the Reagan Administration  would put the medical and health community involved with such clinics in the distasteful position of being forced to selectively betray the confidence of the teenage women who seek their help Should this regulation be enforced this country would regress 25 years as a dispenser of health care Many girls who ordinarily would seek contraceptive help and advice would sooner risk pregnancy than the wrath of their parents Thus those who want and need the services of family planning agencies the most would be the least likely to avail themselves of these services Ideally we would prefer that teenagers defer sexual activity until adulthood when they could better understand the implications of such activities But like it or not The Pill changed sexual mores Government regulations notwithstanding there is no way in which we can roll back the new sexual freedom to conform to standards of 25 years ago Those young people who are sexually active will remain so despite such government manipulation We must face the reality that teenage pregnancies are on the increase with many a tragic outcome for mother and child There is nothing so grim as the specter of a pregnant teenager grappling to make a decision on adoption vs abortion or of coping with the upbringing of her baby for which she is totally unprepared Statistically pregnant teenagers are classified as highrisk pregnancies and they are more prone to bearing congenitally defective children further adding to the problem The unwanted child of today may well be the battered child of tomorrow and the baby brought into this world by an immature illprepared parent is more likely to be the social misfit of the future The ramifications go on and on and the financial burden for the care of so many of these babies must ultimately fall to the taxpayer The least we can do in a responsible and enlightened society is to teach these sexually involved youngsters how to protect themselves from an unplanned pregnancy If they are intelligent and responsible enough to seek counseling and contraceptive help we must not discourage them from doing so The snitch rule must go Government interference with the rights to privacy and confidentiality in health care and family planning must not be allowed lest we set a most dangerous and destructive precedent
CLINICS OPPOSING BIRTH-CONTROL RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/13/nyregion/clinics-opposing-birthcontrol-rule.html,TAPED to the window of the waiting room in the Planned Parenthood clinic in Hackensack is a note printed in felt marker Planned Parenthood of Bergen County Absolutely Will Not notify parents of minors receiving services The sign is more than a reassurance that the clinics longstanding policy of confidentiality remains in effect It also is a symbol of the fierce battle being waged around the country against what its opponents call the squeal or snitch rule Department of Health and Human Services regulations requiring all familyplanning clinics receiving Title X funds to notify the parents of minors receiving prescriptions for birth control The regulations which are scheduled to go into effect Feb 25 define minor as an unemancipated person up to and including the age of 17 Federal health officials say that the regulations are designed to promote family participation in socialagency services Familyplanning clinic workers on the other hand say they expect the rules to frighten off teenagers and lead to even greater numbers of teenage pregnancies A suit by the Planned Parenthood Federation and the National Planning and Reproductive Health Association is scheduled to be heard in Federal District Court in Washington tomorrow Another filed by the Memphis Association of Planned Parenthood is to be heard in a Tennessee Federal Court on Wednesday Two suits have been filed by the American Civil Liberties Union The first was heard in Federal District Court in New York City on Feb 3 with the judge reserving decision A separate ACLU suit is pending in West Virginia Most of the suits have been joined by other parties including in the New York case the State Attorney General After the regulations were promulgated last February the Department of Health and Human Services received 120000 comments of which about half were from individuals and half from organizations and agencies A breakdown by pros and cons has not been made public by the department However according to a briefing memo for Secretarydesignate Margaret Heckler  it was signed by Dr Edward N Brandt Jr an assistant secretary and dated Jan 19  the public debate included about 60000 individual comments mostly in opposition Asked about the individual comments Russell Mack a Department of Human Services press officer maintained that they went all across the spectrum One of the agencies on record as opposing the regulations is the New Jersey Department of Health Dr Allen N Koplin the acting commissioner said that when the regulations were promulgated the department wrote thethen Secretary Richard Schweiker opposing them However he added it is questionable whether New Jersey will enter into a suit Under the regulations familyplanning clinics must send a registered letter to the parents of a minor girl receiving contraceptives within 10 days after she has been to the clinic Failure to do so would mean the loss of Title X funds These funds are for family planning Last year Title X funds for familyplanning agencies in New Jersey totaled 4249950 and were used by 20 of the states 25 familyplanning agencies The 25 agencies operate about 65 clinics In 1982 according to Ann Levine director of Planned Parenthood Affiliates of New Jersey 35345 girls under 20 years old were seen for contraceptive services by all 25 agencies Of these she said 16000 to 17000 were 17 years old or younger The reason most often cited for a teenagers going to familyplanning clinics is the promise of confidentiality A patient fills out a form asking whether her parents know she is there and whether she wants them to know Most often say clinic workers the answers are no Dr Alta Garfield program coordinator of family planning for the states Department of Health said that all the agencies have said that the adolescents have been saying I will not be coming back in because of the parental notification Most teenage girls who seek contraceptive services at clinics have been sexually active for six months to a year according to clinic workers Before they arrive some have been using contraceptives that can be bought over the counter such as spermicides or condoms Many have used no contraception at all According to Patricia Manahan a nurse and clinic supervisor for Planned Parenthood of Bergen County foam and other spermicides give only 50 percent protection against pregnancy The clinic she said does not recommend using the condom alone The birthcontrol pill is the method most often chosen by teenage girls although Loretta Carter director of social service for Planned Parenthood of Essex County said Our doctors really dont encourage a young woman to go on birthcontrol pills because pills have hormones But she added teenagers want something thats easy something they dont have to think about On their first appointment in Newark girls who are given pills must listen to a sexeducation lecture For some of these girls  onethird of the clients are 19 and under  this may be their only source of medical information said Earlene Laurel a nurse who is the Newark clinic supervisor According to a 1977 publication by the Alan Guttmacher Institute a research organization in New York City risks for teenagers from birthcontrol pills are much less than risks from pregnancy It cites a rate of 111 deaths per 100000 live births among teenagers against 12 deaths per 100000 pill users who do not smoke and 14 for smokers In addition according to the institute teenage mothers are 15 percent more likely to suffer from toxemia 92 percent more likely to have anemia and 23 percent more likely to suffer from complications from a premature birth than mothers in their early 20s In 1981  the latest year for which data are available from the states Health Department  there were 890 births to girls 15 years old and under 1308 births to girls of 16 and 2100 to girls of 17 There were 267 illegitimate births to girls 14 and younger and 7494 illegitimate births to girls 15 through 19 In 1980 the department also disclosed 7751 abortions were performed on girls 15 through 19 in hospitals and licensed clinics the only facilities required to report abortions This the department said constituted about 26 percent of all abortions reported in the state that year the latest one for which such figures are available In addition it said 293 girls under 15 had reported abortions that year Planned Parenthood of Essex County which has four clinics and gets 60 percent of its funds from Title X saw 4754 girls 15 through 19 for contraceptive services last year the average age was 17 If this becomes law said Mary E Singletary a nurse and the organizations executive director if the board elects not to notify the parent because weve said to these youngsters that we were going to keep their confidentiality  where do we get the money to service them Theyre making this a political football she added Were talking about politicians telling parents to be closer to their children and children closer to their parents This wont make them any closer It might drive them further away Geraldine Rosen executive director of Planned Parenthood for the Greater Camden Area which has eight clinic sites said that only the poor would be affected by the regulation because the middle and upper classes not only have the funds to pay for private services but they have access to private physicians However in relatively affluent Bergen County Planned Parenthood served 463 15through17yearold girls for contraceptives in the first half of 1982 Although many can afford to pay Adalyn S Hixson the organizations executive director said it was the confidentiality that brought the teenagers in As she put it Some of the young peoples families have money and could well afford to pay for contraceptive services if the kids had the kind of relationship where they could approach their parents about it Although familyplanning clinics have been constantly reassuring their teenage clients  through messages like the one taped to the window in Hackensack  the teenagers clinic workers say are calling saying they are afraid to appear afraid their privacy will not be protected The thing is said Mrs Manahan of Bergen County Planned Parenthood you cant put a notice up in the office and say youre not going to tell  when all the kids are still out there and cant see the note
"Doctor's License Lifted In Abortion on Girl, 12",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/14/us/doctor-s-license-lifted-in-abortion-on-girl-12.html,The state Board of Medical Examiners has unanimously revoked the license of a physician accused of performing an illegal thirdtrimester abortion that nearly killed a 12yearold The Department of Professional Regulation charged Dr Egar Gonzalez of Miami with fraud illegally terminating a pregnancy and the killing of an unborn child by injury to his mother The penalty imposed by the board Saturday was stricter than one recommended by the department which wanted an indefinite suspension Dr Gonzalez also faces criminal charges of acting illegally in performing the abortion on the girl in June 1982 A Dade County Circuit judge dismissed manslaughter and aggravated battery charges but prosecutors are appealing According to court records Dr Gonzalez charged the girl 1000 for the abortion She was taken to South Miami Hospital where a hysterectomy and a colostomy were required to stem bleeding and save her life
MAYOR BYRNE PLAYS DOWN HER SEX IN CHICAGO RE-ELECTION CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/14/us/mayor-byrne-plays-down-her-sex-in-chicago-re-election-campaign.html,The Mayor of Carl Sandburgs City of the Big Shoulders recently confessed to a crowd of a thousand Women for Jane Byrne of fears she had when taking office three and a half years ago You can imagine what it would be like being the first woman Mayor and not being able to make the payroll she said That was Mayor Jane M Byrnes first and last reference to her sex that evening as she appealed for renomination in the Feb 22 Democratic primary in which she is opposed by two men This Mayor has gone out of her way not to identify with womens issues said Patricia Horne executive director of the Midwest Womens Center a nonpartisan coalition of traditional and feminist womens groups Observers See Difference Many observers say that campaign strategies in this primary have been altered because the incumbent is a woman While Mayor Byrnes campaign projects her as a hardheaded businesswoman her two major opponents United States Representative Harold Washington and States Attorney Richard M Daley have appeared interested in womens issues and have gathered on their staffs women known for their strong feminist stances While all three assert that they have worked diligently if unsuccessfully for passage of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment in Illinois last year Mr Washington has proclaimed womens rights a major theme of his campaign He talks of injustices promising better child care stronger city services for rape and spouseabuse victims and jobs for women Under his administration he said women would not just be showpieces gofers and typists Rebecca SiveTomashefsky executive director of the Playboy Foundation and cochairman of Mr Washingtons womens organization discounted Mayor Byrnes claims of having put more women in high office Washington wants to put women in positions of line responsibility his aide said whereas Byrne appoints women to traditional spots such as human services arts and libraries Where are the women in the departments of streets and sanitation budget or planning Daley Less Vocal Mr Daley the son of the late Mayor Richard J Daley has been less vocal than Mr Washington on womens rights but has relied heavily on his record as states attorney He says he appointed several women prosecutors instituted a rape victimwitness program and streamlined rape prosecutions Senator Dawn Netsch known for her feminist stance in the Illinois Legislature said Mr Daleys record on womens rights was one reason she joined his campaign staff She disagrees with his opposition to abortion but says It is not an issue for the mayors race Some including her former campaign adviser Don Rose say that Mayor Byrnes approach to women voters is more in line with traditional almost paternalistic politicking An aide introduced the Mayor to a womens group by saying She is making sure your children are not hurt by pornography drugs and alcohol Mr Rose said he had steered her away from feminist groups and stances He said Mayor Byrnes growing emphasis on appearing businesslike almost neuter is calculated to offset sexist attacks and accusations of her being a hysteric Her current staff continues this line Women make it more of an issue that shes a woman than she does said Jan Starr her womens coordinator We are not in a campaign to elect a woman said Karen Petit who holds Jane M Byrnes former city job director of consumer affairs The mayor is a noun that knows no gender The effect on women voters of the candidates campaign approaches to them is hard to judge Two weeks ago newspaper polls showed that Mayor Byrnes support among women was only a few percentage points higher than among men But a poll released last week showed a much larger gap the Mayors support among women of various ethnic and economic groupings was 15 to 25 points higher than among men of the same categories Newspaper Slights Karen Wellisch president of the National Organization for Women which endorsed the Mayor primarily because she is a woman said the Mayor is subject to slights and criticism that men are not from newspapers as much as from political opponents Newspaper articles have dwelled on her hair style dress and makeup changes have called her Mayor Bossy and mare Byrne have said she is impulsive a 98pound bully and a prim schoolmarm and have quoted her as gushing her responses to questions One columnist a man suggested that her opponents avoid the impression of ganging up on the one female in the series of debates that just ended Mr Rose the Mayors former aide who is now a television commentator on the primary campaign said he believed that advice was taken Some of the things they say about her are tainted with sexism he said of the men in the race But they dont attack her quite as hard as they would a man The worst things theyve said about Mayor Byrne arent as bad as the attacks against Richard J Daley
Squeal Rule Sophistry,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/16/opinion/squeal-rule-sophistry.html,A Federal judge has finally pierced the hypocrisy by which the Reagan Administration in the name of family values tried to abridge adolescents access to sex counseling and contraceptives He properly found the squeal rule requiring notice to parents a denial of Congresss intent and called the defense of it mere sophistry After finding in 1978 that the problems of teenage pregnancy have become critical Congress amended a law assisting private family clinics to require that they also serve adolescents Three years later it further stipulated that they encourage family participation in this work Most agencies have done just that they encourage teenage clients to tell their parents about the help they seek and a majority take the advice Last year however the Reagan Administration decided that encourage meant the agencies themselves must notify parents whenever girls under 18 request contraceptive drugs or devices Former Secretary Schweiker of Health and Human Services said this squeal rule would encourage parental participation because without it that participation was impossible He also held that it didnt mandate but merely facilitated family involvement Characterizing these arguments as sophistry Judge Henry Werker of Manhattan has now blocked enforcement of the rule because it contradicts and subverts the intent of Congress About 450000 girls under 18 become pregnant each year Nearly half become mothers who then risk losing job and education opportunities and becoming dependent on welfare Of those who seek help from private agencies 25 percent have said they would steer clear of them if parents had to be notified A new survey of 1200 teenagers in eight cities by Johns Hopkins University reveals that confidentiality is the single most important consideration in their choice of a clinic Instead of reducing adolescent pregnancies and abortions the squeal rule would probably increase both by encouraging mostly avoidance of the agencies Judge Werkers response to a challenge by New Yorks Attorney General Abrams and civil liberties lawyers should go a long way toward stifling the clamor for this unwise approach
"FOR THE CHIEF OF PROTOCOL, 'CHARMED' AND BUSY LIFE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/18/style/for-the-chief-of-protocol-charmed-and-busy-life.html,There will be five official representatives of the United States Government accompanying Queen Elizabeth and Prince Philip on their nineday visit to the West Coast which begins tomorrow In the party will be Michael K Deaver the deputy chief of staff and his wife Carolyn John J Louis Jr the United States Ambassador to the Court of St Jamess and his wife Josephine and a meticulously groomed woman whose job it is to make sure that all the diplomatic niceties are unobtrusively observed The womans name is Selwa Roosevelt and the sign over the door of her office at the State Department reads Chief of Protocol Since her appointment last April the 54yearold Mrs Roosevelt who holds the rank of ambassador and is a successor to Leonore Annenberg has been photographed greeting 27 kings presidents prime ministers and chancellors from countries as diverse as Costa Rica and Jordan Iceland and India But the flashbulbs catch only the icing on a complicated and multilayered cake Her job touches every aspect of diplomatic relationships Weve been called the nannies of the diplomatic corps she said in a recent interview that began in her spacious office and continued in her redbrick town house in Georgetown We are the office of record for all the diplomatic corps now about 6000 Diplomatic licence plates and identification customs courtesies and freeentry privileges problems in communities in which diplomats reside all fall under the aegis of Mrs Roosevelt as does the operation of Blair House the Presidents guest house for distinguished foreign visitors In addition Mrs Roosevelt consults with the President the Vice President and the Secretary of State on state gifts always American in origin and arranges for their purchase Planning Entertainment The department staffed by 40 men and women is also responsible for planning and arranging entertainment for the Secretary of State and his deputy and coordinating with the State Department and embassies on the Presidents schedule when he travels abroad and on the schedules of distinguished foreign nationals who visit this country The schedules cover every minute of a visit including such details as who sits where in what car Theres no time for After you Alphonse  she said Mrs Roosevelt has in her own words led a charmed life but she hesitates to say so because she is superstitious The words appear to take shape almost against her better judgment but they are in fact carefully considered She does not make remarks that she later regrets Im lucky she said And I have been lucky And she is known far and wide as Lucky rather than Selwa A selfproclaimed flagwaving Fourth of July American Mrs Roosevelt is inclined to believe that her luck started even before she was around to enjoy it when her father then a 16yearold boy from the mountains of Lebanon stowed away on a boat and made his way to Kingsport Tenn It continued she said with the woman she calls her greatest intellectual inspiration Najla Showker her mother Mrs Showker who still lives in Tennessee enrolled in college after her husbands death and recently retired as a professor of linguistics There have been two great things in my life my husband and my parents Mrs Roosevelt said  We didnt have children which is a sadness but God doesnt give you everything He gave me a good share Mrs Roosevelt has been peripherally involved in government since her marriage in 1950 Her husband who proposed to her the day after they met just before her graduation from Vassar is Archibald Roosevelt Jr a grandson of President Theodore Roosevelt Now the director of international relations for the Chase Manhattan Bank he was at various periods during their marriage assigned to United States embassies in Istanbul Madrid and London Her credentials include a stint as an assistant to Roger L Stevens at the the Kennedy Center and a career in journalism It wasnt however until she was named to the 67200ayear post as Chief of Protocol that the involvement became direct and prestigious It also began almost too quickly On her second day at work she was at Williamsburg Va greeting Queen Beatrix and Prince Claus of the Netherlands As Mrs Roosevelt stepped aboard the royal aircraft the Queen obviously well briefed by her own protocol staff smiled and said This is your first visit isnt it The remark considerably eased the newcomers jitters Her most important accomplishment to date she believes is setting in motion the computerization of protocol records The program was designed and presented before her tenure but I believed it should have top priority she said The State Departments exacting specifications for her job include a comprehensive knowledge of current affairs and foreign policy and a willingness to accept personal responsibility Mrs Roosevelt added a few others You have to have physical stamina you cant afford the luxury of being moody or bad tempered and you can never be late she said We also have some guests who speak only their own language so communicating despite a language barrier is important Mrs Roosevelt is fluent in Spanish and knows some French Protocol itself may transcend party lines but she said unequivocally her job was a political one You are part of the Administration and it is important that you are in tune with the Administration she said As a registered Republican and longtime admirer of Ronald Reagan the qualification posed no problems for her She is too she said an unabashed admirer of Nancy Reagan I love to watch them together she added They have human dimensions You have enormous respect but youre not afraid of them She particularly related to the Presidents belief in the American dream she said because she herself was the product of it I got my first job when I was 12 or 13 she said I sold perfume in a department store during vacation At 16 I went to the local newspaper and talked myself into a summer job I didnt know what camp was or a vacation but I didnt care and I never felt deprived I think that was the making of me Several months before her appointment Mrs Roosevelt spoke out at what she considered the unfair treatment Mrs Reagan was receiving from the press and wrote an article defending her There are some who believe that although Mrs Roosevelts credentials as a knowledgeable Washingtonian a wellknown hostess and a journalist were the decisive factors in her appointment the article also played a role She has no doubt about her priorities her life is dedicated to Ronald Reagan the article said adding later One need not agree with her viewpoints on everything I for one wish she would understand the importance of keeping abortion safe and legal But one has to at least grant her the right it said to chart her course as First Lady in keeping with her personality her upbringing and her own interests The Perfect Excuse Mrs Roosevelt enjoys the job itself and the perfect excuse it provides for a limited indulgence in clothes Her wardrobe includes such designers as Adolfo and Oscar de la Renta Ive never spent as much money on clothes before she said I have to dress considering the possibility that Ill be summoned to the White House or to a meeting with the Secretary of State Im conservative but I love pretty dresses Im a romantic about everything Her household arrangements have also changed Someone comes in daily to clean and look after the clothes but she said her husband has also helped I had always been a traditional wife and never expected my husband to do anything not because he wouldnt but because that was the way we structured our lives she said Now he goes to the supermarket for me and does errands Hes very supportive Her days are rarely routine There may be an early trip to Andrews Air Force Base to greet a visitor or a breakfast appointment followed by

BIRTH-CONTROL RULE IS BLOCKED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/19/us/birth-control-rule-is-blocked.html,In a rebuff to the Reagan Administration a second Federal district judge today blocked regulations that would have required federally supported family planning clinics to notify parents when minors received prescription contraceptives Judge Thomas A Flannery said It is quite clear that as a result of these regulations substantial numbers of adolescents will become pregnant and will either elect abortion or suffer the consequences of unwanted pregnancies Accordingly he added the regulations are unlawful and invalid because they violate the letter and the spirit of the law authorizing the use of Federal money for family planning services Judge Flannery issued a preliminary injunction against the rules as requested by the plaintiffs representing clinics and teenagers around the country The plaintiffs include the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association a national nonprofit association of clinics Judge Flannery reached the same conclusion as Federal District Judge Henry F Werker in Manhattan who issued a similar injunction Monday in a separate case brought by the New York State Department of Health and the American Civil Liberties Union but it was unclear at the time whether the order would extend beyond New York Judge Werker ruled Thursday that the temporary injunction applied to the Secretary of Health and Human Services as the official responsible for the promulgation of rules and ordered the Department of Health and Human Services to notify all its regional offices warning them not to put the new rules into effect They were scheduled to go into effect next Friday The Department of Justice said the Government would abide by Judge Werkers ruling but would appeal the ruling as soon as possible Government Arguments Rejected In the case here Judge Flannery rejected virtually every argument made by Justice Department lawyers representing the Department of Health and Human Services The judge said the Government was trying to violate the zealously guarded policy of confidentiality long favored by the clinics Claire del Real a spokesman for the Department of Health and Human Services said the agency had no comment on the judges decision She said she did not know whether there would be an appeal but added We continue to believe the rules are legally sound authorized by law and consistent with the intent of Congress Judge Flannerys decision made no reference to Judge Werkers opinion Nancy L Buc an attorney for the Planned Parenthood Federation noted that neither decision was yet final The purpose of the rules was to encourage teenagers to consult their parents on the subject of birth control The rules said that a clinic must notify a parent or guardian within 10 working days after providing prescription contraceptives to a minor Clinics Serve 615000 Minors The Government estimated that the rule would apply to 5000 clinics that receive Federal money The clinics serve a total of 615000 people under the age of 18 The most effective contraceptives such as birth control pills and diaphragms require prescriptions Federal officials denied that the rules would violate the privacy of young women The officials said the women would have been told of the parental notification requirement in advance and by accepting the contraceptives would have signified their approval Judge Flannery said he could not accept this argument because a young woman would be making her choice under essentially coercive circumstances
PRESIDENT HINTS HE MAY RUN AGAIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/19/us/president-hints-he-may-run-again.html,President Reagan offered a ringing reavowal tonight of the most conservative parts of his agenda teasing a conference of his supporters with a reelection hint that his Administration will need more than two years to complete its goal of reforming the Federal Government The President insisting that the nation had turned the corner toward recovery issued his strongest insistence to date in defense of a device designed to protect taxpayers from being driven by inflation into higher tax brackets Some critics of the Administration want to repeal a provision that Congress passed in 1981 Linking the tax rates to the inflation rate to prevent pushing people into higher bnrackets is nonnegotiable Mr Reagan said in a dinner speech to the Conservative Political Action Conference He said Its a fight well take to the people and well win The audience responded with cheers and also applauded when the President in his strongest remarks thus far on the attempt to assassinate Pope John Paul II in 1981 praised the courage and resourcefulness of the Italian Government Italy has raised charges of a possible Bulgarian plot Mr Reagan added that contrary to speculation no one in the United States Government is feeling embarrassed with the Italian investigation A State of the Reagan Report The President as if mindful of the criticism that has been expressed in some quarters of his conservative underpinning delivered a sweeping speech that touched on every issue dear to the hearts of conservatives He called on Congress to discuss the issue of abortion openly and freely on the floors of the House and Senate and accused liberals of aggravating the crime problem Offering his audience at the Sheraton Washington Hotel what he termed a sort of state of the Reagan report the President called on conservatives to take a great deal of honest pride in what we have achieved Mr Reagan gently apologized to some conservatives who want him to be more blunt and critical in dealing with opponents cautioning I hope you know that sometimes its better if a President doesnt say exactly whats on his mind In his one passing reference to whether he will decide to fun for reelection the President said Now Im the first to acknowledge that theres a good deal left to finish on the conservative agenda Our cleanup crew will need more than two years to deal with the mess left by others over a halfcentury Weve Turned the Corner The Presidents conservative backers and strategists have been among the more outspoken recently in importuning him to declare for reelection soon so that his political organization will not lose valuable campaign time Mr Reagan has insisted that the voters not the party professionals will help him decide that question in good time He told his audience in effect that his program had already been successful enough to provide a strong Republican program for 1984 Its time to admit our guilt Mr Reagan declared speaking ironically of Democratic charges that the Republicans are responsible for the economy Time we admitted that our liberal critics have been right all the time and they should go right on telling the American people that the state of the economy is precisely the fault of that wicked creature KempRoth and its havocwreaking twin Reagonomics Lets admit weve turned the corner on the economy the President added asserting that the Administration had not panicked in the recession and had kept to its program And our stubborness if you want to call it that he said will quite literally pay off for every American in the years ahead
A CANDID TALK WITH JUSTICE BLACKMUN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/magazine/a-candid-talk-with-justice-blackmun.html,John A Jenkins lives in Washington and writes on legal matters ONE DOESNT COME TO this place of all places says Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun sitting in his Supreme Court chambers surrounded by photographs of Charles Evans Hughes and judges from the Court of Appeals for the Eight Circuit in the 19th and 20th centuries with an acquired education in constitutional law Reflecting on what he has learned in his 12 years on the nations highest court the 74yearold Justice a short slightly built man with a full head of gray hair swept back from a face that is lined and drawn continues I think this job is very competitive among the nine of us  If a vote goes 54 on a given case  a tentative vote  and one is assigned the opinion to write he circulates it And somebody on the down side on the four is preparing a dissent Youre locked in combat Its competitive to that degree Youre struggling for the fifth vote But I think clearly this is an educational process  and I would hope that one matures as the years go by Just a few years back Harry A Blackmun was nearly an invisible Justice widely dismissed in his own resentful words as a stepchild of others on the Court Although he made history in 1973 with Roe v Wade the Courts landmark decision legalizing abortions of which he is both author and guardian Justice Blackmuns early years on the Court were mostly distinguished by what appeared to be indecisiveness His lowly seniority which garnered him assignments writing opinions in tax cases and other mundane fare did not raise his profile Yet today he has emerged as the Courts most unlikely crusader a jurist determined to make the Court responsive not only to individuals One has to be aware that human beings are involved in all these cases he says  but also to prevent it from plunging rapidly to the right Justice Blackmuns evolution as a jurist and prominence on the Court represent one of the most important developments in the judiciarys recent history and they have gone largely unnoticed That a sitting Justice has decided to discuss his tenure is nearly without precedent in a proscribed world where Justices inaccessibility is formidable and legendary When Bob Woodward and Scott Armstrong wrote The Brethren an account of the Court no Justice was willing to be quoted directly We shouldnt talk out of school the Justice acknowledged during remarkably candid conversations with this writer The rule around here is no interviews at all WO EXCEPTIONS TO THAT unwritten rule the late Justices William O Douglas and Hugo Black each granted a television interview but primarily limited their remarks to the Constitution Justice Blackmun is the first Nixon appointee after Chief Justice Warren E Burger and the only member of the Burger Court to go on the record in extensive interviews The Chief Justice gives one to US News  World Report every year but its highly controlled as I understand it says Justice Blackmun First Justice Blackmun participated in a 50minute session with Cable News Network a few months ago and now he was taking part in lengthy and wideranging conversations punctuated by a selfeffacing wit He speaks openly of his fears about the increasingly conservative tenor of the Court his thoughts about the legalization of abortion his relations with other Justices  Holmes or somebody described the Court as nine scorpions in a bottle he said We dont socialize too much  and especially with the Chief Justice I am fairly positive that he feels I have not been the supportive arm he would have liked me to be Justice Blackmun was initially typecast as the subordinate half of the Minnesota Twins and therefore an appendage of the Chief Justice a fellow Minnesotan and lifelong friend Today he is speaking critically of the conservative bloc composed of the Chief Justice Justice William H Rehnquist and the newest Justice Sandra Day OConnor No longer a conservative Justice Blackmun has become a pragmatic strongly independent jurist who more often than not votes with the Courts two more liberal Justices Thurgood Marshall and William J Brennan Jr Justice Blackmun acknowledges the change although he adds wryly Once in a while Id like to think that they joined me Not that Justice Blackmun considers himself a flaming liberal Id like to regard myself as being a member of the center of the Court he says When Potter Stewart was here he explains referring to the retired Justice whom Justice OConnor replaced I lined the Court up as 252 on the spectrum There were five of us in the center and whoever prevailed in a case had to get votes out of the center And certainly now I think its a 243 setup  I know I would be happier if the Court didnt plunge back and forth from left to right just by the addition of a new Justice Justice Blackmuns unprecedented candor seems motivated not only by his political concern but also by personal resentment I have a little anger underneath it all he says Anger from being categorized over the 12 years Ive been here in a way that I think I never fit Perhaps too as his thoughts turn to retirement Justice Blackmun is also speaking out for his place in history and to refute those critics who have negatively assessed his tenure on the Court Im convinced much of the criticism simply has to do with Blackmuns style observes Yale Kamisar a constitutional law professor at the University of Michigan Hes a plodder No charisma No commanding presence No one would ever take him for a Supreme Court Justice When I think of someone to compare Blackmun to its Harry Truman Just like Truman Blackmun has said in effect What am I doing here I didnt deserve the appointment but Im going to make the most of it and Im going to convince people by the time I leave that I deserved it  The notion of humility is central to an understanding of Justice Blackmuns place on the Court He believes he is there to do justice not merely to oblige its doctrinal demands and his unprepossessing style serves to remind him of the constituency he has been sent there to serve Maybe Im oversensitive Justice Blackmun says but these are very personal cases Were dealing with people  the life liberty and property of people And because I grew up in poor surroundings I know theres another world out there that we sometimes forget about The other world that the Justice sees is part of his past His father owned a grocery and hardware store in St Paul Minn We lived in a bluecollar neighborhood the Justice says And we didnt have very much but nobody complained because everybody was in the same state in our neighborhood And it didnt do me any harm at all In 1925 the Harvard Club of Minnesota looking for a deserving highschool graduate to send to Harvard on a tuition scholarship chose 17yearold Harry Andrew Blackmun Characteristically he now says their award of the scholarship must have been an accident of fate He majored in mathematics and to cover living expenses worked as a janitor a milkman a painter of handball courts the operator of a motor launch for the coach of the Harvard crew and a grader of math papers He seriously considered going to medical school I probably would have been a poor physician but chose the Harvard Law School instead working at the same eclectic collection of jobs to pay both tuition and board Felix Frankfurter was one of Justice Blackmuns law professors At the time Justice Blackmun says I did not particularly admire him I was not one of his favorites Still he considers Frankfurter a formative influence He was one of the greatest teachers I ever knew and I learned a lot from him  To this day when I am working on opinions if I can find a Frankfurter opinion its always helpful EARS LATER JUSTICE Blackmun would fulfill his interest in medicine by serving as resident counsel to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn It was the happiest decade in the lives of my wife and myself he says I was able to have a foot in both camps  law and medicine Then in 1959 President Eisenhower appointed him to the United States Court of Appeals for the Eighth Circuit Justice Blackmun had been a littlenoticed appeals court judge for 11 years when Chief Justice Burger suggested to President Nixon that he be considered for the Court The President had wanted a conservative Southerner originally but after the Senate rejected his first two nominees Judges Clement F Haynesworth Jr and G Harrold Carswell he compromised with Justice Blackmun a Northerner who seemed to have the law and order philosophy he wanted Justice Blackmun who has goodnaturedly called himself Old No 3 says he always recalls that I came here as the third choice not the first and I think this has been good for me to realize Justice Blackmun recalls presiding over a swearingin ceremony for an official that took place in the Oval Office President Nixon told the new appointee I just wanted you to know that we had a number of people in mind for this But at all times you were the No 1 guy According to Justice Blackmun I must have had a funny look on my face because the President looked at me and said And thats no reflection on you Mr Justice Ive always remembered that because he obviously wondered how his remark had hit me I thought it was funny as could be As a federal appeals court judge and as a new Supreme Court Justice Justice Blackmun seldom seemed to give much weight to his personal feelings about a case He professed himself to be against capital punishment but consistently refused to overturn death sentences saying state legislatures had the power to outlaw the punishment One case that came before him on the appeals bench alleged racial discrimination in home sales yet he felt his hands were tied by legal precedents He wrote a decision saying the civilrights laws didnt apply then expressed relief when the Supreme Court overturned his ruling In the 1971 Pentagon Papers case he was one of three Justices voting against the press The First Amendment after all is only one part of an entire Constitution he wrote In Justice Blackmuns early years on the Court his opinions frequently seemed naive or illreasoned to court observers In one he upheld a bankruptcy filing fee  for indigents On another occasion after all nine Justices had agreed in conference that a fiveperson jury was unconstitutional but a sixperson jury was not Justice Blackmun was assigned to write the opinion Instead of explaining the Courts logic in simple terms the Justices felt they had to draw the line somewhere he tediously analyzed studies of group interaction and collected statistics on the effects of reductions in group size to show that juries of five or fewer would violate the Sixth and 14th Amendments Only one other Justice would sign his opinion Some of his early decisions were just wretched recalls the national legal director of the American Civil Liberties Union Burt Neuborne In the civilliberties community we just despaired We couldnt believe anyone could be that insensitive You wouldnt know it was the same Justice to look at his opinions today The overriding verdict on Blackmun is so overwhelmingly positive that the civilliberties community looks to him as a very important third vote on the Court Justice Blackmun says however that I dont believe Im any more liberal as such now than I was before Ive always been more liberal than the Chief Justice for instance Always The Justices liberalism was exemplified by his authorship of Roe v Wade As the Justice sees it the Courts 72 decision constituted justice in its most essential form I believe everything I said in the second paragraph of that opinion where I agonized initially not only for myself but for the Court Parenthetically in doing so publicly I disobeyed one suggestion Hugo Black made to me when I first came here He said Harry never display agony in public in an opinion Never display agony Never say that this is an agonizing difficult decision Always write it as though its clear as crystal  At another juncture the Justice observes I probably agonize over cases more than I should and more than most of my colleagues do I always have done that and its something I havent been able to get over But at the same time once a decision has been made I dont lose any sleep over it Justice Blackmun who staunchly defends Roe feels that he probably will be remembered for that ruling alone I suppose Ill carry Roe to my grave His office has received more than 45000 letters about the decision Think of any name Ive been called it in these letters Butcher of Dachau murderer Pontius Pilate Adolph Hitler and he still is sometimes picketed by antiabortion groups when he shows up for speaking engagements at law schools He says he is fatalistic about his safety when he encounters such hostility Im in my 70s now Ive lived a good life  If somethings going to happen its going to happen Justice Blackmun has expressed his fury when the Court has occasionally stepped back from its 1973 decision In 1980 when the Court narrowly upheld the Governments denial of Medicaidfunded abortions he fumed He needed a fifth vote to have his way and he didnt get it The Chief Justice who had voted with him in Roe now voted with the other side Justice Blackmun says the Chief Justices actions are proof of his becoming more conservative on this and other issues I feel the abortion decisions are among the most liberal that the Court has produced in many a year  And the Chief Justice was never very enthusiastic about joining the majority  But ever since Roe Justice Blackmun says with exasperation he has gone the other way on abortion cases Like his brethren Justice Blackmun says he occasionally chafes under the Chief Justices domination Certainly he cant be accused of being a rockribbed conservative in all respects But hes a tightrein man He likes to keep things tight He runs his office pretty tight holds his law clerks under control doesnt let them mingle too much There are those who say hes very dogmatic And impatient with those who disagree But if one knows him well enough he has a soft spot too as everybody does  if one can find it Justice Blackmuns pique ment toward the Chief Justice has occasionally surfaced in his writings In a 1979 case Gannett Company v DePasquale the issue was the right of news reporters to be present during a pretrial hearing Not only did the Court rule 54 that reporters had no such constitutional right but Justice Stewarts primary opinion also said no fewer than 12 times that the closedhearing ruling could apply to trials as well Chief Justice Burger joined in his opinion but he also wrote a concurrence that seemed to limit the holding to pretrial hearings  obviously a far narrower interpretation than Justice Stewarts Justice Blackmun dissented in Gannett and he still considers the Chief Justices concurrence disingenuous I cannot understand it the Justice says almost four years later He tried to make his concurrence into a pretrial thing in the face of Potter Stewarts much broader language I just think it doesnt fit in a scholarly way But Justice Blackmun triumphed a year later when the Court accepted another case Richmond Newspapers v Virginia in an effort to clear up the uncertainties created by the previous ruling Unlike Gannett Richmond clearly presented the issue of the presss right to cover an actual trial and now the Court sided 71 with Justice Blackmun Justice Rehnquist dissented and Justice Lewis F Powell Jr did not participate The Chief Justice as was his privilege assigned himself to write the opinion and Justice Blackmun penned a sarcastic concurrence aimed right at him It is gratifying he wrote to see the Court wash away at least some of the graffiti that marred the prevailing opinions in Gannett The Justice grows pensive when asked about his relationship with the Chief Justice Ive known him most of my life  since we were about 5 years old he says We did go to the same grade school together Our paths separated at the highschool level and never joined again although I maintained an acquaintanceship with him through all the years and watched with great pride his advancement and activities and development Hes a pretty dominating person and always has been But I know him well and I think I dont mind his displays of dominance  or attempted dominance The Chief has a great heart in him and hes a very fine human being when you get to know him when the tensions are off One has to remember too that hes under strain almost constantly I think hes tired as all of us are tired When I went through my confirmation process Senator Kennedy asked me if our acquaintanceship might be a difficult factor in working on the court My answer was definitely yes I felt there would be times where our friendship would be sadly strained And this has developed There isnt any question about it  Our relationship is very different from what it used to be before I came here and maybe even from what it was during the first couple of years after I came here Our closeness has lessened considerably He doesnt come down here to the chambers although others stop in on occasion Socially I dont see him at all When asked whether Chief Justice Burger feels that Justice Blackmun has betrayed him the Justice replies It wouldnt surprise me if he felt that way But Im not going to be a standin for anybody Im not going to be a No 2 vote for anybody I never have been and I dont intend to be In recent years Justice Blackmun has become a sensitive advocate of the politically powerless appealing to his colleagues as he did in his dissent in the Bakke reversediscrimination case that prohibited the setting aside of places for minority students at the University of California The sooner we get down the road toward accepting and being a part of the real world and not shutting it out and away from us the sooner will racial discrimination vanish from the scene Similarly in a stinging dissent to the Courts 54 decision in 1980 denying funds for Medicaid abortions the Justice stated The Government punitively impresses upon a needy minority its own concepts of the socially desirable the publicly acceptable and the morally sound  There truly is another world out there the existence of which the Court I suspect either chooses to ignore or fears to recognize Justice Blackmun makes no excuses for the vehement language in some of his dissents If one feels strongly about a major issue with social and economic overtones I think it deserves some strong talk once in a while Everybody gets surprised when I produce it They think its out of character But Ive been as tough in some of my written language as anybody around here The Justice wishes however that his colleagues conduct on the bench was more temperate I think our Court is a little rude he says I think we talk too much on the bench among ourselves while counsel is speaking The Chief Justice tells me he gets a lot of letters about it from lawyers And I think we at times are a little rough on counsel  With nine of us up there in these black robes and this poor guy down there alone its tense enough without several of us asking questions at once or doing it in that staccato fashion Justice Blackmuns transformation became quite evident last term when he authored a number of important opinions that sharply divided the Court Three of his opinions gave the Federal Government wider authority over state actions contrary to the general thrust of the Reagan Administrations policies In aother 54 case Justice Blackmun guided the Court to a decision upholding a Federal law that required state utility commissions to take energyconservation measures And he was also author of a 63 ruling that for the first time applied the Federal law against sex discrimination to employees of schools and colleges receiving Federal aid Previously the law had applied only to students In prior years Justice Blackmun might have voted the other way making the Courts ruling in at least two of the cases far different After all during the Courts 1970 term his first he had voted with Chief Justice Burger  who dissented in these major opinions last term  90 percent of the time That trend continued until just a few years ago when the Justices migration from the right became noticeable Then with Justice OConnors arrival the turnabout became dramatic Justice Blackmun voted with Justice Brennan the Courts senior Justice and its liberal leader 75 percent of the time Mistrustful of ideology in the law Justice Blackmun has sought to prevent those he deems ideologues from upsetting the basic fairness of the Courts original decision Ironically that mistrust of ideology has led him to side with Justices Brennan and Marshall the Courts two most liberal ideologues as he attempts to maintain a centrist balance Just as Justice Blackmun sees Justice OConnors appointment as adding a third solidly conservative vote to the Court so does he see it as his responsibility to correct the imbalance her presence creates Shes obviously settled down on the right side Justice Blackmun says Nothing wrong with that Yet although he says he has seen no political voting by Justice OConnor or anyone else Justice Blackmun suggests the Courts newest Justice might have a political agenda He has for instance considered the prospect that she might one day be the Republican VicePresidential nominee Its always a possibility Justice Blackmun says You hear every rumor I think theres also a possibility of her being named the Chief Justice Suppose the Chief steps down tomorrow The President could name her It would be a popular feminist kind of thing And then he could still fill her place with another appointment I have heard comments to the effect that everything she does looks as though shes running for President But one could say that about a lot of people She commands the public attention Eventually well get a woman on a national major party ticket And right now shes a very logical possibilty Some see Justice Blackmuns balancing act as a glaring deficiency Unlike his colleagues Justice Rehnquist for instance Justice Blackmun makes little attempt to propound a consistent theory of how the Constitution should be interpreted Unencumbered by precedent he votes instead in accordance with his sense of fairness The hazard is that a case thus decided may confuse future litigants Whats really at issue here is the role law should play in our society observes Mr Neuborne of the ACLU Most people think it just exists to settle disputes but its actually much more than that The law is really a set of signals you give people telling them how to behave If you have a Justice putting out inconsistent signals to the country it doesnt help people order their affairs so they can live in accordance with the law The law cant then be a teacher it can only be a dispute resolver To my mind Blackmun is a terrific dispute resolver but he is not a great teacher Hes a brilliant pragmatist but only a passable theoretician What is lacking in some of Blackmuns poorest work adds a wellknown constitutional law professor is an explanation of how he decided as he did Even some of his most important opinions and concurrences and dissents are just very personal statements without any law in them They lack the reasoned foundation that a better Justice would lay Justice Blackmuns critics almost invariably mention Roe when they rebuke him for failing to more carefully locate the constitutional underpinnings of his opinions The Roe opinion did not link the right of abortion to any specific Bill of Rights guarantee But the University of Michigans Kamisar says the abortion issue is such an intensely personal one that Justice Blackmun was bound to be criticized no matter how carefully his opinion was crafted Its inherent in the issue Kamisar observes Hes always going to take a beating on Roe v Wade Justice Blackmun who moderates yearly a seminar on justice and society at the Aspen Institute for Humanistic Studies with Norval Morris professor of law and criminology at the University of Chicago Law School is familiar with such criticism We always have a couple of professors there he says and theyre way up in the clouds They want to talk John Rawls and all the other legal philosophers John Stuart Mill The practical lawyers couldnt be less interested in theory So we kind of take a middle course I get disturbed when we have a case that goes off on theory and does injustice to the litigant I think were there to try to do justice to him as well as to develop a great overlying cloud of legal theory Im not a jurisprude I couldnt be an expert in jurisprudence if I wanted to be Im not Roscoe Pound or Rawls or Mill or Robert Nozick or all the rest of them I dont have the intellect for it But I do not think Ive been inconsistent Of course all of us are more liberal in some fields and more conservative in other fields Justice Blackmun observes and cites an example Surely Thurgood Marshall is a liberal basically and its understandable And yet if we get a case in the securities area I mean he is always over on the conservative side And this is an area where he and Brennan part Justice Blackmun lives with his wife Dorothy their three daughters are grown in a Rosslyn Va apartment just across the Potomac River from Washington and although he earns 96700 a year and has a net worth of well into six figures he drives to and from the Court each day in an old blue Volkswagen Softspoken and approachable hes a favorite of Court clerks and staff Off the bench he is almost Mittyish in his demeanor Gold eyeglasses frame his face and a hearing aid peeks out from behind his left ear By the standards of the pinstriped and blackfrockcoated lawyers who appear before the Court Justice Blackmun is plebeian in his manner of dress wearing in his office rumpled slacks loafers and a comfortable cardigan sweater He apologizes to a visitor for the looks of the office but I cant even keep up with the law reviews over there He arrives at the Court each weekday between 730 AM and 8 AM then breakfasts with his clerks in the Courts downstairs cafeteria from 805 AM to 9 AM when the workday officially begins The routine is unalterable  his breakfast of one egg toast coffee and water rarely changes  but it came about rather by accident Justice Blackmun recollects When I came to Washington I wasnt used to the traffic circles here and the congestion And I thought that if I got in early and left late Id be better off I told my clerks I was always here for breakfast if they wanted to join me And its continued ever since Given the courts workload  5311 cases filed this year more than double that of 15 years ago  both the Justice and his clerks work weekday evenings and Saturdays and Sundays as well We kept up an exhausting pace recalls Charles Rothfeld who was a clerk last term And at the end only Justice Blackmun was ready for more When the FBI conducted its prenomination investigation of the Justice a dozen years ago it turned up only one criticism He works too hard Justice Blackmun credits his stamina to an exercise regimen he follows daily Each noon he leaves his office for a fourblocklong walk around the Court building And each day at 5 PM he leaves again and goes downstairs to an exercise room staffed by a fulltime physiotherapist I couldnt survive if I didnt go down there every day he says At least I get down and stretch and I feel better Its a brokendown little exercise room but I have a regular routine  calisthenics weights bicycle rowing machine then a whirlpool He doesnt smoke and rarely drinks Trim and vigorous the Justice says of his colleagues Some of the younger ones are probably in less good physical shape than some of us old bats His schedule leaves little time for leisure pursuits or socializing His idea of entertainment says Richard A Meserve a former clerk and now a lawyer with Covington  Burling in Washington is a walk around Roosevelt Island a small Potomac River nature preserve near the Blackmuns apartment Although they would prefer an evening out the Blackmuns stay home Saturday nights and listen to the Prairie Home Companion radio show I have 50 books at my bedside and I havent read one laments Justice Blackmun who catches up in the summer During the year I try to get a few mysteries in lastminute bedtime reading Calms one down a bit The classics basically I try to get through the Tolkien trilogy every other year at least He realizes that the exigencies of his duties have put distance between himself and his wife A lot of people think that when you serve on a multijudge court it isnt lonely But its distinctly lonely he says Certainly being here has cut down on my social life I think its unfair to Mrs Blackmun There are not enough hours in the day for me to do some of the social things that she would like to do I cant do both I cant get ready for an argument session and go out nights So in that respect its a little lonely and its lonely for her Justice Blackmuns only rebellion against to the tightly structured existence of the Court is a welldeveloped mischievous streak and it has endeared him to his clerks if not to the Justices who often bear the brunt of his pranks When Justice OConnor for instance was named to the Court she received the endofthebench seat reserved for the most junior Justice Beside her sat Justice Rehnquist an old friend and Stanford lawschool classmate who it was rumored among the clerks had once dated her Justice Blackmun had also heard the rumor When they next took the bench he leaned over to Justice Rehnquist and puckishly admonished him No fooling around Once his clerks jokingly placed a peaked Mao Zedung cap on Justice Blackmuns head and dared him to wear it to the Justices conference that was about to begin He strode gamely into the conference the cap jauntily atop his head Occasionally even Justice Blackmuns selfeffacement can be amusing He almost never calls in the summer when hes vacationing on one of his favorite lakes in Wisconsin explains Mr Rothfeld So when he called I thought Id done something that was terribly wrong Instead he apologized and asked me if I would read him the baseball standings He couldnt get a newspaper there Mr Neuborne of the ACLU remembers an anxious moment in 1975 when he was a New York University lawschool professor sitting alone in the faculty lawschool library marking up one of Justice Blackmuns opinions for inclusion in a legal casebook he was preparing No one would accuse Justice Blackmun of being terse Mr Neuborne says And I had my red pencil out and Id already slashed 20 pages down to six when I heard this voice coming from over my shoulder What are you doing to my case It was Blackmun He was a visiting lecturer at NYU and he had wandered into the library to get a cup of coffee I was flustered and I tried to explain He asked to see what Id done And after he read it he smiled and said to me Its better your way  Sitting on a window ledge in his office Justice Blackmun reflects on changes he knows

LIGHT ON A DARK SUBJECT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/books/light-on-a-dark-subject.html,SECRETS On the Ethics of Concealment and Revelation By Sissela Bok 332 pp New York Pantheon Books 1695 IN 1969 a young student named Tatiana Tarasoff was murdered by a man who had told his psychotherapist two months before that he wanted to kill her The therapist called in the police when his patient first confessed his desire the young man was questioned found rational and let go The universitys director of psychiatry overseeing the case then asked that the police expunge their intervention in the matter from the young mans record No one informed Miss Tarasoff or her parents of the danger it was thought to abrogate the confidential relationship between doctor and patient One day Miss Tarasoff admitted the man to her home was shot and stabbed The parents later sued Miss Tarasoffs university the campus police and the therapists for negligence The California Supreme Court upheld the parents The privilege of confidentiality ends the court wrote when the public peril begins Sissela Bok has written a subtle and often eloquent book about conundrums of secrecy like those posed by the Tarasoff case She is a philosopher whose learning is immense and whose range of reference is wide Secrets deals with the Pentagon Papers the Abscam trials the Iranian hostage crisis and other contemporary events as well as making considered judgments on John Locke Thomas Carlyle and the 14thcentury Japanese text The Confessions of Lady Nijo The aim of her book is to fashion an ethics of secrecy when it is justified when it is not Like the California Supreme Court in the Tarasoff case she is disposed to think that secrecy must end when public peril begins What makes Secrets complex however is the authors acknowledgement that legal definitions of proper and improper secrecy will always miss the psychological and indeed theological rationales for secrecy Her book explores keeping a secret as both a sacred and as a profane act Twentyfive years ago this book would perhaps have been unthinkable AngloAmerican philosophers were then disposed to write analyses of such matters as in what sense can a dog know its parents Brilliance was exercised in proportion to the triviality of the subject at hand experiences of death obsession and moral compromise were considered unsuitable for rigorous philosophic analysis and somewhat embarrassing Sissela Bok belongs to a new generation of philosophers  Bernard Williams in England Ronald Dworkin and Thomas Nagel in this country  who have put philosophy in the service of clarifying somewhat the mess of adult life The vexing problem of the dogs parents has been put aside for inquiries into the ethics of abortion or the censorship of pornography In this new effort Sissela Boks work is distinctive because of her sensitivity to questions of power as they relate to ethics The present work is in one sense a companion volume to her previous book Lying In both she pays much attention to the context in which lying or secrecy occurs specifically what difference it makes to consider these phenomena as private or public acts In both books she is as much concerned with the psychological motives for lying or for keeping a secret as with the act itself But Secrets is also a significant advance on the earlier work it goes deeper into its subject at the risk of being less clear Lying was a brisk efficient analysis As the rationales for lying were toppled one after the other certain nagging but important problems were pushed to the side like the relationship between a lie and a fiction There are no such evasions in Secrets the problems raised are explored from many sides Indeed the book is almost maddeningly fairminded In her effort to probe the complexity of secrecy the author takes such pains to present views contrary to her own that the reader sometimes is at a loss to know what she believes But there is a clear position in Secrets one that appears if the reader is as patient with her as she is scrupulous to other writers Basically this book argues that there is a break between secrecy in private and in public What makes secrecy important as an interior experience cannot therefore easily be used to justify professional military or governmental secrecy At the end of her study Sissela Bok writes With no capacity for keeping secrets and for choosing when to reveal them human beings would lose their sense of identity and every shred of autonomy Their plans would be endangered and their creativity stifled they could not count on retaining even the most fundamental belongings And yet this capacity too often serves to thwart the very same human needs since it risks damaging the judgment and character of those who exercise it and conceals wrongdoing of every kind The reason for this potential damage she says is that Control over secrecy and openness gives power it influences what others know and thus what they choose to do The thesis may sound obvious when stated baldly It isnt because of the way she analyzes the inner subjective experience of keeping a secret Like the sociologist Georg Simmel she begins by asking why a persons secrets in her words once revealed will seem paltry and out of proportion to all that went into guarding them The reason both say is that making something secret gives it value Indeed a secret creates in us the sense of interior life so that our inside is not something we have but something we make partially through our secrets At this point Sissela Bok parts company with Georg Simmel His emphasis is on how the psyche continually shores itself up by making new secrets hers is on how the psyche traffics its secrets in the world In much the strongest chapter in the first half of her book Confessions she makes clear how psychiatric attitudes toward listening to confessions differ from priestly attitudes and how the person confessing a secret can manipulate others through the act Despite her keen eye for the abuse possible in harboring and revealing personal secrets she emphasizes the moral importance of this traffic She believes that through learning discretion people can learn respect for the privacy of others and that through sharing secrets they can create strong fraternal bonds Most important she believes that an awareness of the value of secrecy kindles an awareness of mystery No one can or indeed should try to lay bare the unfathomable inner core of another human being that constitutes his or her distinctiveness In taking this position Sissela Bok sides with Lionel Trilling against what he called the cult of displaying ones inner authentic self she shows moreover that in this respect for the secret begins our belief in the sacred The trouble is that the sense of something sacred about our secrets is so easily profaned Gossip profanes for example In the last half of her book the author shows how institutions and persons in power profane secrets They do so in two ways The obvious way is Big Brothers method the use of power to uncover personal secrets and so gain control over individuals The less obvious way practiced by the doctor the military strategist and the journalist is the cloaking of actions of power in secrecy what makes this complicated is that the individual in power justifies his or her secrets by appealing either to the necessity of his or her work or by claiming that the keeping of a secret is beneficial to those who dont know These appeals justify secrecy as if there were no question of using it as a tool of power  to coerce mislead or violate SISSELA BOK does not throw all these appeals out of court but she shows when it is fallacious to reason from the individual to the collective and when institutional claims of secrecy are suspicious on their own terms There is an especially trenchant chapter on military secrecy She makes it clear through an analysis of the Iranian hostage crisis and particularly the Governments attempt to rescue the hostages through military action just how the practice of secrecy within military channels created the very inefficiency that caused the military effort to abort She has equally unkind things to say about the efficacy of Great Britains Official Secrets Act This analysis which also touches on military deception during the Vietnam War adds up to a vindication of Jeffersons position on the citizenrys right to know about the possibility of war It is their sweat which is to earn all the expenses of the war and their blood which is to flow in expiation of the causes of it Secrets makes a strong case then against what the California Supreme Court called in the Tarasoff affair the privilege of secrecy in public affairs and a strong case for the privilege of secrecy in private But I finished the book with a certain feeling of dissatisfaction Government officials have become virtuosos at appearing candid while hiding their real actions politicians have perfected the art of advertising themselves while keeping their own counsel The position taken in Secrets is one that any reasonable official might subscribe to in principle but only in principle And the books analysis of disinformation and other techniques for creating the illusion of openness is all too brief Since Secrets operates at a more profound level than Lying I wish the author had returned to her earlier theme and spent more effort on analyzing how people lie when they have a secret SOMETHING in the premise is also troubling Not all acts experiences or beliefs are equally potent in creating that mysterious inner region we make sacred by keeping secret Our dogs parents are not a fit subject for mystery our own unfortunately are For all its evils in practice one of the virtues of psychoanalysis as a theory is to indicate which of our experiences have the weight to inspire awe and so the desire to keep them locked inside Secrets does not pay enough attention to which secrets matter It provides an ethics of secrecy without a real theory of value For this Sissela Boks liberality of spirit is to blame if blame is the right word While suspicious of secrecy in the public realm she shows absolute respect for the varieties of individual belief and desire The conundrum that faces the author and probably most of her readers myself included  is how to make judgments of value while respecting the variety of values What Sissela Bok has created instead are tools for criticizing the powerful when they claim the right to keep us in ignorance Secrets is a distinguished and necessary book
STATE TERMS FAKE DOCTORS GROWING PERIL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/nyregion/state-terms-fake-doctors-growing-peril.html,Walter Ian Fischman has published dozens of books for the home handyman and hobbyist Among the titles are 101 Projects for Bottle Cutters and How to Finish Off Your Basement or Attic Mr Fischman also wrote a syndicated column called You Can Do It and for a year in 1965 and 1966 was the editorial director of Popular Mechanics magazine More recently according to authorities Mr Fischman decided to branch out into medicine He set up a practice on the Upper East Side on the ground floor of a building at 25 East 69th Street Although he said he was a physician he had no license to practice medicine In his practice authorities said Mr Fischman offered abortions and cures for everything from sexual dysfunction to pneumonia His treatments were unusual One of his abortion techniques was to insert electrically wired acupuncture needles into the hands feet and torso of a patient and induce a small electric current Put On 5 Years Probation Last Nov 9 Mr Fischman was sentenced in State Supreme Court in Manhattan to five years probation for practicing medicine without a license a Class E felony punishable by up to four years in prison Officials say that while the number of prosecutions in New York State is still small concern is increasing about the danger of unlicensed people posing as physicians Its apparently a growing and very lucrative business said William Dowling the chief of the special prosecutions bureau of the State Attorney Generals office the unit responsible for prosecuting the Fischman case Investigations of people fraudulently practicing as physicians are conducted by the Office of Professional Discipline of the State Department of Education In 1981 six cases were passed on to the Attorney General for prosecution In 1982 the number rose to 10 Charges Are Now Felonies Mr Dowling said that while there had been pleabargaining arrangements through 1981 that had allowed those who were caught to plead guilty to misdemeanor charges that practice had ended and all indictments would now be for felonies Mr Fischman who is 58 years old was arrested last June 21 after he tried to perform an abortion on an undercover agent He was arrested at the office complex he shared with Dr Louis Parrish a licensed physician whose specialties are family medicine and psychiatry Dr Parrish has declined to answer questions about his relationship with Mr Fischman Authorities say Dr Parrish is liable to prosecution for aiding in the unlicensed practice of medicine The agent visited the Fischman office to follow up on a complaint by Ellen Liberty a 28yearold waitress who had gone to Mr Fischman for what turned out to be an unsuccessful abortion She later described the procedure as a nightmare and through her attorney Stephanie Brand has filed suit against Mr Fischman Patient Describes Treatment Miss Liberty said in an interview that she had sought out Mr Fischman because a friend had told her that his was a humane and less traumatic way to have an abortion Miss Liberty recalled that Mr Fischman had greeted her in a white coat and called himself Dr Fischman and that everything in the office seemed professional She said he had dimmed the lights and turned on soft music before beginning the treatment with injections of what he called herbal medicine He then inserted needles in her feet hands and abdomen These she said were wired to what looked like a stereo set and she felt something like tingling but it was more intense painful After the 20minute treatment she said Mr Fischman said  You should be feeling good feeling euphoric like on a marijuana high  Miss Liberty said I didnt feel anything at all I was just glad it was all over When she found that the procedure had not worked Miss Liberty informed the District Attorneys office Because of the delay Miss Liberty said she had to have a late saline abortion at Mount Sinai Hospital Called HocusPocus Procedure Miss Liberty saw Dr Thomas D Kerenyi an obstetrician and gynecologist to arrange for that abortion and told him what she had gone through with Mr Fischman Its incredible that anyone would do such a hocuspocus procedure Dr Kerenyi said of the Fischman treatment Its witchcraft reborn At least one patient came to Mr Fischman as a result of a recommendation from someone at the Serenity School for the Body and Mind a socalled naturalhealing center in a former upstairs synagogue at 310 East 72d Street The school taught yoga and dispensed herbs Serenity has since moved to a storefront at 74 West 69th Street where Mr Fischman taught a course called Sexual Acupressure The catalogue said the course could help raise your level of sexual awareness and pleasure to a new and higher level The catalogue described Mr Fischman as a doctor of Chinese medicine and the author of a book called Sexual Acupuncture  Sexual Acupuncture was published by EP Dutton in 1978 Mr Fischman was listed as coauthor with Dr Frank Z Warren The jacket describes the work as a dramatic new technique to intensify your pleasure and described Mr Fischman as a doctor of Chinese medicine the author of 26 books and more than 2000 articles and the president of Wentworth Press Mr Fischman declined to discuss his work I had a very strange group of patients who were allergic to conventional Western medicine he said in a brief telephone interview Mr Fischmans former associates at Popular Mechanics were surprised to hear of his conviction John Linkletter who is now the magazines editor said that Mr Fischman had left to return to freelance writing but that he continued to keep in touch with the magazine offering articles from time to time
A CONSERVATIVE SHOWS HIS LIBERAL BENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/weekinreview/a-conservative-shows-his-liberal-bent.html,WASHINGTON SENATOR Dan Quayle is an unorthodox conservative The youthful Indiana Republican who says that Government can be brutal and ruinous has taken the lead in championing the cause of the structurally unemployed  those who have been eliminated from the job market by a lack of training or education He says that Government has no alternative but to help provide jobs for minoritygroup members women and youths He also has fought for First Amendment rights involving those who could endanger national security by revealing the identities of covert Govrnment agents sought reductions in military spending and believes his party will stand or fall on the social fairness issue For five weeks last fall Senator Quayle supported conservative Republican efforts to ban abortion and school busing and legalize school prayer He cast vote after vote to end a liberal filibuster of legislation containing those measures But then he rose in the Senate chamber to say he was changing his vote Its time we got on with other things the 36yearold freshman told his colleagues Enough is enough The right wing viewed his reversal as a betrayal His switchboard and mailbox were flooded with denunciations of his proabortion probusing stand Thats the way the far right plays it Mr Quayle said Some of their tactics are detestable The radical right may find further reason to denounce the lawmaker these days He has sponsored legislation that would provide 2 billion to help the approximately seven million structurally unemployed The Administration rejected the proposal last week when Martin Feldstein chairman of the Presidents Council of Economic Advisers told the subcommittee on employment and productivity that Mr Quayles notion was a far less useful way to spend Government funds than the Presidents recommendation The Senator who heads that subcommittee replied that the Presidents proposal to accelerate Federal construction and other public works would provide relatively costly jobs for skilled workers while ignoring the rest of the unemployed We want to look at the minorities the women the lasthired firstfired aspect Mr Quayle said These were unexpected words from the rich conservative grandson of the late Eugene Pulliam the very conservative publisher of The Indianapolis Star They certainly seemed to represent a departure from the record Mr Quayle himself a former newspaper publisher and editor compiled in two terms in the House of Representatves Mr Quayle unseated Democratic Senator Birch Bayh in 1980 using the slogan A New Generation of Leadership During his first two years in the Senate his biggest problem seemed to be that he was regarded as a Robert Redford lookalike I started off thinking oh God Ive got this pretty young thing on my committee and he hasnt a brain in his head said a key aide to the Budget Committee on which Mr Quayle serves Hes turned out to be a lot tougher more thoughtful and independent than I thought he would be Conservative Republican Senator Orrin Hatch chairman of the Labor and Human Resources Committee sees Mr Quayle as a very effective hardworking guy who grabbed the unemployment issue and moved ahead with it But a Democrat on the Budget committee said I dont get the impression that hes a heavyweight yet The Senators conservatism has doubtless been tempered by the economic plight of his state where unemployment is higher than 12 percent If I were from a Sunbelt state I might have a different outlook he acknowledges The Federal Government has built the Sunbelt through dams and public works projects Now its our turn He insists that his political instincts remain conservative But he adds you accommodate to the times you find yourself in And he thinks Republicans risk the voters wrath if they dont take the initiative and deal with unemployment Even before the jobs program Mr Quayle displayed some independence from both his party and the Administration In his first year in the Senate he supported the Administrations drastic cuts in Comprehensive Employment and Training Assistance programs But he helped stave off cuts in youth job training programs which received 1 billion more than the President had asked The Senator also is a civil libertarian especially protective of the First Amendment Last year he sought unsuccessfully to narrow the criteria for prosecution under the Agents Identities Act which penalizes those who publish the names of American secret agents Conservatives are supposed to be for individual liberties he said They are also often expected to be hawkish on military spending issues But Senator Quayle a member of the Armed Services committee has called for reductions in the Presidents proposed military spending He says he has seen a marked decrease in public demand for military spending I was elected in 1980 by a strong defense constituency and unfortunately its not there today he said Finally Mr Quayle believes that his party must show as much concern for those at the bottom of the ladder as for those at the top The fairness issue is going to be the hidden issue in the 1984 elections he said The Republicans were elected to reverse priorities But if we dont do it fairly were not going to remain the governing party
IDEAS AND TRENDS; Courts Block Federal Rule on Contraceptives,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/20/weekinreview/ideas-and-trends-courts-block-federal-rule-on-contraceptives.html,The Reagan Administrations stated goal of fostering closer ties between parent and child may have been wellmeant but two Federal courts last week said the means regulations requiring federally funded clinics to notify parents if teenagers receive contraceptives were unlawful As a result of the regulations substantial numbers of adolescents will become pregnant and will either elect abortion or suffer the consequences of unwanted pregnancies said Judge Thomas A Flannery in Washington DC And that said Judge Henry F Werker in New York separately making the same point constitutes a blatant disregard for one of Congresss main purposes in providing Federal funds to combat the problems of teenage pregnancy Each court issued preliminary injunctions preventing the regulations from taking effect on schedule this Friday in more than 4100 clinics nationwide The Administration last week said it would appeal the New York ruling there was no decision on an appeal of the Washington case At issue is how to carry out the intent of Congress to stem the number of adolescent pregnancies while at the same time encouraging family participation in a youngsters decision concerning contraceptives About 450000 girls under age 18 become pregnant each year There is also a question of what Congress meant by encourage Most clinics say they fulfill that requirement by trying to persuade teenage clients to talk with their parents about contraceptive use Last year however the Reagan Administration said that encourage meant clinics themselves must notify parents or guardians within 10 days of giving teenagers under age 18 prescription contraceptives Exceptions would be granted only in cases where the teenager might suffer physical harm Without this notification said Richard S Schweiker then Secretary of Health and Human Services parents would not have a chance to participate MrSchweiker said parental notification did not mandate family involvement but facilitated it Judge Werker called the argument sophistry accepting instead statistical and medical documentation submitted by the New York State Department of Health that parental notification would deter adolescents from obtaining prescription contraceptives Recent studies support the notion that many teenagers will forgo contraception  but not sex  rather than let their parents know they are sexually active In 1979 and 1980 the Alan Guttmacher Institute a research organization financed by Planned Parenthood Federation of America surveyed 1200 unmarried minors receiving contraceptives at 53 familyplanning clinics across the country About 24 percent said they would stop using birth control methods if parental notification were mandated A recent study of 1200 teenagers in eight cities conducted by Johns Hopkins University found confidentiality the most important consideration in the choice of a clinic
Books Of The Times,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/22/books/books-of-the-times-246128.html,SECRETS On the Ethics of Concealment and Revelation By Sissela Bok 332 pages Pantheon Books 1695 WHAT could be more interesting than secrets It is one of the very purposes of secrets to inject some spice into our daily transactions they spur us to detection and seal delicious compacts we are provoked by the secrets of others and deploy them in the games  and the wars  we play But secrets of course are also a more serious matter As a metaphor for the obscurities of the human heart and for the incompleteness of our knowledge they have fascinated novelists to such an extent that one could speculate on their centrality to the novels structure one need only think of the grave and troubling secrets at the heart of novels from Great Expectations to The Portrait of a Lady or The Heart of Darkness For psychologists they are the signposts and sentry at the gate to the unconscious And in collective life  the professions or government  secrets are the currency and the armor of power But in her examination of the ethics of concealment and revelation Sissela Bok has written a book that oddly misses the complexity or the deeper implications of her subject Mrs Bok who has taught courses in ethics at Harvard writes as a practical philosopher Her aim here as in her first book Lying is to consider concrete moral problems and discuss the choices of how to act and how to shape ones conduct in private and public life when dealing with issues of secrecy and disclosure To bring the methods of philosophic discrimination to the problems of ordinary life is a commendable  and these days all too rare  enterprise Unfortunately Mrs Boks analysis especially in her discussions of personal secrecy is too general and often too obvious to advance our understanding much or throw new light on our perplexities In her chapters on secrecy in private life Mrs Bok mentions almost every idea associated with secrets  their role in the formation of identity the function of gossip the practices of some rather curious secret societies the patients relationship with the psychoanalyst  but she doesnt explore or bring a strong point of view to any of them Mrs Bok defines secrecy as intentional concealment and her attitude toward it is almost relentlessly rationalist and evenhanded In the private realm at least secrecy is necessary in some situations but harmful in others It is needed to protect identity plans action and property a rather odd collection of categories incidentally surely the ontological status in identity is not the same as that of plans but it can hamper the exercise of rational choice It may heighten a sense of equality and brotherhood among persons sharing the secret but it can fuel gross intolerance and hatred toward outsiders Given such alltoobalanced conclusions the ideal that Mrs Bok proposes is that we should be able to exercise control over concealment and openness and use our own discretion  or discernment  in deciding whether to tell or not to tell to probe others for information or to maintain respectful distance Such advice is sensible enough as far as it goes  but it doesnt go nearly far enough Aside from failing to give us much guidance for making choices in difficult situations and for a book of practical philosophy Secrets is surprisingly sparse in actual examples Mrs Boks descriptions never come to grips with what is emotionally vexing or for that matter meaningful to us about secrets There is no insight here into the compulsion to confess that Dostoyevsky knew so well about or of the burning of the secret unconfessed that so preoccupied Hawthorne  no awareness of the irrational conflicts the ambiguities or the doubleness of motives that secrets often portend To be sure Mrs Bok mentions such matters as theories of repression or dangers of forced disclosure  but she glosses over them so briefly and in such unmodulated tones that their import or her interpretation of them is quite lost on us Nor does she show much appreciation in this book for the fact that secrets are in part a social convention its of no small interest for example that we are more closemouthed these days about our salaries than about our love affairs and that our sense of sin shame taboo or reserve is largely dependent on the larger cultures values But without some examination of the specific contexts of secrecy or an inquiry into their inward significance for us her formulations remain empty and schematic  a kind of ethics in a vacuum Mrs Bok is more persuasive when she turns to secrecy in the public realm In these chapters she addresses such timely issues as professional confidentiality secrecy in science whistleblowing undercover police operations and the ethics of investigations by journalists and social scientists who conceal their identities On such questions she takes more definite though never absolutist positions  essentially against collective secrecy and for individual right to privacy Mrs Bok performs a useful service in alerting us to the growing pressures for governmental secrecy and to the excesses committed in the name of such principles as professional confidentiality she would presumably be highly critical of the American Bar Associations new Code of Ethics which requires lawyers to keep confidential their clients criminal intentions or the publics right to know investigative journalism can go too far she warns and involve unnecessary invasions of privacy Still even in these sections one wishes for a deeper analysis of causes as well as a dismantling of the official rationales for secrecy Some conflicts over confidentiality indicate shifting rifts and alignments in our society the debate about whether a doctor should tell the parents of a teenage girl that their daughter is planning an abortion for example involves our uncertainty about loyalties owed to the family And other battles over secrecy or acquisition of information are intractably conflicts over power professional ascendancy or privilege The limits on the Freedom of Information Act will surely depend partly on relative influence of various contending groups as much as on the moral arguments that anyone brings to the debate In underplaying such factors and calling for openness free debate and respect for the individual Sissela Bok invokes principles on which all reasonable people can agree  and which therefore dont sufficiently explain where the sources of the problems  or the passions  lie
TV: BIOGRAPHY OF FRANCES FARMER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/22/arts/tv-biography-of-frances-farmer.html,Suddenly it seems its Frances Farmer time The late actress whose life disintegrated into a pathetic public spectacle is now the subject of two film biographies Already released in theaters across the country Frances stars Jessica Lange whose performance has been nominated for an Academy Award as best actress Now tonight on CBSTV there is the television movie Will There Really Be a Morning with Susan Blakely playing the severely troubled woman Obviously the Frances Farmer story provides an actress with ample opportunities for demonstrating her acting range At the same time though the story is so unrelentingly ghastly so horrifyingly grim that one cannot help wondering if there is much point in its being told at all The television version with a script by Dalene Young is based on Miss Farmers autobiography completed shortly before she died in 1970 at the age of 56 Will There Really Be a Morning was a title taken from a poem by Emily Dickinson One of the premises never completely proved of this production is that Miss Farmer was an exceptionally sensitive woman whose talent was too precious to be squandered on mere Hollywood movies Because her writing abilities were smothered primarily by an ambitious publicitymad mother she became very difficult to control and work with In fact Will There Really Be a Morning sticks far closer to the facts of Miss Farmers life than the film Frances which is something of a scripting mess A fictious character played by Sam Shepard was invented in the film to pluck Miss Lange out of all sorts of terrible situations The relationship between Frances and her mother was brought into focus only half way through the film even though Miss Farmers autobiography stressed that from childhood on our relationship was strained and torn by strife  every encounter between us ended in screaming hysteria and slamming doors And the film leaves Frances lobotomized and vegetablelike which was not the case She went on creating havoc for herself and others for a good many years after that With the accomplished veteran Fielder Cook as director the television production tackles the character of the mother from the very opening scene in which we see Mama boisterously singing to a World War I bond rally while her shy little girl stands by watching her in awe and not a little fear As the years go by Mama remains the figure in control giving her defeated husband visiting rights only on weekends and keeping a tight rein on her daughters career She is played with fearsome strength by Lee Grant Meanwhile although delicate and somewhat otherworldly Frances is drawn into acting at the University of Seattle She also gets involved in leftist political causes and wins a free trip to Moscow where she is able to watch the famed Moscow Art Theater On her return trip she stops off in New York making contacts that will eventually result in her getting a leading role in the stage production of Clifford Odetss Golden Boy The character of Odets is played by John Heard a WASPish sort who doesnt bear the slightest physical resemblance to the playwright Odets is portrayed as the most obnoxious character in the entire story  pompous petulant deceiving vicious even sadistic In Hollywood Frances quickly becomes nervous edgy neurotic gaining a widespread reputation for being impossible She remains convinced that she is better than her material although the heights of her descriptive talents are suspiciously mundane As a woman I was plunging downhill to the depths of despair Urged on by Mama she marries a niceguy actor who is a total failure as a husband She takes to liquor and pills After a disastrous affair with Odets she drifts into sexual promiscuity Neither film mentions that she underwent several abortions When a minor drunkendriving incident makes national headlines Frances Farmer gets trapped in a series of situations that will lead to her being placed in an insane asylum for eight years and worse having her mother being made her legal guardian These are the years of ultimate horror that would color the rest of her days This CBS movie tries to end on an upbeat note Frances begins writing poems and says I had found my place  the beautiful sunlit morning for which I had waited so long Not so she would go through many more years of alcoholic terrors before finding some relief in 1968 in among other things her conversion to Catholicism Miss Blakely like Miss Lange provides a harrowing in many ways memorable performance Unlike Miss Lange she is not as prettily attractive as Frances Farmer but she fully captures the emotional turmoil of the woman She and Miss Grant whip up scenes of almost frenzied power In the end though it has to be remembered that the subject of all this energy is an actress who was never in the league of such contemporaries as Bette

"ASKEW, EX-GOVERNOR OF FLORIDA, TO SEEK PRESIDENTIAL NOMINATION",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/24/us/askew-ex-governor-of-florida-to-seek-presidential-nomination.html,Reubin O Askew a former twoterm Governor of Florida announced today that he was seeking the Democratic nomination for President in 1984 on a platform calling for a new union of labor and management to rebuild American industry At a news conference at the National Press Club Mr Askew said his experience in state government and as Special Trade Representative for President Carter qualifies me to lead this nation during this time of transition He conceded however that carrying the party convention would involve an uphill fight Without providing details other than some general allusions to sacrifice Mr Askew declared that as President I will challenge business and labor along with agriculture education and government to enter into a fundamentally new relationship a new union with one another and with all the American people The declaration put the former Governor into official competition with Senators Alan Cranston of California and Gary Hart of Colorado and former Vice President Walter F Mondale for the Democratic nomination Others whose announcements are expected shortly include Senators Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina Dale Bumpers of Arkansas and John Glenn of Ohio Outlook on Party Ticket Some Democratic leaders believe that Mr Askew is more realistically a candidate for the VicePresidential nomination on a ticket that might benefit from a Southerner with somewhat more conservative views than the standardbearer Mr Askew denied that he was a regional candidate but he noted that Democrats have not won the Presidency in modern times without the South While devoting most of his 18minute announcement to such concerns as international trade and the domestic economy Mr Askew was called upon to deal at his news conference with more sensitive social issues like abortion and homosexual rights Although he has been cited by the antiabortion movement as a righttolife advocate Mr Askew said he was opposed to a flat Constitutional ban on all abortion He said he supported termination of pregnancy where the mothers health or rape or incest was involved and favored the use of government funds for both abortion and birth control for the poor Mr Askew said he was taking a closer look at the issue of homosexual rights but was not willing to say that the subject fell in the same category as denial of civil rights There are some problems he observed A homosexual activist who distributed attacks on Mr Askew before the ceremony left the room at the request of the candidates staff and took up station in the National Press Building lobby Equal Rights Stand Some feminist critics have charged that Mr Askew should share responsibility for the failure of the Florida Legislature to approve the proposed Federal equal rights amendment but he said today the proposal should be part of a renewed national allegiance to social justice Mr Askew said the goals of his new union would include a domestic Marshall Plan to modernize and revitalize our vital industrial base and to assure the continued growth of advanced technologies Asked for a prospective price tag on such a program he said he favored spending whatever it takes As Mr Mondale and Senator Hart had already done Mr Askew pledged that he would not accept campaign contributions from political action committees the union and corporate groups that funnel funds of special interests to candidates Senators Cranston and Hollings have said they would continue to receive such donations
"IN JERSEY, A VOICE FOR WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/25/style/in-jersey-a-voice-for-women.html,A public advocate in government service is often caught between the pressures of politics and the call of conscience Soon Assemblywoman Joan R Wright of New Jersey is likely to learn this lesson A woman who has known both widowhood and divorce and a mother with four children and some newfound notions about the role of women in society Mrs Wright of Woodcliff Lake in Bergen County was confirmed yesterday by the New Jersey Senate as head of the states Division on Women During a recent interview at her legislative office in Emerson Mrs Wright a 44yearold firstterm assemblywoman talked about balancing a philosophy that incorporates feminist views and a political career as a loyal Republican I plan to go wherever I have to go in this state to raise peoples consiousness to the kinds of subtle and blatant discrimination against women that still exists she said Women and Politics Its tough for women to gain any political clout because we still lack money she continued The oldboy network still exists I think Im a feminist and feminine If women are going to be credible they have to have access You have to realize that decisions for the most part are being made by white males and if they are going to listen to a feminist point of view your demeanor has got to be a reasonable one All of this leaves her sounding like a Republican with a Democrats voice And yet her message is that most women defy political stereotypes We look at all Republican women as being like Phyllis Schlafly and all Democratic women as being like Bella Abzug Mrs Wright said The truth is most of us are somewhere in the middle The division she is to run was formed in 1974 It is a tiny agency with a modest budget and a large mission Eight employees and a director must carry out a mandate to serve the states 38 million women and must do it on 257000 a year The division serves as a clearinghouse for information and works with the network of womens groups and organizations in the state It provides referrals to various county and private agencies that run daycare support and counseling programs It organizes task forces and conferences to study legislation that affects women It addresses issues like sexual harassment And it runs a 24hour hot line that answers some 15000 calls a year The agency has been drifting and leaderless since May when its former director Clara Allen resigned to become a union official with the Communications Workers of America Late last year Governor Kean nominated Virginia Bell of Upper Saddle River to the post but she withdrew after her nomination ran into oppostion in the State Senate The delay in finding a director angered many women I was becomming more and more frustrated said Mrs Wright One day I said Im going to take the job myself This started a rumor and I thought Maybe it isnt such a bad move after all So I put my resume in and solicited support In her new 37000ayear post Mrs Wright in effect will become the chief spokesman for women in state government Her career and her rise to such a visible post followed a classic pattern She served as president of the Junior Womans Club of Westwood was elected to the Woodcliff Lake school board and town council ran an unsuccessful campaign for county freeholder and then in 1981 won a seat in the State Assembly Not long ago however she was financially dependent on my husband who was the head of the household and who made all the decisions she said Then in 1971 David K Wright died suddenly and Mrs Wright took over the operation of the familyowned heavy construction company She remarried in 1974 but that marrige ended in divorce I found that I had grown beyond that old takingcareof life style Mrs Wright said I was an individual in my own right This metamorphosis she said gives her a certain practical understanding for the her new job There are diverse womens groups out there she said You have NOW on one side and Junior Leaguers on the other who dont identify with the womens movement My message is No matter what their life is now it could change tomorrow morning Mrs Wright has supported the passage of proposed Federal equal rights amendment and supports Federal financing for abortions I absolutely hate the thought of abortion she said but after one is in that postion all women should have the opportunity to choose She also knows she will have to come to grips with a political philosophy that many women believe has hurt their cause Yes she said Im a Republican My party provides tools for people to do for themselves The Democrats provide programs and say Well do it for you Where I think the national Republican Party has gone too far is that it has taken away the tools But I guess well just have to learn to to do more with less

REAGAN'S NOMINEE BACKS COURT LIMIT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/26/us/reagan-s-nominee-backs-court-limit.html,Margaret M Heckler President Reagans nominee for Secretary of Health and Human Services hinted today that she might tolerate Congressional efforts to strip the Supreme Court of its power to decide cases involving certain issues such as abortion At her confirmation hearing before the Senate Finance Committee Mrs Heckler repeatedly declined to criticize such efforts being made by conservatives who oppose Supreme Court rulings on abortion school prayer and the use of busing to desegregate public schools Senators of both parties pleaded with Mrs Heckler to give some assurance that she would resist proposals to curtail the Courts power but she declined to do so Given her longstanding opposition to abortion she said it would be difficult for her to fight the proposals to limit the Courts jurisdiction over the issue But she said she wanted to study the legal issues further I have very little respect for the Roe v Wade decision she said referring to the 1973 Supreme Court decision that guaranteed women access to abortion I have read it extensively I cannot follow its legal reasoning Would Back Congress Vote Mrs Heckler a lawyer said that if a member of Congress wanted to reverse a Court decision interpreting the Constitution a constitutional amendment is the usual approach and that is a correct one But she said she would not foreclose other options such as passing a law to remove abortion from its jurisdiction which requires a simple majority vote in Congress A constitutional amendment by contrast requires approval by a twothirds vote of each house of Congress and takes effect only if ratified by Legislatures in threefourths of the states Mrs Heckler a former Representative from Massachusetts declined to give a direct reply to questions about the propriety of efforts to restrict the Supreme Courts jurisdiction But she said My own strong convictions on the right to life will dominate my own thinking She noted that she had consistently voted in favor of the prolife position Liberal senators engaged in a filibuster last year to block efforts to restrict the Supreme Courts authority Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon said today the efforts were a most dangerous ploy to undermine our form of government He said he was amazed that Mrs Heckler had not considered the issue more thoroughly Senator Max Baucus Democrat of Montana said the nominee seemed to be hiding behind the cloak of ambiguity Despite the sharp exchanges over abortion and the Supreme Court members of the Finance Committee said there was little doubt that Mrs Heckler would be confirmed by the Senate The committee chairman Senator Bob Dole of Kansas a Republican said the panel would vote Wednesday on the nominations of Mrs Heckler to be Secretary and John A Svahn to be Under Secretary of Health and Human Services Mr Svahn is now Commissioner of Social Security High Praise for President Mrs Heckler was lyrical in her praise of Mr Reagan saying she had never never admired a President so much Senator Dole said her comments sounded like a nominating speech and Mrs Heckler quickly replied that she hoped she would have a chance to nominate Mr Reagan for a second term Mr Dole who has Presidential aspirations of his own said drily We better get off that subject Mrs Heckler expressed no reservations about the rule that would require federally supported family planning clinics to notify parents when minors receive prescription contraceptives Two Federal judges in New York and Washington have blocked the rule saying it is illegal The Reagan Administration is appealing the decisions Mrs Heckler said that she would pursue the appeal because the rule embodied a policy set by the President As a member of Congress and cochairman of the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues Mrs Heckler last year urged the Administration to withdraw the rule But today she said My own prior views are personal views Mrs Heckler was defeated by a Democrat Representative Barney Frank in a race that put two incumbents against each other The 51yearold nominee was chosen six weeks ago to succeed Richard S Schweiker who resigned to become president of a trade association for the life insurance industry Mrs Heckler said that if confirmed she would be at least as loyal to the President as any other member of his Cabinet A study by Congressional Quarterly a weekly publication found that Mrs Heckler voted against the Presidents position more frequently than any other Republican member of the House last year Mrs Heckler said that in casting those votes she represented one Congressional district but that as Secretary she would serve the entire country
Twenty Years After 'The Feminine Mystique',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/27/books/twenty-years-after-the-feminine-mystique.html,It is 20 years now since The Feminine Mystique was published I am still awed by the revolution that book helped spark That I was able to put it together at the time it was needed is something of a mystery to me Even now women and men  stop me on the street to reminisce about where they were when they read it  I was in the maternity ward with my third kid and then I decided to go to law school I keep being surprised as the changes the womens movement set in motion continue to play themselves out in our lives  the enormous and mundane subtle and not so subtle delightful painful immediate farreaching paradoxical inexorable and probably irreversible changes in womens lives  and in mens Firewomen chairpersons housespouses the gender gap ms palimony takeout food women priests women rabbis women prime ministers womens studies womens history double burden dress for success assertiveness training male consciousness raising role strain role reversal networking sexism displaced homemakers equal pay for work of comparable value marriage contracts child custody for men first babies at 40 the twopaycheck family the singleparent family Victor Victoria Tootsie   Who could have predicted some of these changes Not I certainly Its hard enough for me both personally and politically to cope with the realities of our revolution as its daughters and sons take its terms for granted and face new problems new pressures new choices and conflicts and express the need for new dreams Its hard to go on evolving as we all must when some who now follow or fight or study or seek power within this revolution seem to want to lock it in place forever as an unchanging ism Early this year I fled to Harvard as a fellow at the Institute of Politics of the Kennedy School of Government pursuing with relief a new scholarly quest retreating or so I thought from feminist power struggles disheartened less by the attacks of our acknowledged enemies than by the fury of some of my sister feminists over the position I took in my book The Second Stage I said the womens movement had to move anew that the feminine mystique which defined women only as husbands wife childrens mother server of the familys physical needs and never as person had been transcended I said that we had come about as far as we could with the male model of equity and that now we needed a model encompassing female experience and female values which men are beginning to share Thesis antithesis synthesis as Karl Marx said As our revolution converges on larger economic upheavals I said we must come to new terms with family and with work Some didnt like my saying that Well we are in the second stage now whether or not anyone wants to admit it And I am still a feminist But I am sick and tired of the new spate of pronouncements claiming that the womens movement is finished and the revolution is lost because the postfeminist generation is moving from a different place Of course the postfeminist generation is in a different place The womens movement put them there Their mothers were the ones who rejected the feminine mystique and went back to school and went to work and otherwise started to change their lives 20 years ago I as a feminist do not find it a cause for grief that this new generation simply takes the personhood of women for granted If they take womens rights and the opportunities we fought for too much for granted if they are worried now about jobs difficult choices about having children how to pay for a house with or without two incomes and double burdens they cant refuse now even if sometimes theyd like to  its a mark of how far our revolution has come and a summons to its own next stage As far as Im concerned the daughters have to move on they dont have to say Thank you  though its nice when they do Its also nice that so many now study womens history in college even in high school But I am impatient to get those womens studies integrated into history into every subject from grade school on I still remember how surprised I was taking the bus in from my suburban dream house in Rockland County to the New York Public Library when I was writing my book 20odd years ago to uncover the womens history that had been so buried by the feminine mystique in the 1940s and 50s Mary Wollstonecraft Elizabeth Cady Stanton Margaret Fuller Lucy Stone Susan B Anthony and Charlotte Perkins Gilman women whom most educated women like myself had never studied Will our memory be buried in another generation as theirs was Will some future greatgranddaughter have to invent feminism once more from scratch I doubt it Emily my own daughter the doctor went from taking it all for granted in college Im not a feminist Im a person Its not necessary to fight for women anymore to fervent feminism after one year in medical school There are so many of us now they dont dare do it openly the way they used to Its worse now that its so subtle But its not worse that women are 30 percent of the medicalschool class rather than 3 percent After organizing the women in her medical school on the unfinished business of sex discrimination my daughter began to concern herself with fundamental issues as to the practice of medicine itself and her own life She has decided to go into family practice dealing with the patient as a whole person in the concrete family setting not as a specimen of isolated symptoms Her current problem has to do with 800 miles of distance between her hospital residency and his Neither of them would consider asking that the other sacrifice his or her own goals for the sake of their relationship which somehow survives the obstacles of distance and time y daughterinlaw Helen is technically at the moment a housewife The baby was not exactly planned There were difficult choices to be made since both she and Jonathan my younger son had just finished college after having dropped out for some years One day last summer when theyd brought the baby out to my house in Sag Harbor Helen overheard me on the phone discussing how to stop new attacks on the Supreme Court decision asserting womens right to legal medical abortion The right to abortion is very important to me said this postfeminist mother nursing her baby Its important knowing that we had the baby because we chose to It makes a big difference I relish their mutual joy their new confident maturity and sense of themselves in their chosen parenthood which Jonathan truly shares Watching him skillfully maneuver Rafael into his snowsuit and throw him over his shoulder into the backpack I sense he gets at least as much of his male identity from being a father as from being an engineer But Helen is unmistakably the mother She does not let any male doctorasGod tell her what to do with her baby the way we let Dr Spock instruct us She does not apologize for sometimes being bored out of my gourd in this hiatus during which she concentrates on mothering The choices in themselves seem to create a new sense of values and of self in such a postfeminist woman And I as grandmother at last am the envy of my friends whose doctorlawyerbanker daughters are too caught up in their careers to consider babies With my beautiful incredible grandbaby  such a beaming bright bundle of energy smiling at me with his fathers big ears and dimples and his own deep blue eyes so familiar so intensely alive so awesome a miracle  I exult in the generation of life though Ive been too busy this year to babysit much This year a number of my family of friends had their first babies at 35 at 40 some undergoing rather scary unexpected complications at birth Other friends made me fear for their sanity as they suddenly became obsessed in their mid40s after 20 years of brilliant careers with the wish to have a child Again and again in Cambridge or California one or another notsoyoung woman would ask my advice about having a baby by myself I would reply that it seemed to me difficult enough and costly enough to bring up a child with two parents But the power of this desire to have a child  when women no longer need to have a child to define themselves as women  seems to be as great as or even greater than ever Choice has liberated an exultant mother choice has also liberated women to be generative in other ways Gloria Steinem for instance and Germaine Greer have been fine role models for that pattern But there is unfinished business here for many women Now that economic necessity dictates that most women must continue to work after they become mothers  nearly one out of two married women with children under 6 now works compared with 19 percent in 1960 and nearly twothirds of married women with children over 6 work  someone is going to have to battle in a new and serious way for institutions that will help the new family Imaginative thinking should be done about maternity leave paternity leave time off for parents when their children are sick parental sabbaticals reduced schedules flextime job sharing and childcare supports that dont now exist But who will take up this battle and how in a time when jobs themselves are so scarce that people must take what they can get when budgets for social programs that already exist are being cut down It is crucial for feminists to understand the power of the choice to have children and to keep fighting for the right to abortion But they must give new priority to a childcare crusade and to restructuring work If these issues are not addressed soon we can fear a new feminine mystique invoked to send women home again to have babies instead of competing for dwindling jobs During this time of recessiondepression President Reagan who has declared a new campaign against abortion has also suggested that there wouldnt be as much unemployment if women would stop looking for jobs After the elections in 1982 political analysts finally began to take seriously the gender gap though it had been building for some years a reaction in part to the Administrations attitudes toward the equal rights amendment and abortion Month after month women had been indicating their sharp disapproval of President Reagan The latest Gallup poll found that just 36 percent of women approved of Reagans job performance compared with 47 percent of men The gender gap seemed to be based on womens greater outrage at Reaganomics and a national budget that destroyed services essential to the old the poor to children students the handicapped and the environment while increasing billions were shoveled into nuclear missiles The human suffering caused by high unemployment seemed particularly galling to women It didnt matter that Ed Koch in his New York gubernatorial race said the proper words about womens rights when he had been so opportunistic about Reaganomics It did not matter that Margaret M Heckler and Millicent Fenwick were women and had been for the ERA when they went along with Reagan in 1982 they were defeated Political analysts now agree that women were crucial to the election of Mario M Cuomo as Governor of New York and to the defeat or near defeat in Texas New Jersey Missouri and elsewhere of favorites who had been insensitive to womens basic concerns At any rate it is clear now that womens rights and womens issues are no longer minor political items worth a patronizing sentence on the sixth page of the political speech or tea and cookies in the Rose Garden President Reagan has just named two women to the Cabinet  Elizabeth H Dole as Secretary of Transportation and Margaret Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Services Getting into position for 1984 Democrats often begin their speeches with passionate pledges to equal rights With the gender gap a Democratic aide said to me recently issues like child care could be politically sexy in 84 Indeed this month an extraordinary meeting of leaders of womens groups church groups unions and civilrights organizations was held in New York City to plan a childcare crusade for 1983 ERA was reintroduced in Congress this year and I say there will be an equal rights amendment to the Constitution by the end of the decade after we get the Government turned around A few months ago I was invited to Rome by women leaders of the ruling Christian Democratic Party The idea was to speak to them and to leading Italian feminist Socialist and Communist women about The Second Stage which had just come out in Italy But I dont think they had really read it Evidently the Christian Democrats realized they had made a big political mistake by supporting a referendum that would have taken away Italian womens right to abortion The referendum was overwhelmingly defeated and now it appeared I was being brought over to show a conciliatory position toward feminism Someone must have told them I believed in the family To my horror I heard them introducing me as a repentant feminist femminista pentita I had to clear that up of course I had to go back to the feminine mystique and that necessary wonderful first stage of womens liberation in Italy when they had marched in the thousands and voted in the millions for womens right to divorce and to abortion In their country as in mine I said reactionary forces were still trying to take those rights away as their abortion referendum demonstrated Of course I said I respect those who out of religious or other personal conviction would not choose to use that right The value is life I said The life of the woman and the right of the child to be wanted in life Abortion is simply a necessity for some when birth control fails But that issue is behind you now as I hope it will be soon for us I continued We must all move into the second stage where we face new problems of economic survival personal survival and family survival We must be able to surmount the dangers of nuclear war terrorism and economic chaos We must continue to be able to choose to bear children I dont know if thats what the Christian Democrats quite expected The other feminist leaders present the Socialist and Communist women seemed to pick up my secondstage suggestions about the need for new childcare supports and new kinds of communal housing for working parents and for those divorced or widowed men and women who now live too much alone I went from Rome to Paris where Yvette Roudy who originally translated The Feminine Mystique into French is now President Mitterrands Minister for Womens Rights She is no token under secretary but holds a full cabinet ministry for womens affairs Yvette described her efforts in all the regions and departments of France to protect womens rights in jobs education marriage and divorce and to give them training for new nontraditional work As we walked through the lofty arches of the splendid building that houses her ministry I was proudly shown a gallery of honor where after Colette and Susan B Anthony there was a largerthanlife portrait that was supposed to be me Thats not me I said The artist had painted us all to be pretty Like taking the warts off Napoleons nose Oh well Is this new burst of womens power in France and Italy merely a belated epilogue to that same womens movement that they say has crested and is on its way out over here or a preview of greater power to come The fact is that women are given credit for having put Mitterrand in power in France as we did Cuomo in New York State Im worried now about the new polarizations hinted at by recent polls cutting across the gender gap as sharp differences emerge between the married and the unmarried those with children and with none the young and the old the ones with jobs and the unemployed While the new census shows that in the 1980s the great majority of young adult Americans will marry and remarry and that they will have children within marriage they are having fewer children and having themlater than they used to And 10 percent of young adults will never marry a 100 percent increase over the 1970 rate There is also a 100 percent increase in singleparent households nine out of 10 of which are headed by women A fourth of all households now contain no children Nonfamily households have risen by 89 percent But the number of divorces seems to be leveling off at about 50 percent The need or the choice to marry or to remain married takes on new existential and economic importance for women as for men For families in poverty today tend primarily to be those headed by women followed by those headed by men where there is no second income But the fact that women earn only 59 cents for every dollar men earn still cuts through the illusion of equality Will the married be the new elite and those living alone the underclass Will men and women who make that cherished costly choice to have children become the second class while the singleminded take power How can the tradeoffs within marriage be measured He makes more than she does but he feels less strain now because hes no longer carrying it all She makes less but also feels less stress if she is just helping She feels bitter if he is laid off and she has to carry the whole breadwinning burden as well as take care of the house and kids He certainly doesnt spend as much time on housework and the kids as she does he doesnt feel that responsibility for the kids that a mother never quite escapes But how much of that power does she really want to give up Now that weve broken through those rigidly polarized male and female sex roles will we settle for a diversity of patterns of sharing among women and men Am I wrong to try to redefine our concept of family to link the interests of the old and single with the needs of those in their childbearing years Those who cant afford to stop working at 60 or 65 might welcome jobs that wouldnt demand a rigid 9to5 schedule The option of shorter hours would not solve the unemployment problem but it would provide more jobs for more people My friends now in their 50s and 60s who fought the battles  the first woman to have a seat on the stock

and became labor arbitrators the women passed over for corporate promotion university tenure or union leadership who brought and won classaction suits are facing now the frontiers of age There are new questions to be asked beyond success beyond marriage and divorce as we face husbands strokes and retirement and our years to come living alone Those are the questions that are now my personal and professional concern Feelings of deja vu wash over me as I hear geriatric experts talk about the aged with the same patronizing compassionate denial of their personhood that I heard when experts talked about women 20 years ago Much is being said among American women today about the strange dearth of vital men I go into a town to lecture and I hear about all the wonderful dynamic women who have emerged in every field in that town But frequently whatever the age of the woman she says There dont seem to be any men The men seem so dull and gray now Theyre dreary theyre flat they complain theyre tired And if theyre my age theyre dead That women are now living so much longer and aging more vitally than men has wide ramifications The latest census figures show that American women have a life expectancy of 778 compared with 699 for American men  an eightyear difference compared with just two years in 1900 and five in 1950 Despite all the gloomy predictions women are not succumbing to mens patterns of Type A stress and heart attack ulcers and premature death as they take on jobs in business and professions Despite the phase of dressing for success and courses that taught women how to be more like men to get into the executive suite women dont seem to be falling into the superwoman trap so easily anymore They are even spending less time on housework new studies show On the contrary data just published by Rosalind Barnett and Grace Baruch of the Wellesley Center for Research on Women show that women between the ages of 35 and 55 who combine work marriage and motherhood do the best of all women in their age group in general psychological wellbeing They have more control over their lives which now seems essential to health they are able to satisfy their needs for achievement and mastery as well as for pleasure and intimacy And these women do not show depression deterioration or traumatic crises at midlife and beyond as much as women used to and men still do Women are not beginning to die like men As a matter of fact Ive just been asked to address the Western Gerontological Association this spring on Why Cant Men Age More Like Women The very terms of human achievement of moral values and mental development have up until now been defined by men and measured in terms of male experience The highest peak of moral development was some abstract concept of justice in terms of which philosophers and psychologists from Plato to Freud and beyond found women wanting In 1971 a Harvard psychologist named Carol Gilligan began measuring women and men according to a scale based on female experience as well as male and found a level of moral development beyond abstract justice The research translated and tested the abstract concept of justice against the concrete experience of daily life in its actual human complexity On this scale women reached levels of moral development men did not seem even to conceive of In a Different Voice she called the book that resulted from the study What new dimensions will emerge in every field as women begin to find that different voice their own voice and use it in medicine law theology architecture in all the arts and all the sciences I got a curious insight into all this during my year as a fellow at Harvard I immersed myself for one in the study of evolution for I became increasingly convinced that breaking through the feminine mystique and the womens movement for equality and this second stage as female values begin to be shared by the male is not really a revolution at all but simply a stage in human evolution necessary for survival In that bastion of male excellence Harvard women were now admitted on equal terms with men if not yet in equal numbers During my year there I was asked to meet with the women at the law school women medical students and interns the womens group at the divinity and architecture schools These women were awesome in their competence but they made me uneasy They seemed too neat somehow too controlled constricted almost subdued and slightly juiceless A dean of one of the professional schools said We take in the most brilliant women of course Their record of achievement is breathtaking as are their scores on the admission tests But for some reason they dont do as well as they should when they get here Can you explain it Not without interviewing them I said but I have a hunch its because your structures  your whole ambiance  is so masculine it alienates them somehow though they might not be aware of it Something around here must not elicit the best of female energy But if thats so youd better find it out Because its also having an influence on the men that may not be conducive to the kind of leadership needed now So just before I left I ran a seminar on Masculinism at Harvard sponsored by the Institute of Politics The seminar made Harvard officials so nervous that it was closed to the public and the press Women and a few men raised questions about the viciously competitive adversary models they were learning in their case studies and whether in fact a different voice was needed now in law in business and in medicine Among the men mainly it was the wise old professors like David Riesman and David McClelland and some of the young professors like Stephen Gould who seem to be wise in a new way who wanted to talk about such things But the women who had seemed to me so strangely subdued kept nodding their heads They knew exactly what it was  masculinism and maybe even what it was doing to them It is not easy for a woman to transcend or question the masculinism of a powerful successful male institution The first women there will necessarily try to succeed according to the male model For women may have to reach a point of critical mass in any institution to raise that different voice and the institution may have to face its own critical crisis to hear it It is not easy to question the masculinism of a powerful and succesful nation until perhaps its most thoughtful men and women sense that it may be coming too close to economic collapse or nuclear extinction for such questions not to be asked The political gender gap surfaced first among women on the basic issue of war and peace But there were a lot of men among the halfmillion people who marched in Central Park last year for the nuclear freeze At the first NOW convention after the defeat of the ERA in Indianapolis in October 1982 the foremothers were asking each other which issue would emerge next to mobilize womens passions Ive heard this kind of thing often in these last months from thoughtful students from tired women and even from men all people looking at the wreckage of their own beleaguered movements  liberal politics civil rights labor the environment  and wondering where the kind of lifechanging political passion that has fueled the womens movement these last years will come from next What will be the issue Equal pay for work of comparable value Child care Displaced homemakers Rape Lesbian rights Discrimination in Social Security in pensions So diverse have the choices and patterns of womens lives become that there is no single issue now that could hold us all together as firmly as the battle for our constitutional equal rights Now that womens rights are in danger and womens outrage has taken concrete political form that issue is no longer a separate womens issue It is now an issue that can elect a President it is an issue that the major political parties are now sprinting to catch up with Im not sure there is or has to be a separate single womens issue in the next stage I think womens most basic issues now converge on mens the basic issues of war and peace and economic survival of quality of life for young and old But when that different voice now emerging from women in politics and other fields also begins to be heard from men it will become a different politics Are men changing Those young men like my son who carry their little babies so proudly in their backpacks to the supermarket Those men now suffering the midlife crises Men must change They must develop the flexibility and sensitivity to their own feelings and the feelings of others  the attunement to life that has been considered up to now feminine Crazy Well who would have thought that the biggest movie hit of 1983 would be a picture called Tootsie in which a male actor impersonates a woman so he can get a part as a hospital administrator in a soap opera and becomes a better man as a woman And men love it and so do women even though some doctrinaire feminists claim its macho for a man to make a hit playing a woman But then the women say pointedly Dustin Hoffman was much more attractive as a woman than when he went back to being a man as if the only choice was between macho and wimp Actually the sensitivity he acquired sharing womans experience made him a much better stronger more tender man It was a wonderful hearteasing surprising movie And not a snigger in it Somethow putting together the male and female halves of our being seemed to clean up the sexual act We have clearly now broken through and beyond the masculine mystique for man and woman to find such hilarious joyous adventure in being a woman Which is not the same thing at all as going back to the feminine mystique It is the next clue in the human mystery
HEADLINERS; The Sister Stays Put,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/27/weekinreview/headliners-the-sister-stays-put.html,Sister Agnes Mary Mansour protested too little in the view of Archbishop Edmund Szoka of Detroit Archbishop Szoka last week demanded that Sister Mansour resign her post as head of Michigans state welfare agency because she was insufficiently vigorous in opposing state payments for abortions He also called on her order the Sisters of Mercy to determine if she was violating the teachings of the church But Sister Mansour who has often voiced opposition to abortion showed no sign of giving up her post and her order said she remained a member in good standing
TWENTY YEARS AFTER THE FEMININE MYSTIQUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/27/magazine/twenty-years-after-the-feminine-mystique.html,It is 20 years now since The Feminine Mystique was published I am still awed by the revolution that book helped spark That I was able to put it together at the time it was needed is something of a mystery to me Even now women and men  stop me on the street to reminisce about where they were when they read it  I was in the maternity ward with my third kid and then I decided to go to law school I keep being surprised as the changes the womens movement set in motion continue to play themselves out in our lives  the enormous and mundane subtle and not so subtle delightful painful immediate farreaching paradoxical inexorable and probably irreversible changes in womens lives  and in mens Firewomen chairpersons housespouses the gender gap ms palimony takeout food women priests women rabbis women prime ministers womens studies womens history double burden dress for success assertiveness training male consciousness raising role strain role reversal networking sexism displaced homemakers equal pay for work of comparable value marriage contracts child custody for men first babies at 40 the twopaycheck family the singleparent family Victor Victoria Tootsie   Who could have predicted some of these changes Not I certainly Its hard enough for me both personally and politically to cope with the realities of our revolution as its daughters and sons take its terms for granted and face new problems new pressures new choices and conflicts and express the need for new dreams Its hard to go on evolving as we all must when some who now follow or fight or study or seek power within this revolution seem to want to lock it in place forever as an unchanging ism Early this year I fled to Harvard as a fellow at the Institute of Politics of the Kennedy School of Government pursuing with relief a new scholarly quest retreating or so I thought from feminist power struggles disheartened less by the attacks of our acknowledged enemies than by the fury of some of my sister feminists over the position I took in my book The Second Stage I said the womens movement had to move anew that the feminine mystique which defined women only as husbands wife childrens mother server of the familys physical needs and never as person had been transcended I said that we had come about as far as we could with the male model of equity and that now we needed a model encompassing female experience and female values which men are beginning to share Thesis antithesis synthesis as Karl Marx said As our revolution converges on larger economic upheavals I said we must come to new terms with family and with work Some didnt like my saying that Well we are in the second stage now whether or not anyone wants to admit it And I am still a feminist But I am sick and tired of the new spate of pronouncements claiming that the womens movement is finished and the revolution is lost because the postfeminist generation is moving from a different place Of course the postfeminist generation is in a different place The womens movement put them there Their mothers were the ones who rejected the feminine mystique and went back to school and went to work and otherwise started to change their lives 20 years ago I as a feminist do not find it a cause for grief that this new generation simply takes the personhood of women for granted If they take womens rights and the opportunities we fought for too much for granted if they are worried now about jobs difficult choices about having children how to pay for a house with or without two incomes and double burdens they cant refuse now even if sometimes theyd like to  its a mark of how far our revolution has come and a summons to its own next stage As far as Im concerned the daughters have to move on they dont have to say Thank you  though its nice when they do Its also nice that so many now study womens history in college even in high school But I am impatient to get those womens studies integrated into history into every subject from grade school on I still remember how surprised I was taking the bus in from my suburban dream house in Rockland County to the New York Public Library when I was writing my book 20odd years ago to uncover the womens history that had been so buried by the feminine mystique in the 1940s and 50s Mary Wollstonecraft Elizabeth Cady Stanton Margaret Fuller Lucy Stone Susan B Anthony and Charlotte Perkins Gilman women whom most educated women like myself had never studied Will our memory be buried in another generation as theirs was Will some future greatgranddaughter have to invent feminism once more from scratch I doubt it Emily my own daughter the doctor went from taking it all for granted in college Im not a feminist Im a person Its not necessary to fight for women anymore to fervent feminism after one year in medical school There are so many of us now they dont dare do it openly the way they used to Its worse now that its so subtle But its not worse that women are 30 percent of the medicalschool class rather than 3 percent After organizing the women in her medical school on the unfinished business of sex discrimination my daughter began to concern herself with fundamental issues as to the practice of medicine itself and her own life She has decided to go into family practice dealing with the patient as a whole person in the concrete family setting not as a specimen of isolated symptoms Her current problem has to do with 800 miles of distance between her hospital residency and his Neither of them would consider asking that the other sacrifice his or her own goals for the sake of their relationship which somehow survives the obstacles of distance and time y daughterinlaw Helen is technically at the moment a housewife The baby was not exactly planned There were difficult choices to be made since both she and Jonathan my younger son had just finished college after having dropped out for some years One day last summer when theyd brought the baby out to my house in Sag Harbor Helen overheard me on the phone discussing how to stop new attacks on the Supreme Court decision asserting womens right to legal medical abortion The right to abortion is very important to me said this postfeminist mother nursing her baby Its important knowing that we had the baby because we chose to It makes a big difference I relish their mutual joy their new confident maturity and sense of themselves in their chosen parenthood which Jonathan truly shares Watching him skillfully maneuver Rafael into his snowsuit and throw him over his shoulder into the backpack I sense he gets at least as much of his male identity from being a father as from being an engineer But Helen is unmistakably the mother She does not let any male doctorasGod tell her what to do with her baby the way we let Dr Spock instruct us She does not apologize for sometimes being bored out of my gourd in this hiatus during which she concentrates on mothering The choices in themselves seem to create a new sense of values and of self in such a postfeminist woman And I as grandmother at last am the envy of my friends whose doctorlawyerbanker daughters are too caught up in their careers to consider babies With my beautiful incredible grandbaby  such a beaming bright bundle of energy smiling at me with his fathers big ears and dimples and his own deep blue eyes so familiar so intensely alive so awesome a miracle  I exult in the generation of life though Ive been too busy this year to babysit much This year a number of my family of friends had their first babies at 35 at 40 some undergoing rather scary unexpected complications at birth Other friends made me fear for their sanity as they suddenly became obsessed in their mid40s after 20 years of brilliant careers with the wish to have a child Again and again in Cambridge or California one or another notsoyoung woman would ask my advice about having a baby by myself I would reply that it seemed to me difficult enough and costly enough to bring up a child with two parents But the power of this desire to have a child  when women no longer need to have a child to define themselves as women  seems to be as great as or even greater than ever Choice has liberated an exultant mother choice has also liberated women to be generative in other ways Gloria Steinem for instance and Germaine Greer have been fine role models for that pattern But there is unfinished business here for many women Now that economic necessity dictates that most women must continue to work after they become mothers  nearly one out of two married women with children under 6 now works compared with 19 percent in 1960 and nearly twothirds of married women with children over 6 work  someone is going to have to battle in a new and serious way for institutions that will help the new family Imaginative thinking should be done about maternity leave paternity leave time off for parents when their children are sick parental sabbaticals reduced schedules flextime job sharing and childcare supports that dont now exist But who will take up this battle and how in a time when jobs themselves are so scarce that people must take what they can get when budgets for social programs that already exist are being cut down It is crucial for feminists to understand the power of the choice to have children and to keep fighting for the right to abortion But they must give new priority to a childcare crusade and to restructuring work If these issues are not addressed soon we can fear a new feminine mystique invoked to send women home again to have babies instead of competing for dwindling jobs During this time of recessiondepression President Reagan who has declared a new campaign against abortion has also suggested that there wouldnt be as much unemployment if women would stop looking for jobs After the elections in 1982 political analysts finally began to take seriously the gender gap though it had been building for some years a reaction in part to the Administrations attitudes toward the equal rights amendment and abortion Month after month women had been indicating their sharp disapproval of President Reagan The latest Gallup poll found that just 36 percent of women approved of Reagans job performance compared with 47 percent of men The gender gap seemed to be based on womens greater outrage at Reaganomics and a national budget that destroyed services essential to the old the poor to children students the handicapped and the environment while increasing billions were shoveled into nuclear missiles The human suffering caused by high unemployment seemed particularly galling to women It didnt matter that Ed Koch in his New York gubernatorial race said the proper words about womens rights when he had been so opportunistic about Reaganomics It did not matter that Margaret M Heckler and Millicent Fenwick were women and had been for the ERA when they went along with Reagan in 1982 they were defeated Political analysts now agree that women were crucial to the election of Mario M Cuomo as Governor of New York and to the defeat or near defeat in Texas New Jersey Missouri and elsewhere of favorites who had been insensitive to womens basic concerns At any rate it is clear now that womens rights and womens issues are no longer minor political items worth a patronizing sentence on the sixth page of the political speech or tea and cookies in the Rose Garden President Reagan has just named two women to the Cabinet  Elizabeth H Dole as Secretary of Transportation and Margaret Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Services Getting into position for 1984 Democrats often begin their speeches with passionate pledges to equal rights With the gender gap a Democratic aide said to me recently issues like child care could be politically sexy in 84 Indeed this month an extraordinary meeting of leaders of womens groups church groups unions and civilrights organizations was held in New York City to plan a childcare crusade for 1983 ERA was reintroduced in Congress this year and I say there will be an equal rights amendment to the Constitution by the end of the decade after we get the Government turned around A few months ago I was invited to Rome by women leaders of the ruling Christian Democratic Party The idea was to speak to them and to leading Italian feminist Socialist and Communist women about The Second Stage which had just come out in Italy But I dont think they had really read it Evidently the Christian Democrats realized they had made a big political mistake by supporting a referendum that would have taken away Italian womens right to abortion The referendum was overwhelmingly defeated and now it appeared I was being brought over to show a conciliatory position toward feminism Someone must have told them I believed in the family To my horror I heard them introducing me as a repentant feminist femminista pentita I had to clear that up of course I had to go back to the feminine mystique and that necessary wonderful first stage of womens liberation in Italy when they had marched in the thousands and voted in the millions for womens right to divorce and to abortion In their country as in mine I said reactionary forces were still trying to take those rights away as their abortion referendum demonstrated Of course I said I respect those who out of religious or other personal conviction would not choose to use that right The value is life I said The life of the woman and the right of the child to be wanted in life Abortion is simply a necessity for some when birth control fails But that issue is behind you now as I hope it will be soon for us I continued We must all move into the second stage where we face new problems of economic survival personal survival and family survival We must be able to surmount the dangers of nuclear war terrorism and economic chaos We must continue to be able to choose to bear children I dont know if thats what the Christian Democrats quite expected The other feminist leaders present the Socialist and Communist women seemed to pick up my secondstage suggestions about the need for new childcare supports and new kinds of communal housing for working parents and for those divorced or widowed men and women who now live too much alone I went from Rome to Paris where Yvette Roudy who originally translated The Feminine Mystique into French is now President Mitterrands Minister for Womens Rights She is no token under secretary but holds a full cabinet ministry for womens affairs Yvette described her efforts in all the regions and departments of France to protect womens rights in jobs education marriage and divorce and to give them training for new nontraditional work As we walked through the lofty arches of the splendid building that houses her ministry I was proudly shown a gallery of honor where after Colette and Susan B Anthony there was a largerthanlife portrait that was supposed to be me Thats not me I said The artist had painted us all to be pretty Like taking the warts off Napoleons nose Oh well Is this new burst of womens power in France and Italy merely a belated epilogue to that same womens movement that they say has crested and is on its way out over here or a preview of greater power to come The fact is that women are given credit for having put Mitterrand in power in France as we did Cuomo in New York State Im worried now about the new polarizations hinted at by recent polls cutting across the gender gap as sharp differences emerge between the married and the unmarried those with children and with none the young and the old the ones with jobs and the unemployed While the new census shows that in the 1980s the great majority of young adult Americans will marry and remarry and that they will have children within marriage they are having fewer children and having themlater than they used to And 10 percent of young adults will never marry a 100 percent increase over the 1970 rate There is also a 100 percent increase in singleparent households nine out of 10 of which are headed by women A fourth of all households now contain no children Nonfamily households have risen by 89 percent But the number of divorces seems to be leveling off at about 50 percent The need or the choice to marry or to remain married takes on new existential and economic importance for women as for men For families in poverty today tend primarily to be those headed by women followed by those headed by men where there is no second income But the fact that women earn only 59 cents for every dollar men earn still cuts through the illusion of equality Will the married be the new elite and those living alone the underclass Will men and women who make that cherished costly choice to have children become the second class while the singleminded take power How can the tradeoffs within marriage be measured He makes more than she does but he feels less strain now because hes no longer carrying it all She makes less but also feels less stress if she is just helping She feels bitter if he is laid off and she has to carry the whole breadwinning burden as well as take care of the house and kids He certainly doesnt spend as much time on housework and the kids as she does he doesnt feel that responsibility for the kids that a mother never quite escapes But how much of that power does she really want to give up Now that weve broken through those rigidly polarized male and female sex roles will we settle for a diversity of patterns of sharing among women and men Am I wrong to try to redefine our concept of family to link the interests of the old and single with the needs of those in their childbearing years Those who cant afford to stop working at 60 or 65 might welcome jobs that wouldnt demand a rigid 9to5 schedule The option of shorter hours would not solve the unemployment problem but it would provide more jobs for more people My friends now in their 50s and 60s who fought the battles  the first woman to have a seat on the stock exchange the first female network vice president the first executive vice president of a major advertising agency the nun who became a college president the housewives who survived their own divorces and became labor arbitrators the women passed over for corporate promotion university tenure or union leadership who brought and won classaction suits are facing now the frontiers of age There are new questions to be asked beyond success beyond marriage and divorce as we face husbands strokes and retirement and our years to come living alone Those are the questions that are now my personal and

PANEL URGES PREPARATIONS TO MEET BIG DEMAND FOR GENETIC SCREENING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/02/28/us/panel-urges-preparations-to-meet-big-demand-for-genetic-screening.html,A Presidential ethics commission urged the nation today to prepare counseling services and make other arrangements to meet a likely huge demand for genetic screening tests to determine whether parents are likely to have defective children Before the end of the century the commission predicted genetic screening and counseling are certain to become major components in both public health and individual medical care The time can already be envisioned it said when all information about a persons abnormal genes and chromosomes will be readily accessible The commission said genetic screening raised important ethical and legal concerns about who should have access to the tests and the information the tests reveal whether tests should be voluntary or compulsory and what the tests should be used for It threw its moral weight against using genetic tests to choose the sex of a child or produce a superhealthy race of people Up to now genetic screening has been used sometimes to test newborn infants for a few rare genetic diseases or to screen selected population groups like Jews or blacks for specific genetic conditions that afflict them more often than the general population But the commission predicted that a screening test for the most prevalent lethal inherited disease cystic fibrosis would be in hand by the end of the 1980s thus making possible a new program of mass genetic screening of vast proportions Various tests might be used on prospective parents pregnant women or newborn infants depending on scientific advances and practical considerations Just how they will be administered and who will pay for them are problems that remain to be worked out More and Better Tests Cystic fibrosis afflicts about one in every 1800 newborn babies it damages the lungs and digestive system and generally kills its victims before they reach the age of 20 A screening program primarily for whites of reproductive age the group at highest risk of bearing infants with the disease could conceivably require tens of millions of tests in a short period The commission called such a task daunting in itself and warned that it is merely the harbinger of a still greater demand that will inevitably develop as scientists devise more and better tests to determine personal susceptibility to particular disorders or to the risk of passing them on to offspring The recommendations were set forth in a report titled Screening and Counseling for Genetic Conditions issued for release Monday by the Presidents Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research The 11member commission is headed by Morris B Abram a New York City lawyer and includes individuals prominent in medicine theology law and public affairs It was created by Congress in 1978 started work two years ago and will go out of business at the end of March In its wideranging 115page report the commission found that on the whole advances in genetics have greatly enhanced health and wellbeing and that genetic screening techniques give Americans new opportunities to understand their biological heritage and to make their health care and reproductive plans accordingly Ethical Guidelines Proposed But it proposed a broad array of ethical and practical guidelines to insure that new and existing screening technologies would yield safe effective equitable and beneficial results and that parents children and society were protected The report focused on genetic screening for medical and reproductive purposes It did not address the issues raised by genetic screening of workers to determine susceptibility to chemical damage in the workplace or by screening used for research purposes In general the commission argued that medical screening programs should largely be voluntary that genetic information should largely be kept confidential and that access to screening services should be equitable But it noted that these principles sometimes conflict and it offered these specific recommendations for resolving difficult cases and for changing current practices to make them work better  The current practice of limiting amniocentesis a test for diagnosing the health of a fetus to women age 35 or older should be reevaluated to make it more available to younger women The original notion that 35 is the age at which the risk of bearing a defective child rises sharply has been supplanted by more recent understanding that the risk rises gradually with increasing age  The use of amniocentesis for sex selection should be discouraged Although amniocentesis can determine the sex of a fetus thus allowing parents to abort a fetus of unwanted sex the practice is morally suspect for a variety of reasons apart from the abortion issue  Screening programs may focus on particular racial or ethnic groups that have a high incidence of a genetic disease without violating principles of equity and fairness  Men who donate their sperm to artificial insemination programs should be screened more thoroughly so that the risks of transmitting genetic disease can be minimized and women can be apprised of the dangers  Adoption laws should be changed so that information about serious genetic risks can be communicated to all affected parties Currently adoption records are often sealed by the courts thus making it impossible to convey information on a newly discovered genetic condition to either the child or its original biological parents depending on circumstances  Individuals screened should be encouraged to release genetic information that would benefit their relatives if they refuse it may sometimes be ethically acceptable to release it anyway to avoid serious harm to other individuals  Mandatory genetic screening is justified only when needed to prevent serious harm to the defenseless such as children  Genetic information should not generally be provided to insurers or employers without the permission of the person screened In addition the commission said mandatory screening is not justified as part of a program to produce a genetically healthy society or other vague and politically abusable social ideals
"SLOWLY, A NEW AWARENESS OF WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/03/us/slowly-a-new-awareness-of-women.html,Sally Laird is a lobbyist for the League of Women Voters and in the past when she asked Congressmen to consider the special problems of women she usually received a polite brushoff But since Congress reconvened in January she has noticed a new attitude among many lawmakers They really want to look very closely at how legislation affects women she said They start the conversation We dont have to And we love it We find some folks are still somewhat patronizing added Miss Laird the leagues legislative director They say Well take care of you But we say that we want to be active players We dont want to leave our fate to someone else Consciousness raising has come to Capitol Hill Women and their supporters inside and outside Congress are trying to change the mentality of an institution that has long been dominated by white males holding stereotypical views of women and their role in society A lot of people up here dont understand women particularly working women said Senator David Durenberger a Minnesota Republican They relate to women like they do to their wives Its a New Ball Game But as Miss Laird observed the insularity of Congressional males is starting to break down a bit Its a new ball game said Representative Bill Gradison Republican of Ohio Anyone who fails to consider the impact of legislation on women does so at his or her peril Some of the plays in this new game include the following  On Thursday the House is scheduled to take up a 46 billion emergency job bill that contains about 700 million for the sort of public service jobs usually held by women such as home health care or drug abuse clinics Most of the money was included only after women in Congress complained that the bill concentrated too much on heavy construction The legislation also lifts a strict limit on the use of community development funds for similar public service jobs  A House subcommittee has started hearing testimony on a bill that would ban sexbased discrimination in insurance policies  That bill is also included in a package of legislation called the Economic Equity Act that is to be introduced in both chambers later this month Its aim is to improve the economic situation of women by revising pension and Civil Service laws providing tax breaks for displaced homemakers and single parents and encouraging the establishment of more daycare centers  Representative Barbara B Kennelly Democrat of Connecticut became only the third woman to win a seat on the taxwriting Ways and Means Committee and the first in five years Democrats placed their first woman Representative Geraldine A Ferraro of Queens on the Budget Committee Representative Olympia J Snowe of Maine became the first woman in the Republican leadership when she was appointed deputy whip All three are now in key positions to help block further cuts in social programs that largely serve women  Outside groups such as the League of Women Voters have increased their lobbying efforts on issues affecting women and they played an important role in the drafting of the emergency jobs bill The Leadership Conference on Civil Rights has made the proposed Economic Equity Act a top priority for Congress and organized a coalition of more than 50 groups to work for its passage Feminization of Poverty The first factor in creating this new attitude in Congress is the changing nature of the economy and its impact on women In recent testimony before a Senate committee Nancy Neuman first vice president of the League of Women Voters pointed out that women make up 43 percent of the work force double that of 1960 And most of them work for the same reason men do to earn a living in Senator Durenbergers words Moreover more lawmakers are becoming aware of what has been called the feminization of poverty in America One in every three households headed by a woman is below the poverty line said Miss Neuman and the vast majority of food stamp and welfare benefits go to women and their dependent children Economic and equality issues are basic survival issues for women said Representative Patricia Schroeder Democrat of Colorado These are not boutique uppermiddle class causes The urgent nature of practical economic matters has overshadowed two other issues of great concern to women the proposed equal rights amendment and abortion rights And while these emotionally charged battles will almost certainly resurface later this year many activists in the womens movement say that the economic issues give them a better chance for building broad coalitions Emergence of the Gender Gap Abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution have a for em or agin em quality said Patricia B Reuss legislative director of the Womens Equity Action League Weve gone from black and white issues to a whole bunch of different shades Economic conditions were also the primary cause of the gender gap the emergence in the 1982 elections of an independentminded female vote that went heavily against the Republicans and their economic program And nothing will focus a politicians attention more vividly than election results Legislators are perceiving that there is a new political force out there said Ann Charnley Smith director of the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues They are getting the message The caucus which has become the focal point of lobbying activity in behalf of women recently decided to admit men and now has 117 members making it one of the largest caucuses on Capitol Hill Republicans concede that the Reagan Administration appears to be insensitive to the impact of its economic program said Senator Durenberger As a result they are particularly eager to identify with womens concerns and eradicate the gender gap Its extremely important for Republicans said Senator Durenberger the prime sponsor of the Economic Equity Act in the Senate I wouldnt want to be running in 1984 and have voters think that I was opposed to these issues or not interested in them Changes Could Cost Money Yet activists in the womens movement know that such expressions of sympathy and concern will be difficult to translate into legislative achievements For instance many changes in insurance and pension laws could cost companies a great deal of money and the lobbying on the other side is expected to be fierce Moreover it is still an open question whether male politicians who control Congress will feel strongly enough about concerns affecting women to muscle them through the legislative maze A lot of male politicians dont feel this deeply yet said Representative Bob Edgar Democrat of Pennsylvania Theyll try to coopt the movement if they can Theyll cosponsor a bill and forget it It hasnt gotten into their fabric yet  We have to keep on them all the time agreed Mrs Schroeder Its easy to fall back into the old ways This is still a mans town
CITIZENS' INPUT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/04/opinion/l-citizens-input-009241.html,To the Editor Your editorial Poison Pens and a Sensible Tax leaves me very confused First by speaking of poison pens do you really intend to disparage the motives of all investors who took the time to write to their representatives and who dared to express an opinion I dont care if they used a printed form or personal stationery Their letters do not deserve such a vicious description Secondly to suggest that such mail should be consigned to the deadletter office is simply outrageous Anyone who takes time to write to Congress should be complimented and encouraged rather than sneered at for exercising his or her right When did Senator Dole and The Times abrogate this right Thirdly The Times should not encourage Senator Dole to take a threatening stance toward the banks simply because the banks are petitioning Congress Rather you should be admonishing Senator Dole for even hinting at such retaliatory action Such threats simply reinforce the poor estimation in which most politicians are held by the layman Finally what would your reaction be if a newspaper of record suggested that all proabortion letters sent to Congress be consigned to the deadletter office and characterized as written by poison pens You would probably become highly indignant and issue an editorial extolling the right and duty of citizens to petition Congress I guess it depends whose ox is being gored JAMES F SHEA Middle Village NY Feb 24 1983
AROUND THE NATION; Two Brothers Sentenced In Doctor's Abduction,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/05/us/around-the-nation-two-brothers-sentenced-in-doctor-s-abduction.html,Two brothers were sentenced to long terms in prison today for their parts in the abduction of an abortion clinic operator and his wife Matthew Moore 20 years old was sentenced to 20 years and fined 10000 on each of two counts of conspiracy and extortion Wayne Moore 18 was sentenced to 20 years in prison and was fined 10000 on one count of conspiracy Both men had pleaded guilty Federal District Judge William L Beatty imposed the sentences on the brothers both from Texas in the abduction last August of Dr Hector Zevallos and his wife in what prosecutors said was an attempt to stop Dr Zevallos from performing abortions The Zevallos were held for eight days before being freed unharmed Don Benny Anderson 42 of Pearland Tex a third defendant was sentenced last month to 30 years after a jury found him guilty of extortion and conspiracy
THE G.O.P.: A PARTY IN SEARCH OF ITSELF,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/magazine/the-gop-a-party-in-search-of-itself.html,In the morning of the State of the Union address President Reagan and his aides ere briefing Republican leaders on their new program One of those attending the White House session was Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada and after almost an hour of talk he became alarmed I never heard the reality of unemployment raised except in passing he recalled later Senator Laxalt is close to the President and blunt with his advice and he told the meeting that he was really bothered by a recent incident in Minneapolis where 12000 unemployed workers applied for 200 jobs Others complained that the story had been orchestrated by local unions but the Nevadan felt differently If that was orchestrated by the unions then the people I saw interviewed on television were excellent actors he said They had the ring of truth This is middleclass America people who want to work and are out of work Plain political and moral reality dictates that we address the problem The debate in that White House briefing room symbolizes a broader battle within the Republican Party a battle that pits ideological conservatives against more practical politicians and legislators In an important sense the party divides between those who dismiss the workers in Minneapolis as tools of the union and those who say they represent a problem that must be addressed How that battle is resolved could have enormous implications for the party and the nations political life for the rest of the decade In the short term the struggle centers on the mind of Ronald Reagan and on the legislative agenda he and his allies will pursue in the new Congress In the long term the struggle will determine the future of the Republican Party Who will lead the party and in what direction after Mr Reagan leaves the scene Will the party be able to solidify the gains it made in 1980 when some leaders talked confidently of a permanent realignment of the party balance and a new Republican majority Or will the Republicans lapse back into the role of permanent understudy to the Democrats after a few turns on the stage in place of the injured star American parties are vast loosely organized coalitions not ideologically cohesive units on the European model and as Robert M Teeter a Republican poll taker put it The tents so big you always have internal struggles Richard S Williamson the White House liaison with state and local governments added Parties are constantly in search of their own soul What makes this battle more important and more intense than most such battles is that the Republicans control the Senate as well as the White House and thus have major responsibility for running the Government for the first time in a quarter of a century It was easy to be a united minority we didnt have to answer for anything noted a Republican aide in the House Now we have to answer for a national agenda and its very difficult to do that The battle for the Republican future has been described as a contest between conservatives and moderates Liberals seem to be an endangered species in the GOP almost as rare as Democrats who identify with Jimmy Carter But in an important sense the conflict is not really ideological since most of the current and potential leaders cluster in a rather narrow band on the political spectrum somewhere right of center say about the 40yard line The struggle really centers more on strategy than on ultimate goals and the fissures cut across each other in confusing patterns ideologues versus pragmatists optimists against realists those who scorn political calculation fighting those who welcome it Probably the major clash is between Republicans who insist on maintaining certain principles and policies no matter what and those who say the partys job is to govern the country even if that means messy compromises and imperfect solutions So far President Reagan has been trying to straddle both horses at once but the strain is beginning to show His budget calls for standby taxes but no change in his basic threeyear tax package job training but not jobproducing Government efforts a slowdown in defense but no real change in his massive military buildup To many listeners from both parties the Presidents State of the Union address sounded soggy almost soporific For a generation Mr Reagan has basically given one speech the paean to free enterprise that he first started refining as a goodwill ambassador for General Electric and developed into an effective political document during his years as Governor of California What he delivered on Jan 25 amounted to only the second basic speech of his political lifetime and as he grudgingly acknowledged the value of government intervention in the economy the President seemed monumentally uncomfortable and unenthusiastic Accordingly the direction in which Mr Reagan will lead the party remains uncertain So is his decision whether to run again next year What is certain is that the race to succeed Mr Reagan whenever he steps down has already begun in earnest It is also clear that the Republican brouhaha could rival the Democrats wellknown penchant for fratricide John P Sears once the Presidents campaign manager and now a Washington lawyer voices a common feeling when he says Reagan is in charge of a broad group in the party Once hes no longer running no one can replace him Peter Hart a prominent Democratic poll taker adds gleefully It will be a bloodbath that I will be delighted to watch Until Mr Reagan drops the other shoe his potential successors are trying to restrain their eagerness  but only barely In the early weeks of the new year Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader announced that he would not seek a fourth term in 1984 in order to give himself running room for a Presidential bid Senator Robert W Packwood of Oregon went prospecting for support in New England Leaders of the New Right said they might not support Mr Reagan again and contemplated backing Senator Jesse Helms of North Carolina for President either on the Republican ticket or a thirdparty slate Vice President Bush took off on a European mission that could enhance his credentials as a foreign policy expertSenator Robert Dole seemed to be in the middle of every legislative battle from Social Security to taxes to food stamps burnishing his image as an effective legislator who can get things done Representative Jack F Kemp of New York who campaigned vigorously for Republicans during the fall was assiduously adding to his stock of political chits Senator Laxalt gained greater public visibility by taking a new job as general chairman of the party and its chief public spokesman The Great Mentioner that vaporous but influential Washington sage was popping up with some additional names from Senator William L Armstrong of Colorado to Gov James R Thompson of Illinois And all this with the first party caucuses in Iowa still a year away These Republican machinations are not taking place in a vacuum The two major parties interact constantly borrowing ideas and tactics giving shape to each other the way a head shapes a pillow Accordingly the fate of the Republicans will he heavily influenced by what the Democrats do For a while the GOP dreamed of a leftward adventure by the Democrats that would leave the middle ground unoccupied Those hopes were clouded by the decision of Senator Edward M Kennedy to pull out of the Presidential race and his announcement was mourned by Republicans who saw him as the perfect bogeyman the one candidate who could horrify their party enough to keep it united Richard M Scammon a wellknown election analyst said If the Democrats erect a monument it should be to a noncandidate  Kennedy He enabled them to stay in the middle The party that Ronald Reagan eventually bequeaths to his successors does possess considerable strengths For one thing the Republicans have understood far better than the Democrats the changing character of political parties As the traditional locally based parties eroded under the hammer blows of modern life suburbs television education  the GOP created a whole new animal a national party that turned the political world on its head It was organized from the top down not the bottom up and its threads of allegiance were knotted together by computer banks not precinct captains Aggressive marketing techniques turned the party into a moneymaking machine and Richard N Bond the deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee said Were in really good shape mechanically In gross dollars the money we raise in the next election cycle is going to be awesome Institutionally the Republican Party is in good shape despite Ronald Reagan not because of him The President came to partisan politics late in life and he has always been a lone wolf more devoted to promoting his own ideas and ambitions than the interests of his party Accordingly Mr Reagan has played down the role of President as party leader and has shown little concern for the inner workings of the complex organism that is the modern mass political party The health of the Republican Party is really a testament to Bill Brock who took over as party chairman after the Watergate humiliation and did a superb rebuilding job The Presidents disinterest in the party structure was demonstrated by his choice to succeed Brock  Richard Richards an obscure party functionary from Utah who almost disappeared during his two years in the job The decision to replace Richards with Frank J Fahrenkopf Jr the Nevada state chairman and a close associate of Senator Laxalt reflected White House concern for the political future of Ronald Reagan not the Republican Party In recent years the Republicans have been the more dynamic party producing ideas attracting recruits and conveying a sense of purpose As a result the party has exerted more influence over the national agenda and has shaken the Democrats domination of the political dialogue As John Sears observed The crucial thing in politics is who getsto say whats wrong with the country and what should be done about it Thats up for grabs now and that hasnt been true for 50 years The best ideas of one party are often absorbed by the other a process that blurs battle lines and frustrates purists but generally guarantees the health of the system As a result many Democrats sound like warmedover Republicans these days hesitating to propose new spending programs without finding a way to pay for them talking about the needs of capital as well as labor accepting larger defense budgets and the premise that America must rebuild its military In addition the Republicans showed remarkable resiliency in the elections of 1982 While they lost 26 seats in the House they retained control of the Senate captured the governorship of California and almost pulled off a major upset in New York Ben J Wattenberg coauthor of The Real Majority an influential political analysis in the early 1970s said of the Republicans performance in 1982 They survived That tells you something about the potency of their ideas Finally the same polls that show slippage in Mr Reagans approval rating do not show a corresponding surge for the Democrats If the people believed that the Democrats could solve our problems Id be very concerned said Fahrenkopf the new chairman of the Republican National Committee But theyre not saying that Yet for all these brave words and hopeful signs the Republican Party is blanketed today by a thick fog of confusion a miasma of missed opportunities Two years after Richard B Wirthlin the Presidents poll taker talked confidently about a rolling realignment that would significantly alter the political landscape many Republicans are saying frankly Were blowing it Or as Edward Mahe Jr a former party official and current campaign consultant put it We are rapidly getting to the point where were making Jimmy Carter look good and I never thought that would be possible Weve snatched defeat from the jaws of victory lamented Michael S Johnson the press aide to Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican minority leader We went at our programs and our goals with such fervor in 1981 that we got too far in front of the people who gave us our mandate As we moved toward recession and high unemployment we maintained too much selfconfidence in the longterm impact of our program We believed our own rhetoric and we forgot to be shortsighted We didnt demonstrate a basic sensitivity to the problems that were being created Scholars who study the evolution of political parties note that genuine realignments have generally occurred on a 30 to 40year cycle Since the Democrats became the majority party in the 30s pressures are building along the fault lines that divide the electorate and by historic standards a shift might be imminent But the major reason that the Republicans have not been able to trigger this political earthquake was the one pinpointed by Johnson the widespread perception that they lack a basic sensitivity to the problems of average workingclass Americans From everything I can see for the rest of the decade it doesnt look like the Republicans can became a majority said Prof Robert L Peabody who teaches political science at Johns Hopkins University To get a true realignment you have to get a movement in the electorate but all the data show that people are not changing their party allegiance They voted for Reagan over Carter as the lesser of two evils Prof Joel L Fleishman of Duke University believes that the Republican future will be determined at least in part by the Democrats To the extent that the Democratic Party remains a middle party leaning to the left it will be hard for the Republicans to get majority status said Professor Fleishman the editor of a new book The Future of American Political Parties There are just alot more poor and moderate income people around who are attracted to the Democratic Party In Fleishmans view Reagan has pulled the Republicans to the right and out of the political mainstream The party of Ronald Reagan cannot be a majority party its too skewed toward wealth and privilege and corporations the professor argued I doubt that Americans are extremists one way or another When Ronald Reagan was running he was not perceived to be as ideologically extreme as he turned out to be The Republican Party dominated the political scene from the Civil War to the New Deal The Democratic coalition formed by Franklin D Roosevelt did not start unraveling until the 1960s and in an important sense it was a victim of its own success Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr is fond of saying that the Democrats hoisted their own workingclass loyalists into the middle class and gave them the luxury of becoming Republicans This natural political evolution was accelerated by Vietnam and the rise of the youthful counterculture which seemed to mock so many of the values held sacred by traditional Democrats from church to flag to family As John Sears recalls The Democrats denigrated the mainstream voter and allowed themselves to look so avantgarde that they no longer could be trusted George Wallace saw this chance and took it So did Richard Nixon who denounced hippies and praised hard hats and sought out disaffected Democrats By 1972 notes Kevin P Phillips author of The Emerging Republican Majority Nixon was thinking in terms of country and western singers and Polish archbishops in the White House He finally understood it Ronald Reagan codified this new appeal to traditional Democrats in a most cogent and perceptive way through his campaign litany of neighborhood work family peace and freedom With those words the party of the board room and the country club reached into the bowling alley and the union hall Two key voting groups swung behind the Republicans bluecollar workers often urban Catholics from the Northeast and Middle West and Southern Protestants often rural and religious who had been Democrats since the Civil War The Republicans told them that they would fight crime end racial disruptions in the schools restore respect for the flag shore up the family cut taxes and throw the greedy off welfare Said one Republican campaign strategist You cant underestimate the degree of fedupness there was going into the 1980 election Have the Republicans failed to capitalize on their victory in 1980 Why as Prof Nelson W Polsby of the University of California at Berkeley put it is the Republican Party busily blowing a golden opportunity handed it by the incompetence of Democrats in managing their own affairs The basic answer is that the Republicans misread the 1980 elections in a number of profound ways For one thing they were too quick to proclaim a party realignment on the basis of only one election Richard Scammon coauthor of The Real Majority points out that the vote in House races as opposed to the Presidential balloting has stayed fairly steady since 1978 with Democrats winning 51 percent to 56 percent of the popular vote Polsby notes that even when the Republicans were taking control of the Senate Democratic Senate candidates outpolled their opponents by a total of almost three million votes The professor author of the forthcoming book The Consequences of Party Reform concludes The evidence for party realignment or for the emergence of a new majority backing the Presidents program is extremely thin The Republicans interpreted their mandate as an endorsement of the fulldress program long nurtured by Mr Reagan and his conservative colleagues but exit polls from 1980 show that 38 percent of the Reagan supporters were voting against Carter while only 11 percent were attracted by the Republicans conservative agenda Peter D Hart the Democratic poll taker explains You werent getting fundamental shifts in attitude in the 1980 election People sided with the Republicans because they didnt like the Democrats not because the Republican Party made sense and they were buying in Public support for Mr Reagans economic program was always shallower than the President and his allies maintained But the tidal wave of enthusiasm generated by the Presidents victory swallowed up doubts and swept everyone along Looking back Richard Richards outgoing chairman of the Republican National Committee explains There was a tendency to think that when we made a decision certain things would happen If we cut taxes or social spending the results would occur as an exact science That just aint so Everyone who runs for office oversimplifies what he can and will do and we did that But things didnt follow as easily and routinely as we thought they would and weve jeopardized our credentials and our right to lead A growing number of Republicans also believe they are suffering from a compassion gap a belief that the party has not done enough to recharge the economy or alleviate the suffering of the umemployed in the aging industrial areas of the country To Senator Richard G Lugar of Indiana Republicans who counsel caution and restraint are architects of disaster for the party I dont see how you can go to Indiana and say youre for full employment and at the same time say Theres nothing I can do about it  said Senator Lugar author of a housing stimulus bill that passed Congress last year but was vetoed by the President There are things we can do about it and ought to do about it and if we want to be the majority party we have to be part of it The Republicans also misread the election as a mandate for a wholesale attack on government spending and services long favored by conservative ideologues But as Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the Republican whip put it Americans think of themselves as conservatives they want government reduced But in their hearts they are liberals they want all the goodies coming in The Administrations most damaging misinterpretation of the 1980 election came in the area of Social Security V Lance Tarrance Jr a Republican poll taker in Texas reports that for the first six months of the Presidents tenure more and more voters were identifying with the Republican Party Then came the White House proposal to trim pension benefits Realignment officially terminated in June of 1981 with the Social Security pronouncement notes Tarrance who was monitoring the issue through publicopinion surveys Theres been not a single breath of life in it since The third mistake flowed from the conviction that the social issues such as abortion school prayer and busing would help cement the swing of Democrats to the Republican cause But Republican strategists now admit that abortion is an emotional issue that cuts both ways and costs as many votes as it attracts even among Roman Catholics Moreover it was one thing for voters to identify with a vague concern about moral decay quite another to back legislation that would amend the Constitution or strip the courts of jurisdiction Here again the Reaganites projected the ideological views of their true believers onto the average voter and paid for it The fourth misreading of the election was more subtle Because Ronald Reagan won such a large share of the bowlingalley vote in 1980 the Republicans became complacent convinced that these voters had switched permanently But they failed to realize how fragile this newfound allegiance really was and how deep the ancient suspicions of the Republicans really ran  When the Republicans got in said Representative Guy Vander Jagt of Michigan chairman of the National Republican Congressional Committee the image of the Republicans favoring the rich certainly resurfaced And Reagan contributed to that appearancewise with the new china and all those other things Many bluecollar people said The Republicans really dont care about us  Where then do the Republicans go from here The struggle will continue on two parallel tracks the legislative and the political But in the immediate future the focus will be on Capitol Hill The pragmatistrealist faction of the party starts from the premise that the Republican resurgence is being choked off by rising unemployment and deepening despair And they see no point in staying the course with an iceberg looming dead ahead If we dont deal with circumstances as we find them were not doing our job Senator Laxalt insisted Two years ago we thought that our tax cut would stimulate the economy and we would have 6 or 7 percent growth rate by now That hasnt happened so we cant sit there and bury our heads in the sand and say go away The pragmatists make their base camp on Capitol Hill and that is no accident Midterm elections are specifically designed to produce a report card on the Administration to force the entire House and onethird of the Senate to return home and listen to their constituents Representative Toby Roth Republican of Wisconsin described the experience this way You get very isolated in Washington and lose touch But on the campaign trail you get very realistic very quickly Moreover the terms of 19 Republican Senators are up in 1984 and the party leadership has absolutely no desire to return to minority status in the Senate They would like to reelect President Reagan and retain the White House but as one Senate aide conceded Our No1 one priority is to keep control of the Senate To most Republican leaders in Congress the way to do that is follow Laxalts advice and deal with circumstances as we find them not as they would like them to be This bent toward realism not always a highly prized characteristic in Republican ranks has been accentuated by the experience of the last two years Many Congressional Republicans have undergone a remarkable evolution from minority to majority from outsider to insider from critic to craftsman Senator Dole the consummate pragmatist expressed what might stand as the credo of his colleagues when he said We are the majority party we have to produce legislation The determination of Mr Dole and his colleagues to produce practical legislation and not just accept White House dictates is also animated by a dirty little secret Many of them never really believed in supplyside economics the idea that reduced taxes would stimulate the economy and wipe out deficits They agreed with George Bush when he called it voodoo economics and with Senator Baker when he called it a riverboat gamble and now they feel it is time for the party to cut its losses They are still conservatives rooted in the belief that smaller government is better government But just as liberal Democrats have absorbed some basic Republican precepts in recent years these Republicans see some good points in the Democratic belief that government intervention in the economy is right and proper If we continue our handsoff approach with government having no responsibility theres going to be hell to pay in 1984 said Senator Dan Quayle Republican of Indiana As Senator Quayle indicates the 1984 elections are already dominating thought processes on Capitol Hill and the legislative strategy of the pragmatist faction dovetails with its political belief The government can only be run and elections can only be won in the broad middleground of the political arena The question in both parties says Ben Wattenberg is who captures the horse of tough moderation Republicans from the industrial Northeast and Middle West are particularly alarmed at the handsoff attitude of the ideological conservatives in the party and they say that stronger government intervention in the economy is absolutely essential if their party is to have any chance of recapturing the bluecollar Democrats who backed President Reagan in 1980 I cant understand all this caution the feeling that recovery can happen too soon complained Senator Lugar the new head of the National Republican Senatorial Committee In my part of the country it cant happen too soon Senator Packwood of Oregon the man Senator Lugar ousted from the campaign post advances the critique of his party one step further He points out that in 1982 Republicans were most popular with white males earning more than 40000 a year and he finds that a very narrow base for a mass party In speeches around the country the Oregonian is preaching that Republicans must make a major effort to attract women and racial minorities The feeling now is that our party doesnt care about them doesnt need them and doesnt want them he said Many Republicans who dislike the Senators manner and his personal criticisms of President Reagan agree with his political analysis It was no accident that Mr Reagan appointed two women to his Cabinet within one week and praised the Civil Rights Commission in his State of the Union address At times the Republican battle lines seem drawn across Pennsylvania Avenue with the White House on one side and Congress on the other But there are important pragmatist moles in the executive branch just as there are plenty of ideologues in Congress The chief pragmatist in the inner circle is clearly James A Baker 3d the chief of staff and Charles Black Republican campaign consultant describes his role this way Jim Baker knows how this town operates and hes quicker to compromise than Reagan or Meese But philosophically theres not a big difference between them 3rd jump But there is a difference in style and outlook Baker and his allies are rooted in the Republican tradition  generally fostered in Ivy League schools and Wall Street law firms  that government service is a noble pursuit So they do not share the burning hostility toward government that motivates many conservatives from nonEastern nonprivileged backgrounds The other knock against the likes of Baker is that they are not true Reaganites that they originally backed other Republican hopefuls and have not passed the loyalty test To pragmatists on Capitol Hill this makes the Bakerites invaluable sources of balance and skepticism in the White House but to the ideologues this makes them unreliable and even treacherous Indeed it has become a part of the conservative canon that the interlopers in the White House have betrayed the Reagan revolution and caused its downfall A typical view was expressed by Lyn Nofziger the former White House political adviser who said of the President Hes the victim of people who work for him who are opposed to his philosophy That philosophy is the wellspring of the ideological wing of the party Its headquarters are in the White House and its chieftains include Edwin Meese 3d the presidents counselor Edward Rollins the political adviser and Richard S Williamson the liaison to local governments But they get strong support from such lawmakers as Representative Kemp and Senator Armstrong plus rightwing activists like Richard Viguerie who refined the use of direct mail fund raising to a high art This is the group that believes the country must stay the course maintain confidence in the President and his program avoid quick fixes and weakkneed retreat Its rallying cry was enunciated recently by James G Watt the Secretary of the Interior who told a party celebrating the Administrations second anniversary Let Reagan be Reagan In their view President Reagan is failing not because he has been too rigid but because he has been too flexible When the President calls for new taxes or jobs programs no matter how small they believe that he is crippling his own program fuzzing the differences between the parties and converting the Republicans into pale imitations of the Democrats To rightwing activists like Robert McAdam assistant director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress any battle fought on economic grounds will always be won by the Democrats so there is no use compromising The Reagan Administration and the Republican leadership in Congress say that nothing is important but economics McAdam noted But the bluecollar voters say OK Im a Democrat and if all you want to talk about is economics Im better off with the Democrats Theyll at least guarantee my job Mr McAdam insists that the Administration must revive such noneconomic issues as crime and school prayer that motivated the conservative cadres in 1980 Bill Lee a campaign consultant for Republicans agrees saying You have to service the coalition When it comes to the economy the ideologues say that the President and the Republicans must stick with the original plan and not alter it in the name of realism Rollins sneers that there are many Republicans who have been bitten by the good government bug who feel we have a responsibility to govern but he is not one of them Like many Reaganites Rollins is mesmerized by the prospect that if their hero changes course he will be become Carterized and will shrink in stature and will be viewed as weakwilled Moreover the ideologues see Reagan as their best and perhaps last chance to enact the conservative agenda they have been drafting for a generation And as hopes for that agenda continue to dwindle they are getting a bit desperate The only answer goes their argument is for Reagan to stay firm draw a clear distinction between Democrats and Republicans and try to polarize the electorate I personally feel said Rollins that the politics of confrontation is more effective than the politics of compromise You cant run on the basis of compromise One of the leading exponents of this approach on Capitol Hill is Representative Newt Gingrich of Georgia who says that Mr Reagan and the Republicans have already been damaged by too much accommodation and now stand for nothing in the eyes of the electorate Compromise he says helps you to govern but it collapses your majority To the degree you try to govern in the short run at the cost of destroying your coalition t
ats terribly destructive The best example of how these different approaches play out in legislative terms came last fall in the fight over the gasoline tax bill Senator Baker and the rest of the Republican leadership backed the bill as an imperfect but useful compromise a way of providing jobs and showing sympathy for the unemployed while not increasing the deficit The orthodox rightwingers as Mr Gingrich implied are not really interested in governing and they used the occasion to abandon the ruling coalition in the Senate and return to their traditional role of opposition critic When youre given the power to govern noted Senator Quayle and you dont like government youre uncomfortable On principle the ideologues dont like the higher taxes and greater government responsibility embodied in the bill But they also think that the gas tax is the sort of legislation that can be used to political advantage Instead of supporting it as a jobs bill they opposed it as a tax bill and cast themselves in the role of defending the little guy  the motorist who would have to pay the new levy The word of the year among hardcore conservatives is populism and they share the view of the realists that the Republicans must shed their image as the party of the rich But the remedies offered to eradicate that image are diametrically opposed The realists say you win the workers vote by using government to stimulate the economy and relieve suffering the ideologues say you gain friends by reducing government and relieving the tax burden In some ways the legislative battle is a preliminary for the main event the fight for party leadership in the postReagan era Of course Mr Reagan has to step aside before this struggle can emerge into the open and the first question concerns the Presidents true intentions Republicans generally agree that the President would be their strongest and most unifying candidate and those who think he will run again argue some variation on the theme that he does or should want to finish the job he has started However analysts such as John Sears see only a 5050 chance that the President will try for another term and their reasons are also familiar hes too old he doesnt like the job his wife wants to go back to California and their rich friends The key variable is the economy and even a Reagan loyalist like Paul Laxalt says that If I came to the conclusion that he was a political basket case I wouldnt want him to take the party on a kamikaze mission The President is coming under increasing pressure to make his decision by Labor Day or even July 4 Even now there is a lot of discreet contingency planning going on but it is hard to handicap a race that is still being run in the dark Most Republicans agree with Robert Teeter the poll taker when he says that so much depends on personality not ideology This is particularly true since most of the leading contenders come from the pragmatic or moderately conservative camp and agree on a good many issues In addition to personality Senator Laxalt suggests two other key qualities tenacity and organizational skills Running for President he said is a very substantial endeavor You can have all the charisma in the world and run well in your home state but when you get on the national track its a different animal You have to pass the credibility test of the national media and raise a tremendous amount of money and get out and pray that you sell With Mr Reagan out of the picture and even if he stays in Kevin Phillips foresees a fragmentation of the party that could produce two splinter efforts a rightwing slate headed by someone like Jesse Helms and a liberalelite party headed by John Anderson Any insurrection of this sort would certainly diminish the value of the Republican nomination but there would be plenty of competitors anyway and no clear favorite As Senator Laxalt assesses the situation I dont see any heir apparent at all Theres no consensus out there The day of receiving a blessing and getting the nomination is over Many questions continue to hover over the Republican Party as the 98th Congress and the 1984 Presidential race start to take shape The latest struggle for the future of the Republican Party is just beginning But as Teeter noted It is not a struggle that ends some day It is part of a continuing process that all political parties go through If Reagan Doesnt Run ice President Bush has to be considered first among equals in the nomination sweepstakes should President Reagan pull out While he generally represents the pragmatic conservative wing of the party even a hardcore Reaganite like Richard S Williamson of the White House staff says of Bush On a practical level hes done an enormous amount Hes helped 150 candidates in the last year and you couldnt ask for more In addition to a fistful of IOUs Vice President Bush retains the skeleton of a good organization and an ability to appeal to a wide slice of the political spectrum Bush is like a chameleon said Representative Jim Leach of Iowa a Bush backer People see in him what they want to see even if its not always accurate But Bush also carries a lot of baggage and the biggest load at least potentially is his Hubert Humphrey problem linkage to an unpopular and discredited President No matter how you slice it says Senator Laxalt the President and the Vice President become Siamese twins Others deride the Vice President as a walking watercress sandwich a relentless preppy with little appeal to bluecollar Democrats Peter Hart a Democratic poll taker says that Bush has the soul of a Vice President and adds I dont know who George Bush is or what hes for But then the same thing has been said of Senator Baker who is ranked second by most early oddsmakers Baker is also more pragmatic than ideological His advantage over Mr Bush is a folksier image and more independence from the Reagan Administration And by announcing his decision to leave the Senate he managed to proclaim his own Presidential ambitions without dumping on the current President or appearing overeager On the negative side Baker has been despised by the right wing ever since he supported the Panama Canal treaties Moreover Baker is a superb backroom politician an inside man doing an inside job But as Lyn Nofziger former assistant to the President for political affairs notes the qualities of a good majority leader  patience affability a knack for compromise are entirely different from the personality and talent needed to be a good candidate for President The third major candidate from the pragmatic conservative camp is Senator Dole the tough guy turned statesman Dole is a legitimate war hero and that wont hurt the chances of a Republican who might have to run against the Democrats Senator John Glenn the former astronaut Lance Tarrance a Republican poll taker in Texas adds that since economic problems seem so intractable ideological candidates seem less viable than more practical experienced types like Baker and Dole For now however Baker seems to have the edge over Dole in their quiet jockeying for the same corner of the party Moreover Doles responsibilities as chairman of the Finance Committee will keep him tied to Capitol Hill and raising taxes is not exactly the best way to get people to vote for you At this stage the man most likely to emerge as the candidate of the more ideological wing of the party is Jack Kemp The New York Congressman has traipsed across the country speaking for local Republican hopefuls and as Richard N Bond deputy chairman of the Republican National Committee says Kemp has got as many chits as anyone With his football stories perfectly waved hair and toothpastead teeth Kemp exudes a star quality that more prosaic politicians find hard to match The most frequently heard criticism of Kemp is that he is not decisive and that he sometimes seems full of ideas and theories that do not quite make sense One of those theories embodied in the KempRoth tax bill which cut taxes by 25 percent over three years could poison his chances if the economy does not revive Perhaps the one potential candidate who could span both camps with the same agility as Ronald Reagan is his good friend Paul Laxalt The Nevadan would probably inherit a good chunk of the Presidents following and since he led the opposition to the Panama Canal treaties he has always enjoyed good support on the right Yet most pragmatists regard him as an honest broker with a streak of realism in his makeup Laxalt has never seemed to hunger for the Presidency and he will do nothing to advance his own cause while President Reagan is a potential candidate But he was clearly disappointed when he lost the VicePresidential nomination in 1980 and at times it appears that his near miss has left him with an aftertaste of glory When I asked if he ruled out a Presidential bid he replied You cant rule anything out around here,,
"POPE, IN PANAMA, CAUTIONS AGAINST GUERRILLA WAR",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/world/pope-in-panama-cautions-against-guerrilla-war.html,Pope John Paul II arrived here today on the third stop of his tour of eight countries and urged Central Americas peasants to reject the temptation of violence armed guerrilla struggle and the egoistic struggle of classes This is not the path of Jesus Christ the Church or your Christian faith he told a rally in Stadium of the Revolution He expressed sympathy for people who live in conditions of misery and said he supported urgent reforms to improve their lives The Pope flew here from San Jose Costa Rica where he had been spent the night after a visit to Managua Nicaragua on Friday Against Taking Up Arms of Hate Making clear that he was speaking to all rural workers in Central America not only Panamanians the Pope condemned guerrilla warfare There are those who wish you to abandon your work and take up the arms of hate to struggle against your brothers he said You should not follow them Where does this path of violence lead Without a doubt it increases hatred and the distance between social groups These methods completely contrary to the love of God and the teachings of your Church and of Jesus Christ mock the reality of your noble aspirations and provoke new evils of social and moral decay Groups of peasants and Indians were brought here from outlying parts of Panama in buses supplied by local churches A capacity crowd of 30000 filled the stadium which is Panamas largest enclosed arena Before he spoke the Pontiff was entertained by costumed dancers who serenaded him with Panamanian songs He appeared absorbed in their presentation and expressed his thanks before beginning his homily Earlier in the day John Paul gave an outdoor mass at which he exhorted his audience to respect the sanctity of the family and reject divorce contraception and abortion The Pope was met at Omar Torrijos International Airport by President Ricardo de la Espriella and other leaders The man considered to hold ultimate power in Panama Brig Gen Ruben Dario Paredes who is the National Guard commander was not present but greeted the Pope during a brief stop before the outdoor mass Security officers estimated that more than 100000 people were gathered for the mass at Simon Bolivar Industrial Center when the Pope arrived by helicopter From there the Pope made a brief helicopter trip to the Papal Nuncios residence where he had lunch with Roman Catholic prelates The Pope also paid a courtesy call on President de la Espriella and addressed priests and seminarians at the cathedral He was to return to San Jose tonight by helicopter before going on to El Salvador on Sunday The Panamanian crowds were large and enthusiastic and flags and banners lined the Popes route through the city but not nearly in as great numbers as he has seen elsewhere in Latin America Many of the banners were provided by corporations that identified themselves prominently below messages of welcome The only unofficial sign seen along the route was painted in large red letters on a wall near the National University It urged John Paul to demand freedom for political prisoners in Central America The Government declared a day of national rejoicing and urged businesses to release as employees rom their normal duties so they could see the Pope either in person or on television Bars casinos and many shops did not open for business the major thoroughfares were all but empty and the airport was closed The Minister of Justice Justo Fidel Palacios said Thursday that as a gesture of good will he would order the release of some prisoners convicted of nonviolent crimes In contrast to some other countries in the region Panama has avoided conflicts between Catholic leaders and the Government
ON LANGUAGE; THE SQUEAL RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/06/magazine/on-language-the-squeal-rule.html,Rarely does one side in a controversy grab the moral high ground by the coinage of a phrase A generation ago opponents of the union shop urged the passage of what they called righttowork laws building their argument into the name of the game Who could be against the right to work Organized labor called the legislation unionbusting laws In the same way the truthin construction was effective from truthinsecurities in 1933 to truthinpackaging later More recently issuetitling was enhanced by groups that favored legal abortion and called themselves prochoice a move that was then countered by antiabortion groups that selected the positive prolife Now a debate revolves around or centers on a regulation propounded by the Department of Health and Human Services requiring those who use tax dollars to supply minors with contraceptive devices to notify the minors parents Supporters say the law on which the regulation is based calls for the agency to encourage family participation and a family cannot participate unless it knows of the teenagers request opponents call the rule an intrusion into privacy likely to result in more unwanted pregnancies and more abortions The regulation is named the Squeal Rule its label is a powerful weapon in the hands of the opponents In 1865 a British slang dictionary defined squeal as to inform peach and identified the term as a North Country variation of squeak squealer in the sense of informer is a derogation of a person who provides information to the police The implication of course is that the one doing the squealing sounds like a pig The sounds made by animals applied to humans reflect the human attitude toward the animal Dogs can be authoritative he barked or mean he snarled while lions are intimidating he roared and mice are frightened he squeaked Birds are cheerful he chirped and criminals who talk are said to be singing In metaphor the lowest form of animal life is not the snake he hissed but the useful delicious pig Nobody knows the truffles hes seen If you want to hail an informer call him a whistleblower and if you want to condemn him call him a squealer When did Squeal Rule originate At the time the Parental Notification Rule was proposed says Russ Mack spokesman at HHS using the official designation which was in February 1982 Thats when I first heard it called by Planned Parenthood and other opponents the Squeal Rule  Did Planned Parenthood coin it No says Daisy Voigt a mediarelations coordinater who in the course of coordinating media relations answers questions like these Im tempted to say that I first saw it in The New York Times A quick check at that coordinated medium shows an editorial of Feb 5 1982 titled Squealing on TeenAgers On Feb 26 in an editorial blasting the Governments new squeal ruling the headline was Abortion and the Squeal Rule Three weeks later the editorial capitalized the phrase in the copy The strangest of all is the speciousness of the arguments with which the Administration suggests the Squeal Rule The Timess editorial page fiercely defends the anonymity of its editorials and nobody knows which writer has written which editorial but this department has learned to use television newss favorite phrase that the coiner of Squeal Rule was Mary Cantwell Somebody squealed Thanks to the coinage the battle is being won by the antisqueal forces the proponents of the rule are stuck with the bureaucratic parentalnotification rule No imagination at all can be detected nobody has tried fulldisclosure requirement or truthindispensing This matter was brought to my attention by Irving Kristol editor of The Public Interest who heard an NBCTV reporter say that the Squeal Rule was already creating problems Mr Kristol writes As an illustration of such a problem he turned his television on a sexually active girl of 13  those were his exact words I really think comments the father of neoconservatism you ought to take this phrase sexually active which I take to be what we used to call promiscuous and do something with it Is it possible to be promiscuous anymore Or was Don Juan sexually active Promiscuous rooted primarily in the Latin miscere to mix originally meant elements mixed together without discrimination  a sort of Dukes mixture in the tobacconist trade About the turn of this century it began meaning sexually indiscriminate the first citation in a 1924 letter from Cyril Connolly the British critic and editor I am not promiscuous but I cant be loyal to an icicle The word has been used frequently since then but never more tellingly For the difference in connotation between promiscuous and sexually active let us turn to lexicographer David Guralnik Promiscuous is a judgmental word the idea is that the behavior is not desirable Sexually active is without judgment it is neutral Today if a writer wants to be critical he will use promiscuous if he wants to avoid sounding judgmental he will use sexually active That is why you hear sexually active more often than promiscuous Writers who dwell on these words should remember that the handsoff Imnotknockingit sexual activity should not be confused with sexual variety which it overlaps The latter denotes promiscuity oops I made a judgment of a bisexual nature its participants called swingers or if single and frequenters of singles bars swingles They dont worry about the Squeal Rule at all Dont Make a Move Clarity begins at home adjures dermatologist Stanley Spatz of Hallandale Fla I call to your attention a headline in The New York Times A Famed Pastry Chefs Moveable Feast Are we to resign ourselves to these nouveau acceptable spellings likeable loveable sizeable or can someone somewhere insist that the editors and proofreaders demonstrate at least a fourthgrade level of spelling ability before entrusting to them the power to set linguistic standards Sorry Stanley youre scratching the wrong itch Moveable has been spelled with an e since the days of the writing of the Book of Common Prayer in 1549 in which appeared a Table of Moveable Feasts The moveability referred to the dates Ernest Hemingway picked up the phrase and used it as the title of a book about life in Paris in the good old days If you are lucky enough to have lived in Paris as a young man he wrote then wherever you go for the rest of your life it stays with you for Paris is a moveable feast Unfortunately when that quotation and the book title appeared in Bartletts Quotations it was spelled the way Dr Spatz prefers movable Betsy Pitha copy editor for that publication says The spelling of movable in your edition was caused by an overscrupulous proofreader Hemingway spelled it with an e The error was caught and corrected in the second printing Does this mean that moveable is correct Not necessarily in Great Britain the spelling with the e is preferred In the United States we go along with the rule that calls for the dropping of the e when the suffix is added Go with likable provable and unless you were intimidated by Hemingway at an early age  movable That rule does not apply to an ending with a double e lets not get disagreeable I spell movable without an e when writing about types of type but defer to the old English spelling when using the word as a modifier for feast because I like to preserve the phrase as originally used and because I am a generally lovable fellow

NUN DEFIES ARCHBISHOP ON MEDICAID ABORTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/08/us/nun-defies-archbishop-on-medicaid-abortions.html,A Roman Catholic nun here is defying her Archbishops order to resign as state director of social services because she will not denounce the statefinanced abortions for poor women that her department administers Archbishop Edmund C Szoka has vowed to take the issue to the Vatican if she does not resign The Archbishop says it is not too late for the nun Sister Agnes Mary Mansour to satisfy his demand that she denounce the Medicaid abortions The nun a college president who has a doctorate in biochemistry has met the Archbishops challenge with two months of silence She has been bolstered by a groundswell of support from liberal elements in the archdiocese although most Catholics here apparently side with the Archbishop The nun who is 51 years old is scheduled to appear for a State Senate confirmation hearing Tuesday in Lansing where the question of her loyalty and obedience issues usually reserved for ecclesiastical proceedings may be investigated in a political setting Appointment Not at Issue Archbishop Szoka does not oppose Sister Mansours serving in Gov James J Blanchards Cabinet as director of social services In fact he said her appointment could be a blessing to the poor with whom the department deals But before he will give the approval for her to accept the job he said she will have to denounce the abortions This declaration has not been made by Sister Mansour the prelate said in his first public comment on the issue and therefore I must now state without any qualification my objection and opposition to her appointment as director of social services I also call for her resignation from that office without delay Sister Mansours supporters argue that the Archbishop has been inconsistent and wavering hardening his stand as time passed and the nun remained in office pending confirmation These supporters say that the good she can do as a member of an order dedicated to helping the poor outweighs the difficulty of reconciling church and state on the abortion issue Potential Problem for Governor If the issue is not resolved however it may turn into a political problem for Governor Blanchard a Democrat and Unitarian who announced Sister Mansours appointment in December apparently unaware of the ecclesiastical pitfalls that lay in its path In their cautious comment on the dispute newspaper editorials have focused on the lack of political foresight by the Governor and the nun rather than on the church issues involved All indications are that most of metropolitan Detroits 12 million Catholics side with the Archbishop but Sister Mansours defenders have been gathering strength Groundwork for a Just World an organization of nuns and brothers who work in social welfare here has rallied behind her and so lately has Msgr H Clement Kern a wellknown Detroit priest Sister Mansours supporters argue that abortions however repugnant to the church are legal and cannot morally be denied to people who cannot afford them Last year Michigan spent just over 46 million to help pay for 19500 Medicaid abortions Sister Mansours immediate superior is her motherhouse the Sisters of Mercy Province of Detroit The orders superior after a long silence has sided with the nun in the dispute But the Archbishop has vowed to pursue his claim to the right to approve or disapprove such an appointment to the Vatican and to the Sacred Congregation for Religious which rules on disputes involving religious orders Sister Mansour made a losing run for the Democratic nomination to the House of Representatives last year also without the Archbishops approval He later accepted her explanation that she did not know she needed his permission and the matter was dropped Although the Archbishop has not yet invoked Pope John Paul in the current dispute the pontiff has in the past restricted the right of priests to serve in political offices forcing the resignation of a member of Congress
DUBIOUS READING OF INFANT MORTALITY BAROMETER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/08/opinion/l-dubious-reading-of-infant-mortality-barometer-017425.html,To the Editor There is plenty of sound evidence that the availability of medical services including maternal and prenatal care along with adequate nutrition will tend to decrease the infant mortality rate Thus cuts in programs offering these services could have the effect of raising these rates However the implication that this Administrations economic policies and budget cutbacks have caused an increase in infant deaths news article Feb 13 editorial Feb 20 is such a serious charge that it requires adequate documentation Unfortunately The Times which has the responsibility to reasonably winnow out evidence from advocacy on such important issues did not perform well Using data provided by a Washingtonbased advocacy group indicating a rise in infant mortality rates from 1980 to 1981 in nine states The Times assumed that the rates have now turned upward and that if they continue upward the reason must be basic service cuts It is extremely doubtful whether anything can be inferred from a number of states exhibiting a rise in infant mortality rates from one year to the next for while it is true that nationwide rates have been declining steadily for many years state statistics will frequently show this type of rise For example data from the National Center for Health Statistics show that while the infant mortality rate rose in 15 states from 1980 to 1981 it also rose from one year to the next in an average of 12 states per year over the past 10 years and in three of those years the number of states exceeded 15 In addition provisional data from the state vital statistics offices indicate that in six of seven states cited by the Washington group the infant mortality rates had resumed their downward trend in 1982 Although infant mortality has been called a sensitive barometer of the social economic and medical wellbeing of a society because it is subject to so many factors it is very difficult to determine the effect of one or several of these factors over the others In addition to socioeconomic conditions such factors as the body build and smoking habits of the mother along with her age and the number of infants she has had all have their effect on infant mortality It is also likely that increased availability of abortion tends to decrease the infant mortality rate especially for very young women and for older women who often have small premature highrisk infants Indeed if the infant mortality rate should show a significant increase in the future it is possible that a decrease in access of the needy to abortion services may play a major role The American people are not well served by those who on the basis of inadequate data claim that our Government is allowing infants to die On the other hand it is the responsibility of the Administration to support potentially harmful budgetary policies with concrete assurances that they represent no danger to the mothers and infants of this country On such vital issues the public deserves to be treated by both sides to more than advocacy posing as evidence LEROY L SCHWARTZ MD Princeton March 3 1983 The writer is president of the Princeton Institute for Health Policy Inc
AROUND THE NATION; Nun Defends Financing Of Abortions in Michigan,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/around-the-nation-nun-defends-financing-of-abortions-in-michigan.html,A nun ordered by her archbishop to resign as Michigans welfare director told a legislative hearing today that her conscience permitted her to carry out a law under which the state paid for abortions for the poor For those of us that are prolife we have the obligation to be convincing and not condemning in conveying our beliefs said Sister Agnes Mary Mansour who is awaiting confirmation as state director of social services There is the need for a change of attitude relative to abortion that I feel will be more greatly delayed without such sensitivity and openness to some flexibility she told legislators at her confirmation hearing That is why although I am opposed to abortion I can tolerate Medicaid funding for abortion through the Department of Social Services
REAGAN IN THE PULPIT; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/reagan-in-the-pulpit-news-analysis.html,Talking of morality to a degree that Presidents usually avoid President Reagan yesterday adhered not only to oldfashioned religion but to oldfashioned political wisdom Dance with the girl you came in with Before he got to the nuclear freeze issue and the opposite poles of a Godfearing America and a Godless Soviet Union Mr Reagans speech to the National Association of Evangelicals meeting in Orlando Fla sounded the themes that won him support and votes from the socalled religious right in his 1980 election In speaking forcefully against abortion and for prayer in school to identifying himself as one of the many Godfearing dedicated noble men and women in public life Mr Reagan appealed to a constituency that seemed after his election to have retired to the political sidelines To Paul Weyrich a conservative who has urged Mr Reagan to hew to the social issues that drew ordinarily nonvoting evangelicals to the polls in 1980 yesterdays speech might as well have been a declaration of candidacy That view was backed by a highranking Republican strategist who spoke on the condition that his name not be used He said It could fairly be interpreted as another in a series of signals that a candidate is talking Moral Arguments Against Freeze Mr Weyrich who heads the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said he told Mr Reagan personally Monday to stress the moral arguments against a nuclear freeze He also said If Ronald Reagan had sounded like that in 1982 the Republicans wouldnt have lost as many seats as they did Mr Reagans campaigning for Congressional Republicans last November concentrated on a defense of his economic policies and a plea to stay the course he had charted There was little evidence of interest in the election or voting from the white Protestant evangelicals who appeared to have registered and voted in unusually heavy numbers only two years before But yesterday Mr Reagan sounded like the candidate who in 1980 said in a Dallas speech The First Amendment was written not to protect the people and their laws from religious values but to protect those values from government tyranny In Orlando yesterday he said Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God acknowledged When our Founding Fathers passed the First Amendment they sought to protect churches from government interference They never meant to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself Pledge on School Prayer That passage introduced a pledge to campaign for a Constitutional amendment to allow organized prayer in public schools Let our children pray Mr Reagan said He also promised to fight in the courts recent judicial decisions that have prevented his Administration from informing the parents of young people who get contraceptives from family planning clinics that receive Federal aid Mr Reagan complained that the critics voices were louder than ours on this issue but he insisted The rights of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washingtonbased bureaucrats and social engineers National polls do not identify clearly the beliefs of the audience to whom his appeal for and promise of support were directed But last September a New York TimesCBS News Poll found that white Protestants who said they attended church weekly or almost every week did indeed support school prayer and oppose abortion more strongly than the rest of the public In a survey of registered voters 79 percent of the churchgoers backed a school prayer amendment Only 62 percent of the others surveyed said they did Thirtysix percent of the Protestants said they favored a constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion as against 25 percent of the others in the poll Most Approve of Arms Control But this group which in the poll included more people than some other surveys might identify as Mr Reagans primary audience yesterday was only barely less approving of a freeze on the deployment and production of nuclear weapons Sixtyfour percent of the white Protestant churchgoers supported a freeze while 70 percent of the others surveyed did However Mr Reagan sought to connect his audiences religious concerns with his opposition to a freeze going easily from we will never abandon our belief in God to asserting that a freeze would be tolerable only if it would freeze the Soviets global desires Even so one highranking Republican strategist said yesterday that all these issues were important to strengthening Mr Reagans ties to the religious conservatives who were part of his 1980 base The speech had its fire and brimstone moments which the strategist said was important to reigniting the coalition Another conservative however indicated the ambivalence with which the political right has viewed the President cannot be washed away with a single speech Richard Viguerie the direct mail specialist and publisher of Conservative Digest praised Mr Reagan for moralizing and sermonizing on vital issues But he added The President has always been very good at giving the conservatives their rhetoric It remains to be seen if the White House staff will stay the Presidents course and fight for these issues
REAGAN DENOUNCES IDEOLOGY OF SOVIET AS 'FOCUS OF EVIL',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/reagan-denounces-ideology-of-soviet-as-focus-of-evil.html,President Reagan denouncing Soviet Communism as the focus of evil in the modern world today warned Protestant church leaders not to treat the arms race as a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong good and evil Appearing before a convention of evangelical Christians the President delivered one of the most forceful speeches of his Administration on the subjects of theology and war morality and government In what White House aides privately said was something of a rebuttal to recent criticism of Administration policy by church officials notably the Roman Catholic hierarchy Mr Reagan delighted his audience by declaring In your discussion of the nuclear freeze proposals I urge you to beware the temptation of pride  the temptation of blithely declaring yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire Very Dangerous Fraud In an addition to his prepared text the President used some of his strongest language in again rejecting as a very dangerous fraud calls for a nuclear freeze without additional Soviet arms reductions That is merely the illusion of peace he said The reality is that we must find peace through strength He continued A freeze at current levels of weapons would remove any incentive for the Soviets to negotiate seriously at Geneva and virtually end our chances to achieve the major arms reductions which we have proposed The speech to the National Association of Evangelicals received a standing ovation in the Sheraton convention center as the orchestra played Onward Christian Soldiers The President also issued renewed calls for Federal laws that would restrict abortions and permit organized prayer in public schools But the strongest thrust of his address appeared to be his response to unspecified church leaders who have criticized his foreign policy Simpleminded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly Mr Reagan said as he discussed the nuclear freeze issue It means the betrayal of our past the squandering of our freedom The President argued in effect that his national security goals were parallel to with the nations founding spiritual values He echoed a debating point of the past in praising as a profound truth a young father whom Mr Reagan said he once heard discussing Communism with his daughters I would rather see my little girls die now still believing in God than have them grow up under Communism and one day die no longer believing in God There was strong applause as Mr Reagan the President delivered this line with dramatic emphasis and an undertone of cheers could be heard in the hall too Let us pray for the salvation of all those who live in that totalitarian darkness the President Mr Reagan said adding that Americans also must not forget that Communists are the focus of evil in the modern world He then criticized unidentified people individuals who he said would have the nation accept Communists at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses So I would urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority Mr President Reagan continued Catholic hurch Stands on Freeze The National Conference of Catholic Bishops is scheduled to vote in May on a final draft of a pastoral letter on the arms race Earlier drafts have endorsed a twowaybilateral nuclear freeze and the final version is expected to include such a statement Many Protestant denominations have taken similar stands against nuclear arms Last month in another major statement the Synagogue Council of America representing six leading groups of Conservative Reform and Orthodox organizations asserted that the United States was morally bound to reduce the danger of nuclear war The statement further urged Mr President Reagan and the Soviet leader Yuri V Andropov to seek a total cessation of production and deployment of nuclear weapons In discussing domestic issues that have been dormant induring the Administrations recent budget troubles Mr Reagan the President stressed a full list of social proposals being pressed in the Congress by conservative legislators lawmakers and church leaders No one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex Mr Reagan said in asserting complaining that sexually active hads replaced promiscuous as a description of for some girls He Mr Reagan defended the socalled squeal rule proposed by his Administration and enjoined temporarily by two Federal judges under which parents must be notified when children receive contraceptive help from Federally aided clinics The rule has been and temporarily enjoined blocked temporarily by two Federal judges Court Fight Pledged Is all of JudeoChristian tradition wrong Mr Reagan asked drawing strong applause as he added We are going to fight in the courts The rights of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washingtonbased bureaucrats and social engineers In quick order with his comments punctuated by the crowds frequent applause Mr Reagan urged these steps  A renewed fight for a constitutional amendment for organized public school prayer Let our children pray he said  A renewed fight to end abortion on demand He said You and I must never rest he said until abortion is outlawed  Congressional hearings on infanticide legislation to protect the handicapped against mercy killing Mr Reagan The President said this was a growing problem directly related to a decline in respect for human life generated caused by the growing prevalence of abortion Enjoined by Scripture There is sin and evil in the world the President Mr Reagan declared And we are enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might The President He called on the Christian preachers to use their pulpits to denounce hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice The gathering applauded in approval The National Association of Evangelicals is the largest umbrella group for conservative Protestants Formed in 1942 it is a loosely knit organization of 38000 individuals and church groups from 40 denominations with a total membership of 35 million While members affirm central religious beliefs common among evangelicals the association has generally refrained from taking strong stands on social issues But an activist group has been gaining strength within the association in recent years Many in the group called Evangelicals for Social Action have pressed the association to consider making an antinuclear statement In May the activists plan a large conference ion Pasadena Calif on the subject of war and peace
EXCERPTS FROM PRESIDENT'S SPEECH TO NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF EVANGELICALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/09/us/excerpts-from-president-s-speech-to-national-association-of-evangelicals.html,Following are excerpts from the text of President Reagans speech as prepared for delivery here today to the National Association of Evangelicals This Administration is motivated by a political philosophy that sees the greatness of America in you her people and in your families churches neighborhoods communities  the institutions that foster and nourish values like concern for others and respect for the rule of law under God Now I dont have to tell you that this puts us in opposition to or at least out of step with a prevailing attitude of many who have turned to a modernday secularism discarding the tried and timetested values upon which our very civilization is based No matter how wellintentioned their value system is radically different from that of most Americans And while they proclaim they are freeing us from superstitions of the past they have taken upon themselves the job of superintending us by government rule and regulation Sometimes their voices are louder than ours but they are not yet a majority An example of that vocal superiority is evident in a controversy now going on in Washington Since Im involved Ive been waiting to hear from the parents of young America How far are they willing to go in giving to government their prerogatives as parents Let me state the case as briefly and simply as I can An organization of citizens sincerely motivated and deeply concerned about the increase in illegitimate births and abortions involving girls well below the age of consent established clinics nationwide to offer help to these girls and hopefully alleviate this situation Order on Birth Control Clinics Again let me say I do not fault their intent However in their wellintentioned effort these clinics provide advice and birth control drugs and devices to underage girls without the knowledge of their parents For some years now the Federal Government has helped with funds to subsidize these clinics In providing for this the Congress decreed that every effort would be made to maximize parental participation Nevertheless the drugs and devices are prescribed without getting parental consent or giving notification Girls termed sexually active  that has replaced the word promiscuous are given this help in order to prevent illegitimate birth or abortion We have ordered clinics receiving Federal funds to notify the parents such help has been given One of the nations leading newspapers has created the term squeal rule in editorializing against us and we are being criticized for violating the privacy of young people A judge has granted an injunction against enforcement of our rule I have watched TV panel shows discuss this issue have read columns pontificating on our error but no one seems to mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex Is all of JudeoChristian tradition wrong Are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm And isnt it the parents right to give counsel and advice to keep their children from making mistakes that may affect their entire lives Many of us in government would like to know what parents think about this intrusion in their family by government We are going to fight in the courts The rights of parents and the rights of family take precedence over those of Washingtonbased bureaucrats and social engineers Rule of Law Under God But the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy Freedom prospers when religion is vibrant and the rule of law under God acknowledged When our Founding Fathers passed the First Amendment they sought to protect churches from government interference They never meant to construct a wall of hostility between government and the concept of religious belief itself The evidence of this permeates our history and our government The Declaration of Independence mentions the Supreme Being no less than four times In God We Trust is engraved on our coinage the Supreme Court opens its proceedings with a religious invocation and the members of Congress open their sessions with a prayer I just happen to believe the schoolchildren of the United States are entitled to the same privileges as Supreme Court Justices and Congressmen Last year I sent the Congress a constitutional amendment to restore prayer to public schools This week I am resubmitting that amendment and calling on the Congress to act speedily to pass it Let our children pray Perhaps some of you read recently about the Lubbock school case where a judge actually ruled that it was unconstitutional for a school district to give equal treatment to religious and nonreligious student groups even when the group meetings were held during the students own time The First Amendment never intended to require government to discriminate against religious speech Senators Denton and Hatfield have proposed legislation in the Congress on the whole question of prohibiting discrimination against religious forms of student speech Such legislation could go far to restore freedom of religious speech for public school students and I hope the Congress considers these bills quickly And with your help I think its possible we could also get the constitutional amendment through the Congress this year Court Decision on Abortion More than a decade ago a Supreme Court decision literally wiped off the books of 50 states statutes protecting the rights of unborn children Abortion on demand now takes the lives of up to one and a half million unborn children a year Human life legislation ending this tragedy will someday pass the Congress  and you and I must never rest until it does Unless and until it can be proven that the unborn child is not a living entity then its right to life liberty and the pursuit of happiness must be protected You may remember that when abortion on demand began many indeed Im sure many of you warned that the practice would lead to a decline in respect for human life that the philosophical premises used to justify abortion on demand would ultimately be used to justify other attacks on the sacredness of human life infanticide or mercy killing Tragically enough those warnings proved all too true Only last year a court permitted the death by starvation of a handicapped infant I have directed the Health and Human Services Department to make clear to every health care facility in the United States that the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 protects all handicapped persons against discrimination based on handicaps including infants And we have taken the further step of requiring that each and every recipient of Federal funds who provides health care services to infants must post and keep posted in a conspicuous place a notice stating that discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by Federal law It also lists a 24hour tollfree number so that nurses and others may report violations in time to save the infants life Problem of Infanticide In addition recent legislation introduced in the Congress by Representative Henry Hyde not only increases restrictions on publicly financed abortions it also addresses this whole problem of infanticide I urge the Congress to begin hearings and to adopt legislation that will protect the right of life to all children including the disabled or handicapped Im sure you must get discouraged at times but there is a great spiritual awakening in America a renewal of the traditional values that have been the bedrock of Americas goodness and greatness One recent survey by a Washingtonbased research council concluded that Americans were far more religious than the people of other nations 95 percent of those surveyed expressed a belief in God and a huge majority believed the Ten Commandments had real meaning for their lives Another study has found that an overwhelming majority of Americans disapprove of adultery teenage sex pornography abortion and hard drugs And this same study showed a deep reverence for the importance of family ties and religious belief I think the items we have discussed here today must be a key part of the nations political agenda For the first time the Congress is openly and seriously debating and dealing with the prayer and abortion issues  thats enormous progress right there I repeat America is in the midst of a spiritual awakening and a moral renewal With your biblical keynote I say today let justice roll on like a river righteousness like a neverfailing stream Now obviously much of this new political and social consensus I have talked about is based on a positive view of American history one that takes pride in our countrys accomplishments and record But we must never forget that no government schemes are going to perfect man we know that living in this world means dealing with what philosophers would call the phenomenology of evil or as theologians would put it the doctrine of sin National Legacy of Evil There is sin and evil in the world and we are enjoined by Scripture and the Lord Jesus to oppose it with all our might Our nation too has a legacy of evil with which it must deal The glory of this land has been its capacity for transcending the moral evils of our past For example the long struggle of minority citizens for equal rights once a source of disunity and civil war is now a point of pride for all Americans We must never go back There is no room for racism antiSemitism or other forms of ethnic and racial hatred in this country I know you have been horrified as have I by the resurgence of some hate groups preaching bigotry and prejudice Use the mighty voice of your pulpits and the powerful standing of your churches to denounce and isolate these hate groups in our midst The commandment given us is clear and simple  Thou shalt love thy neighbor as thyself But whatever sad episodes exist in our past any objective observer must hold a positive view of American history a history that has been the story of hopes fulfilled and dreams made into reality Especially in this century America has kept alight the torch of freedom  not just for ourselves but for millions of others around the world And this brings me to my final point today During my first press conference as President in answer to a direct question I pointed out that as good MarxistsLeninists the Soviet leaders have openly and publicly declared that the only morality they recognize is that which will further their cause which is world revolution I think I should point out I was only quoting Lenin their guiding spirit who said in 1920 that they repudiate all morality that proceeds from supernatural ideas or ideas that are outside class conceptions morality is entirely subordinate to the interests of class war and everything is moral that is necessary for the annihilation of the old exploiting social order and for uniting the proletariat Fact of Soviet Doctrine I think the refusal of many influential people to accept this elementary fact of Soviet doctrine illustrates an historical reluctance to see totalitarian powers for what they are We saw this phenomenon in the 1930s we see it too often today This does not mean we should isolate ourselves and refuse to seek an understanding with them I intend to do everything I can to persuade them of our peaceful intent to remind them that it was the West that refused to use its nuclear monopoly in the 40s and 50s for territorial gain and which now proposes 50 percent cuts in strategic ballistic missiles and the elimination of an entire class of landbased intermediaterange nuclear missiles At the same time however they must be made to understand we will never compromise our principles and standards We will never give away our freedom We will never abandon our belief in God A number of years ago I heard a young father addressing a tremendous gathering in California It was during the time of the Cold War when Communism and our own way of life were very much on peoples minds He was speaking to that subject Suddenly I heard him saying I love my little girls more than anything in the world but I would rather see them and I thought  oh no not that But I had underestimated him He went on I would rather see them die now still believing in God than have them grow up under Communism and one day die no longer believing in God There were thousands of young people in that audience They came to their feet with shouts of joy They recognized the profound truth in what he had said Let us pray for the salvation of all those who live in that totalitarian darkness  pray they will discover the joy of knowing God Evil in the Modern World But until they do let us be aware that while they preach the supremacy of the state declare its omnipotence over individual man and predict its eventual domination of all peoples of the earth  they are the focus of evil in the modern world It was CS Lewis who in his unforgettable Screwtape Letters wrote The greatest evil is not now done in those sordid dens of crime that Dickens loved to paint It is not done even in concentration camps and labor camps In those we see its final result But it is conceived and ordered moved seconded carried and minuted in clear carpeted warmed and welllighted offices by quiet men with white collars and cut fingernails and smoothshaven cheeks who do not need to raise their voice Because these quiet men do not raise their voices because they sometimes speak in soothing tones of brotherhood and peace because like other dictators before them they are always making their final territorial demand some would have us accept them at their word and accommodate ourselves to their aggressive impulses But if history teaches anything it teaches Simpleminded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly  it means the betrayal of our past the squandering of our freedom So I urge you to speak out against those who would place the United States in a position of military and moral inferiority You know I have always believed that old Screwtape reserves his best efforts for those of you in the church So in your discussions of the nuclear freeze proposals I urge you to beware the temptation of pride  the temptation blithely to declare yourselves above it all and label both sides equally at fault to ignore the facts of history and the aggressive impulses of an evil empire to simply call the arms race a giant misunderstanding and thereby remove yourself from the struggle between right and wrong good and evil Nuclear Arms Negotiations I ask you to resist the attempts of those who would have you withhold your support for this Administrations efforts to keep America strong and free while we negotiate real and verifiable reductions in the worlds nuclear arsenals and one day with Gods help their total elimination While Americas military strength is important let me add here that I have always maintained that the struggle now going on for the world will never be decided by bombs or rockets by armies or military might The real crisis we face today is a spiritual one at root it is a test of moral will and faith Whittaker Chambers the man whose own religious conversion made him a witness to one of the terrible traumas of our age the HissChambers case wrote that the crisis of the Western world exists to the degree in which the West is indifferent to God the degree to which it collaborates in Communisms attempt to make man stand alone without God For MarxismLeninism is actually the second oldest faith he said first proclaimed in the Garden of Eden with the words of temptation Ye shall be as gods The Western world can answer this challenge he wrote but only provided that its faith in God and the freedom He enjoins is as great as Communisms faith in man I believe we shall rise to this challenge I believe that Communism is another sad bizarre chapter in human history whose last pages even now are being written I believe this because the source of our strength in the quest for human freedom is not material but spiritual and because it knows no limitation it must terrify and ultimately triumph over those who would enslave their fellow

HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/10/garden/hers.html,MY hobby is acting out Civil War battles the commuting businessman tells his fellow passenger on the New YorktoPittsburgh run What do you get out of it Well you know how you get the feeling that you just want to blast a guy I get to do that every weekend His enthusiasm reaches volcanic proportions Guys come from all over We have real Yankees real Rebels and real cannons I am on my way to Erie Pa to interview Sister Joan Chittister OSB PhD prioress of the Benedictine Sisters of Erie who sees in the nuclear arms race all the male values of the society run amok Like our bornagain Civil War hero I boarded this plane after hearing talk among church leaders and peace groups that it was Sister Joans protest that brought the bishops back to the table to strengthen the stand they had taken in the first draft of the Bishops Pastoral Letter on Nuclear Disarmament I dont know if anyone ever read what I wrote she is to assert But their second draft does address every issue I raised Upon arrival I am greeted by a 46yearold woman with brown curly hair who is not in a habit Her bright eyes fasten on mine and lock them in place There is no ignoring this presence She throws her arms around me in welcome grabs my hand and runs to breakfast to meet a group of sisters eager to hear about her recent week of meetings with some of the countrys foremost feminists at Stanford University Her own feminism she describes as not antimarriage antimothering antimale but a commitment to the dignity and equality of opportunity of all people She laughs with the pleasure that seems boundless in her soulBefore I arrived at Stamford some of the women were concerned that a nun would not be able to cope with the high intellectual demands of the meetings The rest of the sisters whoop with glee for they know that their prioress is a genius She also has the energy of a race horse and unshakable commitment Im very hardnosed she said of herself You cant call me a romanticist I wont permit that kind of flattery Im just entirely too mean and too stubborn to allow the corruption of military thinking to go unchallenged Although she has been a major force in the Roman Catholic Church as president of the Conference of American Benedictine Prioresses past president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious and a delegate to the White House Religious Conference on SALT II it was her article in the August 1982 edition of Commonweal and the bishops purported response to it that have brought her national attention She took the bishops to task for failing to be morally absolute in their repudiation of the manufacture or use of nuclear weapons She wrote that she was troubled by the contrasting ease with which they were able to take a clear stand against abortion What is a woman to think she asked That when life is in the hands of a woman then to destroy it is always morally wrong But when all life is in the hands of men then destruction can be theologized Did it take great courage for a nun to challenge bishops in this way She responds We must all become models of holy disobedience We must say that Peacekeeper is a lie for Death Reaper  When asked about separation of church and state her eyes flash she begins to walk around the room When bishops bless bombs salute the flag and pay taxes nobody says the church shouldnt be involved in politics But when a church begins to talk about the destruction of the planet then they say bishops religious and priests should stay in the pulpit should mind their prayers should concentrate on mercy and forget the obstacles to justice Tell that to Jeremiah and Daniel to Deborah and Judith for me I am reminded of a comment by Sister Mary Lou Kownacki who says of her prioress When she articulates a point its helpful to imagine a Roman candle that starts with a slow burn quickly bursts into a series of sparks and then shoots into the sky exploding into myriad colors Thats what is happening before my eyes as we sit in her study and discuss deterrence She pulls a chart down from her bookshelf lined with treatises on monasticism feminism pacifism and oil wells one dug on the convent property had a strike This was drafted by Geier and Green for Christianity and Crisis Dec 13 1982 she said It is a typology of the present nuclear environment She points to a page that consists of 121 dimesize squares each filled with dots Each dot represents three million tons of TNT the amount of firepower used in all of World War II The total number of dots 6000 represents the number of megatons existing in the world She points to three encircled dots These represent the fire power of one American Poseidon submarine or the equivalent of three World War IIs It is capable of destroying the major and minor cities of Soviet Russia We have 31 Poseidons Geier and Green say that if you put a dime any place on this chart you will have identified enough firepower to destroy the entire planet She leans toward me so that there is no chance that her words might get lost in the space between us Tell me she asks what will you do with the rest of your dimes Although she cannot pinpoint what brought her to this calling this conviction the elements become apparent as we talk She was a sensitive and bright child growing up in a world that had just experienced the Holocaust and the dropping of the bomb on Hiroshima She remembers being told when she was in fifth grade that if a bomb were dropped there would be no escaping it And then my teacher said Isnt it lucky that we are the only ones who have the bomb And I remember thinking No because we dropped it To this day whenever I hear that we will never use nuclear weapons I always think But we did we did  We can now eliminate a culture as easily as the Nazis exterminated the Jews she comments But this time I want there to be evidence that some Christians said no Her Benedictine tradition demands a commitment to peace It was Benedictines who provided sanctuary during medieval wars she said It is Benedictines whose most ancient motto was Pax  She has come to realize she says that to be monastic is not to be cloistered but to have burning eyes and a steel voice As a Benedictine I am compelled to face the nuclear issue Its a nice image  a nun bringing the military complex to its knees She departs for a news conference in town The black community has asked various local leaders to attend the conference in support of a black woman lawyer whose appointment to the County Commission of Industrial Management has been stalled All but Joan refuse Everyone is terribly polite The local NAACP representative assures the commission and the press that this is not a racial issue Sister Joan who has been growing increasingly agitated suddenly jumps to her feet Of course its racial And furthermore its sexist The world is not white and the world is not male and when institutions dont reflect the various perspectives of the communities they purport to represent then they are institutionally racist and sexist She is amazed by the standing ovation that begins and does not end She later explains her outburst I just cant stand pussyfooting As she moves to leave the audience parts to open a path arms reach out to pat her on the shoulder An elderly black woman steps forth embraces her and says Youre some woman Sister Joan You are some woman

REAGAN'S JAB AT RUSSIANS; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/10/world/reagan-s-jab-at-russians-news-analysis.html,President Reagans denunciation of a nuclear freeze and of the Kremlin as the focus of evil in the world is viewed by some politicians as the keynote of a drive to induce Congress to approve a large rise in military spending and to deflect pressures for what Mr Reagan sees as undesirable concessions to Moscow Other politicians called his speech on Tuesday before a convention of Evangelical Christians in Orlando Fla a vintage Reagan performance intended to mend fences with disgruntled rightwing supporters Some said it might have a wider unintended impact There are Democrats who fear that the Presidents polemics may harm the armscontrol negotiations with the Soviet Union Others rankled by Mr Reagans attack on a nuclear freeze as a very dangerous fraud said his comments would further polarize the national debate on arms issues May Get Peoples Backs Up That speech is going to get peoples backs up said Senator Claiborne Pell a Rhode Island Democrat And Senator Joseph Biden of Delaware another Democrat commented The President either does not understand what the American people are saying or he is deliberately misrepresenting it when he says the freeze is unilateral disarmament To the degree that the speech will influence debate on these policies it can only serve to polarize that debate further Pursuing the offensive the Pentagon has now issued a booklet asserting that the Soviet Union has not slowed its military buildup  despite some recent intelligence readings to the contrary and is bent on achieving military superiority in all fields This touched off a tart reaction in Moscow Sentiment Against Arms Increase In Congress Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader sought to postpone committee work on the 1984 budget to give Mr Reagan and Defense Secretary Caspar W Weinberger more time to make their case for a 10 percent real increase in military spending after inflation But other Republicans objected and the Budget Committee will start work next week with sentiment running against accepting much more than half the proposed Pentagon increase The tone of Mr Reagans Orlando speech may also have ramifications in Western Europe where it may be seen as running counter to expectations that he might come forward with a new proposal in the Geneva talks on mediumrange nuclear systems in Europe Foreign Minister Emilio Colombo of Italy who is visiting here said he would urge Mr Reagan in a meeting on Sunday to make a new arms offer In Orlando Mr Reagan said he would do everything I can to persuade Moscow of our peaceful intent and desire for arms reduction But his hardline thrust marked a departure from other speeches notably one to the American Legion on Feb 22 signaling flexibility in the armscontrol talks A Persistent Theme in Office Mistrust toward Soviet motives and morality has been one of Mr Reagans persistent themes since taking office though some advisers told him in recent months that polemical attacks only irked the Russians and intruded on the arms negotiations Mr Reagans latest jabs were a throwback to 1980 campaign speeches and to comments reportedly made to staff members and visitors In the context of the Evangelical convention the jabs against Moscow matched the fireandbrimstone tenor of his remarks on abortion school prayer and the nuclear freeze Nor was the shift in tone uncharacteristic Mr Reagan has proven to be a more complex figure than both his supporters and his critics had imagined One trademark has been his oscillation between between toughness and pragmatic compromise between dogmatic ideological speeches that echo his years as a missionary conservative and politically realistic pronouncements that bear the mark of careful deliberations within his Administration Irritation at Catholic Bishops His denunciation of a nuclear freeze as the illusion of peace that would reward Moscow for its buildup remove incentives for Soviet concessions at Geneva and divert us completely from arms reduction seemed as much a matter of pique at his opponents as a rallying cry for his supporters His comments about opposition from within the church seemed to reflect irritation at the National Conference of Catholic Bishops which plans a vote in May on a nuclear freeze Simpleminded appeasement or wishful thinking about our adversaries is folly Mr Reagan said More broadly he was making the case for carrying on his military buildup in 1984 to enable his negotiators to bargain from strength He said any domestic opposition undercutting this strategy was helpful to Moscow In this context some politicians said Soviet officials had grown as accustomed to American polemics as Americans had to Soviet criticism But some said tough talk toward a new Kremlin leadership debating priorities might backfire by playing into the hands of Soviet hardliners

STATE CONSIDERS BIRTH- DEFECTS REGISTRY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/nyregion/state-considers-birth-defects-registry.html,POSSIBLY nothing haunts a mothertobe more than the fear that her baby will not be normal That fear becomes a nightmarish reality for 2 to 3 percent of the 96000 New Jersey women who give birth each year Although some birth defects are as minor as an extra tab of skin or a small blemish others involve major cosmetic flaws or physical or mental handicaps In 1981 more than 200 newborns died of congenital defects onefourth of New Jerseys infant mortality Legislators have unanimously approved a bill to set up a statewide registry to determine whether birth defects are statistically linked to such environmental factors as toxic waste sites industrial chemicals or water pollution The registry would be similar to one started for cancer in mid1979 Sponsored by Senator Daniel J Dalton Democrat of Blackwood the measure passed the Senate last November and the Assembly earlier this month Governor Kean has not indicated whether he will sign the bill Last week Senator Dalton recalled the legislation when he learned that as a result of an administrative error the Assembly had approved the bill without the amendments added by its Corrections Health and Human Services Committee The correct version is scheduled for a vote tomorrow and is expected to pass As amended the measure would require the states Department of Health to collect confidential data from healthcare facilities and providers on birth defects detected in children up to a year old in miscarried fetuses and in fetuses electively aborted after 15 weeks of gestation The 15week figure corresponds to the time that some pregnant women undergo amniocentesis in which a sample of amniotic fluid is removed and analyzed for Downs Syndrome and other serious birth defects Thus pregnancies terminated after an amniocentesis had revealed a problem would be included in the registry The Department of Health would set reporting criteria and procedures to insure strict confidentiality and compliance but could not require anyone to take a physical examination Senator Dalton said that he learned of the need for such a registry after a cluster of birth defects in Gloucester County part of his district Between January 1977 and August 1982 17 babies were born with neural tube defects In this spinal columns fail to close leading to paralysis retardation and sometimes death Among those cases were five infants with anacephaly a fatal condition in which there is a misshapen skull and virtually no brain tissue Because no birth defects registry existed investigators to confirm the cases had to review the records of every hospital used by Gloucester County residents Only 14 families were found and said Robert Smith director of the countys Department of Health the timeconsuming research uncovered no common factors in the births Another anacephalic baby has been born since State Health Department statisticians say that New Jerseys birthdefect rate appears not to exceed the national averages They acknowledge however that present reporting probably misses a significant number of cases Senator Dalton and others contend the registry would correct that We suspect that the states heavy industrialization may contribute to a higher incidence of certain types of birth defects Senator Dalton said The registry will enable the Department of Health to detect any correlation between those birth defects and the environment Dr George Halpin director of Parental and Child Health Services in the Department of Health predicted that the registry could be started at little additional administrative cost He noted that hospitals already reported birth defects to the states Special Child Health Services which replaced the old Crippled Childrens Registry Since 1930 that registry and its successor have tracked children with birth defects who needed publicly financed medical and educational services Dr Halpin said that statisticians began using the data only in the 1970s and found that they did not include late miscarriages stillborns or babies who died in the first year With the new registry we can collect morecomplete information and the department will have more leverage with hospitals and physicians who do not comply with reporting procedures said Charles Lawson a publichealth epidemiologist with the special child program Dr Halpin added that the new system also would enable his division to assess the need for special services and to see that families got good comprehensive care especially when finances are a problem  The proposed registry is supported by organizations concerned with birth defects They include the March of Dimes Birth Defects Foundation and the Human Genetics Association of New Jersey an organization of individuals involved in genetic education research and services New Jersey RighttoLife urged Senator Dalton to amend his bill to include elective abortions Although the group originally wanted the registry to cover any electively aborted fetus regardless of gestational age it accepted the 15week limitation and now supports the measure according to Rita Martin the organizations legislative coordinator The New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents a statewide group that lobbies for parental rights opposes the measure John Tomicki the associate executive coordinator called the proposed registry nothing more than malevolent eugenics It gives the Commissioner of Health too broad a power to determine what is a birth defect said Mr Tomicki who added that his organization had 4000 members and operated from a Biblical perspective He also contended that the bill would violate the doctorpatient relationship by requiring disclosure of the childs name We prefer that hospitals or clinics merely report statistics not names unless parental consent is given he said Dr Elizabeth Feuer a senior publichealth physician in the Division of Epidemiology in the states Department of Health stressed that identifying families affected by birth defects was crucial to the usefulness of the registry Suppose we do find a cluster of birth defects she said It would be very difficult to investigate its etiology if we couldnt contact patients David Troast chairman of the North Jersey chapter of the March of Dimes views the registry as an essential first step in eliminating birth defects With the information from this registry special programs can be designed and implemented with the hope of improving the outcome of pregnancy he said
DIOCESE ASSESSING 'COME HOME' CALL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/nyregion/diocese-assessing-come-home-call.html,THE Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centres Come Home for Christmas campaign was its sponsors said a success in many ways Yet its full effects they say may not be clear for months or years  Msgr Francis Maniscalco director of the Office of Catechesis and Worship suggested the campaign after reading about similar programs in New Orleans and Albany The aim of the program was to invite inactive Catholics to come home to the Christmas liturgy as well as participate in dialogues with the church In order to get in touch with Catholics not participating in church life Bishop John R McGann asked active Catholics to submit the names and addresses of friends and family members who might respond to an invitation More than 11000 names were submitted and 375 people responded to newspaper advertisements To each person Bishop McGann sent a Christmas card inviting him to attend his parishs Christmas liturgy and remembering sessions two of which included a dialogue with the Bishop Monsignor Maniscalco said the greeting was to express the Bishops concern for these people with no moral judgment on their absence from the church We tried not to make it an intrusion he said The carefully worded text also offered apologies if the card had been inadvertently sent to an active Catholic as some were The turning in of names of others apparently rankled many active Catholics as well as a number of those whose names were submitted I was insulted one woman who received the invitation said although she added that her anger was directed not at the diocese but at the person who had anonymously submitted her name The woman who did not want her name published said it bothered her to think I must be on a list somewhere Both Bishop McGann and Monsignor Maniscalco took pains to state that no lists were kept and that the names had been used only for the Christmas program I dont know how else you could address them Bishop McGann said He indicated that the approach seemed the only way to reach the inactive population effectively He added that he had received a reply from one young woman who had written Dear Bishop Who blew the whistle Monsignor Maniscalco said he had received five complaints about that aspect of the program adding that the smaller the community the more sensitive the recipients seemed Displeasure with the method of reaching out may have also kept some from responding Of the 11000 people sent cards 250 attended the first session with Bishop McGann and 50 went to each of the 13 subsequent sessions the second dialogue with the Bishop was Dec 12 when a large snowstorm hit the Island Those who attended the dialogue indicated they had stayed away from the church because of a few common issues although they represented opposite ends of the ideological spectrum For many the main area of concern centered on divorce and remarriage where they had found the churchs position too conservative For a smaller number birth control and abortion were important questions A surprising number of people according to the Bishop and Monsignor Maniscalco took issue with the church over what they saw as too liberal a trend since the Second Vatican Council Some of the disaffected have become born again Christians turning to religions with a more fundamentalist orientation Other people objecting to the use of the vernacular and similar modernizations in the liturgy have subscribed to such traditionalist groups as the Ave Maria Church of Father Gommar de Pauw in Westbury Another reason why some Catholics have slipped away Monsignor Maniscalco suggested is the mobility of our society which prevents many people from putting down roots in a community or settling into a congregation For others he said the reason might be laziness or their losing the fear of the spiritual consquences of missing Sunday mass The fact that 300000 out of 11 million Catholics on the Island are considered inactive shows that for many religion is not a high priority in their lives he added The largest group for whom names were submitted were young adults although few of them attended the sessions Monsignor Maniscalco said their absence highlighted the dearth of programs appealing to the group Of the people invited to the sessions those most likely to respond were in the 35to50 age group Many have children being raised as Catholics and attending religious instruction and services although their parents no longer go For many who feel alienated because they have been divorced and remarried the discussion groups on those topics were able to reconcile some of their differences Members of the Diocesan Tribunal explained that the annulment process had become much more open based on a deeper understanding of the psychological disposition needed for marriage Conceding there was a wide gulf on some issues Bishop McGann said Im sure we didnt answer satisfactorily all the questions that were raised I think it was sensitizing for us to hear their concerns If in our Sunday sermon we talk about the Holy Family as the ideal family unit that doesnt speak to the 50 percent of families who are no longer intact The diocese has distributed evaluation questionnaires to the parishes and it will be reviewing the responses Participants in the program felt it offered insights about the church as well as the feelings of those who came home Patricia Megale a coordinator of religious studies assisted at a session She said There was a lot of reluctance among professional Catholics  those who work for the church or are actively involved with the diocese at first to invite people back to the mess we are now We dont completely have our act together Were the best we have she said an unfinished sinful community working on being better She said it was valuable for those in the church to hear from those who had been away because we need to know what their pain has been  we need them to make us whole Any followup to the campaign will be in the parishes through discussion groups and other methods Although no strong resurgence in attendance at masses was expected or has occurred interest has been stirred Some who were invited but did not return said the program had made them stop and think about religion again The programs impact may only be evident way down the road Mrs Megale said Its flowering may be in Gods time not in ours
COLLEGE REPUBLICANS OPEN A DRIVE AGAINST STUDENT ACTIVIST GROUPS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/us/college-republicans-open-a-drive-against-student-activist-groups.html,The College Republican National Committee has started a campaign against a group of student organizations throughout the country that advocate such things as environmental and consumer protection and safety in the workplace The organizations which are known as public interest research groups and have also opposed nuclear power and supported the right to have abortions were inspired by Ralph Nader the consumer advocate and they continue to receive his encouragement Jack Abramoff national chairman of the College Republican National Committee says the groups promote leftist political ideas and are instrumental in leading antiReagan and antifree market forces on campuses In a 50page packet that went out in early February to college Republican chairmen in the 50 states and the District of Columbia the student groups are described as a major threat to democracy on American campuses and as unethical undemocratic and unconstitutional Total Smear Nader Says This is a total smear Mr Nader said The groups are as ethical as clean as democratic and as selfless as any citizens organization can be he said They are about as nonideological as you can get They deal with fundamental issues of equity justice health and safety in the consumer and environmental areas A lot of students who classify themselves as conservatives work in the groups Mr Nader also said the groups were not institutionally opposed to President Reagan but added that they opposed his position on toxic waste consumer fraud and other issues Mr Abramoff said that before the college Republicans started their national effort last month challenges of public interest research groups had already been begun on 37 campuses including the University of Michigan the University of Colorado the State University of New York at Binghamton and Florida International University He said he expected challenges to be opened on 10 other campuses in the next two weeks Two Groups Facing Lawsuits Two lawsuits have been filed opposing public interest research groups objecting to the way they are financed One was filed by a student at Rutgers University who is a college Republican and a member of the Young Americans for Freedom a conservative group Another suit was filed last month by eight students from various campuses of the State University of New York some of whom are college Republicans and some of whom are members of Young Americans for Freedom The expense of pursuing both lawsuits is being borne by the MidAtlantic Legal Foundation which is part of a network of legal offices called the National Legal Center for the Public Interest James R Richards vice president of the center said the networks purpose was to provide a balance against extremist environmentalist organizations such as the Sierra Club and consumeroriented groups such as the Nader organizations Most of the public interest research groups are financed by funds that are automatically collected from students in college registration as activity fees and support other campus activities In many cases students can demand refunds and in a few cases they have a choice at registration time on whether any of their money goes to the public interest research groups System Described as Unfair Mr Abramoff a student at Georgetown University Law School describes the system as mandatory funding and says it is unfair to students who do not share the views of those involved in the activist groups Mr Nader said the financing of all the 160 public interest chapters in 26 states was approved either by student petitions or referendums or by decisions of elected student governments They are a major expression of democracy on campus Mr Nader said Their legitimacy comes directly from the consent and support of the students According to Mr Nader the largest public interest research group is in New York It has a staff of 150 people including lawyers scientists organizers researchers and writers It also has chapters on 19 campuses and an annual budget of 25 million Onefourth of the budget comes from student contributions an aide to Mr Nader said The rest comes from foundation grants and other contributions First Groups Formed in 1971 The groups around the country are independent nonprofit corporations Mr Nader said that elect their own student boards hire their own staffs and decide what social issues they will pursue There is no national headquarters and no funds are provided by Nader organizations he added The thousands of students who work in the groups as volunteers do tasks ranging from making posters to lobbying state legislators in some cases for college credit The first of the groups were formed in 1971 at Oregon State University and the University of Minnesota Thomas A Walthen director of the public interest research group in Colorado which has units on three campuses said the groups were meant to be a major educational program on campus with the resources to get students involved in a meaningful way in public policy Mr Abramoff said the College Republican National Committee received most of its 250000 annual budget from the Republican National Committee and described college Republicans as being on the conservative side of the Republican Party Asked if the Republican National Committee approved of the college Republicans program William I Greener 3d director of communications for the Republican National Committee said To the extent that they are trying to diminish the strength of groups opposed to the President especially when those groups receive obligatory funds thats something we generally support In its information packet to state chairmen the College Republican National Commitee urges its members to criticize public interest research groups in fliers and posters to collect signatures on petitions calling for new referendums on financing and to appeal directly to campus trustees and administrators In areas where new groups are being formed the committee suggests that college Republicans call or write to school officials and hint that  our lawyers are looking into this situation  adding No school wants to be involved in court litigation that may drag on for years If that does not block the public interest research group the national committee suggests that a new organization be formed with a name such as Students Against Mandatory Fee Abuse Attack the Funding Policy At this stage the committee wrote dont attack their political leanings but attack only the funding policy It also urged college Republicans to get all groups riled up over the special treatment given to public interest research groups saying that such treatment was not fair to everyone else who has to raise money the hard way This way the committee added it doesnt look like an attack on the left by the right Steve Baldwin national projects director of the college Republicans wrote in the information packet that a successful campaign against the public interest research groups would return literally millions of dollars to students pockets Plus he said it will mean that the organized left will not have students money to lobby against President Reagan
TO FIGHT TEEN-AGE PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/13/opinion/to-fight-teen-age-pregnancy.html,Old ideas never die Unlike old soldiers they dont even fade away It is in the service of an old idea that two Federal district judges have ruled against a regulation that Governmentfunded familyplanning clinics notify parents of teenagers who obtain prescription contraceptives In Manhattan Judge Henry F Werker based his ruling on an interpretation of what Congress intended under Title X of the Health Service Act which encouraged but did not make mandatory family involvement in familyplanning services for adolescents In Washington in a separate decision based entirely on Congressional intent Judge Thomas A Flannery also struck down the notification restrictions But in 1981 Congress amended the Health Service act further in the family life amend  Eunice Kennedy Shriver is executive vice president of the Joseph P Kennedy Jr Foundation which focuses primarily on issues relating to mental retardation ments Title XX in which Congress insisted on family involvement in the sexual decisionmaking of minor children Accordingly I think the judges interpretations of Congressional intent are too narrow In Title XX Congress clearly recognized that the growing problem of adolescent pregnancy cannot be solved by the secret and wholesale distribution of contraceptives but that services encouraged by the Government should promote the involvement of parents with their adolescent children What could be more explicit an expression of intent than this If Congress had wanted to create just another system for delivering contraceptives to adolescents it would have put more millions into family planning under Title X But it did not Adolescent family life legislation obviously was intended to differentiate between services to teenagers and to adults to help young people understand their sexuality to encourage them to recognize the seriousness of starting a family to teach responsibility and to underscore the need for communication and openness between parents and children Conferring adult status on children 13 14 and 15 years old by substituting professional intervention for family involvement has been a failure in such critical areas of adolescent conduct as drug and alcohol abuse It has not worked and Congress did not intend to perpetuate it For years familyplanning agencies have secretly handed out contraceptives and the rate of adolescent pregnancy has not significantly declined Tragically it has increased among girls under 15 who most need parental involvement in learning to deal with awakening sexuality Working in the field of adolescent pregnancy for more than a decade I have spoken to hundreds of pregnant adolescents The chief reason that teenagers become pregnant is not that they lack access to contraception but as one 15yearold said Im pregnant because I want to be pregnant I could have controlled it I wanted a baby so I could love it and just make me feel good These young women engage in sex not out of grand passion but because of emotional problems school problems peer pressure and trouble at home What they need most is the support and encouragement of their families churches community institutions not official sanction to keep their problems hidden from their families In Title XX communities were challenged to develop familycentered programs In St Paul Minn teenagers get the chance to care for infants and young children at a daycare program so that they can gain an appreciation of parental responsibilities In demonstration programs in Albany NY Tacoma Wash Elkins W Va and Dorchester Mass parents attend training sessions with their teenage sons and daughters In adolescent pregnancy programs such as the one at Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore research shows that when families become involved in their pregnant teenagers lives the young women are more likely to stay in school remain off welfare get a job develop a more positive selfimage and take better care of their babies and that they are less likely to have an early repeat pregnancy If this family support works with pregnant adolescents why shouldnt it work for those not yet pregnant I challenge those who interpret our laws and regulations to recognize that Congress clearly intended that families be involved in decisions concerning their childrens health and safety I challenge professional familyplanning agencies to reject the old idea that pregnancy can be treated only by private decisions for contraception sterilization or abortion I urge them to try developing new approaches to prevention of adolescent pregnancy based not on secrecy but on trust openness strengthening of families With or without the regulations that the courts have temporarily suspended let us concentrate on positive family values and build on them instead of alienating the family from the most difficult of lifes decisions and trying to solve problems with a pill
SPANISH CHIEF'S 100 DAYS: PEACE THE KEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/world/spanish-chief-s-100-days-peace-the-key.html,Seven years of democracy have already spawned the tradition that 100 days in the life of a new administration is a time for taking stock Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez who is called President here because he heads the executive branch of government used the occasion of this anniversary today to put on his most conservative gray businessmans suit and face an auditorium full of reporters for his first news conference since assuming office Mr Gonzalez pointed to some general directions on such critical issues as the economy Spains membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization and his own involvement in the search for peace in Latin America But mostly as he answered the questions with ease and informal good humor he projected the image of moderation and reasonableness Good Contacts With Military Asked to sum up the achievements of the 100 days the 41yearold Prime Minister said it had now been shown that a Socialist Government can function in this country without trauma and in peace He neatly sidestepped a chance to eulogize Karl Marx on the 100th anniversary of his death He said he had good contacts with the Spanish military And he sought to smooth the fears of entrepreneurs by asserting that some parts of Rumasa the huge holding company taken over by the Government last month would be returned to the private sector Mr Gonzalez also backed away from setting a firm date for a public referendum on membership in the North Atlantic Treaty Organization which was a campaign pledge of the Socialists The Government has frozen Spains integration into the military structure of the alliance while reaffirming its political commitment to it The Communist Party which fared poorly in the October elections has just began a campaign to try to force the referendum Debate Called Inopportune It would be most inopportune for Spain to hold such a public debate that could contribute to EastWest tensions the Prime Minister said and he appeared to rule it out for next year as well He attacked certain sectors agitating for the referendum Only once did the Prime Minister show a flicker of annoyance when a reporter asked him to account for a mood of disillusionment in the country How can people think were going to resolve decades and decades of problems in 100 days he shot back Everyone wants a solution to everything right away Up until last month the first Socialists to come to power since before the 193639 civil war moved cautiously in bringing about the change that was their campaign slogan The Cabinet was filled largely with young moderates many with backgrounds in economics They put together a program for modernizing not radicalizing Spain The first moves were on issues that were to some extent hidden from public view tackling corruption and social security fraud trying to force bureaucrats to work full eighthour days and limiting the holders of public office to one job Dramatic Shifts Avoided At the same time the Government paid a certain homage to the military One of the first public acts of Mr Gonzalez was to visit the key armored division at Brunete outside Madrid for a wreathlaying ceremony On foreign policy the Government has avoided dramatic shifts It has continued to press for membership in the European Economic Community It laid the groundwork for negotiations with Britain over the future of Gibraltar by partly easing restrictions against the colony After minor adjustments it upheld a fiveyear treaty with Washington that grants the United States access to military bases in Spain and it appears to be following through on a major contract to purchase 84 F18A fighter planes from the American company McDonnellDouglas Within the last month the Government has taken a more assertive approach on a number of sensitive issues One is abortion which the administration is seeking to legalize in cases of rape malformation of the fetus or danger to the mothers life This has brought a strong campaign of opposition from the right and the Roman Catholic Church
ETHICS COMMISSION'S LEGACY: ANSWERS TO PAINFUL QUESTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/science/ethics-commission-s-legacy-answers-to-painful-questions.html,A presidential commission that has been wrestling with some of the most troubling ethical issues confronting modern medicine will go out of business this month leaving behind advice that is bound to be influential in helping citizens doctors scientists and political leaders find morally acceptable answers to painfully difficult questions Were parents and doctors justified in refusing lifesaving surgery to a baby who was doomed to mental retardation Definitely not according to a report that will soon be published because mental retardation is not a severe enough handicap to warrant denial of life Are cuts in Medicaid benefits to the poor an ethical way to contain healthcare costs Probably not according to a forthcoming report that caused bitter dispute on the commission with one Reagan appointee threatening to resign unless early drafts were changed and another accusing the commissions staff of writing a socialistic manifesto Should genetic screening be used to help parents abort a fetus of unwanted sex Generally not according to a report issued last week The practice would be morally suspect because it might encourage sexual prejudice undermine the virtually unconditional acceptance essential for successful parenting and foster the very dubious notion that children are artifacts to be designed by their parents Should genetic engineering be used to produce half humanhalf animal slaves to do peoples bidding That issue raises important questions about what characteristics are uniquely human the commission said last year but fortunately there is time to study the problem because the ability to create such slaves will not be available in the foreseeable future How much should a doctor tell mortally ill patients about their condition A lot more than they usually do according to a report issued last year Surveys conducted for the commission found that physicians are often unwilling to be candid but that sick patients almost universally desire all available information on their condition and treatment The commission urged better communication by doctors so that patients can participate in making decisions about their own health care Such has been the scope of issues confronted by a small group of commissioners and staff who operate under the mouthfilling title of the Presidents Commission for the Study of Ethical Problems in Medicine and Biomedical and Behavioral Research The commission was created by Congress in 1978 to extend the work of a previous commission that had dealt primarily with protecting people who serve as experimental subjects for biomedical and behavioral research The original 11 commissioners were appointed by President Carter and the group started work in January 1980 The bulk of its work has been carried out by a small fulltime staff of about a dozen professionals including lawyers sociologists ethicists doctors and policy experts backed by additional support and research staff members who operate from offices at 2000 K Street NW in the nations capital The driving force according to staff members and outside observers has been Alexander M Capron a law professor who left the University of Pennsylvania to become the commissions executive director and who will now become a professor of law ethics and public policy at the Georgetown University Law Center here The commission itself consists of 11 members appointed by the President who meet once a month to direct and discuss the staffs work By statute the commissioners are supposed to be distinguished in such fields as research medical practice ethics theology humanities and the law among other relevant professions The chairman throughout has been Morris B Abram a New York City lawyer who has been president of Brandeis University and of the American Jewish Committee The composition of the commission has changed radically over the last few years The original Carter appointees were weighted heavily with academic experts women and members of minority groups The subsequent Reagan appointees who now dominate the commission are largely white male doctors over the age of 50 Held 28 Public Meetings In carrying out its work the commission held 28 public meetings heard testimony from more than 300 witnesses sponsored scholarly studies sought advice from panels of experts and pored over pertinent reading material spending roughly 4 million in the process It produced 11 substantive reports in all The commission strove hard for consensus and largely succeeded Only one report dealing with access to health services carries a dissenting view The rest were approved unanimously But the price of consensus was occasional timidity The commission deliberately ducked the abortion issue lest it engulf the group in controversy And the report on access to health services was revised again and again after the fiscally conservative Reagan appointees clashed with the largely liberal staff The commissions most widely acclaimed and influential report so far has been its first Defining Death The report urged the law to recognize new criteria for establishing that a person has died beyond the traditional standard that heart and lung functions have stopped permanently The issue arose because medical advances allow doctors to keep the heart and lungs functioning even in patients who have irretrievably lost the capacity to breathe spontaneously If these patients were considered alive then turning off their respirators or removing a vital organ for transplantation to another patient might be deemed murder Thus the commission recommended that death be defined by an additional standard irreversible loss of all functions of the entire brain By this definition in the celebrated New Jersey case Karen Ann Quinlan would be declared alive because although permanently unconscious she has not lost all brain functions About half the states already had some form of braindeath statute and various professional groups and scholars including Mr Capron himself had proposed model laws But the commissions contribution was to develop a new model statute in cooperation with the American Bar Association the American Medical Association and the National Conference of Commissioners on Uniform State Laws and to set forth an extended explanation of its purposes thus ending the confusion caused by a multitude of competing proposals About a dozen states have already adopted the new statute And a separate set of guidelines for doctors drawn up by medical consultants to the commission was declared a landmark document by an editorial in The Journal of the American Medical Association But this early success may be less significant in the long run according to Mr Capron than the potential impact of two other reports that have not yet received wide distribution Anxiety Over GeneSplicing The first titled Splicing Life deals with issues raised by genetic engineering research It was prompted by concerns expressed by leading Roman Catholic Jewish and Protestant organizations and was presented at a Congressional hearing in November The commission found that much of the anxiety over gene splicing such as the possibility that genetic engineering might be used to remake human beings like Dr Frankensteins monster  was exaggerated But it called for the creation of an overseeing group drawn from a variety of backgrounds to keep a wary eye on the fastchanging technologies Some critics charge that the commissions genesplicing report evaded a responsibility to frame ethical rules for that distant day when scientists will be in a position to alter the very nature of man others consider the commissions call for oversight a courageous stand in opposition to scientists who fear that overseeing groups will needlessly restrict the advance of research The second potentially significant report Deciding to Forgo LifeSustaining Treatment is due to be issued later this month More than 1000 people have already requested copies and parts of the draft have already been incorporated in some medical and nursing school curriculums Issues Examined by Panel The commissions overall contribution is impossible to assess at this point because few of its reports have yet been widely circulated The panels subjects have included among others the privacy of medical information informed consent compensation for injured research subjects handling of reports of fraud or misconduct and protection for whistleblowers who reveal improper activities Comments by staff members and by outside observers suggest that the panel has done little or nothing intellectually new but that it has performed a valuable service in bringing together ideas and publishing consensus views Efforts were made at the end of the last Congress to extend the commissions life so that it could tackle a whole new batch of ethical issues in medicine and research but the attempt was abandoned However key legislators are now talking of introducing bills to establish some kind of followup group perhaps to watch over genetic engineering or to review an even broader range of ethical problems The issues raised by biomedical advances they say are not going to disappear just because the commission does
The O.M.B. Bomb-Throwers,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/15/opinion/the-omb-bomb-throwers.html,Several weeks ago the Office of Management and Budget recklessly tossed a grenade at Washingtons leftwing lobbyists But the explosion burned many of the Administrations best friends as well and touched off an outraged counterattack that left the OMB in full retreat and the White House with embarrassing questions Who authorized this nonsense and why The original idea was to restrict political advocacy by groups that receive Federal funds If Washington pays for an exhibition by say the National Center for BasketWeaving the group may charge the Government for a portion of salaries and overhead as well as the direct costs of the show But what if the head of the center spends a lot of time in Washington talking up basketweaving and hustling more Federal grants Why should taxpayers have to give general support to his lobbying The issue obviously becomes more pointed when the activity in question is abortion or welfare rights Thats why trying to defund the left has for years been part of the far rights agenda The Reagan budget office proposed a radical form of defunding prohibiting any reimbursement for overhead if more than a small part of it supports lobbying or for salaries of people who engage in lobbying even on their own time The proposed rules defined political advocacy with oceanic breadth They included efforts to affect the opinions of the general public and communications with state and local as well as Federal officials Under such rules the basketweavers would apparently not even be able to go before a zoning board without risking Federal support What OMB evidently failed to grasp was that so to defund the left would inevitably defund everyone else too trade associations service groups defense contractors Once the implications sank in a coalition of groups as diverse as the Girl Scouts and the National Association of Manufacturers rose up in fury A humiliated OMB withdrew the rules at least for now That may quiet the flap but not questions about judgment What possible case could be made for the initiative OMB refers to a Government Accounting Office report that found some family planning clinics to have used small amounts of grant money for lobbying The agency also recounts recent defense contracting scandals But that doesnt document a crisis or make clear the need for action In fact Congress already accepts some publicly supported lobbying Groups supported by taxexempt contributions may engage in limited advocacy Attempting to defund such activity down to the last penny goes so far as to raise serious First Amendment issues OMB had no business trying to use its rulemaking authority to impose so radical a policy Its hard to escape the conclusion that the bombthrowing responded more to farright ideology than to a generally recognized problem The rules have been withdrawn but the questions remain Who in the White House imagined this could be sensible public policy Why
COOKE: THE QUIET LEADER OF NEW YORK'S CATHOLICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/17/nyregion/cooke-the-quiet-leader-of-new-york-s-catholics.html,Only hours after he became Archbishop of New York in 1968 Terence Cardinal Cooke was attending a church reception in his honor when news came that the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr had been slain The tragedy in Memphis thus became the focus of his first day as the leader of the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of New York Now nearly 15 years later and with a certain diffidence the Cardinal continues to find himself at the behest of the wider world as the citys IrishAmerican community is divided over the selection of a supporter of the Irish Republican Army as grand marshal of todays St Patricks Day Parade His associates say that by background and temperament the Cardinal who turned 62 years old March 1 would rather concentrate on local church issues than plunge into national or world affairs When in Rome he longs to get back to New York In the company of other bishops from the United States according to those who have seen him he sometimes seems to be less effective as a leader A Cheery Outlook The Cardinal prefers to work quietly behind the scenes shaping policies over a long time and allowing considerable discussion among various church groups according to associates He works prodigiously listens carefully follows Vatican guidelines scrupulously and retains a cheery outlook His associates say he wants to believe the best about people He wants to find good people to work with an official said rather than take on the bad guys He doesnt like to admit the existence of problems said Msgr Florence D Cohalan author of a history of the archdiocese that will soon be published Hes the most ebullient man youd meet Some church leaders say that the Cardinal dislikes confrontation and that his desire to find amicable solutions through lengthy consultations sometimes masks a quality of indecisiveness Efforts to Unify Church Among the 18 million Catholics in the archdiocese he has been widely lauded for his efforts to unify a church still in the throes of the major changes introduced by the Second Vatican Council The archdiocese which includes Manhattan the Bronx Staten Island and seven upstate counties has undergone dramatic shifts during the last 15 years The majority of its constituents now live in the suburbs the number of Hispanic Catholics has steadily risen and the number of priests has dramatically declined Those close to him say he is most at home as an administrator He loves annual reports said one of several officials who asked that their names not be used He can sit with a 70page memo on how to rescue the hospitals and master it He has a terrific memory for such things The Cardinal has fully engrossed himself in the task of administering the archdiocese associates say Last year according to one aide he attended 200 board meetings of organizations sponsored by the archdiocese sometimes rushing from one to another As some prelates have increasingly addressed such national and global problems as poverty nuclear arms and abortion Cardinal Cooke too has been pressed to expand his involvement Because of his Irish heritage and the large number of IrishCatholic New Yorkers the problems of Northern Ireland have never been far away although until now he has managed to stay above the fray Meanwhile he has led the American Catholic Church hierarchy in its fight against legalized abortion And on nucleararms issues he has been a conservative voice who has argued that nuclear deterrence can be tolerated as a step toward meaningful negotiations Some fellow bishops privately believe that he should be removed as head of the New York region of the National Conference of Catholic bishops They say a new leadership would be able to develop a stronger role for the region in setting a national agenda for the bishops Last November in a closeddoor meeting a group of bishops within the New York region voted on his removal The Cardinal prevailed 13 to 12 He has approached the problem of the St Patricks Day Parade in a manner that tells much about his style of leadership Faced with a grand marshal who openly supports the Irish Republican Army Michael Flannery the Cardinal issued a statement denouncing IRA violence and urging his divided flock to seek harmony At the same time however he refrained from personal criticism of the parade committees choice and did not say whether he would review the parade from the steps of St Patricks Cathedral as he usually does In trying to steer a balanced course church officials say the Cardinal was trying to keep divisions from deepening while tacitly ackowledging that he is far less able to determine the outcome of such a situation than were some of his predecessors Some church officials point out that the day of the powerhouse as the chancery was once called is over If there was really a time when a fiat was acceptable said Bishop Joseph T OKeefe the vicar general of the archdiocese that time is gone Similar Case in 1972 Seldom has the Cardinal been drawn into such a heated public debate Aides say that he was caught largely unaware by the parade committees choice and that he was angered at having been put in what he considered an untenable position He was forced to make a statement and risk increasing the dissension The Cardinal faced a similar showdown in 1972 when antiabortion groups criticized him him for inviting Gov Nelson A Rockefeller to the annual Alfred E Smith dinner after the Governor had vetoed a bill that would have repealed the statee liberalized abortion law Cardinal Cooke explained that public officials have always been invited to it impartially across political lines Terence James Cooke was born on Manhattans Upper West Side and grew up in the Throggs Neck section of the Bronx His father Michael and his mother Margaret were from County Galway in Ireland In the United States His father worked first as a chauffeur and then in construction The child was baptised in Corpus Christi Church on West 121st Street and he attended the archdiocesan seminary St Josephs in Yonkers Masters in Social Work He went on to earn a masters degree in social work from Catholic University in Washington and taught at the Fordham University School of Social Work before beginning 11 years of service under Francis Cardinal Spellman first as secretary then chancellor and auxiliary bishop He regularly dined with his mentor and was chosen to become New Yorks seventh Archbishop after Cardinal Spellmans death Cardinal Cooke has declined requests to be interviewed By nature the Cardinal is a manager rather than a philosopher Though many detailed statements have been issued under his name he is not a stirring speach maker From early morning to late at night he focuses on the details that keep the archdiocese in running order The Cardinal can do many of the routine things very well said Monsignor Cohalan He was on every rung of the ladder himself When you bring him a problem he has such a phenomenal memory that his mind goes back to when he was in your job Compromise With Koch On a number of occasions the Cardinals methods have borne results For example in the early days of Mayor Kochs first term the two men met to discuss some proposals for cutting the citys reimbursements to church hospitals and treatment centers The Cardinal reportedly asked if the city really could do without the churchs care facilities and pointed out that cuts below a certain level would force the archdiocese to close many of its institutions Mayor Koch agreed that some of the proposals would indeed be unwise and some of the proposals were revised The Cardinal has impressed many Catholics with his sensitivity to the changes within the archdiocese They give him credit for allowing parishes to initiate their own programs restoring the broad range of archdiocesan institutions focusing energy on the poor and reaching out to scores of people with a touch of pastoral concern His penchant for detail has served the Cardinal well in his drive to keep the churchs schools hospitals and other service institutions financially solvent One innovation the Inner City Scholarship Fund allots over 1 million for the education of poor children and another the interparish finance program allows wealthier parishes to contribute to parishes that are unable to support themselves Social Unrest of 60s The Rev Phillip Murnion an archdiocesan parish researcher said the Cardinal had held things together as the social turbulence of the late 1960s shook the society as well as the church He managed to provide a context within which lots of viewpoints could be at home Father Murnion said At the same time Father Murnion said many Catholics in the archdiocese lack a sense of solidarity around some collective mission Among the challenges he said was to develop closer coordination between the chancery and the parishes Others within the church would like to see bolder initiatives from the top I really dont think the New York Archdiocese is nearly as impressively active as it should be a chancery official said It lacks charismatic leadership He has created a highly organized complicated bureaucracy and he is not the kind of a person who is able to transcend that The desire by some for a stronger voice is offset by the apparently deep reservoir of appreciation for those qualities that the Cardinal most easily exhibits Good Religious Leader A lot of priests comment about his being a good religious leader said the Rev John Foley chairman of the Archdiocesan senate of Clergy He gives the image of a holy man and gives a lot of time to peoples opinions People can disagree with him and his attitude is to give equal play to that and not to put them down The decline of the church as a force in an increasingly secular culture during this century has been noted by many social scientists The Cardinals associates say that he has acutely felt the effects of the shift to what one priest called a world less friendly to the church and that he will continue to try to explain Catholic views But he is primarily an inside man the priest continued He is no swinger He might like to go to a ball game or to an opera but that just wouldnt be him

BRIEFING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/21/us/briefing-046502.html,Stockmans Return David A Stockman Director of the Office of Management and Budget almost went into full eclipse 16 months ago when a magazine article revealed him as unduly candid about the Administrations economic policies In recent weeks however the White House press corps has been treated to an occasional glimpse of the budget director in action indicating that his exile if not his penance is over When President Reagan visited the briefing room last week for a personal attack on the proposed Democratic budget Mr Stockman was at his side and took all questions after the President had left The budget director had called the Democratic plan a political document and a reporter inquired Have you ever submitted a political budget No Mr Stockman snapped absolutely not The room which held Administration aides as well as reporters dissolved in a hoot of laughter The rehabilitated budget director allowed himself one brief smirk then sternly moved on to the next question Budgeting for the Primaries The vice chairman of the Federal Election Commission Lee Ann Elliott told a Senate hearing last week that the agency was assuming for budgetary purposes that 10 Presidential candidates would qualify for matching funds in the 1984 primary season Since there are only seven or eight Democratic contenders in the potential field this would mean for political purposes that there would be two or three Republican candidates either President Reagan and a challenger or two or a two or threeway contest to succeed him In fact the commission was not trying to predict that Mr Reagan would not run again or would be opposed if he did It was merely seeking to justify its request for 103 million for the fiscal year 1984 and had to make some estimate of campaign activity in order to project costs In 1980 when the Republican nomination was open and President Carter was challenged on the Democratic side 10 candidates received Federal primary subsidies Abortion PAC Assignment Mary Crisp whose support of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution cost her the cochairmanship of the Republican National Committee has taken a new assignment heading the political action committee of the National Abortion Rights Action League The group is already gearing up for the 1984 Congressional and state legislative elections raising money and organizing logistic support for candidates it favors In 1982 the group contributed more than 430000 to campaigns and helped elect eight of the 12 Senate candidates it endorsed 73 of 100 House candidates and 30 of 38 legislative candidates Officials of the league say they have not prepared any hit list of lawmakers they will attempt to defeat next time out but concede there may be some attractive targets such as Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina who has pressed thus far unsuccessfully for a Constitutional amendment prohibiting abortion Back on the Court Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania is a restless man After he was hit below the eye by an opponents squash racket 10 days ago a blow that did some bone damage doctors told him he could not play the game for six or seven weeks Mr Specter a Pennsylvania Republican heard that Dick Young a trainer for the Washington Capitals hockey team had devised a protective mask for one of his players with similar injuries On call Mr Young provided a hockey helmet with a transparent plastic visor bolted to the front and the Senator was back on the squash courts Thursday only a week after the accident For his return to combat however he chose to play Senator John H Chafee of Rhode Island rather than Senator Bob Packwood of Oregon whose racket it was that had crossed Mr Specters cheekbone Marking the TVAs 50th When you decide to commemorate the 50th anniversary of a Congressional milestone with contemporary testimony your speakers tend to be a little long in the tooth Tuesday on Capitol Hill at the formal observance of the enactment of legislation establishing the Tennessee Valley Authority one of the headliners will be Senator Jennings Randolph the 81yearold West Virginia Democrat who is the only person still in Congress who voted on the original bill Also expected are the deans of the TVA delegation Senator John C Stennis 81 and Representative Jamie L Whitten 72 both of Mississippi
WASHINGTON; WHAT'S GOING ON?,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/23/opinion/washington-what-s-going-on.html,The Center for Defense Information is a think tank in Washington that keeps a box score on the wars rebellions and other violent uprisings going on in the world Its latest report reminds us of some things were inclined to forget  In the last three years six new wars have started while only two have ended  with over four million people engaged in combat  Fortyfive of the worlds 164 nations are involved in these wars and even the CDI can merely estimate that the number of people killed ranges from one million to five million  About 500000 foreign combat troops are involved There are ten conflicts in the Middle EastPersian Gulf ten more in Asia and Africa seven in Latin America and three in Europe Five are conventional wars and 35 are internal guerrilla struggles  The United States and the Soviet Union and its satellites are the major suppliers of military arms to 13 nations now at war and in l981 the 45 nations involved in 40 conficts spent over 528 billion on their armed forces These of course are only rough estimates and cannot take into account the suffering of families or the loss of property but they may remind us of the madness and cost of violence in a world where half the human race is going to bed hungry every night We need to be reminded The facts being debated now in Washington are important How much for missiles how much for El Salvador how much for education and unemployment relief and foodstamps Its a hard call for the Ways and Means Committee in the House and the Finance Committee in the Senate Secretary of Defense Weinberger tosses around not billions but trillions for the Pentagon and President Reagan delivers sermons about the importance of religion and prayer in the schools All this is worth debating But very little is added to this debate about whats going on in these wars and rebellions what can be done to get at the causes of these conflicts  except to vote more money for more military weapons As the Center for Defense Information points out over 50000 Soviet troops invaded Afghanistan in December of 1979 over 10000 Libyan troops intervened in the civil war in Chad in December of 1980 around 100000 Israeli troops went into Lebanon in June 1982 and the cost in human life there and elsewhere is staggering According to the Center for Defense Information between one million and four million have died in Cambodia since 1970 In East Timor it has been 100000 to 250000 since 1975 In Afghanistan 100000 since 1978 In the conflict between Iran and Iraq 80000 to 100000 since 1980 In Lebanon nobody knows And this of course is not all In past centuries we had religious wars between believers in conflicting faiths now we have religious wars between people who believe more in fighting than anything else See Ireland the Indian subcontinent etc Obviously the United States Government cannot be expected to grapple with all these human and political tangles all over the world  its having a tough enough time dealing with them at home  but when you look at the spread of nuclear knowledge the outbreaks of terrorism rebellion and war you have to think more about the causes of wars rather than how to fight them or survive them the issues that tend to preoccupy the debate here now There is general agreement in Washington these days about the interdependence of the world and endless talk about economics and statistics and the world balance of trade and what to do about the consequences of world turmoil but very little about the causes of that turmoil President Reagan talks a great deal about the gross national product and about religion but very little about the sanctity of individual life  except when hes arguing against abortion We are said Archibald MacLeish the best informed people on earth We are deluged with facts but we have lost or are losing our human ability to feel them    We know with the head now by the facts by the abstractions We seem unable to know as Shakespeare knew who made King Lear cry out to blinded Gloucester on the heath You see how this world goes and Gloucester answers I see it feelingly Why we are thus impotent MacLeish added I do not know I know only that this impotence exists and that it is dangerous increasingly dangerous This apparently is what also troubles the people at the Center for Defense Information They monitor the facts of contemporary wars because they think we dont know the facts let alone feel them and they may be right

Abortion Amendment Voted by Senate Panel,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/26/us/abortion-amendment-voted-by-senate-panel.html,A proposed constitutional amendment to allow states to ban abortion was approved Thursday by a Senate subcommittee After a vote of 3 to 0 the Constitution Subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee sent the proposal to the full committee The amendment would say A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah said legal experts on both sides of the abortion issue believed this language would overturn the Supreme Courts landmark decision in 1973 legalizing abortion nationwide Senator Hatch said he expected the Judiciary Committee to consider the proposal sometime after Easter He said he had a commitment from the Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee to bring the issue to the Senate floor before the end of spring The proposed amendment approved by the subcommittee was an revised version of Senator Hatchs original proposal The approved version dropped language stating that when a state law was more restrictive than a conflicting Federal law on abortion the state law would prevail Senator Hatch said that dropping the language did not prevent states from outlawing abortions but might make the proposal more acceptable to lawmakers

CHANGING FACE OF JAPAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/27/magazine/changing-face-of-japan.html,It was 1030 at night and on the stool next to mine in the Orchid Bar of Tokyos Hotel Okura a British businessman was sipping moodily at a snifter of brandy He was he explained about to head home to London emptyhanded having failed to land a big contract because the product his company made did not meet the standards of reliability insisted upon by a potential Japanese client He ordered a second brandy and savored it in silence Then he jumped off his bar stool abruptly and just before disappearing into the night said loudly to no one in particular They are so damned efficient these people its bloody frightening The frustrated Briton was voicing a sentiment shared by most of the worlds nonJapanese population that the Japanese are incurable workaholics who uncomplainingly accept constraints that subordinate their personal interests to the achievement of collective purposes There is one country however in which this view is often dismissed as obsolete  or at least obsolescent That country somewhat ironically is Japan itself The kind of society we have had up till now cannot endure said Yoshiya Ariyoshi one of the elder statesmen of the Japanese shipping business shortly before his death last year Our youngsters nowadays are born with silver spoons in their mouths and as a result Japanese industry is doomed to be Americanized A professor at Kyoto University put the point even more succinctly We follow you Americans with a lag of about 10 years in all things  including your most counterproductive social attitudes and practices The fact is that Japanese society is changing extraordinarily quickly Arrests for drug abuse increased 20fold between 1970 and 1980 and though the crime rate in the country has actually decreased in recent years juvenile crime rose by 48 percent between 1978 and 1979 Women once the solid foundation of Japanese homelife are entering the work force in great numbers  more than half of all women over the age of 15 hold jobs and 57 percent of all working women are married In addition the movement of women into the workaday world is significantly altering childrearing practices  as of 1980 approximately onefifth of all Japanese children of 6 and younger were attending daycare centers and the percentages are growing Finally the postwar urbanization of Japan means that 87 percent of the population now lives in cities  and most inhabit tiny apartments too small to provide any privacy at all let alone the calm sanctuary that the Japanese home has symbolized for centuries Many of these changes reflect the emergence of attitudes and behavior patterns long familiar in the West  but new to Japan And all are having an impact on what most Westerners think of as immutable Japanese social and economic practices Perhaps the most significant of the changes confronting Japan is the transformation of the status of women because it affects so many different aspects of Japanese life Most Westerners believe that the Japanese male is lord of all he surveys In fact that has not been the case for a long time Even before World War II when they had almost no legal rights at all Japanese wives were not the powerless purely decorative creatures of legend I first learned the Japanese phrase for henpecked  kaka denka  in the 1940s when a Japanese friend applied it to his countrys dreaded military leader Gen Hideki Tojo To be sure a Japanese husband is rarely visibly henpecked But often he spends so little time at home that he is essentially a nocturnal boarder in his own house Partly for that reason the typical Japanese household is a rather thinly disguised matriarchy In the majority of Japanese families the husband turns over his entire salary to his wife who then doles out to him a daily allowance  usually a rather modest one  for cigarettes drinks and sundries And in most Japanese homes it is the wife who decides such matters as where the family will live what car it will buy and what schools the children will attend In one 1979 survey 41 percent of the men polled admitted they left the education and disciplining of their children entirely to their wives But now all that is changing To a great extent the fact that so many women are joining the work force simply reflects new economic realities Japanese have become avid consumers As of 1981 for example there were 14 color television sets in use in Japan for each man woman and child in the country In the United States there are only 3 color sets per household And many Japanese families now count among their necessities automatic rice cookers moneyguzzling automobiles and expensive vacations But it is not just the appetite for material possessions that has driven so many married women in Japan to find jobs Though many Japanese men will heatedly deny it their country today is in the midst of a kind of underground feminist revolution Among younger women who have been to college aspirations for significant achievement outside the home are increasingly common and aggressively pursued And in some degree at least this attitude on the part of the educated elite has been transmitted to the rest of the female population In the early 1970s polls showed that 80 percent of Japanese women believed that a husband should work and a wife should take care of the home By 1979 however only 36 percent of them still accepted that proposition and even more significantly some 60 percent of the female population had come to believe that women with the desire and ability should be allowed to enter fields previously reserved for men As in most other countries the majority of working women in Japan occupy lowerlevel jobs and are relatively poorly paid Some Japanese companies that freely employ young unmarried women deliberately ease out those who are still on the job at 27 or 28 and still others simply decline to hire women for careertrack positions in the first place Yet despite all this career prospects for Japanese women are steadily improving In recent years largely because a declining birthrate has created a shortage of new male entrants into the labor force there has been a sizable influx of women into the highly technical field of computer programming Some of the most prestigious Japanese Government agencies now routinely include at least a few women when they hire recent university graduates earmarked for the upper reaches of the bureaucracy And a growing number of women in their 30s and 40s now hold influential positions in retailing and the service industries  a matter of particular significance since these are among the fastestgrowing sectors of the Japanese economy In their struggle for equality Japans feminists have for the most part scrupulously avoided the kind of hardnosed political pressure and confrontational rhetoric that have characterized the womens movement in the United States Their methods reflect a difference in the nature of society in Japan and the United States If you want to change the social structure in Western culture explains Asahi Shimbuns Mitsuko Shimomura the first woman correspondent ever stationed abroad by a Japanese newspaper you first have to fight  to challenge the system But in our culture once you start to fight thats the end you have lost the game In Japan you have to try to do everything without big friction and to change the consensus in quiet even tricky ways And there is in fact ample evidence that in their quiet and tricky ways Japanese women have already significantly modified the national consensus on the status of women most particularly where the marital relationship is concerned To be sure traditional patterns still prevail in the great majority of Japanese marriages where the partners are middleaged or older But this sort of marriage is becoming much less prevalent among couples in their 20s and 30s More and more young Japanese husbands now spend a significant part of their free time on family activities such as weekend barbecues visits to parks and playgrounds and summer excursions to the mountains or the seashore And deference to husbandly whims is on a marked decline among younger Japanese wives A woman particularly a working woman who has decided to appease her kids by giving them spaghetti or hamburgers for dinner  those now being the favorite dishes of virtually all Japanese children  is unlikely to offer Daddy an entirely different menu The result is that a young Japanese married man who has a craving for a nice oldfashioned plate of grilled fish in soy sauce will often stop off after work at one of the burgeoning restaurants that specializes in ofukuro no aji  food like Mama used to make Even more horrifying from the traditionalists point of view is the loss of the Japanese husbands immunity to such mundane chores as dishwashing and shopping Since I sometimes cant get home in time to make dinner one young career woman confided Ive been teaching my husband how to cook for himself The idea shocks his mother but he rather seems to enjoy it One result of these changes in the roles of both women and men is a new trend in Japanese parentchild relationships Historically Japanese children under school age have enjoyed the undivided almost obsessive attention of their mothers In the traditional Japanese family an infant or toddler basks in an allembracing maternal love which at least on the surface is utterly supportive and uncritical Rarely denied a wish the child seldom has cause to cry and if he does he is immediately comforted At bedtime Mama croons him to sleep And when the family goes out in public he is indulgently forgiven for behavior that would earn most American youngsters a sharp parental reproof But permissiveness as practiced by Japanese mothers is akin to jujitsu in the sense that it turns the natural emotional responses of the child into devices for his control Specifically it fosters a sense of dependence on Mama and induces powerful feelings of guilt about ever disappointing her And this has farreaching consequences Carried over into adult life these deeply ingrained psychic patterns  a taste for dependence and a horror of failing to meet the expectations of others  become major tools for the maintenance of social discipline in Japan At the moment this is still the kind of character molding that the majority of Japanese children receive But as the number of working women increases a growing percentage of Japanese no longer get all their early upbringing at Mothers knee Since 1960 the number of daycare centers has doubled it now stands at well above 20000 and the end is by no means in sight The majority of daycare centers moreover are operated by local governments and nearly all receive at least some governmental support Despite this implicit governmental endorsement there has been considerable controversy in Japan over the ultimate effect of this development on the Japanese character Traditionalists like Jun Eto a professor at the Tokyo Institute of Technology who has argued  without data  that children dispatched to daycare centers lag in everything from speech skills to dexterity in origami the art of Japanese paper folding insist that it spells doom for the classic Japanese virtues Though his view is somewhat extreme it is possible that children who cease to be totally motheroriented at 3 or 4 might be somewhat less likely to be imbued with a dependency complex than those who first venture out of the nest at 6 Another element contributing to the trend toward independence among members of the Japanese family is the countrys rapid urbanization After World War II the Japanese population was almost evenly divided between country dwellers and city dwellers Today because of the postwar process that one top Japanese business executive describes as the second industrialization of Japan all but 13 percent of Japanese live in cities The result is that in terms of effective living space by my calculation all 118 million Japanese are now crammed into an area slightly smaller than the state of Connecticut Inevitably this has caused the price of real estate and of housing in Japans major cities to skyrocket In the Tokyo area a house with a total living area of 600 or 700 square feet  the equivalent of two or three modestsized rooms in an American development house  sold in 1980 for five or six times the annual income of a highly paid industrial worker Thus a typical young Japanese bureaucrat or junior executive lives with his wife their two children and a mindboggling array of household possessions in an apartment consisting of a small kitchen with dining area plus two additional rooms of perhaps 9 by 12 feet each A few years ago a sharptongued Common Market official Sir Roy Denman called this kind of apartment a rabbit hutch Unkind as it was the phrase quickly caught on in Japan itself Because of such crowding Japanese family members are moving their formerly homecentered activities elsewhere Unless he is prosperous enough to rent a midtown studio the father who wishes to do serious reading or research in his spare time must take refuge in a public library or reading room If he is addicted to a pastime requiring concentration such as board games like go or shogi his best course is to betake himself to one of the special recreation centers that have sprung up in major cities In some cases the lack of privacy at home inhibits the sexual activity of married couples to such a degree that they are driven to patronize Tokyos love hotels to escape the observation of their children Inadequate housing is just as hard on Japans children Because few urban homes have yards small children mostly have to go to parks or private playgrounds that charge admission for their outdoor play And older ones unless they come from unusually prosperous families cannot hope for a room of their own If they wish to study in relative piece and quiet they too must resort to a library or an afterhours tutoring school Because it has weakened the bonds of family unity all this has induced in younger Japanese a greater sense of individual choice  and with that a greater insistence on selfgratification as a primary goal In a 1980 survey of Japanese between 15 and 19 more than 71 percent of the youngsters polled said that they craved an individual life style and fewer than 10 percent professed the desire to lead lives useful to society almost exactly the reverse of a similar poll taken in 1960 Carried to extremes these attitudinal changes have contributed to a disturbing development in contemporary Japan Foreigners marvel at the lawabiding nature of Japanese society  and rightly so At last report New York had 279 times as many armed robberies as Tokyo does  and Japanese crime rates have actually decreased somewhat over the past decade But a closer look reveals some trends in the pattern of crime in Japan that in the words of a National Police Agency white paper almost certainly constitute pointers to future social problems One such pointer is a major increase in drug abuse In 1980 some 20000 Japanese were arrested for using illegal drugs most often amphetamines  or speed By American standards this is a minuscule figure but Japanese police believe that the total number of drug addicts in their country may now run as high as several hundred thousand More than half the drugrelated arrests currently involve people under 24 many of them highschool students And the growing abuse of drugs by youngsters is only one aspect of a recent upsurge in juvenile crime of all kinds In 1979 juvenile arrests jumped by a startling 48 percent to a total of more than 140000 By 1981 14 to 16yearolds had outstripped adults as Japans most frequent lawbreakers What troubles older Japanese more than anything else is the increasing frequency with which schoolchildren are resorting to violence against their teachers  a special kind of blasphemy in a society in which the teacher has traditionally been held in particularly high esteem Presumably it will be some years before it becomes clear just how much of a threat to Japans social order the current juvenile crime wave represents But already in far less aggravated form the tendency of younger Japanese to seek instant gratification has begun to take its toll Young people in this country have changed significantly since I first began to teach here in 1954 says the Rev Joseph Pittau an engaging Italian Jesuit who spent more than 20 years as an educator in Japan and at one time was the president of Tokyos Sophia University The kids back in those days he says referring to the children of World War II had suffered when they were small and felt a compulsion to change Japan But nowadays the motivation to be a leader or start something new is extremely rare even in brilliant students The prevalent ambition in fact is to become a salaryman  Father Pittau adds using the fracturedEnglish term that Japanese apply to whitecollar workers and to achieve more balance than previously existed between ones personal life and the demands of the job One of the most striking evidences for this change is the amount of time that todays Japanese actually devote to work As recently as 1971 only onefifth of Japans workers took all the paid vacation time to which they were entitled Today the willingness to forego vacations while still common among management personnel is far less prevalent among bluecollar workers Even when they are not on holiday Japanese do not work as hard as they used to The number of hours the average Japanese spends on the job dropped from 186 a month in 1970 to 175 a month in 1980 Those figures moreover include overtime which is an increasingly sore subject with Japanese bosses People my age used to work Saturdays even if we werent paid says Kazuo Nukazawa a Tokyo executive in his middle 40s Todays young people not only dont work on Saturdays they dont even do overtime on weekdays unless they get paid As commitment to work begins to diminish the emphasis on personal desires increases As a nation Japan has long had the highest rate of personal savings in the world  and it still does Currently the average Japanese puts about 20 percent of his disposable income into savings roughly four times as much as the average American saves But executives of Japanese finance companies report that they do a disproportionate amount of their business with people under 35 instead of saving for years to buy a car as their parents did more and more young Japanese are prepared to go into debt to buy the things that they want right now Still another sign of this new emphasis on immediate gratification is the growing fussiness which young Jap anese display about the kind of jobs they will take With easy abortion and the prevalence of birth control Japan is a rapidly aging nation In 1970 more than 24 million Japanese turned 20 but in 1980 only l6 million did so This means increasing competition among employers for recent highschool and university graduates  and young Japanese are taking advantage of their sellers market Fewer and fewer are willing to work for the small manufacturing enterprises that are the backbone of Japanese industry  primarily because smaller enterprises cannot match the wages benefits or working conditions offered by such major corporations as Toyota or Sony Just as important as their choosiness about the jobs they will take is the attitudes young Japanese display toward those jobs they do find acceptable Theyre taking things easier and have begun to ask Why should we sacrifice for the company  said Yoshiya Ariyoshi the late shipping magnate And this laidback approach goes well beyond the mere reluctance to put in unpaid overtime Young workers are beginning to question such seemingly immutable principles of Japanese corporate life as the necessity of spending ones entire career with a single company and of being paid according to age and seniority rather than personal performance The most dramatic manifestation of these new attitudes occurred in early 1980 when 80 computer technicians walked away from lifetime jobs with IshikawajimaHarima Heavy Industries a major shipbuilder and maker of heavy machinery and established their own systemsdesign consulting firm in which they were stockholders as well as employees The move sent a tremor though Japans industrial establishment Up till now Father Pittau told me shortly after the IshikawajimaHarima episode companies and Government agencies have been able to take these youngsters and reshape them giving them the traditional social formation in which loyalty to ones company or ministry is paramount But already it is not so easy as it used to be to instill a spirit of service in young people in this country  and Im afraid that it may get harder and harder A Detroit auto maker or the chief executive of a European electronics company can scarely mourn the fact that his Japanese competitors may one day face much the same kind of personnel and productivity problems that already confront Western industry But before such people grow too euphoric at the prospect of a less dynamic Japan they should carefully consider certain aspects of Japanese economic life and the Japanese character that seem likely to reduce significantly the impact of some of these social trends To begin with contrary to Western legend the current competitiveness of Japanese industry does not fundamentally rest upon cheap labor or the exploitation of armies of indefatigable productionline workers In fields ranging from steel to silicon memory chips Japans true competitive advantage lies in the fact that in the last couple of decades Japanese companies have been prepared to invest far more heavily than their Western rivals in automation and high technology And as the rapid pace of robotization in todays Japan demonstrates Japanese entrepreneurs are doing everything in their power to retain and even strengthen that edge It is important to remember that decadence is a relative matter There is I am convinced every reason to believe that Japans doomsayers are right when they predict that the Japanese of tomorrow will not work as hard as those of the 1960s and 1970s and will show markedly less readiness to subordinate their personal ambitions and private lives to the success of the company that employs them It is also likely  particularly if robotization creates significant unemployment or other forms of social dislocation  that Japans labor unions will become more militant than in the past It is one thing for the leaders of a union to moderate their demands in order to assure the continued survival of a corporation that guarantees their membership permanent employment it is quite a different matter to do so for a company that is in the process  however gradual  of phasing out the bulk of its human employees Yet even assuming all these things do occur it still seems highly improbable that the competitive imbalance that now exists between Japan and the other major industrialized nations will be redressed For even at their new diminished levels of effort the Japanese will probably still work harder and feel more responsiblity for the success of the enterprise that employs them than Americans or Europeans Despite the selfabsorption of so many young Japanese these days the great majority of the population finds it almost impossible to conceive that anyone can achieve real stature or success except as part of a group A salaried executive in a major corporation still enjoys more prestige simply because of his affiliation than the owner of a thriving mediumsized business even though the latter may have a considerably larger income and more real power And to let down the group to which one belongs by failing to observe its accepted standards of performance is to court ostracism by ones coworkers  the most appalling thing most Japanese can imagine Admittedly there are eminent Japanese thinkers who criticize the group orientation of their countrymen arguing that it produces less desirable behavior patterns than the Wests individual motivations Indeed Naohiro Amaya at one time the top bureaucrat in the Ministry of International Trade and Industry points out that ever since Japan opened itself to Western influences more than a century ago it has been living in a state of ambivalence on this score My own view is that what is currently taking place in Japan so far as value systems are concerned is the classic Japanese process of synthesis One of Japans greatest strengths in its extraordinary evolution from the feudal society that it was at the time of Commodore Perrys arrival to the advanced technological one it is today has been that instead of totally accepting destabilizing and often unsuitable Western ideas and institutions the Japanese have been remarkably successful in adapting these influences to their own needs and imperatives One example of the way in which almost all things foreign are subtly transformed when they are absorbed into Japanese culture can be found in the workings of the Japanese parliamentary system To all outward appearances it closely resembles that of Great Britain But while a British prime minister with even a paperthin parliamentary majority feels free to ram through his or her programs with total disregard for the most deeply held convictions of the opposition any sensible prime minister in Japan will go to great lengths to avoid such action In the Japanese ethic it is abhorrent for anyone even if he is legally entitled to do so to brush aside the feelings of his opponents and decline to make at least token concessions to them In politics in other words the Japanese have succeeded in synthesizing two seemingly opposed principles majority rule and government by consensus And now I believe they are performing the same sort of Hegelian trick with the concepts of personal gratification and group responsibility What will emerge from this process it seems safe to predict is a softer more individualistic Japan  which will still boast the most purposeful and productive society of any great industrial nation in the world
WASHINGTON; THE APRIL FOOL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/27/opinion/washington-the-april-fool.html,Chairman The witness will take the chair and state his name Witness I am the April Fool Q The purpose of your testimony A I have come on my annual spring visit to defend the Presidents policies against the vicious opposition of the press Q All his policies A Yes sir Q How very odd Where would you like to begin A With outer space Mr Chairman if you dont mind I thought the Presidents idea of shooting down enemy nuclear missiles with laser beams and other clever devices before they blew up Washington was marvelous Q But I didnt know they had been invented And didnt the President say that he had just begun to think and study how this might be done A Thats why it was so marvelous He has been unjustly criticized for not thinking at all or studying anything and always trying to drag the country back into the 19th century But here he was thinking and studying about how to save the Republic from destruction in the 21st century Q Anything else A He tried to take the mind of the country and the Congress off merely temporary problems such as unemployment budget deficits or taxes and give it a vision of the coming age when computers and high technology would relieve people from such nuisances as war He was restoring hope for our children and our grandchildren Q Did it occur to you that this might have been a clever television political trick to divert attention from present anxieties into future hopes Meanwhile what about the present problems A He dealt with them with characteristic political candor He argued for more nuclear weapons so that he could convince the Russians to reduce them and eventually get rid of them And also for larger deficits so that he could balance the Federal budget Surely you see the logic of his proposals Q Im not sure I do Isnt this a vision of a fools paradise A No and I must say Mr Chairman that it puzzles me why you mock fools since there are so many of them here in Washington With respect I remind you that Mark Twain thought you should be thankful for fools since sometimes they had more votes than anybody else and that the country could not succeed without them I think  Q What do you think A I think the first duty of the government is to provide for the security of its people defend its borders restore its faith and assure that it remains No l in the development of modern military and industrial science Thats why the President insists on his defense budget and is against abortion and for prayer in the public schools Q I agree with some of that But how can the President get the government off the backs of the people when 12 million of them are unemployed and on their backs He wants to revitalize the industry of the country so that it can compete more effectively in the export markets of the world Right A Right Q Okay He also wants to explore the possibilities of defending the nation from nuclear attack by getting the best scientists and the best possible students on his side Wouldnt this require a much larger education budget than he has proposed to prepare the coming generation for these tasks A I dont know The President has already proposed fantastic sums to subsidize their education but a lot of them are bums who are borrowing money from the government and learning nothing except how to evade their debts and even refusing to register for a military draft Q So you would punish the good along with the bad Are fools pessimists or optimists A Were the last of the optimists but its not easy Q What about the poor nations and the hungry half of the human race many of whom are also avoiding their debts Should we apply your same rule of punishing the good along with the bad Comfort the afflicted or afflict the comfortable A I think youve got me wrong Mr Chairman Im a fool but not a knave There are poor fools all over the world and we need money to help them but to deal with the knaves we need power which is all they understand Q So you come to Washington once a year in the spring Why then A Because its so beautiful with the regularity coherence and hope of nature Its not like the contention and solid mass of ignorance and selfish pride of politics during the rest of the year I like it around April Fools Day because we can laugh together about our follies including the folly of fools politicians and the press The Chairman I thank you for your remarks not about politicians but about the press and hope youll come back next year

LEGISLATURE VOTES NEW YORK BUDGET FOR FISCAL YEAR '84,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/28/nyregion/legislature-votes-new-york-budget-for-fiscal-year-84.html,The Legislature approved a 1984 tate budget early today calling for 220 million in added programs but thousands fewer layoffs than Governor Cuomos original proposal The budget arrived at after weeks of negotiations imposes nearly 1 billion in new taxes Overall it would add less than 1 percent to the Governors proposed 315 billion budget The last bill was passed in the Assembly shortly before 2 AM today and in an unusual show of unity Assembly Speaker Stanley Fink Democrat of Brooklyn invited Governor Cuomo and the Senate majority leader Warren M Anderson a Binghamton Republican to the podium to speak Proud of When We Did It Im not particularly proud of what we have done Senator Anderson said But I am proud of when we did it Governor Cuomo said What you produced is a better budget than the one I gave you and for that I am grateful Assemblymen who had debated for most of Sunday and into the morning cheered wearily The Senate had completed action about an hour earlier As the final bill a measure imposing a series of taxes was put to a vote Senator Anderson walked over to several Republicans who voted against the measure including Senator John E Flynn of Yonkers and Senator Martin J Knorr of Queens They immediately changed their votes The measure passed by a vote of 4812 Immediately afterward Governor Cuomo walked into the Senate Chamber walked up to Senator Anderson shook his hand and said Thank you very much The layoffs of state workers became a key issue in Mr Cuomos first budget News analysis page 15 The State Budget Director Michael Finnerty said that because of the money restored during legislative negotiations all layoffs of state workers would be delayed at least until May 5 and that only 3100 of the 9400 layoffs called for under Governor Cuomos budget proposal might actually be carried out He said that the figure would drop even further if state unions could persuade more than the expected 4200 of their members to retire early under a plan passed by the Legislature this week Under the plan employees over age 55 who retire by the end of next month would get credit for three extra years of service in figuring their retirement incomes We are talking about converting layoffs into attrition Mr Finnerty said In negotiations overnight agreement was reached on a plan to tax the gross receipts of only the 18 largest petroleum companies One of the companies has threatened not the pay the new tax The 2 percent tax can be passed along to consumers but oil company officials have said they might not be able to pass it along because of competition from the companies not subject to the tax Mobil Oil has instructed me to say it will litigate said Victor Condello a lobbyist for the company They will not pay it The budget also will make it more expensive to smoke cigarettes drink alocholic beverages drive a car and transfer real estate But in negotiations a proposal to impose a sales tax on movie and theater tickets haircuts and other services was dropped and replaced with a tax on profits from large real estate transactions The Legislature was working to complete action on a budget before the April 1 deadline the start of the new fiscal year If it succeeds it would be the first time in four years that the deadline was met and the first time in some years that the budgetwas arrived at t ed by the Republican minority Most of the measures were defeated by a p artyline vote The Senate recessed periodically as it waited for the Assembly to act Republicans Denounce Taxes In the debate Assembly Republicans argued that much of the nearly 1 billion of additional taxes was unneeded The taxes said the Assembly minority leader Clarence D Rappleyea Jr Republican of Norwich will generate a monumental surplus just in time for the spring of another election year Assembly Democrats said the budget would cause some pain but that much of the pain had been eliminated by the restoration of programs This is a tightly balanced budget said Assemblyman Arthur J Kremer Democrat of Long Beach We were the last state of the 50 to catch up with the national recession we may be one of the last of the 50 to catch up to the upswing Republicans in the Assembly voted against most tax bills but most supported school aid legislation In the Senate most budget bills passed with support of both Democrats and Republicans Medicaid Measure Defeated As in past years both houses defeated amendments that would have barred the use of Medicaid to pay for abortion after lengthy debates Senator James H Donovan Republican of Chadwicks said that if funding was cut out we could eliminate the tax on beer Assemblywoman Cynthia Jenkins Democrat of Queens said It is no longer a matter of life or death it is a class issue The gross receipts tax on oil companies was passed in the Senate early last night and it was approved by the Assembly this morning As part of the same measure the state authorized an increase of one percentage point in the sales tax in Nassau County to help close a county deficit After weeks of negotiations during which little was disclosed the Legislature released details of items restored this afternoon following private party caucuses Money was added for the state and city university systems tourism mental health the arts upstate cities sewers and highways Smaller Cut for Arts Council The New York State Council on the Arts will be cut about 500000 not the the 45 million proposed by Governor Cuomo The State University received 10 million to restore jobs and the City University 94 million Mental health and mental retardation received 453 million to restore jobs Education spending was raised 292 million or about 4 percent above what Mr Cuomo had proposed for the next school year The total school aid budget would go up to about 46 billion Democrats in the Assembly listed 346 million in appropriations added mostly to increase aid to schools and localities But Mr Finnerty the State Budget Director said that not all the money would be spent during the state fiscal year He put the cash value of the additions at 220 million To help balance the increases about 140 million in spending was cut including 186 million from the courts and nearly 6 million from Governor Cuomos proposed prison expansion and increased savings were budgeted based on estimates of lower interest rates and petroleum prices Revenue Estimates Raised New estimates of revenue were also raised by about 80 million according to Mr Finnerty The state lottery was projected to bring in about 30 million more improved tax collection was estimated to bring in an extra 15 million 30 million more was expected from abandoned property funds and additional money from surplus state funds Administration officials said the reduction in layoffs was made possible only by the Legislature adding spending They insisted there was no change in policy on Mr Cuomos part Mr Finnerty said that the state still planned to eliminate 11000 jobs during the year though this was fewer than the 14000 originally planned At the Assemblys insistence Mr Finnerty said the budget will require higher stafftopatient ratios in state institutions than Governor Cuomo had proposed There is another year he said Earlier Tax Replaced The gross receipts tax on oil companies which can be passed along to consumers is designed to replace an earlier tax that could not be passed along Both taxes apply only to oil companies that do a large volume of business in the state and are limited to 18 companies The earlier tax was overturned by a state appellate court because it could not be passed along in a case that is before the Court of Appeals The state is in outofcourt negotiations with some oil companies over more than 450 million the state says it is owed Last Friday Governor Cuomo announced that the new tax had been revised to tax 400 oil companies because of threats from the large oil companies that they would refuse to pay In negotiations overnight that position was reversed Mr Finnerty said the broader tax could have a serious impact on smaller oil companies The new tax is designed to raise 200tmillion Mobil and other oil companies have called it punitive and discriminatory Mobil said it would challenge the tax in court and warned that the tax would not be collected and could as a result jeopardize the states bond rating But Mr Finnerty said that the language limiting the tax to only 18 companies had been upheld by the courts so far and that he was confident the tax could be collected

WASHINGTON; WHITE HOUSE REVUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/30/opinion/washington-white-house-revue.html,In the last few days President Reagan and his wife have never seemed happier They have used the capital of the United States as a stage and demonstrated the power of personality and the theater to influence politics Last week Mrs Reagan went on a commercial television show and played a most appealing and effective role in support of her anxiety about the use of drugs by young people in this country A few days later she went on stage here at the Kennedy Center and read Ogden Nashs amusing commentaries to Camille SaintSaens Carnival of the Animals She was the prettiest thing seen here this spring since the flowering of tulip magnolias Meanwhile the President addressed the annual dinner of the Gridiron Club which is the original Carnival of the Animals The idea here was that the newspaper members of the Gridiron were supposed to roast him but he disarmed everybody by appearing on stage with his tormentors singing and dancing in their skit and laughing at himself and his Administration in a selfmocking speech unmatched since the days of President Kennedy The moral of this happy tale is that you dont try to be funny with the Reagans on stage That is where theyre in their element The President understands the power of television and the theater better than anybody else in Washington As Jimmy Carter said about his old buddy Bert Lance you have to give him credit The press has been charging Mr Reagan with being old which he cant deny and also with being lazy But he has never been more active or feisty than in the last few weeks Lately he has been all over the lot He has been dominating the news making his Saturday morning broadcasts flying all over the place delivering sermons to the evangelicals about the glory of prayer in the schools taking time to talk to foreign correspondents and domestic publishers and strolling into the White House press room to argue his case just before some important vote in Congress and just before televisions evening national broadcasts Still he has a problem Hes a master of public relations but not of policy Like any other good actor he concentrates on whatever audience hes addressing If he goes to Orlando to talk to the evangelical preachers he denounces the Russians as an evil empire If he talks to the NATO allies or to Anatoly Dobrynin the Soviet Ambassador he talks of compromise and peace If he meets with his rightwing supporters he is all for supplyside economics tax cuts and antiabortion laws and if he talks to Speaker Tip ONeill hes for cooperation and nonpartisan compromises In this sense hes a puzzle beyond the reach of journalism and like Messrs Carter Nixon Johnson and Kennedy before him he will probably have to be left to the novelists and the psychiatrists For he balances the books every day It is the performance and not the policy that dominates his thought and the impression here is that there are no connecting rods between the two When he denounces the new heads of the Soviet empire as godless men intent on the domination of the world without knowing much about them its not really that he thinks this is a good idea and doesnt want to talk to them about peace but merely that he was making a speech to the evangelicals that day and didnt think at all about the larger consequences The NATO allies are also inclined to confuse Mr Reagans speeches with his policies and intentions They tend to think that when he condemns Moscow as the center of an evil empire that hes really trying to pick a fight with Yuri Andropov But its not in his nature to pick a fight with anybody His mind so to speak is not on policy for the coming age but on performance before whatever audience he happens to be addressing And it would probably be wrong to assume that in the coming battle for the Presidency in l984 that hes wrong He is dominating the political stage in Washington with the help of his wife and the Democrats dont quite know how to handle them The Democrats think they have the best policy arguments given the present rates of unemployment taxes and interest at the bank  but so far they dont have the personalities to match the television and theatrical performances of the Reagans This is both the Presidents power and his weakness He is a brilliant performer and this helps him politically but almost everything he does is a performance even when he is dealing with the critical problem of the control of nuclear weapons or the unemployment of 12 million at home He has had his revenge against a critical press because he beats them at their own game of dominating the news but he has not convinced them or the allies or his adversaries that he has a coherent policy for the future either at home or abroad
COURT UPSETS MURDER CHARGE IN DEATH OF FETUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/03/31/us/court-upsets-murder-charge-in-death-of-fetus.html,The Kentucky Supreme Court ruled today that a man accused of killing his wifes unborn fetus could not be charged with murder In a 5to2 decision the court said there was nothing to prevent the state from prosecuting Robert Lee Hollis of Monticello Ky for performing an illegal abortion or for firstdegree assault on his wife Barbara A Wayne County circuit judge had dismissed a murder indictment against Mr Hollis 26 years old but the State Court of Appeals reinstated the charge last May The Supreme Court decision upheld the county judges ruling Mr Hollis was indicted in July 1981 on charges of murder and assault on charges that he tried to remove the fetus with his hand Justice Charles Leibson writing for the majority said the question of when does life begin is not the subject of this opinion The questions facing the court he said were what is included in the common law definition of murder second what is the impact of United States Supreme Court decisions and third using the recognized rules of statutory construction what is included within the word person  as used in Kentucky statutes Cannot Stand Up to Rule of Law Justice Leibson acknowledged the status of a fetus had changed in the eyes of society Lawyers for the state argued that a viable fetus was a person for purposes of criminal homicide While this argument may appeal to us instinctively Justice Leibson said it cannot stand up to the rule of law which both guides and restrains our hand He said that decisions in 19 states had held that life must exist separately from the mother to establish a charge of criminal homicide and said this was a position supported by the United States Supreme Court Although it is well recognized medically that a normal healthy fetus in the third trimester of pregnancy has a potential of sustaining life outside the body of the mother Justice Leibson said it is quite another matter to say that a particular fetus was viable at the time it was terminated Chief Justice Robert Stephens and Justice Donald Wintersheimer dissented Justice Wintersheimer cited testimony by a doctor who delivered Mrs Hollis after the assault He said that the sevenmonth fetus was a living person Stripped of its rhetoric this matter is simply a brutal murder committed on an innocent defenseless victim he said It is directly connected to a savage criminal assault of the mother and on the child

SHARP RISE FOUND IN DISEASE THAT IS DANGER IN PREGNANCY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/01/us/sharp-rise-found-in-disease-that-is-danger-in-pregnancy.html,The incidence of a lifethreatening disease of pregnancy in which the fetus develops outside the uterus has increased dramatically in the United States in the last decade researchers said yesterday This is a very great public health problem and an increasing cause for worry because its becoming worse Dr George L Rubin head of a research team at the Federal Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta said of the disease ectopic pregnancy He pointed out that not only had some 400 women died of the disease in the period studied but that it had also caused the deaths of more than a quarter of a million unborn children An ectopic pregnancy occurs when a fertilized ovum fails to reach the uterus and instead develops in the ovary Fallopian tube or other extrauterine location Unable to Determine Cause Scientists have not been able to find a direct cause of the increase in ectopic pregnancies But they suspect that an important factor is that many women are becoming pregnant at older ages than in the past Other significant causes are believed to be sexually related diseases and inadequate gynecological care The findings derived from three independently conducted studies were reported in two medical journals and the results of the studies concur with several similar surveys that have shown comparable rates of increase of the disease in Finland Sweden England and Wales The American surveys like the earlier surveys conducted abroad indicated that the disease was most prevalent in older age groups in blacks and among women with previous pregnancies or earlier diseases of the reproductive system Ectopic pregnancies cause potentially fatal consequences to the mother since the fetus grows in a place much too small to contain it and if not removed will burst the tube within about 10 weeks of pregnancy 4 Major Causes of Death On rare occasions the fertilized egg may lodge in an ovary or in the abdomen In any case the condition must be corrected by surgery to remove the fetus Along with toxemia infection and hemorrhaging ectopic pregnancy is one of the four major causes of death among pregnant women The most probable causes of tubal pregnancies as they are also called are considered to be pelvic inflammatory diseases sexual activityrelated diseases such as gonorrhea other infection and inflammation of the Fallopian tubes or the ovaries and adhesions or scars from previous abdominal surgery or ailments Although scientists have found no evidence that intrauterine contraceptive devices IUDs cause the disease they cite some studies that show a correlation between their use and a higher than normal number of tubal pregnancy cases The three independent studies of the rise of the disease were made in New York City upstate New York and the United States as a whole The latter study was made by researchers from the Centers for Disease Control while the two New York surveys were conducted by separate teams from the New York State Department of Health The national survey and the upstate New York research were reported in todays issue of The Journal of the American Medical Association and the New York City study was published in the June 1982 issue of The American Journal of Public Health The nationwide study showed that from 1970 through 1978 about 262000 women aged 15 to 44 were discharged from United States hospitals with a record of tubal pregnancy These cases increased from 17800 in 1970 to 42400 in 1978 The disease rate per 1000 reported pregnancies more than doubled in the same interval and rose to 94 from 45 261000 Cases Estimated Dr Rubin noted in an interview that out of about 33 million live births in the nineyear period there were about 261000 cases of tubal pregnancy And for every 1000 cases he said there were about 17 maternal deaths Since scientists still have not determined the precise cause or causes of the disease they also are not sure of the best way to prevent it We cant tell a woman that she shouldnt be promiscuous but we can suggest that there ought to be more use of contraceptives Dr Rubin said though he made an exception for intrauterine devices because of the possibility of their connection with ectopic pregnancies A greater use of contraceptives would reduce the number of unwanted pregnancies He also noted that there were now some 13 million legal abortions each year In the New York City study made at 73 hospitals the number of ectopic pregnancies rose from 1457 in 1975 to 2080 in 1980 The rate of the disease per 1000 reported pregnancies in the same period rose from 648 percent to 962 percent The study attributed the main causes of maternal fatalities to patient neglect and errors by physicians Dr Rubin said the trouble signs often resembled those of other gynecological disorders The main symptoms are pain in the lower abdomen and any alteration of the menstrual pattern such as small blood loss during a period instead of the normal flow he said He said symptoms of tubal pregnancy could be found within four to eight weeks of conception There is usually some sort of warning he said adding that the growing fetus would probably rupture the Fallopian tube in the first four to six weeks and would certainly do so by

CANDIDATE'S WRONG PROTEST FORUM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/01/opinion/l-a-dismissed-stanford-phd-candidate-s-wrong-protest-forum-070721.html,To the Editor It evidently takes only clairvoyance  in this case the ability to see an unreleased report  and a strong belief in a wideranging conspiracy to write an editorial about the expulsion of Steven Mosher from the PhD program at Stanford Expelling the Messenger March 19 However not only did you lack essential facts as you conceded you might you chose to ignore facts you had at your command You had in your possession a quotation from the report of the ad hoc investigating committee which deals explicitly with the issue of Mr Moshers publication of information on the Chinese birthcontrol program and Chinese controls on foreign scholars We feel that although the Chinese are clearly linking Moshers article to the restrictions they are imposing on foreign scholars we cannot hold Mosher responsible for actions the Chinese are taking Although we believe that Mosher was unwise to publish his article in a popular Taiwanese weekly where it would be read as a political attack on the PRC we cannot judge this act to be misconduct both because we are not convinced that Mosher fully understood the implications of his choice of publishing medium and because we believe that Moshers right to publish where he chooses is protected by the right to freedom of speech That report was discussed and endorsed unanimously in a secret ballot by the faculty of the Stanford University Department of Anthropology Anthropology is made up of independentthinking contentious scholars witness the latest controversy on the work of Margaret Mead Do you believe that 11 faculty members none of whom are Sinologists with an apparent ax to grind would unanimously vote to terminate a student on the flimsy and unconstitutional grounds stated in the editorial As you know Mr Mosher published his article on Taiwan in May 1981 In response to comments by individual faculty members he apologized for publishing the photographs of identifiable seminude women about to undergo abortions and also for his choice of publishing medium Thus when the anthropology faculty met in September 1981 all the information pertinent to the publication of the article was before it We did not need an investigating committee to determine the facts and if that were the critical issue for dismissal the faculty could and would have dismissed him then You are correct in stating that the Anthropology Department will not publicly release the report because the material in it might injure innocent third parties Mr Mosher has a copy and all documents used in drawing it up However you do not say that Mr Mosher has stated in writing that the crucial evidence against him would physically endanger innocent persons You accept Mr Moshers latest statement that he will not publish the document because he would be disseminating slanders against himself But if you accept the first part of his argument  that he was dismissed because of exercising his right to free speech  then release of the report by his account can only exonerate him Mr Mosher has attempted to try his case in public where he can control all the information released rather than use avenues within the university He has claimed to those who have no access to the evidence that his rights have been violated But to have his case reviewed and his objections considered all Mr Mosher need do is file a grievance with the dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences at Stanford At that point university officials up to the president will be in the line of appeal to review the case and all pertinent documents Now one month since his termination Mr Mosher continues to obstruct such a review by failing to appeal the decision To paraphrase your editorial unless we lack essential facts  and since we do lack your creative clairvoyance  we cannot even speculate on the reasons for your groundless attack on us CLIFFORD R BARNETT Professor and Chairman Department of Anthropology Stanford University Stanford Calif March 23 1983
TV VIEW; A RARE PORTRAIT OF THE POPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/arts/tv-view-a-rare-portrait-of-the-pope.html,Think of Pope John Paul II as an evangelist preaching where he can Think of him also as a modern man a media personality who uses television to further his evangelism The Pontiff in both these roles is the subject of an unusual hourlong documentary The Pope and His Vatican on ABC at 7 oclock tonight Since his election to the papacy in October 1978 John Paul the first nonItalian pope since Adrian VI in 1523 has made 17 trips outside Italy carrying his message to a large part of the worlds population The constant exposure opens him to the charge noted in the documentary that he is a showboat artfully playing to the crowd In fact he does play to the crowd and as the documentary proves he does it wonderfully well The Pope it is clear regards television as a tool in this The film tonight opens with ABCs assertion that its documentary crew was granted unprecedented access to the Pope with its cameras allowed behind the walls of the Vatican Actually the cameras were not allowed everywhere  the Vatican and its policies are too complex for that  but certainly they were allowed in sufficient places to ensure a rare look at a Pope So we see an obviously cooperative John Paul walking in the garden receiving visitors celebrating mass in his private chapel He is aware the camera is on him of course a few times he obviously moves or stands to facilitate the making of the film Still he shows no discomfort in this He is at home with the camera he regards it as a friend He is very much like Ronald Reagan in this respect Mr Reagan is a secular spokesman which the Pope is not but in large part their message is themselves In offering himself to the camera the Pope is offering his persona trusting it will televise well The trust is not misplaced The persona televises superbly The film meanwhile is respectful although scarcely reverential The Pope kisses a baby he waves to crowds he slaps someone on the shoulder A monsignor briefing a group of priests who are about to meet the Pope tells them not to kiss his ring but to shake his hand and look him in the eyes instead The Pope is not made of plastic the odor of sanctity clings to him not at all There have been ascetic popes political popes and pastoral popes each formidable in his own way John Paul is no less formidable although it is not hard to imagine a layman inviting him say to drop in for a beer It is not that John Paul looks folksy or that he exudes the paternalistic geniality of Pope John XXIII It is more that he seems so comfortable with himself so much of a whole that the layman would not be afraid to extend the invitation The apparent anomaly here is that this very modern man this great natural for television is preaching and indeed reinforcing a traditional set of rules celibacy for priests strictures against abortion a return to old standards They are rules associated sometimes incorrectly with conservative politics The Popes political positions however seem to be transcended by his religious convictions  and in The Pope and His Vatican we see how John Paul uses political situations to further his religious message In the documentary John Paul is shown ignoring the counsel of advisers at a peace rally in Rome Leftist politicians there want to prevent the opening of American missile bases in Italy This is not a position approved by the Vatican the Popes attendance at the rally could be seen as an endorsement John Paul however is onto something else The Pope is with you as you run through the streets of peace he tells the crowd Then having caught everyones attention he says Do you really want to cheer for peace Then study the original disciple of peace Christ He said much the same thing on his recent trip to Central America some of which we see in the documentary In Nicaragua he publicly chastized a priest who had become a government minister saying that the priest had to straighten out his relationship with the church In El Salvador the Pope told his bishops to mediate between extremes and he urged all sides to come together for political negotiations He seemed to be taking issue with American policy in this inviting Communists to sit down and talk He used his extraordinary persona to place Christianity not so much in the partisan battle but above it an arbitrator if you will Television of course helped to deliver the message In a thoughtful commentary during the film John Cardinal Krol says that the Popes predilection for reaching out to people however he can grows out of his Polish background In Poland he says the church was denied free access to the media They could only approach the people directly And thats why in Poland if you have a church that was repainted youll find five or six bishops walking in procession to inaugurate the repainted churchWhen the Communists were out simply to destroy the church as an institution the bishops and priests had no defense other than to become acquainted with the people themselves Meanwhile a recent investigation by The New York Times connected Soviet intelligence agents with the attempt to kill the Pope last year Evidence was found that the KGB believing John Pauls election was engineered by Zbigniew Brzezinski President Carters security adviser thought the Pope might be used to take advantage of political unrest in Poland In the documentary we see what could have been the basis of Soviet fears In a moving sequence the Pope is shown in Poland addressing an enormous crowd His power is palpable The crowd is moved The Pope is helping the Poles to unite and to see themselves as one people In The Pope and His Vatican we hear the extraordinary power of the Popes voice
SELECTION; THE UNEASY CATHOLICISM OF GRAHAM GREENE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/books/selection-the-uneasy-catholicism-of-graham-greene.html,Later this month Simon  Schuster will publish The Other Man a series of interviews with Graham Greene conducted by MarieFrancoise Allain Much of the material contained in Greenes answers to her questions will be familiar to readers of his two autobiographical books A Sort of Life and Ways of Escape  his despair during adolescence his adventures with Russian roulette the lifelong restlessness that led to his extensive travel his introspection and his early conversion to Roman Catholicism But the following selection reprinted in a somewhat emended form from The Other Man is perhaps a fuller and more lucid explanation of his uneasy relationship to the church than exists elsewhere  Did you become a Catholic the way one falls in love No I needed convincing arguments for the possibility that God exists Im very fond of an Anglican divine Bishop Gore he was also a writer and he opened one of his books with the words The hardest thing is to admit the existence of God Im with him there I was perfectly ready to accept the historical existence of Christ but how was I to start from a hypothesis as vague as that of the omnipresence of God So you were an atheist No but religion bored me to death with its Sunday services and its endless readings from the Bible Anglicanism meant absolutely nothing to me no more than Buddhism or Catholicism One of my grandfathers was a clergyman with a great sense of personal guilt so one day he had defrocked himself in a field and ended his days in an asylum You see Ive inherited some bad genes I too rebelled but not from a sense of guilt At Oxford one had the choice between having breakfast sent to ones rooms if one attended the morning service in chapel or of going to breakfast in the hall I opted for the second solution Your rebellion did not go very far Thats because I was so indifferent I knew nothing about Catholicism it was a closed book to me It was a long time later when I was working in Nottingham that I slipped a note into a collection box in the cathedral asking for instruction because my fiancee was Catholic I wanted to understand what she believed in I wanted a better grasp of the nature of her faith I had no thought of becoming a convert myself So would love have been responsible for your conversion Ive told you my conversion was not in the least an emotional affair It was purely intellectual It was the arguments of Father Trollope at Nottingham which persuaded me that Gods existence was a probability How do you explain his success I enjoyed our discussions I was stubborn as a mule but he got me interested in his game Subsequently I plunged into books of theology which fascinated me You see I wasnt in the position of a Protestant who is searching for an alternative I believed in nothing Father Trollope and I saw each other regularly for six months sometimes at the cathedral sometimes on the open upper deck of a bus when wed pursue our arguments for the entire journey When I was baptized I made it clear that I had chosen the name of Thomas to identify myself not with St Thomas Aquinas but with St Thomas Didymus the doubter I eventually came to accept the existence of God not as an absolute truth but as a provisional one So you could not say like Sarah in The End of the Affair Ive caught belief like a disease Ive fallen into belief like I fell in love I should have been pleased if my faith had been like hers But I must say in my defense that unlike her I had also to be converted to the idea of Christianity When did you begin to feel your faith I recognized the first inroads during my visit to Mexico in 1938 Its all bound up with my loyalty to the underdog  and so it has been ever since In Mexico the underdogs were the Catholics When I heard a woman tell of the death of one of her family how they had to send in secret to the capital for a priest to come and celebrate the funeral rites in Tabasco the persecutions did not affect the inhabitants of Mexico City who were in a way protected by the tourists when I had witnessed the fervor of the peasants who would go back and forth on their knees across the flagstones of those churches in Chiapas which were still open though not to priests and who would kneel for ages with their arms outstretched as though crucified  I tried to pray this way and I found I could keep my arms up for a few minutes perhaps no longer while they would stay as though crucified for the entire service  when one has been with believers who suffered for their faith  the masses said in secret in Chiapas and Tabasco where there were no longer either churches or priests  this endowed the church with such grandeur the fidelity of the believers assumed such proportions that I couldnt help being profoundly moved I expect Im explaining myself badly I would compare these worshipers with the polite little congregation in Chelsea which I sometimes joined and the ladies in hats and Id feel that religion was the peasant approaching the altar on his knees his arms outstretched as though crucified But did you not in 1938 have a sense of being torn between a form of superstition as witness the Mexican peasant and a belief of intellectual origin No The two aspects coincided I still believe in magic even in the art of writing If Catholicism has succeeded in reaching the remotest corners of Africa its no doubt because of certain magical characteristics Its sense of magic is closer to the African than the abstractions of the Methodists and Anglicans Im inclined to find superstition or magic more rational than such abstract religious ideas as the Holy Trinity I like the socalled primitive manifestations of the faith What are they Oh the ones Ive been telling you about and others which are harder to describe One comes across people for instance endowed with a strange aura Im thinking of a friend of mine a Spanish priest with whom I go traveling every year He has a faculty for bringing people to life He is not a conventionally pious man but he is possessed by an absolute faith When I asked him to describe it he modestly replied I do not believe in God I touch Him What do you think of miracles I want to believe in them I have myself experienced what could be called a small miracle I was in despair about someone  someone I had left rather brutally but whom I still kept seeing The break was far from clean and when we met we always ended up having an angry scene So I went into a church and prayed to Padre Pio the Italian Franciscan to change the womans attitude From that moment all was calm For me it was more striking than the sudden healing of a skin disease Perhaps it was coincidence but I like to think that it was magic I have also seen with my own eyes the stigmata on Padre Pios hands in the south of Italy He was not a man who looked as though he suffered from a nervous disorder I was so convinced of his powers of goodness that I refused to approach him and speak with him I explained to the friends who had brought me along that I was too afraid that it might upset my entire life As you see superstition made a late appearance in me As a child and an adolescent I didnt know the meaning of the word I only became superstitious when I started to accept the existence of God and therefore of miracles Is not your view darkened by the Christian consciousness of sin Not in the least I dont like the term sin Its redolent of a childs catechism The term has always stuck in my throat because of the Catholic distinction between mortal and venial sin The latter is often so trivial as not even to deserve the name of sin As for mortal sin I find the idea difficult to accept because it must by definition be committed in defiance of God I doubt whether a man making love to a woman ever does so with the intention of defying God I always remember the example of a Dominican priest who found his life in Europe too easy and left for Africa where he lived for years in a hut made out of old tin cans only to discover that he was suffering from the sin of pride He came back to England and confided to a friend that during all this time of hearing the confessions of the faithful he had never come across a single mortal sin In other words for him mortal sin didnt exist The word mortal presupposes a fear of hell which I find meaningless This being the case I fear that Im a Protestant in the bosom of the church In your novels you are content to substitute yourself for God All writers even the worst are led into assuming a role vaguely comparable to Gods for they create characters over whom they exercise almost total control I should add though that a writer is even more like a double agent than he is like God He condemns and sustains his characters by turns Their relationship is so ambiguous that when the characters come to elude his control  as with Scobie in The Heart of the Matter  one doesnt know whom to blame You are a believer even though you say that you are only keeping a foot in the door In your opinion does faith give an additional dimension to writing Human beings are more important to believers than they are to atheists If one tells oneself that man is no more than a superior animal that each individual has before him a maximum of 80 years of life then man is indeed of little importance I think that the flatness of EM Forsters characters and Virginia Woolfs or Sartres for example compared with the astonishing vitality of Bloom in Joyces Ulysses or of Balzacs Pere Goriot or David Copperfield derives from the absence of the religious dimension in the former Francois Mauriacs characters are equally endowed with this strange substantiality In La Pharisienne when one of them  a very minor character  crosses a schoolyard we have a sense of having seen him in flesh and blood while Mrs Dalloway doing her shopping leaves one indifferent She moves out of our minds as easily as she moves out of Harrods Along the same lines I should say that very few good writers have emerged from the Communist world with the exception of a Solzhenitsyn or a Pasternak or a Sinyavsky who have in fact retained their sense of the religious The welfare state has driven God off the stage just like the Devil but it has failed so lamentably that I have the impression God is making a timid reappearance History tends to prove that faith is reborn from its own embers Would a Solzhenitsyn have existed if Communism had met with a more obvious success What is God like A mystery an inexplicable force Thats why when one prays one shouldnt in my opinion address oneself to this inexplicable and mysterious force but to His intermediary Christ I think theres an element of truth in the myth about man being created in His image But it is easier to pray to Christ than to an abstract entity Human love can be only a pale reflection of the emotion that God must feel for what He has created Do you think that the Catholic Church today has at last rediscovered the technique of revolution the absence of which you deplored in 1939 in The Lawless Roads which you wrote after your journey to Mexico What lay behind that remark were the abuses of the Catholic Church in Mexico which had had the unfortunate result of bringing down on her priests the persecutions of the 30s But the church could no doubt be grateful for these persecutions She was purged by them and is now in good health there I know that all too often throughout history the church has sided with the powerful but this has happened less frequently in the 20th century I think that at the moment especially so far as Latin America is concerned she has effectively rediscovered a technique of revolution In Nicaragua for example the bishops aligned themselves clearly with the Sandinistas and two priests are in the Government while in El Salvador the bishops have united against the Government and provided a martyred archbishop The influence of Dom Helder Camara in Brazil is not to be underestimated  though I know less of whats going on there In Europe its still too early to pronounce on the surprising appearance of a nonItalian pope whom I for one heartily admire John XXIII was one of the most remarkable popes weve ever had Paul VI was a good and honorable man but strangely enough he damaged the church He was too much influenced by the Curia not sufficiently independent The present Pope inspires confidence because of his experience of life He has worked in the mines he has fought in the Resistance he had a genuine political experience I believe moreover that he is playing an important role in Europes political geography witness the warmth of his welcome in Ireland The concrete effects are evidently not yet perceptible but its very possible that in the long run his visit there will have a valuable impact He addressed himself to thousands of young people very enthusiastic young people  and this cut the grass from under the feet of the Provos His visit to the United States on the other hand was disturbing I think it a pity that he raised the tired old question of contraception In 1966 during the final session of the papal commission on birth control nine cardinals and bishops pronounced themselves in favor of contraception  this proved that it couldnt be an intrinsic evil  and only three voted on the opposite side It seems to me that one has to choose between that and abortion Im sure that most people are instinctively repelled by the idea of abortion but abortion is very often nothing but the result of an absence of contraception What do you think of this rigorous stand on priestly celibacy There Im in complete sympathy with him  though I know that its not very well viewed at the moment I think there has been too much laxity in this area Not that Im the one to talk When I became a Catholic I was very worried in case I turned out to have a vocation for the priesthood Id have made a very bad priest for chastity would have been beyond my powers But if priests were allowed to marry why not let them divorce as well In that case why shouldnt they marry four or five times like Americans I think that for many people especially the young the priesthood must have the attraction of a crack unit Its an organization which has to train for combat one which demands selfsacrifice Ive nothing in particular against priests marrying  as you know in the Eastern Catholic Church marriage is permitted a single marriage but Im convinced that the drop in vocations has to do with the fact that we dont put across clearly enough the attraction to be found in a difficult and dangerous calling One enlists in a venture which is total People are attracted to the church where theres danger I dont think theres a crisis of vocations in Latin America or in Poland You express yourself like someone seeing these problems from the inside Not altogether Once again Im speaking not as a theologian only as a writer who happens to be a Catholic and perhaps even a Protestant inside the church For Ive always considered it better to be a Protestant inside rather than outside Your name has often been associated with Mauriacs Do you feel closer to French Catholic writers than to your English colleagues I was very close to Evelyn Waugh whose Catholicism was so orthodox that it clashed with mine But strangely enough we never quarreled in spite of substantial disagreements in the field of politics as well Evelyn was conservative right down the line I made him very unhappy with A BurntOut Case He concluded from it that Id lapsed from the faith We exchanged a sequence of letters on this subject and our correspondence ended on a humorous note Our friendship was deep genuine and in no way affected by the disparity of our ideas Among my contemporaries I appreciate Anthony Burgess We have seldom met but I admire his talent I dont consider him a Catholic writer though any more than I consider myself one The French press often couples our names because we are both labeled exiles I dont have the slightest sense of living in exile The worst of it is that our names are also linked with Lawrence Durrells with whom I havent the slightest affinity The French are not always sound judges of English literature Look at the way they took to Charles Morgan who was held in small regard by British critics He probably read better in translation For me perhaps I shouldnt say this Lawrence Durrell and his cloying prose is the Charles Morgan of his generation What do you mean when you say you have broken the rules In my private life my situation is not regular If I went to communion I would have to confess and make promises I prefer to excommunicate myself Thats why I said at a conference in Paris with Mauriac that I could only speak in the name of the semilapsed comparable in this respect with certain Communists who have reached the dangerous edge where faith wavers The priest in The Power and the Glory also broke the rules since he was father of a little girl and he was a drunkard and fornicator and yet  But he could always say mass He was never stripped of that right While you you are happy to torture yourself are you not No I have become less depressive with age I have if you like more doubts but my faith has grown too Theres a difference between belief and faith If I dont believe in X or Y faith intervenes telling me that Im wrong not to believe Faith is above belief One can say that its a gift of God while belief is not Belief is founded on reason On the whole I keep my faith while enduring long periods of disbelief At such moments I shrug my shoulders and tell myself Im wrong  as though a brilliant mathematician had come and told me that my solution of an equation was wrong My faith remains in the background but it remains So you are happy  Not very Who is Well then at peace Im just not bothered Ill have it sorted out soon enough  or else I wont
CONGRESS FACES TOUGH DECISIONS ON ITS RETURN FROM RECESS TUESDAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/us/congress-faces-tough-decisions-on-its-return-from-recess-tuesday.html,Congress returns to work Tuesday to confront a series of tough decisions on domestic and foreign issues that it managed to avoid before the Easter recess After postponing action for weeks the Senate Budget Committee will finally take up the Federal budget for the fiscal year 1984 and the Republicans who dominate the committee will have to detail their differences with President Reagans spending blueprint on such key issues as military spending and additional taxes In addition both chambers will have to grapple with the shortterm suffering of more than 11 million unemployed workers and the longterm crisis of industries and regions that show few signs of economic revival Congressional leaders acknowledge that the 46 billion measure adopted last month to create jobs will have only a minimal effect on the unemployment problem In the foreign policy area the full Senate will be facing the thorny issue of Kenneth L Adelman President Reagans choice to head the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency And the House is scheduled to renew consideration of a resolution calling for a freeze on nuclear weapons Earlier Bipartisan Efforts As these issues move to center stage the underlying question is whether the legislators will continue to follow the bipartisan spirit of cooperation that marked their successful deliberations on the job bill and the overhaul of the Social Security System in the early months of 1983 In both those cases there was a wide consensus on the wisdom and urgency of the legislation and the White House went along with the compromises after sensing the mood of Capitol Hill But as the next election inevitably begins to affect the judgments of both Congress and the White House the possibility for partisan clashes will rise steeply House Democrats signaled the start of the political season when they used their 102vote majority to adopt a budget resolution that was openly designed to serve as a statement of party principles Votes could be gleaned they reasoned by advancing less money for the military and more for social programs than Mr Reagan proposed Some Republicans who avoided proposing their own budget believe Democrats went too far and left themselves vulnerable to the charge that they were resurrecting the days of big government and higher taxes But many Republicans who face reelection next year including 19 incumbent senators are eager to counteract the Democratic charge that Mr Reagan and his allies are unfair to average working people And they seem to have little stomach for further assaults on the domestic programs that Mr Reagan wants to reduce Arms and Food Stamps If I were running an aide to the Senate Republican leadership conceded Id hate like hell to try to sell a big increase in defense while cutting food stamps Both sides know they are entering a bargaining process and staking out their initial positions In the end since the Democrats control the House and the Republicans control the Senate they will have to compromise their differences on the budget in conference At that point a strong dose of bipartisanship will be needed to pass a budget While the budget sets overall spending targets individual legislation is needed to authorize and appropriate specific funds And some of the earliest battles could come over additional proposals to deal with unemployed workers and inefficient industries One of the first bills will probably provide funds to bail out families that face mortgage foreclosures and another would protect unemployed workers from a loss of health care benefits Proposals have also been made to provide training for workers with obsolete skills and investment capital for industries with obsolete plants The Housepassed budget plan leaves room for 17 billion worth of new programs but Democratic leaders privately admit that the figure will shrink substantially by the end of the budget process They also wonder whether they can pass legislation that will add significantly to the already huge deficit Congress generally has little say over foreign policy matters but it gets a chance to exert influence when an administration wants either more money or a new appointment As a result the fight over Mr Adelmans nomination has given critics of Mr Reagans arms control policy a chance to express their concern Some Senators are threatening a filibuster against the nomination Similarly the White House invited Congressional action on El Salvador when it asked for 110 million more in military aid for that country Other Key Issues Other issues that could well emerge in the coming weeks include these  A bill to repeal the 10 percent withholding tax on interest and dividend income will come to the Senate floor on April 15 Supporters of withholding managed to hold off repeal last month but the issue has wide public support  The Senate leadership has promised to allow a debate on a proposed constitutional amendment aimed at banning abortions but the amendment seems to have little chance for passage Hearings are also starting this month on a Constitutional amendment to permit organized prayer in public schools but that proposal also faces a rough road  Legislation to change the nations immigration laws passed the Senate last year but stalled in the House and supporters are trying again Lawmakers also have to decide whether to transfer 84 billion to the International Monetary Fund The money is needed for loans to enable the international organization to lend to developing countries suffering huge debt burdens but the move faces opposition
SEVILLE SPICES ITS HOLY WEEK WITH REVELRY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/03/world/seville-spices-its-holy-week-with-revelry.html,Throughout southern Spain the agony of Christs ascension to the cross is celebrated with fervor  almost with gusto  and nowhere more so than here in Seville The perfume of jasmine and orange blossoms mixes with incense and burning tapers Night after night the drums pound like heart throbs keeping time for the cofradias the spectacular centuryold processions mounted by 57 religious brotherhoods They compete in splendor Each procession centers on two immense gold or silver litters one for Christ and one for the Virgin Mary bedecked with flowers or shimmering with candles borne by 36 or 48 men hidden underneath who pay for the privilege of excruciating labor Hooded Brothers of Light Each is accompanied by thousands of robed and hooded penitents They are brothers of light or brothers of blood carrying either candles at their sides or wooden crosses on their backs The peaked caps with eye slits remind Americans of the Ku Klux Klan When the cofradias pass along the official route past the tribunal in front of City Hall and into the cathedral it is the moment of glory But when they return to the barios of their parish churches they are serenaded with love songs and greeted with cheers stolen from soccer matches It is the aficionados say the supreme moment the moment of joy True aficionados speak often of perfection They will station themselves at favorite sites a niche in a narrow cobblestone street to judge the paso They look for certain elements like the movement of the canopy which must sway slowly but not too much and how a difficult turn is negotiated within inches of the walls Shouts of Ole A paso that is perfect is said to be completo or complete It can inspire a crowd into frenzied applause and shouts of Ole Then the procession halts and the crowd falls silent The float of the Virgin or Christ is carefully lowered to its legs A solitary figure dressed in black steps out onto an irongrill balcony raises one hand and begins a haunting song of lament Oh blessed Virgin when I see your eyes of sorrow  A crowd can be moved to tears The foreman of the costaleros who haul the float on the backs of their necks raps three times on a golden door knocker The men heave the 6000pound float aloft and move on leaving the singer openmouthed In recent years some brotherhoods have taken to hiring professional flamenco singers to station themselves at strategic points But purists frown on this practice because it cuts down on spontaneity Revelry and Religion Holy Week was born in the grim spirit of the CounterReformation in the 16th century But over the centuries it has lightened under the Andalusian spirit Now it is one part revelry to one part religion a mixture that sometimes surprises tourists from northern EuropeBaptised paganism it has been called What do people expect said Jose Luis de Vicente With this sun and this earth who could be serious all the time From Palm Sunday to Good Friday the whole town stays up until dawn The bars and cafes reap a whirlwind Vendors line the routes selling cigarettes lottery tickets cotton candy peanut brittle laid out on marble slabs to cool and giant lollipops shaped like baby pacifiers This morning at 6 oclock the crowd was still there on the Calle Sierpes where Cervantes was jailed Don Juan dined and Carmen gave the slip to Don Jose Charity is supposed to be a mark of the hermandades or brotherhoods Unlike those in other Andalusian cities the brotherhoods of Seville operate all the year round Some of them run a kind of unofficial employment office Seville has one of the highest rates of unemployment in Europe above 20 percent The brotherhoods are supposed to eschew politics although in the Franco years the ceremonies were larded with symbols of support for the regime Even now the largely conservative brotherhoods take positions on political issues deemed to have moral overtones such as a declared opposition to the Socialist Governments move to liberalize laws on abortion Felipe Gonzalez the Socialist Prime Minister comes from Seville During Holy Week political considerations are put aside and even Communists join in the processions The climax comes in the early hours of Good Friday when the most revered icons are brought out

SENATE STUDY CALLS FOR CHANGES TO UNRAVEL THE TANGLED LEGISLATIVE PROCESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/08/us/senate-study-calls-for-changes-to-unravel-the-tangled-legislative-process.html,A study group headed by two former Senators today recommended wideranging changes in Senate rules designed to make the lawmakers more efficient in their procedures and more respected by the public The main thrust behind the suggestions would be strengthening the ability of the Senate leadership to move legislation forward while reducing the power of individuals and small groups to paralyze the proceedings I think we have a very serious problem in reaching decisions said Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr the Maryland Republican who heads the Rules and Administration Committee which commissioned the study This will have disastrous results if we dont deal with the issue in a serious way The 41page study was prepared by two widely respected and recently retired Senators James B Pearson Republican of Kansas and Abraham A Ribicoff Democrat of Connecticut Hearings have been scheduled by the Rules and Administration Committee next month to review their 18 recommendations many of which are expected to evoke considerable controversy Would Eliminate 7 Committees Some of the more significant suggestions include establishing annual agendas and weekly schedules for the Senate appointing a permanent presiding officer eliminating seven of the 20 current committees including the Budget Committee passing a budget every two years instead of annually reducing the power of subcommittees limiting the right to filibuster legislation or delay Senate business through procedural maneuvers and restricting opportunities to offer extraneous amendments Senate leaders acknowledge that many of the recommendations will face tough opposition from lawmakers who view them as a threat to their powers and prerogatives Senator Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader called the suggested changes sweeping and farreaching and added that they will scare some people to death Senator Robert C Byrd of West Virginia the minority leader said in an interview that Its very important that we make some changes now because the Republican leadership is very much in the mood to do it That is largely because of the problem the leadership had within its own ranks last fall Fight on Gas Tax Senator Byrd was referring to the lengthy and ultimately successful fight in the last Congress to increase gasoline taxes by 5 cents a gallon The bill was delayed for weeks by a small band of conservative Republicans using parliamentary maneuvers to postpone a final vote The tactic infuriated many of their colleagues and increased pressure for rules changes in the new Congress But the gasoline tax battle was only the latest example of the way a little determined handful of Senators in Senator Byrds words have come to dominate the Senate in recent years At times they have tried to block legislation they do not like At others they have used the rules to offer nongermane amendments on emotional subjects like abortion In both cases said Senator Mathias the rules have been abused and lawmakers have conveyed the perception that the work of the Senate was being trivialized Two Forces Behind Problems Many analysts trace the Senates current problems to two political developments The rise of mass communications undermined the power of Senate barons who once enforced through their seniority and prestige the unwritten rules that governed Senate life At the same time a new generation of lawmakers invaded Capitol Hill who had little previous experience in government and little loyalty to established parties or leaders Accordingly there is a broad belief on Capitol Hill that the Senates tradition of virtually unlimited debate must be adapted to the new nature of the Senate membership The giants of the Senate are gone one senior aide to the Senate leadership said They were the glue that held this place together While many of the panels recommendations face extended scrutiny leaders from both parties say they are determined to seek changes in the rules that govern filibusters Now a filibuster can be ended by invoking cloture a procedure to cut off debate that takes the votes of 60 senators but determined and resourceful lawmakers can keep their delaying tactics going long after the cloture vote Would Impose Time Limits The PearsonRibicoff report suggests placing strict limits on how long members can speak and how many amendments they can offer after cloture is invoked Some version of this proposal seems likely to be adopted Senate leaders would also like to curb the practice of offering extraneous or nongermane riders to pending bills Many senators are particularly incensed at the tactic of conservative lawmakers who regularly offer amendments on such volatile issues as abortion or school prayer to must legislation The PearsonRibicoff report suggests making it possible for the Senate to prohibit all nongermane amendments to a bill through a premium vote either twothirds or threefifths of the membership Senator Byrd and other leaders favor a similar change Some of the other suggestions in the report include  Setting annual agendas and weekly schedules for Senate business and allowing television coverage of major debates Now the Senate schedule is often uncertain from hour to hour and television is banned  Appointing one senator as permanent presiding officer in order to strengthen the authority of the chair and enable him to enforce existing rules Under the Constitution the Vice President presides over the Senate but in practice the chair is usually taken by a freshman member who exerts little or no authority over the debate  Banning the ability of senators to bring up an issue more than once in a session This suggestion would inhibit lawmakers who insist on introducing controversial riders at every oportunity  Reducing the number of committees while broadening their jurisdiction and eliminating the staffs and legislative authority of subcommittees The report notes that some lawmakers belong to as many as 17 different panels and are often scheduled to appear at several different places at the same time The authors hope their suggestion would cut down on the amount of legislation and the extreme specialization of many lawmakers  Absorbing the Budget Committee into existing committees The authors argue that the current situation has upset the committee balance and given the Budget Committee far too much power  Stretching the budget process over two years The report maintains that the workload is becoming too great for Congress to pass a budget and individual appropriations bills every year Senator Mathias admitted that there was some tough stuff in the report but he promised serious consideration of the recommendations I think this is an important thing he said The effectiveness of the Senate over the next few years depends on our doing something
RULES TO AID HANDICAPPED INFANTS FACE COURT TEST,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/09/us/rules-to-aid-handicapped-infants-face-court-test.html,A Federal district judge heard an impassioned argument here today on the legality of Federal rules that require doctors and hospitals to provide food and medical care to infants with severe birth defects Judge Gerhard A Gesell said he would decide next week whether to uphold or strike down the rules which took effect March 22 The judge who is the son of a famous child psychologist and pediatrician Dr Arnold L Gesell said the new rules would have a profound effect on the practice of medicine and would reach into a hospitals apportionment of its lifesustaining resources The rules require hospitals to post notices saying Discriminatory failure to feed and care for handicapped infants in this facility is prohibited by Federal law Anyone who knows about a handicapped infants being denied customary medical care is asked to call the Federal Government on a tollfree telephone number Removing the Parents Role Judge Gesell without indicating how he might rule said at todays hearing The regulation purports to take away from the doctor any consideration except pure medicine At present he said the primary consideration affecting many hospitals and physicians is the parents wishes about whether a newborn handicapped infant should live or die The regulation he added is designed to remove the parents from that role Stephan A Lawton a lawyer for the American Academy of Pediatrics one of the plaintiffs denounced the rules saying they injected the Federal Government directly into the hospital nursery and into the physicianparentpatient relationship Neil H Koslowe a Justice Department lawyer defended the rules which were issued by the Secretary of Health and Human Services The Secretarys effort he said is not an effort to supplant the medical judgment of the health care provider or even to establish any standards of treatment Rather he said the Government wanted to insure that extraneous nonmedical factors such as the cost of rearing a handicapped infant did not intrude into the decisionmaking process Thus he said the Government is protecting the medical sphere from nonmedical intrusions Indiana Case Is Recalled The question of medical care for handicapped infants was widely debated after a retarded infant known only as Baby Doe died last April in Bloomington Ind Food and medical treatment had been withheld from the child with the approval of his parents and a state court Antiabortion groups have complained that the withholding of food and care in such cases amounts to infanticide President Reagan took an interest in the issue and directed the Department of Health and Human Services to remind hospitals of their responsibilities under the Rehabilitation Act of 1973 The law says that no handicapped person shall be excluded from a federally supported program solely by reason of his handicap Many doctors and hospitals contend that Federal officials violated the Administrative Procedure Act because they did not give the public an opportunity to comment on the regulations before they took effect The formulation of these rules involving complex medical legal and ethical issues cried out for public participation Mr Lawton said The Government in issuing the rules said it could not wait for public comments because any delay would leave lives at risk The Childrens Hospital National Medical Center here and the National Association of Childrens Hospitals have joined the 25000member academy of pediatrics as plaintiffs in the case In opening his argument today Mr Koslowe the Government lawyer quoted the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr as saying Of all forms of inequality injustice in health is the most shocking and the most inhuman Mr Koslowe added that the new rules represented the Governments effort to investigate inequality and injustice in the care of handicapped infants Dr M Harry Jennison executive director of the academy of pediatrics said in an interview that the dispute was really a product of high technology developed in the last 15 years With such technology he said we can salvage the tiniest premature babies including some who weigh less than two pounds and were born after 220 days of gestation instead of the normal 280

that depicted in the classic film It all takes place in 1941 French colonial Casablanca controlled by the Free French government that was beholden to the Nazis The series will focus on the relationships among the characters My star is not playing Humphrey Bogart hes playing Rick says Mr Wolper of Mr Soul He explained that he chose Casablanca because I felt that the relationships between the characters were so strong that other people could play the roles and it would work To me that makes a good series Im not doing Casablanca as it was done in the film I just want the character and the settings of Ricks place This television version looks like Casablanca I put smoke in muted colors and have terrifc actors not look alikes If its a hit Ill be a hero and if its a disaster  after 35

HOW WE LIVE NOW,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/10/books/how-we-live-now.html,US A Statistical Portrait of The American People Edited by Andrew Hacker With the Assistance of Lorrie Millman300 pp New York Viking Cloth 25 Penguin Books Paper 895STATISTICAL ABSTRACT OF THE UNITED STATES 198283 National Data Book and Guide to Sources 103d Edition US Department of Commerce Bureau of the Census 1008 pp Washington DC US Government Printing Office Cloth 15 Paper 11By CHRISTOPHER JENCKS ONE of the more bizarre byproducts of the Reagan Administrations distaste for big government has been talk about turning over part of the Governments statistical services to private enterprise In reality while the Federal Government is collecting analyzing and publishing somewhat less information about American life than it did two years ago the private sector has shown little interest in filling the gap It has however continued to repackage Government statistics which it gets free in forms the public is willing to pay for US edited by Andrew Hacker a professor of social sciences at Queens College is such a venture The Government has been publishing a Statistical Abstract of the United States annually since 1878 The 198283 paperback edition runs to more than 1000 pages sells for a mere 11 and contains something like 500000 statistics plus a 39page index running from Abortions to Zoology degrees conferred Every library buys one but bookstores dont stock it and only a handful of private citizens own it The fact that the current edition is only now appearing six months late because of budget cuts at the Census Bureau has passed completely unremarked by almost everyone Mr Hackers US includes fewer than 15000 statistics culled from the Statistical Abstract and other Government publications But while it provides far less data per dollar it embeds its numbers in prose rather than tables displays them in large type with ample margins and provides useful explanations of where the numbers come from and what they mean It contains too little information to be a useful reference work but because it focuses on statistics that either tell us something about American society or have some interest as highbrow gossip it should have considerable appeal to browsers The way US and the Statistical Abstract treat crime statistics provides a good illustration of their respective strengths and weaknesses The Statistical Abstract begins its section on crime with a dramatic chart titled Selected Crime Rates 1971 to 1981 According to the chart and the supporting table crime rates rose dramatically during the 70s From 1973 to 1980 for example forcible rapes per 100000 inhabitants rose 49 percent assaults rose 45 percent robberies rose 33 percent and burglaries rose 36 percent Readers who accept such statistics at face value as many have done mostly seem to conclude that the country is lapsing into anarchy But the data on crime in the 70s come from statistics local police departments send to the Federal Bureau of Investigation every year Local police departments only record those crimes that have been reported to them and investigated by them and that the investigating officers wrote up in a formal report as crimes that really happened Needless to say that method leaves a lot of crimes unrecorded Recognizing this since 1973 the Census Bureau has been asking large random samples of Americans whether they have been victims of various crimes Its surveys show far more crime than the FBI reports But there has been no increase in the proportion of the population that reports having been raped assaulted robbed or burglarized On the contrary the incidence of all four crimes fell slightly between 1973 and 1980 It takes no Sherlock Holmes to infer that what changed between 1973 and 1980 was not the amount of crime but the efficiency with which local police departments recorded crime So the Statistical Abstracts chart showing changes in crime rates measures changes in bureaucratic efficiency not in criminality THE Statistical Abstract says nothing about why the Census Bureau finds more crime than the FBI or about why FBI statistics show increases in crime since 1973 while the Census Bureau statistics show decreases It simply publishes both sets of numbers without comment US in contrast explains why the Census finds more crime than the FBI But even U S says nothing about the fact that FBI statistics show rising crime rates while Census statistics do not Indeed it provides no data whatever on changes in crime rates That is a puzzling omission since the public seems to be more interested in trends than in any other aspect of crime The one bit of information US does provide on trends in crime is misleading Mr Hacker presents a table showing that the percentage of crimes cleared by arrest fell between 1970 and 1980 Like the Statistical Abstracts chart on crime rates this table is likely to convince readers that the police are losing the war against crime But once again this apparent trend is a spurious byproduct of improved recordkeeping by local police departments If one compares arrest rates to victimization rates there is no evidence that the police are arresting a smaller percentage of those who commit crimes They are just arresting a smaller percentage of the people whose crimes they record The rule that statistics require explanation to insure that browsers are not misled applies to almost every area not just to crime Both the Statistical Abstract and US for example contain tables showing that median family income rose 113 percent between 1970 and 1980 while the Consumer Price Index rose 112 percent The tables therefore indicate that real family income was almost the same in 1980 as in 1970 Most people who see such statistics conclude that the American standard of living is stagnating But the tables are seriously misleading because what constituted a family changed between 1970 and 1980 As one can see by looking elsewhere in either US or the Statistical Abstract American families were smaller in 1980 than in 1970 Families shrank partly because they had fewer children and partly because parents were more likely to live apart leading the Census Bureau to count them as two families instead of one As a result the same amount of income per family meant more income per person Real income per person rose 22 percent between 1970 and 1980 even after allowing for higher taxes LEST there be any doubt that rising per capita income meant a rising standard of living for most Americans it is instructive to look at changes in what the typical American family owned Housing prices for example rose faster than family income during the 70s and many commentators claimed that this was putting the dream of home ownership beyond the reach of most American families Yet both US and the Statistical Abstract report that the proportion of families owning their own home rose from 63 percent in 1970 to either 64 or 65 percent in 1980 The explanation is clear While interest rates were high during the 70s interest on home mortgages was tax deductible and aftertax interest rates were consistently lower than inflation Borrowing money to buy a house was thus an almost surefire way of enjoying large capital gains the more you borrowed the more you gained Millions took advantage of this opportunity driving housing prices higher and higher Nor did the high price of housing force more families to live in substandard dwellings The average family member had 15 percent more space in 1980 than in 1970 The proportion of families with hot and cold water an indoor toilet and a shower or tub rose from 93 to 97 percent The proportion with a television set rose from 95 to 98 percent and the proportion with telephones rose from 91 to 96 percent At the same time the proportion of families with an automatic clothes washer rose from 62 to 77 percent the proportion with air conditioning rose from 41 to 56 percent and the proportion with electric dishwashers rose from 27 to 43 percent For a country that thought it was going to the poorhouse we certainly went in style While official statistics show that Americas per capita income fell below that of many European countries in the 70s these statistics reflect the vagaries of exchange rates which depend as much on interest rates trade balances and the whims of Saudi investors as on relative prices On almost every traditional measure of material wellbeing I have been able to find such as housing standards food consumption and ownership of consumer durables  Americans still seem to be better off than Europeans The one realm in which we clearly lag behind is health This is not because we spend less than other countries on medical care It may be because we take such poor care of ourselves or it may be because of the way we run our health care system None of this means we ought to be complacent about the state of the American economy As the Statistical Abstract shows the rate of output per worker has been stagnating If that trend persists living standards must eventually stagnate too Living standards rose during the 70s largely because we chose to spend our money on ourselves instead of having more children Since the Statistical Abstract shows that birth rates are no longer falling that route to rising affluence wont take us much farther AS these examples suggest browsing through statistics can be instructive if they are presented in such a way that their limitations are clear By that standard the Statistical Abstract is not just inadequate but downright dangerous It will continue to appeal to hardcore number junkies like myself but it would need much more detailed notes to become useful to the average citizen US provides more guidance for amateurs than the Statistical Abstract but not enough Instead of formulating specific questions that readers might want answered and then trying to assemble all the data relevant to answering them it titillates the reader with numbers some say a lot and some little Nonetheless it seems to me that in this instance free enterprise has filled a real need An hour spent browsing in U S will probably tell readers more things they didnt know about America than an hour spent reading any other book of this kind and in nine cases out of 10 what they learn will probably be true

TV: PRIVATE LIVES vs. A PUBLIC PRESS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/11/arts/tv-private-lives-vs-a-public-press.html,CBS NEWS makes a brave attempt to define the indefinable tonight In its second Eye on the Media seminar it gathers together some bright feisty people seats them at conference tables and sets loose a Harvard law professor to stir them up The seminar is called Private Lives Public Press and the participants discuss the individuals right to privacy which is sometimes opposed to journalisms right  or at least wish  to know In theory a line must be drawn someplace in practice hardly anyone knows where The program may be seen on Channel 2 at 10 The participants in the seminar are people from the arts law business and of course journalism mostly of the electronic kind The Harvard professor Arthur R Miller presents them with hypothetical cases Should the press for example report on a Congressman a whited sepulcher who cheats on his wife sniffs cocaine and is not what he pretends to be Does his morality really matter Meanwhile what the distinguished participants make clear when they discuss the hypothetical cases is this The positions they take depends on who they are Selfinterest and personal predilections are at least as important as the ambiguous reaches of Constitutional law Consider for instance another of Professor Millers hypothetical cases Felicia Forthright the people in the cases all have cute names is the leading Right to Life advocate in her state She is also a woman of unblemished reputation Then someone discovers that 25 years ago at the age of 17 she had an abortion Should the press report it It is an interesting question the answer trickier to find than it may seem In real life a journalist who found out about Mrs Forthrights abortion would be greatly influenced by whether he liked Mrs Forthright or not The Right to Life movement has some dreadful harridans in its ranks it also has some warm generous loving women If Mrs Forthright was among the latter one supposes many reporters or their editors would be more likely to bury the story Real life however is one thing and the seminar which is sponsored by both CBS and the Columbia Graduate School of Journalism is another A seminar demands absolute answers principles must be laid down At this seminar the case of Mrs Forthright inspires real passion William F Buckley Jr the celebrated conservative says he would not report the abortion Bob Schieffer the chief Washington correspondent for CBS says he would Mr Schieffer says that rich people can afford abortions and poor people cant and thats what this argument is all about Mr Buckley however says The point is that she had an abortion when she was 17 years old Mr Buckley is on the verge of anger so is Mr Schieffer Each begins to interrupt the other Then they cross the verge of anger clearly they are angry Its the worst kind of elitism Youre going around saying its all right for me but its not all right for you Mr Schieffer says He goes on to call Mr Buckleys position immoral twice This is not a seminar that defines the lengths of your curiosity Its a seminar that defines the lengths of your licit curiosity Mr Buckley says coldly Mr Buckley is being a little obscure here but no matter Other participants immediately jump in all critical of Mr Buckley In fact there hasnt been much elitism or immorality in what he has said there has been instead a political position tempered with what seems to be humanity Mr Buckley has argued that if Mrs Forthright has had an abortion it is nobodys business but her own Simultaneously his political position  support for the Right to Life movement has surfaced Mr Buckleys respondents in turn argue from their own political position they are opposed to the Right to Life movement The original issue privacy has been replaced How one feels about Mrs Forthright now depends on how one feels about the politics of abortion Ideology morality and reason are not necessarily compatible It proves that a decent journalist should operate by the seat of his or her pants Meanwhile there is a good deal of oneupmanship in the onehour discussion Often the participants  Barbara Walters Lauren Bacall Morley Safer the lawyer Floyd Abrams among them  seem to be playing Can You Top This It is annoying Still they are trying to discuss a serious issue and they should be heard It is a shame CBS has scheduled the program opposite the Academy Awards
TELEVISION WEEK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/arts/television-week-093163.html,Explosion of Emotion The Public Broadcasting Services Kennedy Center Tonight series consists of performance kinds of programs Dale Bell executive producer said recently but unlike the Lincoln Center and Live From the Met stuff Ive tried to make this series different much more human if you will His latest attempt is Robinson Jefferss adpatation of the Euripides tragedy Medea starring Zoe Caldwell and Judith Anderson The two recreate roles that earned them critical plaudits last year at the John F Kennedy Center for the Performing Arts in Washington and on Broadway Medea will be broadcast on Channel 13 Wednesday from 8 to 930 PM In the first Broadway production of Mr Jefferss adaptation 36 years ago Miss Andersons Medea won her a Tony award and later Miss Caldwell was in the chorus when this production played in Australia In recent stagings Miss Anderson plays the Nurse and Miss Caldwell portrays the passionate heroine driven to infanticide Miss Caldwells husband Robert Whithead produced the 1947 and 1982 productions For television he said in a recent telephone interview he sort of collaborated with Mark Cullingham the director The most interesting problem Mr Whitehead explained was finding a way in which you could project the kind of classic size  the rather massive explosion of emotion and massive tragedy  with a camera three feet from the actors and actresses Therefore Mr Whitehead said despite the actresses familiarity with the work the television production required nearly three weeks of rehearsals at the old Manhattan Opera House on 34th Street Taping took place last November on a soundstage in Toronto Incidentally Channel 13 will present Reflections on Medea individual recollections by Miss Anderson Miss Caldwell and Mr Whitehead  the same evening at 11 PM The Abortion Experience We made this film said Mark Obenhaus referring to his documentary Abortion Clinic because we thought this was an issue that had very little human dimension Part of the Public Broadcasting Services Frontline series Abortion Clinic shows perhaps for the first time on television a doctor performing actual abortions Jessica Savitch is the host and it will be telecast Monday at 8 PM Ironically Mr Obenhaus believes the abortion issue has been so politicized that people are talking about basically abstract ideas to such an extent that the actual experience of abortion and the actual experience of protesting abortion are sort of forgotten The complexity of the experience is not really understood His film is far from abstract At a clinic in Chester Pa Mr Obenhaus filmed interviews with two patients by clinic staff members before surgery and the patients personal feelings about the termination of their pregnancies Outside the clinic Mr Obenhaus recorded antiabortion protestors and a righttolife physician who leads the weekly picketing and counsels pregnant women Mr Obenhaus calls his film observational in character Break for Young Writer John McNamara only 20 years old and a junior at New York University has won a national playwriting contest And now his first screenplay Revenge of the Nerd an hourlong comedy will be broadcast on The CBS Afternoon Playhouse Tuesday at 430 PM Mr McNamaras Present Tense which won the Young Playwrights Festival of 1981 was produced Off Broadway Winning the prize just set off a whole chain of events Mr McNamara said last week I saw it as a break and I was fairly determined that this was a good opportunity that might not present itself for years I was determined to get at least an agent out of it and if I could an agent and a television assignment And he did precisely that Frank Doeiger of Highgate Television Productions saw Present Tense and asked if he could write for television Mr McNamara submitted Revenge of the Nerd Another student Ken Kwapis of the University of Southern California for the first time in his career did the rewriting and polishing Does Mr McNamara believe writing can be taught It always depends on the teacher he said A good teacher will give you a set of guidelines and he will never let you stray from them He always kicks you in the butt if youre lazy but he never constricts what you want to say or what you want you to do Demystifying Banking This week two of the networks will be attempting to analyze the current scene in domestic and international finance Banking on the Brink an hourlong NBC Report with Marvin Kalb will be broadcast Friday at 10 PM And On Borrowed Time will be presented on ABC on Thursday beginning at 10 PM with Pierre Salinger Both networks concede they face two challenges To present the material clearly and to show viewers interesting and relevant pictures Only the viewer can say if we succeed says James Gannon Mr Gannon the NBC producer says his report focuses on the revolution in banking in the past 25 years especially the way banks get and distribute money Since prominent bankers dont talk too much in public  for example Walter B Wriston the chairman of Citicorp said he was too busy to be interviewed  NBCs research included scrutiny of testimony on the collapse of the Penn Square Bank of Oklahoma City and examination of the Mexican fiscal crisis That crisis inspired the ABC documentary Mr Salinger said that ABC aims to show how American bankers loans to developing countries came about how the United States and third world countries depend upon one another whether the bankers are really worried how banks profits are affected and how American workers and their pocketbooks are also affected
SENATE G.O.P. MODERATES MAY CHART AN INDEPENDENT COURSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/weekinreview/senate-gop-moderates-may-chart-an-independent-course.html,During a Senate Budget Committee meeting last week Senator Lawton Chiles of Florida the ranking Democrat proposed increasing taxes by 30 billion in fiscal year 1984 Senator Mark Andrews a North Dakota Republican crossed over and voted with a solid block of Democrats for the proposal The Chiles amendment failed on a tie But Mr Andrewss defection was an important symbol of a new development the determination of moderate Senate Republicans to separate themselves from the Reagan economic policy and become a more organized force in a chamber that is basically run by conservatives of their party A few days before the budget vote five senior Republican moderates proposed an alternative budget that called for even higher revenues than Mr Chiles plus more than 7 billion in additional spending on such programs as child nutrition and Medicaid Like Mr Andrews the five lawmakers believe that the Reagan economic program is staggering and that higher taxes are necessary to reduce the budget deficit and restore investor confidence It is my view said Senator John H Chafee of Rhode Island one of the five dissidents that reducing the Federal deficit to manageable proportions is the most important step we can take to reduce interest rates and thus provide jobs An unemployment rate of 10 percent is intolerable Reviving the Rockefeller Wing The moderates potential power was demonstrated when the budget panel recessed until early this week without resolving the tax issue because the White House and Senator Pete V Domenici of New Mexico the panel chairman did not have the votes to protect the third stage of the Presidents tax reduction program scheduled to go into effect July 1 During the weeks deliberations the committee also rejected Mr Reagans proposal to freeze most domestic spending and actually added more than 11 billion in nondefense outlays The President Senator Andrews asserted continues to think that all our problems will go away But things arent working that way There has long been a split between conservatives and moderate Republicans that group once known as the Rockefeller wing of the party During the first two years of the Reagan Presidency the moderates success was negative  leading the fight against attempts to ban abortion permit school prayer and otherwise tamper with court jurisdictions But their frustration level was building As Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr of Connecticut one of the coauthors of the alternative budget put it Invariably we were given a choice between this conservative program or that conservative program this conservative contender or that one We felt very strongly that we had to put together a group and start to affect the decisions made up here Their determination was bolstered in November when Senator Weicker Senator Chafee and Senator Robert T Stafford of Vermont narrowly won reelection Returned to Washington convinced that their party had to shift course they joined with Senators Charles McC Mathias of Maryland and Mark O Hatfield of Oregon to draft their own budget We are Republicans and were proud of that fact said Senator Weicker But the image that has been created  in social terms Constitutional terms and racial terms  has been entirely wrong And that could be permanently damaging to the party The moderates could matter The Republicans hold 54 Senate seats If the 46 Democrats remain disciplined and the dozen or so moderate Republicans stick together a new coalition could exert considerable leverage Those are however big ifs A near dozen conservative Democrats often cross party lines and the moderate Republicans have yet to prove that they can buck their party leadership and the White House on a regular basis Many of them are likely to go against the President this week on repeal of income tax withholding on interest and dividends MrReagan again urged that the provision stand in his national radio address yesterday But then many conservatives also favor repeal Strong forces are driving the moderates toward a more independent stance One of their main motives is the economic stagnation in the Frost Belt states that many represent I dont think the signs of economic recovery are conclusive Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania said In my state he added theres been no pick up at all and a lot more needs to be done As their budget proposals indicated the moderates advocate more direct Government aid to the needy Senator Stafford spoke for many of them when he said We cannot abandon the victims of the economy on the battlefield On a deeper level the moderates also want Government to deal with the longerrange structural problems of their aging industrial areas Senator Richard G Lugar of Indiana a state that relies heavily on the automobile industry said We have a very sizeable transition going on that wont cure itself As Senator Chafee noted the moderates believe that economic recovery can only be stimulated by higher taxes lower deficits and declining interest rates A specific aim of the moderates is the Senate leadership When Majority Leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee retires next year one of their number they hope will win a place among the powerholders They also believe that their influence over the Administrations economic program could strongly color the elections of 1984 Our ability to get the President reelected and to keep Republicans in office depends on our ability to do a good job running the Government said Senator Specter Republicans are responsible for running the government and weve got to do it right
IN DEFENSE OF BUSING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/17/magazine/in-defense-of-busing.html,Lee A Daniels is a reporter on the Metropolitan staff of The Times Today hundreds of school buses routinely traverse the 540 square miles that comprise the CharlotteMecklenburg countywide publicschool system carrying 48000 pupils every day  12000 of whom travel in accordance with the 1969 Federal court order that desegregated the public schools in this North Carolina community Contrary to the popular opinion that forced busing has failed in the United States it seems to have worked effectively in Charlotte the nations 31stlargest school system with a total of 73000 pupils And busing is apparently supported by the vast majority of pupils their parents and the citys leaders The first wave of desegregation was turbulent despite the areas generally enlightened political and social tradition From 1970 to 1973 this New South city of 324000 saw each of its 10 senior high schools closed temporarily because of racial fighting Alfred Alexander a 1971 West Charlotte High School graduate whose classes had previously been overwhelmingly black recalls his first year of desegregation It was rough here he says We were so segregated that many blacks had never encountered whites close up either So there was a lot of tension  A fight between two people if one was white and the other black became not just a personal thing but the start of a race riot Today the prevailing view of school integration in Charlotte is similar to that expressed by Christi Derreberry a white junior at East Mecklenburg High School I dont think segregated schools would be very interesting she says Here you learn to work with different kinds of people Charlotte is one of busings many success stories yet busing is widely perceived as a failure Certainly as the end of another school year draws near and the 30th anniversary of the Supreme Court ruling outlawing separate but equal education aproaches the controversy over busing refuses to go away In nearly every session since 1968 Congress has passed antibusing legislation Presidents Nixon and Ford publicly condemned mandatory busing and directed the Justice Department to defeat it through the courts President Reagan and his conservative Administration have been even more outspoken in their denunciations of busing to achieve racial balance and have actively sought to curtail its enforcement In recent months in communities across the country busing has been in the headlines In an effort to avoid litigation St Louis and surrounding school systems are attempting a voluntary busing plan that would transport schoolchildren across district lines Ordered to desegregate its schools in 1955 the East Baton Rouge La school system recently presented the court with an alternative to busing that critics have labeled a blueprint for segregation In Los Angeles a mandatory busing program was ended last fall by court decree after Californians voted to adopt the stricter Federal standards requiring proof of intent on the part of local or state authorities to segregate schools Yet a remarkable transformation has occurred in school desegregration since the Supreme Court ruled in 1954 that legally segregated public education was unconstitutional As the Federal Government forced Southern state and local governments to desegregate the regions public schools became more integrated  primarily because of racially focused busing  than many schools in the North and West A report released in January by the Joint Center for Political Studies a Washingtonbased research organization indicated that Southern and border states continue to lead the nation in the desegregation of black students while segregation is increasing in the Northeast segregation of Hispanics has risen sharply nationwide Yet President Reagan Attorney General William French Smith and Assistant Attorney General Civil Rights Divison William Bradford Reynolds have repeatedly asserted that mandatory busing plans are illconsidered and unworkable and that voluntary measures are the best means of achieving desegregation The Justice Department has joined in court other parties seeking to reduce or eliminate busing plans in Seattle Tacoma and Pasco Wash and Nashville Tenn but the courts have ruled against all these attempts Washingtons political drumbeat against busing unquestionably reflects the opinion of many whites and some blacks and Hispanics Polls show that while support for desegregated schools continues to increase disapproval of busing as a means to accomplish it has hardened If mandatory busing had proven to be effective in desegregating school systems across the country says Assistant Attorney General Reynolds then I think you would probably have a much different public response But time after time in jurisdiction after jurisdiction its been shown that busing has not been effective and as a result of that public education has suffered mightily But many civilrights professionals and academic desegregation experts argue that such remarks are completely at variance with the facts about racially focused busing and they have presented substantial evidence that busing largely works Their research shows that contrary to popular opinion busing has usually been imposed only after careful consideration and in many cases after voluntary desegregation measures have been tried and proved unsuccessful It has found that minority students generally have made academic gains without damaging the scholastic performance of whites In most instances the health and safety of students has not been jeopardized nor have they been forced to travel extraordinary distances to school Busing does not consume a large portion of the school systems budget nor does it subvert the socalled neighborhoodschool principle Their assertions have been bolstered by the House Judiciary Subcommittee on Civil and Constitutional Rights which concluded after hearings in 1981 that busing achieves a degree of desegregation that is unattainable through other means In addition contrary to opinion polls that show an antibusing sentiment among a majority of Americans who have had little or no personal experience of racially focused busing a March 1981 Harris poll found overwhelming support for it among families whose children had actually been bused for racial desegregation Of those parents polled 54 percent said the busing experience had proved very satisfactory another 33 percent said it had been partially satisfactory and 11 percent said it was not satisfactory These latest findings the Harris report stated are diametrically opposed to the general impression that such busing has been a disaster where it has been tried Statistics from Government agencies and desegregation studies show for example that busing is the norm rather than the exception in American school life About 55 percent of all publicschool pupils are bused daily Of that number only 7 percent  or fewer than 4 percent of all publicschool students  are bused to achieve racial desegregation Charles D Moody and Jeffrey D Ross of the University of Michigan School of Education found suggestive evidence that more pupils are being transported at public expense to racially segregated schools  including public schools private schools parochial schools and recently organized Protestant churchrelated academies  than for purposes of school desegregation Studies also show that the median travel time for all elementaryschool pupils being bused for whatever reasons is less than 15 minutes only 15 percent of the youngsters travel more than 30 minutes to and from school and busing generally consumes no more than 2 percent of a school departments budget Because children in many deliberately segregated school systems often were bused long distances in order to maintain segregation the number of miles buses travel after desegregation may actually decrease even though more students are being bused A 1970 study found for example that the number of students bused in Georgia in the late 1960s to foster significant desegregation increased by 14434 but that bus mileage declined by 473662 miles Federal District Judge James B McMillan who presided over the Swann v CharlotteMecklenburg Board of Education case from the late 1960s to the mid1970s put it in plain terms before a Senate subcommittee in 1981 Busing is necessary legal cheap safe and practical harlottes staunch resistance to the Federal court order weakened after 1971 when the Supreme Court upheld Judge McMillans order to desegregate the countys school system The citys business and political leaders began stressing the publics duty to obey the law Parents of bused children organized themselves to make the busing plan less cumbersome In 1973 Charlotte voters replaced three antibusing schoolboard members with candidates who had counseled acceptance of the court plan Quiet returned to the schools Last June Charlotte where the racial makeup of the schools has changed in 15 years from 71 percent white and 29 percent black to 62 percent white and 38 percent black graduated its first class of desegregation babies  4900 seniors who had attended integrated schools all their lives School desegregation and the busing still necessary to achieve it have largely disappeared as topics of public controversy especially among the current crop of students most of whom know nothing other than racially mixed schools Jeffrey Taylor is studentbody president of East Mecklenburg High School where the 2089 students are 76 percent white 18 percent black and 6 percent Asian and others Its evident from the way things go on here he says that black students are involved in the school just like white students Jeffrey a white senior points out that his opponent in the presidential campaign was black They needed a runoff to decide between us he says It was that close and there was no racial bloc voting Sonja Gantt who is black presides over the schools 630student senior class of which fewer than 100 are black I feel very proud she says referring to her election as class president because it shows me most of my classmates whatever their color look at me as a leader Race isnt a topic here says Lynne Cosper another white East Mecklenburg student whose family moved to Charlotte from New Jersey nearly two years ago People dont separate along racial lines Its hard to remember the pain and agony of those first years because weve now replaced it with something else says Richard Cansler the white principal of West Charlotte High School for two years and a veteran of Charlottes schools for 19 years Were still in the years of change we dont have a perfect society here he quickly adds strolling across the schools campus But weve come a long way Leroy Pop Miller West Charlottes former assistant principal who recently retired as head of East Mecklenburg points out that his school has 41 extracurricular clubs a very helpful parent Boosters Club a comprehensive program for handicapped students and the top girls crosscountry team in the state A student body should be a reflection of the total community he says We have a school community that works Charlotte owes its success to more than just its tradition of public spiritedness Its switch to a countywide school system in 1960 meant that anxious parents could not flee to the suburbs to escape desegregation Also the areas schools have long enjoyed an excellent reputation and in sharp contrast to many other cities Charlottes black and white middle and upper classes kept their children in public schools throughout the desegregation crisis Why if busing can be as successful as it has been in Charlotte is there such a gap between the reality of busing and antibusing rhetoric Willis D Hawley dean of Vanderbilt Universitys George Peabody College for Teachers believes one reason is the mixed conclusions of various studies conducted in the mid1970s on the impact of school desegregation  far too soon to assess a situation that was limited both in scope and numbers of children bused People found no conclusive evidence then that it outweighed the costs involved he explains and although that conclusion has now decisively changed little attention has been paid to it Gary Orfield professor of political science at the University of Chicago and a desegregation expert speculates that the gap partially results from a propensity of both politicians and others to focus on busings glaring failures to the exclusion of its successes Conclusions about busing and school desegregation are more often than not drawn from what occurred in Los Angeles and Boston two major cities where school authorities fiercely resisted minimal desegregation plans and not from what has happened in Charlotte Pontiac Mich or TampaHillsborough County Fla three of the far larger number of communities where desegregation and busing have been accepted after initial periods of turmoil James M Nabrit 3d associate counsel of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund Inc suggests that mandatory desegregation has become a lightning rod for a range of grievances about social change and the influence of judicial and Federal authority Like other such highintensity political issues as abortion the death penalty and school prayer says Nabrit the depth of emotion about racially focused busing simply overwhelms any countervailing data Until the 1970s school segregation outside the South was widely assumed to be incidental or de facto the result of individual preference and the natural development of neighborhoods and communities But the record of court cases in such communities as Boston Detroit Indianapolis Denver Dayton Pontiac and Minneapolis proved that Northern officials could be as zealously discriminatory as their Southern counterparts School officials in these cities were found to have manipulated school grade structures locations and sizes gerrymandered attendance zones and when all else failed bused pupils to foster and preserve segregation Bostons legacy of institutionalized racism contributes today to its poorly desegregated public schools The Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court ruled in 1855 that Boston could build schools exclusively for black children and prohibit their attendance at other public schools The decision later became an underpining for the United States Supreme Courts 1896 Plessy v Ferguson ruling in favor of separate but equal schooling During the 1960s Bostons black community sought to negotiate the end of a segregated school system in which black children represented 23 percent of the student population Its requests were repeatedly rebuffed by the allwhite Boston School Committee and later by the majority of the citys white electorate A 1974 Federal District Court decision later found that during the 1960s the Boston school board had taken numerous and deliberate steps to segregate the schools further Bostons English High School founded in 1820 and the first public high school in the United States offered a particularly poignant example of the lengths school officials went to in order to maintain segregated schools The Federal Court determined that starting in 1967 the school had changed under the direction of school authorities from an institution drawing its students from all over Boston to one largely limited to taking those from predominantly black elementary and junior high schools As a result English Highs enrollment changed from 80 percent white to 81 percent black within five years Simultaneously the school board withdrew needed educational resources from the school Intensive resistance to desegregation on the part of Bostons school officials stoked the embers of racial hatred that coming from the Athens of America surprised and fascinated the rest of the country in the mid1970s Resistance accomplished two things It foreclosed the opportunity to establish voluntarily desegregation procedures that likely would have involved a minimum of busing and it raised the hopes of whites that desegregation would never occur In the face of the court ruling which required busing within a single city district whites continued to resist desegregation fervently and white publicschool enrollment began a precipitous citywide decline from 53593 in 1973 to 18592 today Although Boston has had tremendous difficulties  including sporadic racial violence  desegregation has forced upon the school system reforms that would not be possible otherwise These reforms include an upgraded occupationaleducation program a greater number of magnet schools and the direct involvement of area businesses and colleges in the affairs of the high schools Unquestionably busing suffered a political defeat because of the intransigence of whites but busing advocates would argue that Bostons failure represents a lack of political will rather than a failure of busing itself Bostons attempt at desegregation underscores two major new developments both studied by Gary Orfield of the University of Chicago Although viewed as a national policy problem severe segregation now occurs in a relatively small number of states often in only one metropolitan area Yet these states have the largest percentages of minority children Of these states Illinois New York Michigan and New Jersey have the greatest number of black children in segregated schools only Florida and North Carolina have achieved significant desegregation Boston also casts in sharp relief the central role of metropolitan busing plans involving both city and suburbs Most of the desegregated Southern communities were small or had countywide school systems like CharlotteMecklenburg As Los Angeles Chicago Detroit and others cities outside the South were investigated the problem became increasingly apparent How could desegregation be achieved in school systems that were or would soon become predominantly black and Hispanic In 1973 the Supreme Court ruled that metropolitan desegregation plans could be ordered only if suburban or state officials had deliberately contributed to school segregation in the city Such collaboration has been proved in several cases including Wilmington Del Louisville Ky and Denver Colo among others Despite the objections critics raise to compulsory desegregation on a metropolitan scale advocates such as William Taylor a former official of the United States Civil Rights Commission and now director of Catholic Universitys Center for National Policy Review insist such a program is virtually the only way to break the racial and class segregation that consigns most black and Hispanic children to large corecity schools Referring to studies showing that metropolitan plans lead to a greater integration of housing as well as to a greater socioeconomic mix of students Taylor asserts Metropolitan and countywide desegregation plans may be the most effective way to achieve integrated schools stable integrated neighborhoods and bettereducated children in both large cities and rural areas Over the next five years for example 15000 to 20000 black students from St Louiss predominantly black school system will be bused to 22 predominantly white Missouri county districts as part of a desegregation plan arising from an 11yearold suit White suburban children will be encouraged to transfer to city magnet schools offering special programs The suburban jurisdictions agreed to participate in order to avoid litigation about their responsibility for St Louiss segregated schools Busings critics have charged that it causes whites to abandon the cities James S Coleman the sociologist at the University of Chicago whose 1966 study Equality of Educational Opportunity played a significant role in broadening support for busing reversed his position in 1975 claiming that later research proved mandatory busing had actually increased educational segregation because it drove whites to suburbia Presented with countervailing facts gathered by other scholars Coleman later conceded that his research was not conclusive but says that he still believes busing is counterproductive Attributing white flight solely to busing racializes the longterm exodus of middleclass children from urban public schools by focusing on race and not class charges Michael Sussman a former staff attorney in the Justice Departments Civil Rights Division who is now an assistant general counsel with the NAACP This largescale migration of whites to the suburbs began shortly after World War II Sussman points out and its causes included record levels of suburban housing construction changing job patterns and discriminatory housing practices that made suburbs allwhite enclaves This pattern combined with the sharply declining birthrate of whites relative to blacks and Hispanics explains the continuing decline in white publicschool enrollments in most large cities The Supreme Courts 1954 Brown v Board of Education decision outlawing segregated schools required only that courts order school officials to correct intentional segregation but judges have responded to the spirit of the law as well as to the demands of civilrights groups and black parents that black children receive a quality education in their desegregated setting The courts have ordered school faculties and staffs to be desegregated and curriculums changed to improve the education available to all students In Charlotte where the turmoil of the first years of desegregation noticeably affected the public school systems traditionally good testscore showings scores in recent years have once again equaled or surpassed national norms in reading and mathematics School officials also report that the gap between black and white students on the North Carolina Minimum Skills Competency Test continues to diminish One review of 93 studies examining the academic impact of desegregation on various school systems found that minority students performance in class work and on standardized tests noticeably improved and that white students performance at least kept pace with predesegregation levels These studies showed that because of their previously inferior schooling minority students required at least two years before any positive impact on their academic work became evident They also determined that minority students with the longest experience with desegregated education performed the best These findings busing advocates contend have been reinforced by those of the National Assessment of Educational Progress surveys conducted by the Education Commission of the United States and the Governments primary means of monitoring elementaryand secondaryschool students academic progress Beyond these relatively immediate results James M McPartland codirector of the Center for Social Organization of Schools at Johns Hopkins University has discovered that school desegregation also produces important longterm effects In comparing black children in segregated schools with those in desegregated schools he found that the latter were more likely to be aware of and have a positive outlook on career opportunities have higher levels of educational aspiration and attainment attend traditionally white rather than traditionally black colleges pursue careers beyond those traditionally gained by blacks and experience greater social mobility In short he found that presentday student experiences in desegregated schools lay the foundation for a natural reduction of segregation in adult life and in future generations In 1981 a Federal District Court judge ordered substantial changes in the 10yearold desegregation plan of NashvilleDavidson County schools including the easing of metropolitan busing requirements and the return of most elementaryschool pupils to neighborhood schools Critics claimed the decision would have significantly increased school segregation When the United States Court of Appeals for the Sixth Circuit overturned the decision the Justice Department joined the local school boards appeal to the Supreme Court which dismissed the appeal without comment The NAACPs Thomas Atkins maintains that the Reagan Administrations other efforts to curtail busing will be equally ineffective because the facts and the law are against them However Nabrit of the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund believes the Administrations active opposition is significant because the Justice Department has substantial resources it could bring to bear in a positive way on this issue The Reagan Administrations actions have already convinced many civilrights activists that current Federal policy in the words of a recent report of the Washington Council of Lawyers a private nonpartisan association of attorneys signifies that  separate but equal schooling illegal for a generation has again become acceptable Reynolds of the Justice Department denies this stressing that the Administration is simply seeking alternative ways to achieve more progress than has been demonstrated to be achieved under the old formulas  Were doing everything we can to enforce civil rights But according to Orfield of the University of Chicago the Administrations insistence on the effectiveness of voluntary programs is not supported by the history of school desegregation He maintains that of the hundreds of communities that have undergone school desegregation only Teaneck NJ in the early 1960s and Seattle Tacoma and Pasco Wash two years ago have done so without at least the threat of a court order Further he says several school desegregation cases have had to be reopened after it became evident that voluntary programs were not eliminating segregation In recent years opposition to courtordered busing has received additional support from an unexpected quarter from blacks themselves In the early 1970s Atlantas blacks were granted control over that citys school board in exchange for not pursuing a metropolitanwide desegregation case through the courts The blacks favoring the arrangement the socalled Atlanta Compromise asserted that once blacks had the authority to address the educational needs of black children desegregation would be unnecessary Their political success soon spawned similar but unsuccessful attempts by blacks in Dallas Cleveland San Francisco and Detroit Recently in Boston where a local poll found that a majority of blacks surveyed were against busing a group of black parents asked the Federal judge to reduce the scope of the courtordered busing plan a request the NAACP is opposing A Boston Globe poll found that about 75 percent of the blacks polled opposed the busing plan arguing among other things that their children could get a quality education in their neighborhood schools In fact a group of black parents unsuccessfully petitioned the Federal District Court to change the busing plan to one allowing free choice as long as the school involved contained a student body whose racial mix corresponded to that of the school system as a whole according to Larry Johnson a staff attorney at the Center for Law and Education a publicinterest legal organization Johnson who has been involved in the Boston case since 1977 says the black parents believe we have reached the time when mandatory assignments are no longer required and free choice is in the best interests of them and their children Johnson remarks that the parents who advocate this position do not necessarily think the momentum of the school boards past segregative activity has changed Rather it is that the nineyear struggle over the plan forced black parents to become more involved in school affairs and more sophisticated about getting what they want In addition black opinion makers such as the columnist William Raspberry and Derrick Bell dean of the University of Oregon Law School have argued that the busing issue wastes black political and educational energies in return for small ambiguous gains The issue that gets obscured says Raspberry is how to educate children who come from homes whose parents put little value on education on discipline and where they get little of the help which middleclass kids routinely do These arent racial problems at all he continues and you dont solve them by sending kids from one school to the next I am an integrationist who believes nonetheless that as far as school desegregation is concerned a proper emphasis should be the education of the black children I believe that black children can be taught and can learn in black schools Atkins of the NAACP insists that fundamentally what black and white critics of busing advocate though for different reasons is separate but equal schools They would rather forego desegregation in exchange for the allocation of greater resources to heavily minority schools The separatebutequal concept underlies last years Federal court ruling establishing a voluntary plan for Chicago where civilrights advocates say school officials have resisted desegregation for nearly 20 years Black and Hispanic students now constitute 81 percent of the systems enrollment 320 of its 540 schools have student populations that are 85 percent or more nonwhite Under the ruling most of these schools will remain unchanged but receive additional funds for staff and curriculum development The NAACP plans to appeal the decision Given that black and Hispanic students outnumber white pupils in most of the countrys 50 largest centralcity school districts some ask whether the separatebutequal approach might not be the only option for these schools But in response Atkins and Orfield among others raise several questions What safeguards are there to insure that the promised extra resources will continue to be allocated in this era of strained local state and Federal budgets Will teachers unions accept community control over school curriculums and personnel And what is to be done for Hispanic students Orfield stated in a recent report to the House Subcommitee on Civil and Constitutional Rights that while the desegregation trends for blacks were varied the pattern for Hispanic students is overwhelmingly toward greater segregation They are he said more and more likely to find themselves in schools with large numbers of the poor the nonEnglishspeaking and other minorities The separatebutequal concept would seem to ignore the fundamental point of the Brown v Board decision One groups power to segregate another  no matter how disguised by equal or extra resources or sweetened by political payoffs  effectively restrains that groups social mobility Such power also imposes an overwhelming burden on the segregated groups material and psychological wellbeing Doesnt separate but equal overlook too the evidence offered by communities like Charlotte that busing to achieve desegregation can work
1965 MEMOS SHOW DOW'S ANXIETY ON DIOXIN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/19/us/1965-memos-show-dow-s-anxiety-on-dioxin.html,Almost 20 years ago scientists from four rival chemical companies attended a closed meeting at the Dow Chemical Companys headquarters The subject was the health hazards of dioxin a toxic contaminant found in a widely used herbicide that the companies manufactured Shortly after the meeting in Midland Mich on March 24 1965 one of those attending wrote in a memorandum that Dow did not want its findings about dioxin made public because the situation might explode and generate a new wave of government regulation for the chemical industry Another scientist noted that at the meeting Dow officials had disclosed a study showing that dioxin caused severe liver damage in rabbits Dioxin which has also been linked to birth defects and skin disorders in laboratory animals is believed to be the deadliest chemical made by man but its effects on humans have been difficult to prove Since the Midland meeting various studies have yielded conflicting evidence on whether dioxin increases the risk of cancer in humans Although it has been known for many years that Dow held the 1965 meeting with its competitors excerpts from corporate memorandums about the session are only now beginning to emerge as a result of a lawsuit filed in 1979 against Dow and several other chemical companies The memorandums raise the possibility that Dow scientists have been saying one thing in private about dioxin while the companys management has said something else in public There is absolutely no evidence of dioxin doing any damage to humans except for something called chloracne Paul F Oreffice the president of Dow said last month on NBCs Today show Its a rash Dow has performed medical tests on individuals suffering from chloracne for over 20 years he added and there is no evidence of any damage other than this rash which went away soon after Dows critics challenge the accuracy of Mr Oreffices flat assertion that there is no evidence that dioxin causes human damage other than chloracne and also charge that Dow has failed to publish all the information it has collected in its own dioxin research Furthermore they say Dow has systematically resisted Federal and state efforts to learn about and regulate dioxin According to a pretrial motion filed by Yannacone  Associates the legal organization created to represent the Vietnam veterans in the Agent Orange case the 1965 meeting on dioxin was attended by eight of Dows senior scientists and six officials of Hooker Chemical the Diamond Alkali Company which later became part of Diamond Shamrock and the Hercules Powder Company A representative of the Monsanto Chemical Company was invited but did not attend Donald R Frayer a spokesman for Dow confirmed in an interview April 5 that the giant chemical company had called the meeting to discuss the health hazards of dioxin We feel the meeting was pretty darn straightforward and proper he said I think on the balance that the record shows we discovered a problem sought out our competitors and tried to give them information and a means to control the problem Invitation to Meeting The pretrial motion filed by Yannacone  Associates quoted a number of documents VK Rowe then director of Dows Biochemical Research Laboratory said in his invitation to the meeting that Dow had been researching toxicological problems caused by the presence of certain highly toxic impurities in certain samples of the herbicide 245T and wished to share its findings The Dow laboratory was and is recognized as one of the worlds finest privately owned toxicology labs Two days after the meeting CL Dunn a chemist who was manager for regulatory affairs for Hercules summarized in writing what he had been told Dow says that their examination of their own and competitors 245T products contain what they call surprisingly high amounts of the toxic impurities he wrote In addition to the skin effect he wrote describing the results of tests on rabbits liver damage is severe and a noeffect level based on liver response has not yet been established Even vigorous washing of the skin 15 minutes after application will not prevent damage and may possibly enhance the absorption of the material There is some evidence it is systemic Fear on Situation Dr John Frawley the chief toxicologist for Hercules who had also attended the March meeting got a followup telephone call four months later from Earl Farnum a Dow executive Dr Frawley immediately wrote a confidential memorandum to the file Mr Farnum he wrote said he was calling on behalf of a Dow vice president Donald Baldwin and stated that Dow was extremely frightened that this situation might explode They are aware that their competitors are marketing 245T which contains alarming amounts of acnegen Dr Frawley continued referring to dioxin and if the Government learns about this the whole industry will suffer They are particularly fearful of a Congressional investigation and excessive restrictive legislation on the manufacture of pesticides which might result A second memorandum written by Dr Frawley and quoted in part by lawyers for the veterans said he had just received new information about health effects of dioxin from Monsanto which did not send a representative to the meeting From the data provided a sample which contained 5 parts per million would be acutely toxic he wrote Whether this refers to death or liver damage is not clear Daniel Bishop a Monsanto spokesman said in an interview that his company didnt do any testing period not then and not now He said that a fair reading of Dr Frawleys full statement would make it clear that he had not received the toxicity information from Monsanto but was not able to identify the informations source because the material in the Agent Orange case had been sealed by the judge The documents were sealed at the chemical companies request Group of 75 Compounds Dioxin is the name given to any of a family of 75 compounds called dibenzoparadioxins composed of benzene molecules and oxygen atoms The compounds are an unwanted byproduct of several chemical processes including the manufacture of 245T under certain circumstances 245T is one of the two major components of Agent Orange Proving the specific effects of toxic chemicals on humans is extremely difficult human experiments are generally prohibited by medical ethics Animal tests which are universally accepted by scientists as providing essential guidance on appropriate exposure levels for humans are not a perfect guide because various species react differently In laboratory rats concentrations as small as five parts per 1000 million have caused statistically significant increases of cancer in rats Two studies conducted on a group of forestry workers in northern Sweden and on a group of agriculture workers in southern Sweden point to a possible association between exposure to herbicides contaminated with dioxin and an increased risk of softtissue cancers Other studies however including one in New Zealand show no higher risk of cancers for a group of farmers foresters and fisherman exposed to dioxin than in men in other occupations Dr Samuel S Epstein a physician who is professor of occupational and environmental medicine at the University of Illinois Medical Center in Chicago cites the Swedish studies and other research on such questions as reproductive abnormalities to challenge the statement of Dows president that there is no evidence that dioxin causes any more damage than a skin rash For Mr Oreffice to make that statement is absurd he said in a recent interview Warning on Dioxin Studies On March 23 Dr Perry J Gehrig Dows vice president for agricultural research and development and director of health and environmental science cautioned the House Subcommittee on Natural Resources Agriculture Research and Environment against overinterpreting the Swedish studies The reports he argued are too incomplete both individually and in aggregate to currently formulate a clear picture of the possible associations between TCDD and softtissue sarcomas TCDD is a form of dioxin In 1982 Dow scientists published a report of a company survey on the occurrence of spontaneous abortions stillbirths infant deaths and several categories of birth defects among the wives of Dow workers who had been directly exposed to dioxin The study concluded there were few differences in the number and kind of birth abnormalities found in these women compared with the wives of Dow workers not exposed to dioxin and the report has been used frequently to support the theory that dioxin is not as dangerous as generally believed But Dr Marvin S Legator professor and director of environmental toxicology at the University in Texas in Galveston questions the study Initially Dr Legator went on Dow planned on comparing the birth defects among the wives of Dow dioxin workers with two controls First a group of wives of Dow workers in Midland who had not been directly exposed to dioxin and second some wives of workmen who lived outside the Midland area This second control group was important because the Midland area is quite polluted and the general population has a relatively high level of congenital abnormalities But when they published the study the second control group was not included A Sampling Problem Mr Frayer the Dow spokesman said the second group had been deleted because of sampling problems The women could not be compared with those in the first two groups and they were questioned in a different way Mr Frayer said Information compiled by Dr Alvin Young an expert at the Veterans Administration indicates that from 1961 to 69 American companies made a total of 1545 million pounds of 245T Of that total 44 million pounds were applied to the jungles of Vietnam 234 million pounds were exported to other countries and 781 million pounds were used domestically The balance 10 million pounds was destroyed by the Government after it was decided to halt the Vietnam defoliation program Dr Young estimates that 1700 pounds of dioxin a year were produced in the United States from the mid1950s to about 1975 when steps were taken to limit it through changing the manufacturing process There is broad agreement that a substantial portion of dioxincontaminated wastes are buried in thousands of dumps around the country The Environmental Protection Agency recently said there were 12000 of these dumps Other experts have estimated the number may be closer to 50000 Suits Against Companies Billions of dollars are at stake in the answer to the question of what the chemical companies knew and when they knew it In addition to the tens of thousands of veterans who have sued the chemical companies because of their exposure to Agent Orange in Vietnam thousands of other Americans living near toxic dumps such as the one in the Love Canal area of Niagara Falls NY are seeking damages on the grounds that dioxin and chemical poisons left there have shortened their lives and caused cancer birth defects and genetic damage In January 1979 a group of veterans brought a Federal suit in New York charging that the dioxin contained in the 245T sprayed in Vietnam was a cause of cancer and other diseases among their members and had resulted in genetic damage and the birth of severely deformed children Victor John Yannacone Jr a principal organizer of the association of lawyers handling the classaction suit said in a recent interview that the group now represents 20000 Vietnam veterans widows and children of veterans who are seeking damages against the chemical companies that provided the Government with Agent Orange The suit against Dow and the other major manufacturers of 245T is scheduled to go to trial in the Uniondale LI court of Federal District Judge George C Pratt Jr in June EPA Action Opposed In an annual report filed with the Securities and Exchange Commission in Washington called a 10K Dow said it was one of six chemical companies who were defendants in the suit Dow believes it has not been scientifically demonstrated that the injuries claimed by the plaintiffs were caused or could have been caused by exposure to Agent Orange the report said The Dow report also noted that the chemical company was opposing a move by the Environmental Protection Agency initiated during the Carter Administration that would totally ban the use of 245T in the United States The herbicide therefore is still being used on rice fields on range lands and in industrial areas such as refineries to control weeds The companys repeated public statements about the comparative safety of dioxin including testimony to Congressional committees press releases and scientific papers have been accompanied by efforts on its part particularly in the Reagan Administration to block the Government from collecting information about the contaminant Evidence of the repeated contacts between Dow and EPA officials in Washington if not of the subject of the meetings is contained in the calendars and travel records of these officials that have been obtained by the House subcommittees investigating the agency Links to Government Anne McGill Burford for example made at least two trips to Midland Mich in her 22 months as the head of the Environmental Protection Agency Rita M Lavelle the former head of the Government program to clean up toxic waste dumps met at least 14 times with Dow officials in the 11 months she held office Mrs Burford Miss Lavelle and 11 other political appointees recently resigned or were dismissed amid Congressional inquiries on allegations that the agencys toxic waste program had been mishandled According to the public testimony of some officials of the agency Dow used its connections with the top echelon of the agencys Washington officials to get its way on several important matters relating to the regulation of dioxin Three weeks ago for example agency officials in Chicago told the Investigations Subcommittee of the House Committee on Energy and Commerce that their superiors in Washington ordered them to change an important report on dioxin to comply with the wishes of Dow The key deletion from the report was the following central conclusion about Dows Midland plant Dows discharge represented the major source if not the only source of TCDD contamination found in the Tittabawassse and Saginaw Rivers and Saginaw Bay in Michigan

FULL SENATE GETS ABORTION MEASURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/20/us/full-senate-gets-abortion-measure.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee today sent a constitutional amendment to the floor that would reverse the 1973 Supreme Court decision legalizing abortion The vote was 9 to 9 which means that the committee acted without a positive endorsement The committees vote reflected the obstacles facing the proposed amendment Two senators who have generally supported such antiabortion measures Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware and Alan K Simpson Republican of Wyoming switched sides and opposed the amendment Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who proposed the amendment acknowleged in an interview The odds are heavily against us But Senator Hatch noted the Senate leadership had promised to hold a fullscale debate on the proposed amendment this spring Debate is Important Thing The important thing is the debate Mr Hatch said Sometimes it takes years to get a constitutional amendment through Lobbyists who advocate the right to choose an abortion said they were pleased by the tie vote and they expressed optimism about blocking the measure on the Senate floor A twothirds vote is needed in each house of Congress to send a change in the Constitution to the states and Joanne Howes legislative representative of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said There arent the votes out there to pass it We know it and they know it The Hatch amendment cosponsored by Senator Thomas F Eagleton Democrat of Missouri says A right to abortion is not secured by the Constitution Last year a similar amendment came out of the Judiciary Committee but it specifically gave states the right to restrict abortions That language was dropped this year The Hatch amendment never came to a vote last year It was withdrawn after the Senate killed an attempt by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina to overturn the Supreme Court through statute For withdrawing his amendment Senator Hatch won a promise for a debate this year Now even many antiabortion lawmakers no longer believe that supporting the right to choice will cost them votes back home Senator John P East a North Carolina Republican who is a strong foe of abortion remarked North Carolina is not unlike the nation at large Were polarized on this issue It cuts both ways He added that the foes of abortion had undermined their own cause by fighting among themselves Some groups for instance do not like the Hatch amendment because it does not declare that a fetus has the right of personhood Others say an amendment is futile because it cannot command a twothirds vote and they prefer a statutory approach
SCHOOLS VARY IN SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/nyregion/schools-vary-in-sex-education.html,OUR 11thgrade students can watch a film of a naked woman giving birth and later have an open discussion about it in a coed classroom without any giggling or tittering said Dr Norman Schwartz assistant superintendent of secondary education for Syosset public schools Kids can discuss topics that would make some of their parents blush The more educated we get about sex the less prurient is our interest in it The Syosset School District has a sex education program that is among the most comprehensive of any in the Islands 129 school districts Since the New York State Department of Health Education does not mandate that sex education be included in the health curriculum each district has the authority to determine if a sex education program should be mandatory and how extensive the program should be Consequently some school districts have no sex education program or a limited program for secondarylevel students while others have developed comprehensive programs that include detailed discussions illustrated by slides or films about birth control pregnancy and abortion An increasing number of districts are beginning sex education programs for elementary and middle school students as well as high school students While some school boards and administrators are still struggling for parental approval of initiating elementary school instruction in sex education the Syosset district has made considerable gains in acceptance Currently for example it has received few parental complaints about its program which began 13 years ago amid controversy According to Wilson Gearhart assistant superintendent for elementary education for Syosset schools about 50 elementary students out of 2400 were exempt from sex education by parental request when the program began 13 years ago today only one child out of 1800 is exempt Drugs alcohol and tobacco must be covered in health education courses but the rest of the content is up to the individual school district said Carol Fairley associate in health education at the New York State Education Department Health education is supposed to provide students with all the facts on issues discussed to help them make their own intelligent decisions What facts are presented is left to the school districts discretion The reluctance of some parents to deal with sex education in the home and the increase in teenage pregnancies in Nassau and Suffolk Counties indicate the extent of the need for sex education in schools according to health educators interviewed Parents are asking for more support and more programs in sex education said Rose Brown executive director of Nassau County Planned Parenthood According to Planned Parenthood statistics in 1981 in Nassau there were 3194 adolescent pregnancies resulting in 706 live births 15 fetal deaths and 2473 abortions In Suffolk in the same period there were 3890 adolescent pregnancies resulting in 1292 live births 105 fetal deaths and 2493 abortions From 1971 to 1981 Nassau and Suffolk had the highest increase in teenage pregnancies in the state According to 1978 statistics from the Alan Guttmacher Institute 35 percent of girls aged 13 to 19 are sexually active and 54 percent of boys 13 to 21 are sexually active Although many school districts are responding to their communities need for sex education in the schools some school administrators were reluctant to discuss what their districts sexeducation programs covered Dr Charles W Rudiger Superintendent of Huntington schools said that sex education was too delicate an issue for a telephone interview The sex education programs in the Islands school districts range from open programs in which speakers from a wide variety of public and private agencies are allowed presentations in classrooms to selfcontained programs in which no outside speaker or film is allowed The Syosset district for instance has allowed in representatives from Planned Parenthood and Birthright a private nonsectarian antiabortion group financed mainly by individual donations but also by such Roman Catholic groups as the Knights of Columbus Speakers have included Bill Baird an abortion counselor who is also director of the Parents Aid Society Views of many other people and groups have been presented to secondary school students as part of the health education curriculum The more open your program is the more danger there is of making mistakes said Dr Schwartz the Syosset administrator But wed rather make mistakes than deal with a closed program Parents in both the Middle Island and ShorehamWading River districts have recently objected to a talk and slide presentation about the dangers of abortion given by Birthright The graphic slides of fetal development and types of abortions were shown to 11th and 12th graders Administrators from both school districts said they were striving for a balance of varying points of view in the school setting and antiabortion views while presented were not endorsed by the school  We offer students information and let them make their own decisions said Don Webster director of health physical education and athletics for the Middle Island district He acknowledged however that he did not have a representative of Planned Parenthood or any group opposing the antiabortion viewpoint speak to students after the Birthright presentation I dont feel obligated to bring in organizations with contrasting viewpoints as long as different views are discussed in class he added Joseph Ferreira health educator at the ShorehamWading River High School said the Birthright presentation was one of many shown to junior and senior students as part of the districts secondary sexeducation program The district has also had speakers from Planned Parenthood the Suffolk Health Department and a naturalchildbirth group among others address students as part of the health education curriculum I never take sides with the speakers Mr Ferreira said Its up to the students to make their own decisions Seth Rockmuller a lawyer for the State Education Department that teachers in the state were not allowed to advocate a particular point of view in a classroom but simply to inform students There is a difference between saying This is the way to believe and This is the way we view the issue  he said When the abortion issue is studied people cant try to sell their position unless there is a public forum and both sides of the issue are presented In the last year Birthright has given presentations at 15 public schools on the Island and Planned Parenthood has had representatives speak at about 60 districts Mr Baird said he had spoken at a few districts on the Island but added Its almost impossible for me to get on a high school campus here On Long Island Ive been banned in some schools Mr Baird who considers his organization the opposite of Birthright also differs with Planned Parenthood whose representatives view parents as childrens prime sex educators Teenagers he said dont need their parents permission to have an abortion or to have intercourse He added Birthright doesnt tell students that abortions are nine times safer than childbirth according to the American Medical Association Speakers such as Mr Baird are banned from the Islands 103 Roman Catholic schools although Birthright speakers are allowed presentations at many parish schools that choose to provide instruction in sex education Msgr Francis Maniscalco director of the Office of Family Ministry of the Roman Catholic Diocese of Rockville Centre said about 40 parishes on the Island have had their teachers trained by the diocese to prepare students to understand the Catholic view of family life Only church documents are used in the preparation Monsignor Maniscalco said any group or individual that did not present the Catholic point of view was not allowed to speak in familyeducation classes in parish schools He added that parents had to give permission for students to take sex education classes in the Islands Catholic schools Public school administrators and health educators interviewed said that all outside speakers invited to provide information in sex education classes were carefully screened Also if any students felt the material presented by an outside speaker was offensive they had the right to leave the classroom without incurring disciplinary measures the educators said Lorraine Sorg district coordinator for health education in the William Floyd School District said she met regularly with parents community religious leaders and the ShirleyMastic Action Coalition to discuss the sex education program in the district The community has a right to object to the program or to debate about it she said Teachers dont want to send kids home with a sexual perspective their parents cant handle Mrs Sorg said that the Floyd districts sex education program focused on feelings as well as biological facts in coeducational classes We talk about decisionmaking in class and we view sexuality as it is interwoven into everyday living she said Its a holistic approach taking emotions into account as well as the body When outside speakers are invited to speak in the Floyd district program parents are notified No matter what viewpoint you take there will be objections Mrs Sorg said But we have to continue with our program We have no choice Each school district is responsible for its outofwedlock mothers In the PatchogueMedford district sex education is a component of the curriculum in the seventh and 10th grades Topics such as anatomy reproduction and conception are introduced to seventh graders and 10th graders discuss such subjects as birth control venereal disease and abortion according to the districts spokesman Hugh MacLeod The sexeducation program is optional and requires parental permission No private groups are invited to speak to students in the districts program The Port Washington district offers a kindergartenthrough12thgrade approach to sex education that focuses on responsibility and decisionmaking said Dr Ed Berkowitz assistant superintendent of instruction in the district The program begun in 1971 is taught by nurseteachers and certified health instructors Parents can opt that a child not participate All outside speakers are carefully screened by the administration We make every effort to maintain a balanced reasonable position Dr Berkowitz said The Lindenhurst district began its sex education program for secondary students last year According to Lee McLaughlin district coordinator of health and physical education 93 percent of students received parental permission to attend the classes the first semester they were given For the second semester such permissions dropped one percentage point Mr McLaughlin said the sex education program in Lindenhurst schools was selfcontained No outside speakers are invited Contraception is the most controversial issue discussed in the program Mr McLaughlin said and students who do not have parental permission to attend the discussions are given alternative assignments With the high percentage of single parents today Mr McLaughlin said schools must provide the education that is lacking in some homes
MR. SIKORSKI GOES TO WASHINGTON,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/24/magazine/mr-sikorski-goes-to-washington.html,STILLWATER Minn is an old lumber town on the St Croix River In the last century when the white pine still stood high on the hills and when settlers traveled to the Middle West by steamboat and stagecoach some enterprising pioneers built a sawmill there Later when the railroads inched west and when millions of logs were being sorted every year at the boom site just beyond town a modest downtown started to grow and there sprouted a brewery an opera house and a series of mansions The logging ended decades ago but Stillwater endures a small town with a hardware store a drug store a grocery store and an elegant old hotel The butcher knows the name of just about everyone in town The meters charge a dime for two hours parking Gerry Sikorski doesnt live there anymore He has left the farmhouse on the hill his horses the deer that used to nose up to his stoop and the great horned owl that he used to hear in the night He has packed up and moved away to Washington He has bought a city rowhouse and a tuxedo He has an unlisted telephone number And when he visited the White House early this year he entered through the front door This winter when there was ice on the St Croix freshman Congressman Gerry Sikorski went back to Minnesota He drove down Route 36 the highway leading from St Paul to Stillwater a road he has taken hundreds of times He drove it when he worked in a law office and he drove it when he served in the State Senate Over the years he has seen houses spring up and trees grow from seedlings to robust sentinels He has watched one of the farms along the road change watched the number of cows increase and decline This time however everything seemed different This time said Sikorski who turns 35 on Tuesday I felt sort of morose Its like the two paths in the woods Ive taken a path but I havent gone so far that I still dont see the other path I hope I dont lose that path Across the country last fall 80 men and women began the complex process that would transform them into members of Congress Nearly threequarters of them were Democrats and many of them like Sikorski were lawyers had served in state legislatures and had borrowed heavily to run for Congress They had based their campaigns on opposition to Reaganomics support of efforts to freeze the level of nuclear weapons and reassurances that Social Security which has 36 million beneficiaries would be restored to financial health They had moreover come to office with what Jonathan Moore director of the Institute of Politics at Harvard Universitys Kennedy School of Government called a skepticism of clearcut solutions Days after the voters of Minnesotas 6th Congressional District decided to send him to Congress Gerry Sikorski was still campaigning For months he had driven from suburb to suburb from farm to farm across highways and down gravel roads His campaign had been a page torn from an American scrapbook greetings and speeches and parades and kisses and now that it was over now that he had won and was going to Washington he almost could not stop He got in the car and drove 60 miles through the November chill to Monticello for the annual Wright County Democratic Farmer Labor dinner He was among the first to arrive and was one of the few men there it was deer season and most of the men were hunting It was cold inside the restaurant and the barmaid who handed out drinks with embossed cocktail napkins left over from somebodys wedding wore a heavy cable sweater and skimpy black hotpants Sikorski gave a short speech telling the group how grateful he was for their support telling them of the challenges that were ahead telling them how much it all meant to him The response was tumultuous For us a Congressman is a big thing Mary Bray a county worker said as the cheering faded Were far away from Washington Most of us have never been there Hes our only direct line there I think he knows that Susan Erkel Sikorski was at home The house smelled of cloves and she sat in the kitchen going through the mail There was a letter from Dan Rostenkowski the Illinois Democrat who heads the powerful House Ways and Means Committee inviting her husbands opinions on the Social Security financing crisis There was a letter from Senator Edward M Kennedy the Massachusetts Democrat pledging that we shall stay our course together There was a letter advertising a gardenapartment complex in suburban Virginia And less than a week after the election there already were job requests scores of them opening with entreaties like this I am an energetic young Democratic attorney with a variety of skills that can contribute to the success of your first team For the Sikorskis life was almost overwhelming the speeches the mail the good wishes the phone calls the endless plans In the confusion Sikorski lost his pay check his 20monthold daughter screamed almost continuously and his wife a PhD in home economics worried about whether she could find a job in Washington and whether it made sense to take their dogs and cats along They were excited they were exhausted but most of all they were scared One afternoon Sikorski who is lean and cleancut in the oldfashioned way was working in jeans and a down vest in his campaign headquarters in a Minneapolis suburb He kicked away the large plastic 7Up bottle that held his office door open and there amid the piles of letters and files and phone messages he took a deep breath He talked about Minnesotas Red River Valley where he grew up and he talked about his parents about how his father had been a railroad laborer and parttime bartender and how his mother had waited on tables had taken in laundry and worked at a turkeyprocessing plant Then came one of those moments rare in the life of a politician when he confronted out loud what really troubled him More and more he said almost in a whisper I worry about what this means for my family In the early years of this century before airconditioning and before the United States was a world power Congressional sessions lasted only a few months Members of Congress would travel to Washington stay in boarding houses visit the bawdy houses and go home to their families before the heat and the oppressive humidity of the summer months set in Today Congress meets virtually all year round and more and more of its members maintain homes in the Washington area From the start the Sikorskis had decided that they too would move to Washington Gerry Sikorski knew about the latenight sessions the dinner meetings and the rounds of Capitol receptions His wife had multiple sclerosis suffering occasional and sometimes persistent bouts of numbness in her hands legs and feet Their daughter was growing up quickly He decided that he would try to put his family first I draw lines he said that first week after the election Im not going to a bunch of receptions and talk about the weather and the Minnesota Vikings all night Id rather be at home talking to my wife and my daughter Thats my choice Im not going to get fat become an alcoholic and lose my family Im not going to do that Later that week he took a walk on Fairy Falls Hill near his home Long ago before the white men came to Minnesota the Sioux and Chippewa regarded that land as a sacred plot of earth where the spirits talked to them That morning Sikorski walked in the snow across the old logging road into the woods and as he walked he thought of the river and the fields and he remembered how when dusk deepened into night he could see the lights of Wisconsin beyond the St Croix I get sort of sad he said when I think that we have to leave here Two weeks after the election the Sikorskis arrived in Washington and a campaign of a different sort began Like many other freshmen Sikorski sought out Congressional leaders in the tuckedaway power centers where committee assignments are made Sikorski wanted a position on the Energy and Commerce Committee which puts its imprimatur on about half the legislation that passes through the House He sought and won the support of Representative Martin Olav Sabo of Minneapolis a member of the Democratic Steering and Policy Committee which plays a major role in the committee assignment process He then pressed his case in person before virtually every member of the steering committee leaving a resume with each of them and spent hours on the telephone trying to corral support from members of the energy committee itself He found that his Polish heritage could be an advantage dropping a few Polish words into conversations with Representative John D Dingell the Michigan Democrat who heads the energy committee and Representative Rostenkowski The Polish connection doesnt hurt he later said Meanwhile Susan Sikorski was scouring the realestate listings They decided that they wanted to live on Capitol Hill where modest town houses routinely cost more than 100000 After days of searching they finally found a threebedroom home with a basement and a garage only a few minutes walk from the Capitol He was discovering that his Congressional pay of 69800 would not go far in Washington It will be macaroniandcheese dinners for several years Sikorski said the night they signed the house contract Sikorski had always maintained a fast pace Before the election in fact the St Paul Pioneer Press said that he campaigned as if he were trying to run a threeminute mile Now he was back in that mode He dashed from one interview to another fielding telephone calls along the way yet somehow also managing to follow the rigorous orientation program laid on for new Democratic members of Congress As freshman Republicans followed their own schedule Sikorski and his fellow Democrats pursued a regimen of seminars receptions luncheons and even a session devoted to teaching them how to get reelected There was a brunch with former Vice President Walter F Mondale a prayer breakfast a reception sponsored by AnheuserBusch and a lecture entitled Customs Decorum and Unwritten Rules of the House The Sikorskis moved through the orientation period like timid college freshmen following the schedule faithfully Early in December they went to a session held by the Democratic Study Group a research organization for House members and listened to a speech given by retiring Representative Bill Brodhead of Michigan The hours are long and there will be embassy parties and dinners to go to Brodhead warned You can get caught up in the whole syndrome The divorce rate is higher than it should be Then he added It doesnt have to be that way You dont have to do all that If you just do your job you wont have to go out to dinner The room was quiet When it came time for the session on Congressional procedures the class was led through the cavernous hallways of the Capitol to the House floor Sikorski pulled a piece of paper from his pocket and wrote a note to himself Theres an incredible sense of pride and wonder on walking on the floor Some sitting Congressmen told us that the sensation never leaves you It was a special moment the crossing of the shadowy line between a mans most cherished dreams and his realization that they were coming true Sikorski was like many youngsters in his hometown near the North Dakota border born and bred a Democrat When he was young and his parents had no money to contribute to the Democrat Farmer Labor Party they contributed the labor of their five children instead He made his first political poster a sign for the StevensonKefauver ticket when he was 8 Sikorski was a college student during the Vietnam years and quickly became swept up in the antiwar movement He was a street demonstrator at the Democratic National Convention in Chicago in 1968 but soon became deeply involved in local and state politics working for such causes as the effort to lower the voting age Now as then Sikorski found himself left of center politically in Congress he has spoken out for the nuclear freeze and against cuts in social programs such as school lunches and aid to education However as a devout Catholic he strenuously opposes abortion Sikorski has an aggressive streak Once running a campaign for former Representative Richard Nolan Democrat of Minnesota his zeal led him to tear down a lawn sign boosting Nolans opponent Sikorski himself made an unsuccessful try for Congress in 1978 Early in the orientation period Sikorski announced his candidacy to be the freshman Democrats whip helping Democratic leaders maintain party discipline He sent letters and resumes to the other new legislators and distributed orientation schedules complete with pictures of the members of the Steering and Policy Committee He even called some freshmen at their homes during Christmas week Yet the orientation could be disspiriting at times The speakers droned on often repeating themselves or each other and before long even the anecdotes grew wearisome Susan Sikorski went to a seminar New Perspectives for Political Spouses sponsored by a group of Congressional wives and Georgetown University and sat restlessly as the speakers talked about the Constitution explained how a bill became law and touched on the rudiments of life in Washington In the audience eyes rolled and groans were heard Im not an airhead said one Congressional wife sotto voce Im not sitting through this Susan Sikorski later described parts of the session as a ninthgrade civics lecture By the end of the formal orientation period the Sikorskis had come to feel as if they were being suffocated as if they were losing control over their own lives Always always there were things to do appointments to keep Weariness had settled in On Dec 9 Susan Sikorski flew home to Minnesota while her husband and some of the other freshmen legislators took a military plane to Massachusetts for yet another series of seminars at Harvard Universitys John F Kennedy School of Government As each lecture ended the legislators rushed for a bank of telephones and when they made their connections they spoke quickly almost breathlessly The clock was running and the next seminar on agriculture policy or arms control was only minutes away They had so little time Many of them stayed up late in the Sheraton Commander Hotel washing laundry in their sinks in the small hours of the morning Talk about people making important decisions Sikorski said after lunch one day I havent been able to make a decision since we started orientation Im tired of people telling me where to sit and what to eat What I want is a little more free time fewer speeches and a cheeseburger There was little relief when he returned to Minnesota shortly before Christmas Everybody is trying to nip at my time he said Everyone wants you to have breakfast everyone wants you to be at their meeting everybody wants you at their Christmas party The bittersweet is a native Minnesota berry and this was a peculiarly bittersweet time for the Sikorskis They and their daughter Anne trudged out to the woods behind the house and chose a red cedar Sikorski chopped it down and dragged it home They decided to save money and forgo presents exchanging ornaments instead At years end Sikorski paused a moment to reflect People dont understand all the pressures Youre trying to get on the committees youre trying to start relationships with other members of Congress you want to hire people you want to stay in touch with the people at home And youre tired With the opening day of Congress Jan 3 a fresh atmosphere descended on the Capitol It was a scene of mink coats microphones and Minoltas The nineman Ortiz Mariachi Band from Kingsville Tex played on the Capitol steps small groups of television reporters conducted interviews on the triangle of grass near the House office buildings and families took scores of snapshots Sikorski found a seat in the first row of the House chamber for the swearingin ceremony Anne sat on the carpet in front of him chewing gum When she started screaming for her mother during Opening Prayer Sikorski put his hand over her mouth The House was now his home Then the voice of Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr was heard in the chamber and the members of the House raised their right hands and swore to defend the Constitution of the United States You are members of this legislature ONeill said and Representative Gerry Sikorski Democrat of Minnesota kissed his baby girl Minutes later his entourage  his wife his parents his sister his motherinlaw some friends  was on its way to a reception in the Rayburn House Office Building How do you get to the subway Sikorski asked a Capitol guard They followed the guards instructions rode the underground cars to the Rayburn Building and finally came upon a group of elevators Sikorski pushed the up button and a door opened under the sign Members Only He took a step forward and started to enter the elevator but then hesitated he had after all only been a member for a few minutes He waited for the public elevator For freshman legislators nothing is more important than assembling a loyal efficient staff Sikorski delegated that job to Dennis M McGrann 32 years of age a close friend who had been a personnel manager for the Minnesotabased Control Data Corporation McGrann had been feeling his own pressures He was completing requirements for his Masters of Business Administration his wife was expecting their second child and he was a stranger in Washington Like other freshmen Sikorski was assigned a temporary office in House Annex No 2 one of the depressing boxlike stone Government buildings scattered like breadcrumbs a few blocks off the handsome wide boulevards of the capital The day after the swearingin ceremony some staff members were sitting in a small circle open boxes behind them 200 letters already awaiting answers Ione Yates Sikorskis executive assistant and a veteran Congressional aide was typing up the letters that would give the staff entree to the House Office Supply Service When she finished she took a blue felt pen and signed Gerry Sikorski Then she led the staff in a quick survey We need stationery she said the kind that says Congress of the United States  We need letter openers added Tom Meskan the 26yearold legislative assistant Staples and staplers chimed in Lynn Drake the press secretary Just buy one stapler said Ione Yates I have one at home I can bring in Stamps Lynn Drake said We need stamps There was an embarrassed silence Tom Meskan who had worked with her throughout the campaign finally broke it We he said dont need stamps anymore Meanwhile the Congress itself was getting down to business House Majority Leader Jim Wright of Texas called Sikorskis home with the good news that the Minnesotan had been chosen as one of the six freshmen on the Energy and Commerce Committee And the next day brought Sikorski another triumph  he was elected freshman whip by a substantial margin He seemed to emerge pretty quickly as the person who was going to be the preeminent spokesman for the freshman class said Representative Dennis Eckart the Ohio Democrat who preceded Sikorski as freshman whip This is going to be a big edge for his career Later that week the new members of Congress were invited to the White House for dinner Susan Sikorski had gone to the G Street Remnant Shop purchased material and sewn her own dress Her husband struggled with his new formal wear Victor Kamber a Washington political consultant finally took pity on his friend and saw to it that the bow tie was straight and the cummerbund on properly It was like sending your kids out to the prom said Kamber As legions of management consultants have been saying for years Congress is not the most efficiently run enterprise in the nation and the Sikorski staff was just discovering the dimensions of that inefficiency By Jan 10 they were settled in their permanent headquarters in the Cannon House Office Building a magisterial whitestone structure a few steps from the Capitol However their duplicating machine was broken their longdistance telephone line had not been connected and the facsimile machine did not work Meanwhile banks and financial institutions across the nation were encouraging one of the largest mail campaigns in history and the effects were being felt in Congressional offices The banks wanted Congress to repeal a provision of the tax law passed last August that would force financial institutions to withhold 10 percent of their customers interest income from savings and investments In a matter of days 1000 letters on the issue had come into Sikorskis office virtually paralyzing it We have an answer prepared said McGrann But were not even geared up mechanically to get the answers out Our typewriters dont even work Sikorski favors the repeal After less than a week in session Congress took its customary January recess At months end Sikorski came back to the capital feeling invigorated and plunged into the basic work of Congress  meetings Before long he was sitting down with lobbyists from groups favoring the arts working for help for Soviet Jews seeking assistance for environmental causes and looking for support for a proposed coal slurry pipeline There also were the sessions with constituent groups including Minnesota delegations to the League of Cities convention and to police and firefighting conventions And gradually as a routine developed Sikorski began to feel more at ease with himself and more at ease with life in Congress Sikorski had been a leader in the Minnesota Senate in seeking the enactment of childprotection measures and in efforts to assist the victims of family violence Early in February he set out to win a place on the Select Committee on Children Youth and Families He went to the Speakers Office where many such decisions are made and was urged to give a short speech on the floor to demonstrate his knowledge of the subject On the day of the speech his first before Congress Sikorski was sitting by himself in a corner of the cafeteria in the Longworth House Office Building There surrounded by soiled trays empty potatochip bags and milk cartons he nervously went over his prepared text It was going to be a hectic day he said He had to be in two places at the same time on the floor awaiting his turn to speak and in the chambers of the Energy and Commerce Committee where a critical vote had been scheduled Soon Sikorski would grow accustomed to the tug of the floor In a month in fact he would be able to go to the House gymnasium lift weights shower and still be able to reach the floor for the crucial votes on the Social Security bill But in February his first speech in hand he made three frantic round trips between the floor and the committee chambers in the Rayburn House Office Building There were only two dozen Congressmen on the floor a small group of students in the visitors gallery and a handful of reporters lingering in the press gallery when Sikorski finally approached the lectern As he stood there he told himself Stop Take a breath Take your time But like so many freshman Congressmen before him he couldnt He talked about drug and child abuse family violence and divorce on Minnesota Indian reservations in California barrios and in West Virginia hollows and he raced through it all in only 40 seconds The maiden speech of Congressman Sikorski occupied two and threequarter inches of type in the Congressional Record In the council chamber of the Stillwater Municipal Building one of the cinderblock legacies of the largess of the Great Society days there sat several dozen people in heavy boots lumbermens jackets and dungarees It was a wintry Saturday afternoon and Congressman Sikorski was standing at the front of the room Congress he was saying is a noble and old institution It was the fourth town meeting Sikorski had held in two days but the cold air of Minnesota seemed to stir him and he plunged into a monologue with vigor He quoted John Kennedy Mark Twain and Red Skelton he talked about some of the nuances of general revenue sharing he touched on local landfill issues But it was Congress that he really wanted to talk about and it was some of the backroom mysteries of the Capitol that his audience wanted to hear There are a lot of egos in Washington big heads he said the laughs starting to gather in the audience I know that comes as a surprise Later that afternoon Sikorski held court just down the hall greeting a stream of constituents who wanted to share their opinions and just as often to share their problems At one point he was confronted by 18 postal workers angered by the prospect that new Federal workers would be forced under the Social Security umbrella They stood in their woolen shirts and their windbreakers arms folded every one as Sikorski preached to a congregation that refused to be converted They were afraid that without the pension contributions of new postal workers their own benefits would be endangered When our retirement system starts going down the tubes one asked testily is the Government going to kick in some money I think we have to Sikorski answered I dont think theres any option The questions continued for several minutes before Rex P Johnson general president of the St Paul area local of the American Postal Workers Union made his demand Wed like a No vote on a bill if it includes us in Social Security Sikorski did not hesitate You wont get it he said I wont vote no Youve got to accept that The meeting began to break up Thank you said Paul Ryberg qualitycontrol specialist with the St Paul Post Office Thank you Johnson asked mockingly Yes thank you Ryberg said turning to Sikorski He could have hid like the rest of them in his office in Washington All that week Sikorski drove across his district attending a nuclearfreeze meeting addressing the Anoka County Chamber of Commerce visiting a senior citizens dance dropping by a political fundraiser even taking a few minutes on a Saturday night to dip into a testimonial for a leading member of the Spring Lake Park Veterans of Foreign War But during that trip back to his district a journey to where he had come from he also found time to reflect on where he was going Things have in truth turned out quite well for him His wife landed a parttime job with the National Governors Association in Washington He was earning his spurs as the Democrats freshman whip The Democratic leadership for example dearly wanted Congress to reject President Reagans budget and adopt in its stead one fashioned by the Democrats themselves It was a major test of the Presidents influence in Congress and the Democrats sought to exploit the opportunity to embarrass the Administration Sikorski drew up a checklist of freshman Democrats and met with them individually and in groups in the halls of the Capitol in cloak rooms and in committee chambers and then when the actual floor vote neared he telephoned them or called upon them in their offices In the end he won the votes of all but six of the 56 Democratic freshmen an accomplishment that earned him the praise of Representative Thomas S Foley of Washington the Democratic Whip Its not until you start seeing peoples problems and trying to do something about them that you actually know what its like being a Congressman Sikorski says I didnt know what it would be like And the thing is I do like it I like it more than anything else Ive ever done During that February visit to Minnesota Sikorski was asked by the Rev Bernard Reiser pastor of the Church of the Epiphany of Coon Rapids to be a lector at one of the churchs Sunday masses At the proper time Sikorski went to the altar picked up the Scriptures and did his two readings But for most of the mass he sat in the front pew a pensive look on his face How often do we sell our soul for power and fame Father Reiser asked in his homily Lent is a time to look at our choices What are our priorities What are our principles Sikorski listened to the prayers and readings from the liturgy He listened to the choir He listened to Father Reisers questions and he listened to his own thoughts
"BETTY FRIEDAN DEFIES BRITONS, WINS DEBATE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/25/style/betty-friedan-defies-britons-wins-debate.html,Betty Friedan was as she said later irritated She had endured the first gibes and sexist jokes in a sporting way smiling pleasantly The young British speakers in evening clothes and patent leather shoes at the Cambridge Union Society seemed to be testing the American feminist leader for a sense of humor But as the onslaught continued and each speaker who preceded her lampooned the feminist movement and painted rude oral cartoons of what they saw as manly activist women her smile gave way to a frown By the time it was her turn to address the Cambridge University audience as the seventh speaker in a formal debate Friday night on the benefits men have derived from the womens liberation movement Betty Friedan was angry I came here to Cambridge accepting your invitation to speak at this male bastion and confront this serious social issue she told the debating society her voice husky and her dark eyes flashing I cant tell you how more than irritated I was to hear it treated as a joke It is not a joke Freedom for Men and Women Then in the ensuing 20 minutes Betty Friedan who had traveled 4000 miles for the debate proceeded to win her argument although she left the hall thinking she had lost because a clerical error had reversed the vote tally She had to wait for word of her victory until today She gave her British audience a passionate lecture Feminism she said had not only freed women from old roles and culturally imposed limits but had created a revolution that had also liberated men and contained the seeds for improving life for all humanity Prowling the speakers well pounding a small fist on the table or into her palm she took the role of a teacher imploring the privileged to open their eyes and remove the foppish mask as she put it of derision When she took her seat on the black leather speakers bench in the historic hall the students gave her an enthusiastic though somewhat chastened round of applause Her grit appeared to have won many hearts and minds The proposition that she had defended was This house believes that feminism is good for men Afterward the members of the union which is open to all undergraduates at Cambridge voted to approve the proposition 123 to 56 with 43 abstentions But because of the clerical error that transposed the vote Friday evening it was first announced that the proposition had failed That error was not discovered and corrected until today About half of the audience were women Women were first admitted for degrees at Cambridge only after World War II and about 40 percent of the students now are women Melanie McDonagh the fifth woman to be president of the society led last nights debate I had never run into anything like this on an American campus Mrs Friedan said later at a small reception with British and American students Dont worry said one of the young women there These men just like to get sloshed and argue their prejudices Another guest suggested that it was just the way he thought the British did things classifying everything by sex class age or institutional affiliation Mrs Friedan shook her head slowly as if still numb You would never hear this in an American university she said I didnt realize just how conservative some of the students here were She said she had been forewarned of the whimsy that British debating societies occasionally impose on serious subjects But she said she had not expected the debate to wallow so much in what she regarded as selfindulgent ripostes instead of rapier wit Foppish Humor At the conclusion of her talk in which she challenged the men in the audience not to continue hiding their feelings behind masks of foppish humor one of her opponents in the debate said Madam I insist on my right to be frivolous You will find that when Im at my most foppish Im expressing my true feelings The speaker Peter Bazalgette went on to characterize feminists as those who look upon men as nothing more than a set of marauding genitals He called Mrs Friedan one of the sad women who are running away from their radicalism of the 60s and whose views today are disowned by more militant feminists in America Why should we listen to her he asked scornfully Mr Bazalgette a recent Cambridge graduate who is now a producer with the British Broadcasting Company was interrupted briefly by a male student who was moved to defend the American guest Surely he called out you are being unreasonable But the 62yearold Mrs Friedan needed no defenders as Mr Bazalgette discovered in his next breath When he looked across to her through halfclosed eyes and began to define for her what a feminist was she jumped to her feet For the last 20 years since the publication of her benchmark work The Feminine Mystique she has been recognized not just as a leader of American feminism but as one of the movements premier theoreticians She made Mr Bazalgette surrender the dais You cannot tell me what a feminist is declared Mrs Friedan a founder of the National Organization for Women Leveling her gaze at Mr Bazalgette she said that women are able to be different now because of hardwon victories and that feminists have earned the right to express different views while defining themselves But it is not for you she said to tell any woman what a feminist is You can call yourself a dinosaur but dont tell me what a feminist is She sat down again folding her arms tightly as members applauded This clash came after Mrs Friedan had already expressed her distress at hearing men in the debate call feminists manhaters who sought the abolition of sexual distinctions and who were responsible for undermining Christian family values Even the speakers who had preceded her in support of the proposition seemed to have no heart for it One Mary Kenney a British journalist said men had benefited from the womens movement because abortion and contraception now freed them from the consequences of sexual license Mrs Friedan later called Miss Kenny a traitor to feminism who had twisted the effects of abortion on womens lives She said that the availability of abortion in the United States had reduced maternal mortality caused by illegal abortions in the past But at the heart of her argument was her conviction that American men seeing the gains made by women are insisting on a new reality for themselves That reality she asserted is one that allows men to be truer to their nature and to abandon their need for dominance and control which she said suppresses their innermost feelings and shortens their lives It enables men to be themselves she said her hands clasped in front of her I listened to some of this  eh if you pardon the insult  foppish humor tonight and I thought My God maybe British men have to deny their feelings and have a worse time of it then American men do Dominance she continued It must make every man so defeated so sad to have to put on the iron mask or the foppish mask But there is new life for men ladies and gentlemen It is good for men and it is good for all humanity
CHINA'S VITAL BIRTH-CONTROL EFFORT DOES NOT INCLUDE INFANTICIDE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/25/opinion/l-china-s-vital-birth-control-effort-does-not-include-infanticide-118407.html,To the Editor I do not dispute the two Chinese students who write that there is infanticide in China OpEd April 11  an unfortunate but longknown fact which only recently has attracted the attention of the American news media I would only point out that instances of coercion in Chinas family planning cannot be discussed in the abstract but must be seen from the perspective of a population of over one billion that increases each year by some 12 to 13 million What China faces in coping with such basic requirements as housing education transportation sanitation water resources and so on would overwhelm a rich advanced nation Yet these needs relate only to quality of life The two critical problems that relate to national survival are food and employment It is true that although there were years of starvation and that imports had to supplement domestic grain production China has managed to feed her population But how long will it be able to surprise the doubters and continue to feed a billion people on 11 percent of the land that is arable As the population is growing some of Chinas most productive lands are being lost to urban development and erosion Between 1952 and 1977 the average cultivated land per farm worker decreased by 50 percent Is it any wonder the stipulation that the state shall encourage and enforce birth planning is written into the constitution of China Peking estimates that since 1966 the annual increment of the labor force has been 17 million and it anticipates that in each of the next 10 years about 20 million young people will be entering the job market  almost the total employed population of France These are frightening figures for a country with a weak economic base which knows that the bulk of the already disenchanted youths will somehow have to be absorbed by the countryside Infanticide barely touches on Chinas problems The two writers of the OpEd article admit that it is a reflection of ignorance poverty and the persistence of feudal attitudes toward women This is precisely where Peking places the blame insisting that the whole society should resolutely condemn the criminal activities of female infanticide and maltreatment of the mothers and the judicial departments should resolutely punish the offenders according to law The use of extreme political pressures in the familyplanning program may apply to abortions but not to infanticide which is the mindless if practical choice of the mother andor the family determined that their oldage security will not depend on a female child who will marry and disappear  just like spilled water It will take more time and the introduction of social insurance into the countryside to change the attitudes of Chinese peasants Until then short of abandoning the critical familyplanning program there is nothing that the Chinese Government can do to guarantee that with some 25 million pregnancies every year there will not be instances of infanticide It is also important for us to understand that the success or failure of Chinas populationcontrol program has global implications Only a secure China can be a peaceful China and it is not farfetched to suggest that Chinas stability depends not so much on how as on how well the familyplanning program will be implemented For our own sake if not for Chinas let us hope it will be successful LEO A ORLEANS Camp Springs Md April 13 1983
SCIENCE WATCH; Alcohol at Conception,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/26/science/science-watch-alcohol-at-conception.html,The risks of drinking alcoholic beverages during pregnancy are now well established and pregnant women have been duly warned about the possible harmful effects of alcohol on their unborn children Now there is experimental evidence that large amounts of alcohol consumed just after fertilization may cause genetic abnormalities that ultimately result in miscarriage early in pregnancy The studies done in Cambridge England by MH Kaufman an anatomist involved female mice that were given alcohol in amounts equivalent to what a woman might drink during a night of celebration The mice had recently been fertilized and were exposed to alcohol at the time the fertilized eggs would have been undergoing chromosomal rearrangements that ultimately produce an embryo While male fertilized eggs showed no abnormalities those that would have become females showed a large percentage of abnormal chromosome arrangements  either one chromosome too many or one too few Dr Kaufman urged caution in extrapolating his findings to people but he said his results draw attention to the potential danger to the conceptus of a single episode of heavy drinking by the mother at about the time of conception Citing two recent studies linking alcohol intake in early pregnancy to an increased risk of miscarriage he warned that any agent that can interfere with chromosomal divisions as alcohol did in his study should be considered a possible cause of spontaneous abortion
ABORTION BATTLE CATCHES DUBLIN LEADERS UNAWARE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/27/world/abortion-battle-catches-dublin-leaders-unaware.html,At a time when the new coalition Government of Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald of Ireland is making overtures to Unionists in Northern Ireland to discuss political reunification his leadership of the republic is being eroded by an emotional debate on abortion Abortion is already illegal in Ireland and no political movement exists to challenge this prohibition in a country where 95 percent of the population is Roman Catholic But prolife activists have succeeded in getting the two major political parties to press for a national referendum that could add an antiabortion amendment to the Constitution and critics contend reassert the Catholic nature of the state Moreover the abortion debate is so deeply emotional that Mr FitzGerald is losing support inside his coalition as the Government tries to cope with worsening economic and social conditions that require firm government policies Churchmen in Dispute How Mr FitzGerald has managed to get caught in the trap of the abortion issue at a time when the republic faces urgent and complex domestic problems is something that perplexes his supporters and delights his opponents He above all other political leaders in Ireland have been conciliatory in his approach to Protestants living in Northern Ireland who fear that political reunification of the island would mean a loss of their tradition The abortion debate has already led to a rare public dispute between the Catholic hierarchy and the churchmen representing the small Protestant minority in the republic Catholic bishops in Ireland recently made it clear that the wording of the antiabortion amendment hammered out by Mr FitzGeralds advisers was not as acceptable as the one put forward earlier by the Government of former Prime Minister Charles J Haughey who was defeated by Mr FitzGerald in a November election The Anglican Primate of Ireland Dr John Armstrong who also represents many of the Protestants living in Northern Ireland said the intervention by the bishops was an attempt to impose Catholic moral teachings on all the people of Ireland Parliamentary Vote Expected The Irish Parliament is expected to vote before the end of the month on the wording of the amendment favored by Mr FitzGeralds Government and if it is enacted to set plans for a national referendum on the matter But several members of Mr FitzGeralds Fine Gael Party have already angrily indicated that they cannot support his proposal and favor what they consider to be the tougher safeguards contained in the amendment of the opposition party Fianna Fail This in turn has led the Prime Minister to threaten the suspension of any party member who fails to support the party on this vote If he is defeated and the Fianna Fail amendment is accepted the Prime Minister said he would campaign against its approval by the public in a referendum a campaign that might further drain his administration of the support needed to address the nations serious economic decline The FitzGerald amendment is contained in one sentence Nothing in this Constitution shall be invoked to invalidate any provision of the law on the grounds that it prohibits abortion The Fianna Fail wording recognizes the right to life of the unborn in addition to other language that was opposed by mainstream Protestants The absurdity of it all is that its all so pointless commented a Government official as the debate raged this week Abortions are not performed in Ireland he said but an estimated 5000 Irishwomen a year travel to England where they can obtain free abortions on demand in public clinics The only real way to prevent abortions in Ireland is to forbid pregnant women to leave the country Tax Protests Continue Meanwhile in a month when unemployment went above 14 percent and inflation was hanging at more than 15 percent Mr FitzGerald was faced with other problems Scattered tax protests and work stoppages continued around the country after mass demonstrations by Irish workers who say that the Governments new austerity budget and higher rates of taxation have cut deeply into their income while sparing farmers and people who can hide income from tax collectors Government leaders discussed setting up community work programs for young criminals as the authorities acknowledged that the countrys soaring crime rate had reached the point where there were no longer enough prison cells to hold all the convicted offenders One Member of Parliament from Dublin said the crime reports from her district made her feel as if the major criminals were going out in tour buses into this area The Department of Justice reported an alarming rise in drug abuse and drugrelated crimes with an estimated 6000 heroin addicts in a nation of three million people where hard drugs were almost unheard of five years ago With a countdown under way for a fulldress meeting in Dublin of the Forum for a New Ireland called by Mr FitzGerald to discuss a blueprint for the reunification of Ireland Ulsters Protestants have harshly rejected his overtures and refused to participate Premier Expresses Determination In a recent interview the Prime Minister said he expected that progress on the initiative would be slow but he was determined to go ahead with it even if the Unionists did not participate at first What we are searching for is one or a number of models for progress in the relationship between North and South something that might provide a way forward he said At the same time it is necessary to reassure those in the Protestant community who have genuine fears that any new relationship would threaten their identity and their civil liberty His proposal made last month offered a forum that would include anyone from the constitutional parties in the North and South who rejected violence and were willing to discuss the future I came to the conclusion many years ago that we were not helping our cause by leaving completely vague what we meant by a united Ireland Mr FitzGerald continued The picture I think many Protestants in Northern Ireland have is that we are seeking a united Ireland in which they would be a permanent minority and in which laws would be enacted that would be contrary to their value system
AROUND THE WORLD; FitzGerald Loses Dublin Abortion Battle,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/28/world/around-the-world-fitzgerald-loses-dublin-abortion-battle.html,The fourmonthold Irish Government suffered its first parliamentary defeat today over a bill to put an existing legal ban on abortion into the Constitution The Governments wording of the bill was defeated by 22 votes A tougher version drafted by the opposition was carried overwhelmingly as the majority of Prime Minister Garret FitzGeralds Fine Gael Party abstained and a few voted for it Some members of the Labor Party junior members of the coalition voted against both versions on the ground that any amendment was unnecessary The defeat while it did not mean the fall of the Government was a major embarrassment for Mr FitzGerald who had branded the opposition wording ambiguous to the point where it could put the lives of women at risk
PLAN VOTED TO EASE BANKRUPTCY DEFECTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/04/28/business/plan-voted-to-ease-bankruptcy-defects.html,The Senate approved legislation today to create 229 new bankruptcy judgeships and to rectify constitutional defects in the bankruptcy system The legislation which passed on a voice vote would also create 85 new Federal district and appeals court judgeships and permit judges to determine if individuals were seeking to abuse the bankruptcy code Last summer the Supreme Court ruled that it was unconstitutional to assign bankruptcy cases grounded in state law to bankruptcy judges who did not have the life tenure and guarantees against salary reductions called for by Article III of the Constitution Although the 229 new judgeships that would be created by the legislation the Senate passed today would not receive those guarantees they would be regarded only as adjuncts of the United States district courts Federal district judges would be permitted to intercede in any case referred to the bankruptcy courts House Has Not Yet Acted Federal district judges moreover would be required to decide bankruptcy cases involving interstate commerce or other questions outside bankruptcy issues themselves The House has not acted on bankruptcy legislation yet but is contemplating a substantially different response to the Supreme Court ruling A bill approved by the House Judiciary Committee would establish 227 bankruptcy judges and give them two essential guarantees life tenure and exemption from salary reductions Since the Supreme Courts ruling in Northern Pipeline Construction Co v Marathon Pipe Line Co the nations bankruptcy courts have been in legal limbo The Court postponed the effective date of the decision twice once until early last October and again until late last December but Congress still failed to act The Supreme Court was unwilling to grant a further postponement so the bankruptcy courts have been operating under an interim rule proposed by the Judicial Conference of the United States the top policymaking body of the Federal courts and adopted in each district The rule has the effect of placing bankruptcy under the purview of the the Federal district courts while permiting the district judges to delegate much of their authority to the bankruptcy judges Credit Industry Victory A major provision of the Senates legislation the option for special judicial scrutiny of personal bankruptcy cases represents a victory for the credit industry which has argued that a 1978 bankruptcy law made personal bankruptcy excessively attractive Under the provisions of the Senate bill the bankruptcy judge would be permitted to dismiss a personal bankruptcy case if he believed that a settlement would constitute a substantial abuse of the bankruptcy code The bill also calls for courtappointed trustees to set out in an unbiased fashion the options available to individuals filing for personal bankruptcy The consumer credit industry had lobbied for legislation that would have required judges to consider an individuals future income before settling a bankruptcy case Spokesmen for the industry said however that they were pleased with the provisions designed to prevent abuse of the bankruptcy code This recognizes the fact that there have been problems with the bankruptcy law and it institutes procedures to insure that abuse will be curbed said Frances B Smith a spokesman for the American Financial Services Association which has been a principal part of the lobbying effort Some of the people declaring bankruptcy have not been aware of the different options available to them Major Issue of Contention The creation of 61 new district court judgeships and 24 new court of appeals judgeships was a major issue of contention in the Senate The judgeships were created to handle growing caseloads that have become a burden to Federal judges but some members of the Senate principally from the South considered the new judges unnecessary Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina attributed the heavy burden of work to judicial activism and usurpation by the judges themselves and added The Federal judiciary has recognized any number of alleged constitutional rights that the framers of the Constitution never had any idea they were creating The right to abortion the right to drive voluntary school prayer out of the schools and the right to massive forced busing to achieve racial balance would all be novelties to those who drafted the United States Constitution The Senate actually acted on two separate bills today folding its response to the Supreme Court decision into a bill intended to combat abuse of the bankruptcy code Representative Peter W Rodino Jr chairman of the House Judiciary Committee has resisted attempts by the credit industry to win swift approval of legislation designed to make it more difficult for individuals to declare personal bankruptcy Mr Rodino a Democrat from New Jersey has repeatedly stated that he wished to act on the constitutional question of the bankruptcy judges before making adjustments in other sections of bankruptcy law A House aide said that he believed the Senate bankruptcy package would not be acceptable to Mr Rodino You have to have a court before you can discuss substantive issues the aide said
CHICAGO'S ACTIVIST CARDINAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/01/magazine/chicago-s-activist-cardinal.html,WHEN the Roman Catholic bishops of the United States convene in Chicago tomorrow to vote on a pastoral letter on nuclear warfare their action will climax a twoyear battle led by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin principal architect of the controversial declaration who has fought for it as head of the bishops committee that has seen it through three drafts On that front another and longer campaign is just beginning The Cardinal sees the document which will be distributed to parishes later this year as a platform for continuing instruction and debate among the nations 50 million Catholics His longterm objective is the transformation of the Catholic Church in the United States into a peace church and his public pursuit of that objective has brought him into conflict with some of his ecclesiastical colleagues and under severe criticism from the Reagan Administration During the last decade the youthfullooking 55yearold Cardinal has earned a reputation as a polite but persistent warrior in social and ecclesiastical causes There is some irony in the fact that the vote on the most controversial issue the church has ever taken up in this country one it has debated in an unusually public way will take place in Chicago When Joseph Bernardin set out on this quest in 1981 he was Archbishop of Cincinnati Last August amid international furor over the letter he was appointed Archbishop of Chicago the nations largest archdiocese and less than four months later Pope John Paul II announced that he was giving the archbishop a cardinals hat In sending him to Chicago the Pope may have set Cardinal Bernadin down in a more bewildering field than the arena of nuclear strategy which for all its complexity is a tournament in which champions fight over a single issue In the Chicago archdiocese the problems are so complex emotionally powerful and interlocked that just getting a grip on them requires heroic effort The 24 million Catholics in the archdiocese account for almost half the citys population and more than half of its Cook and Lake County suburbs The racial polarization the city so radically evidenced in last months mayoral election divides the archdiocese in much the same way it divides the city a broad range of European ethnic groups a huge Hispanic population and the largest black Catholic group in the country There are deeper problems too For almost 20 years the Chicago archdiocese has drifted and decayed Many reforms mandated by the Second Vatican Council were never even begun and there was very nearly an open rebellion by priests against Cardinal Bernardins predecessor the late John Cardinal Cody The decline of the Chicago archdiocese became an obsessive problem for the Vatican in the late 1970s with some Curia officials openly expressing fears that it could sink into anarchy Yet its history has been one of innovation within the church and in social movements and its size has long made it preeminent in the nation Cardinal Bernardins assignment is to pull it all back together and he approaches his task with notions about spiritual renovation that virtually amount to creating a new kind of church In a sense he has the future of American Catholicism in his hands There is no member of the American hierarchy who is more closely watched by church leaders in the United States and abroad If he succeeds Cardinal Bernardin will have many imitators if not the failure could be catastrophic HE Cardinals plunge into political controversy in the debate over nuclear warfare may be good preparation for the work ahead in Chicago where eventually every question is political In the case of the pastoral letter he does not seem uncomfortable with politicsNuclear strategy he says is a political issue but it is also a moral one and we have an obligation to speak The bishops have spoken on moral issues before and some of them like the rights of labor have been political We bring to bear on such concerns the light of a great moral tradition It was he who devised the rules for the ad hoc Committee on War and Peace of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops which heard testimony from an array of nuclearwar experts political strategists and members of the Reagan Administration including Secretary of Defense Caspar W Weinberger and Eugene V Rostow then chief disarmament negotiator Some bishops criticized the holding of hearings but Cardinal Bernardin says We were preparing to speak on a complicated international question and we couldnt do it without all the advice we could get There was a sensation when he disseminated drafts of the proposed document to the media last year But he regarded the circulation of them as an opportunity to teach and to learn He and several other highranking American churchmen also went to Rome to meet with 30 European bishops who had asked to be briefed further Although many peacemovement supporters feared pressure from the Vatican Cardinal Bernardin insists that was not the case The discussion was absolutely open he says The draft to be voted on this week after what is expected to be a heated debate initiated by bishops still favoring a tougher stand differs from earlier versions primarily in dropping support for a nuclear halt There has also been a slight change in the language of earlier drafts which suggested that American targeting of nuclear weapons included civilian populations The changes do bring the document more in line with the public stand of the Pope on the issue But some Reagan Administration spokesmen have sought to leave the impression that behindthescenes lobbying turned the bishops around The Cardinal denies that claim saying that every change made through the various drafts was suggested by members of the bishops commmittee and that there were no conversations with Government officials except for those publicly announced and reported back to the bishops For them to give the impression that the document was changed by pressure is simply wrong he says heatedly Although the Administration expressed mild satisfaction with the new draft this document raises so many questions on the controlled use of nuclear weapons that in the Cardinals words it is skepticism bordering on outright disbelief In the long run what may prove most significant is that the pastoral letter limits the churchs historical notion of what is a just war and advises Catholics to consult their individual consciences about whether they can support a government that pursues a nuclear policy Defining his notion of a peace church Cardinal Bernardin has said that there is a need for a public voice willing to take risks on the side of reversing the arms race rather than reinforcing it The potential constituency of the peace church he adds is the entire body of 50 million American Catholics Whether that is realized will depend ultimately on the determination of individual bishops to keep the issue alive in their dioceses Cardinal Bernardins work on the pastoral letter and his promotion of it have unquestionably made easier his job as archbishop in Chicago where the cause is popular and his international prominence receives a good deal of media attention This leader of the peace church is what used to be called a prince of the Roman Church But there is little about Cardinal Bernardin that one would associate with royalty except perhaps for the rambling brick mansion bristling with towering chimneys where Chicago archbishops have lived for 100 years and where Cardinal Cody lived all alone The new Cardinal has made changes Heavy draperies were pulled aside windows opened and ceremonial rooms and offices dismantled The Cardinal invited two priests to move in with him and has welcomed a broad spectrum of Chicago society as visitors The office he works in at the archdiocesan headquarters may be perfect for the image he is creating A small room on the fourth floor of the crowded sixstory building it is Very Early Depression in style furnished with an old desk a round table with six side chairs a television set and two Naugahyde arm chairs On the walls are a crucifix a painting of a Madonna and child and one of clowns In that setting the red telephone on his desk looks as if it might have been put there by Claes Oldenburg in a spirit of fun The Cardinal seems at home there He pulls his chair up closer to a visitors and sits sideways in it so that when his black jacket falls open it reveals a lining patterned with tiny white quatrefoils Sitting does not describe his posture there is more movement in his chair than in most joggers routines and as he talks he uses both hands to shape and caress words and ideas His conversation reflects an enormous range of interests and emotion but popping up constantly amid talk of budgets politics family music war and peace are references to sanctity salvation God and prayer He has a tendency to be serious about everything but heavyhanded about nothing Asked about his Cardinals ring he took it off and handed it to his visitor telling a story about how it was made and commenting I like it That matteroffact sense of humor may be useful to him in Chicago not only in church work but in politics He had an early baptism in Chicago politics in the recent bitter mayoral campaign into which he waded early with a warning to Catholics to keep racism along with ethnic preferences and religion out of the ballot box There were racial demonstrations around churches during the campaign which were painful to him but he continued to speak out against racism and the day after the election he appeared at an interfaith breakfast with Harold Washington the citys first black mayor and pledged him his support Those who knew the Cardinal in Cincinnati were accustomed to his taking stands on public issues Nothing will intimidate Joe says Dr Alfred Gottschalk president of Hebrew Union College there Nor he adds is he susceptible to flattery When he first came here there were some old conservative Catholics who tried to win him over to their way of thinking Dr Gottschalk recalls They did not stand a chance He is openminded but determined and he is not going to be stopped or seduced He will need all the determination he can muster to reinvigorate the Chicago archdiocese to bring a sense of unity to its ethnic groups reorganize its executive structure involve lay people in decision making recruit new priests and deal with the increasing exasperation of women anxious to play a more active role in the work of the church If the people who applaud him sometimes talk as though he were a messenger from eternity his world is hardly ephemeral At least 15 languages are regularly used in masses at Chicago churches The largest ethnic groups have traditionally been European especially Polish and German But in recent years the Hispanic population  actually two groups a MexicanAmerican one whose origins in Chicago go back 100 years and a Puerto Rican and Latino group  has risen to at least 500000 with perhaps half again as many illegal immigrants There are 100000 black Catholics in the archdiocese and that bloc is rapidly expanding More than 2400 priests serve 444 parishes and 5000 nuns operate schools hospitals and other institutions The 61 Catholic high schools and 376 elementary schools have 186000 students and there are more than 36000 enrolled in the two large Catholic universities and six colleges CARDINAL Bernardin insists that the archdiocese has a mission and is not simply a giant corporation but under Illinois law it is a corporation and the Cardinal is legally the whole works  chief executive officer board of directors and sole stockholder At the end of fiscal 1982 the archdiocese had securities investments of 150 million market changes since have probably added another 40 million and it held 27 million in receivable notes Its revenues for the year including investments parish collections school tuitions and Catholic Charities were 294 million its outlays 281 million The biggest expense item was for the schools not including 48 high schools run by independent religious orders which cost 121 million to operate only half of which was covered by tuition To finance its operations the archdiocesan central office assesses parishes 587 percent of their collections It also acts as their bank paying 4 percent for funds deposited and charging 5 percent on loans Last year it held 659 million in deposits and had 187 million on loan Deficits were shown by 117 parishes mostly in the inner city including 29 that are directly subsidized by the archdiocese Church property basically churches and schools was listed at about 21 billion but since property used by churches is neither depreciated nor taxed the figure represents only insurable value The archdiocese owns no investment property Historically there has been little formal executive structure There are two auxiliary bishops but both are assigned to parishesCardinal Bernardin says he plans this year to nominate five or six auxiliary bishops one to be a kind of executive vice president and the others to be given geographical jurisdictions and he has said he is sympathetic to requests that one be black and one Hispanic Recruiting priests has been a recent problem for the archdiocese where there were only seven ordinations last year That number however could double in each of the next several years The two high schools where students who have an interest in the priesthood study have more than 1000 students and the two seminaries where candidates study for priesthood now have 260 students more than a third of whom entered this year Recruiting priests and reorganizing his administration are hardly matters of controversy but in most other areas Cardinal Bernardin is likely to encounter problems For example the status of women is a problem he has not yet tackled despite pressure from many disparate groups Sister Kaye Ashe a Dominican nun and associate dean of Rosary College whose new book Todays Woman Tomorrows Church has won a top Catholic publishing award recently wrote the Cardinal outlining some areas for consideration He replied immediately which impressed her but she says he did not directly address such issues as promoting women to decisionmaking jobs in the archdiocese or giving them continuing education for pastoral duties Asked what he will do eventually the Cardinal says This is a painful question for many people and it needs attention and study But reflecting the Vatican position he adds that if the question being raised is one of participation I am very sympathetic If it is a question only of power I would say No  In other matters it is the Cardinal who will sometimes hear someone say No for instance when he begins to implement plans to alter the strong ethnic identity of many parishes While saying that it is very rich and should be preserved he also says that he will find ways to stress the common identity of all Although the realization of that vision in Chicago would seem impossible to almost any knowledgable observer of that city those who knew the Cardinal in Cincinnati point out that he accomplished just that while archbishop there Even more complex will be the difficulty of reshaping the structure of the large church school system which is intricately woven into the citys political and racial structure The potential for conflict in any reorganization is enormous I know how attached people are to their neighborhood schools he says but he hopes that eventually they will see these things in a larger vision He warns that the great danger is to just let things happen The underlying instruction he has given to planners is that as the Catholic system is reshaped it should not be seen as in competition with the public schools They ought to complement one another Even within the church his view of education is quite different from the dominant ideas of the past The schools are a part of Catholic education he says but only part Catholic education is a lifetime process and part of the churchs evangelizing efforts he says and the schools should be seen in that light not as something unique How much municipal social action he is willing to undertake is not yet clear But his history in Cincinnati where he became one of the most forceful activists in the state for jobs and equality for blacks and Appalachian immigrants suggests it could be a great deal To run the archdioceses ecumenical and human relations programs he has brought back to Chicago Msgr John J Egan a national socialaction leader who worked in the city for 30 years before a fallingout with Cardinal Cody led him in 1972 to remove himself to the University of Notre Dame For all his sophistication in church affairs and in politics there is a lot of the small town in Cardinal Bernardin and it works to his advantage when he is dealing with people He was born in Columbia SC to Maria and Joseph Bernardin an immigrant stonecutter from northern Italy and attended public and Catholic schools there before going on to the University of South Carolina where he intended to prepare for a medical career One the jokes making the rounds in Chicago these days is that there but for the grace of God goes a good doctor Like many children of immigrants he has become more interested in his roots as he has grown older He says that when they were young he and his sister Elaine now Mrs James Addison did not learn Italian because we were too busy becoming American and it was only recently that he became proficient in the language He did not visit Fiera di Primiero the little town in the Dolomites near the city of Trent where his parents came from until long after he had become a priest When he received his cardinals hat last February his Primiero relatives rented a bus and drove to Rome for the ceremony He likes to tell people about that and many other things about his family and those stories have a strong emotional appeal in Chicago  as indeed does the presence at some official ceremonies of his widowed mother who now lives in a center for the aging operated by the Little Sisters of the Poor in the city Cardinal Bernardin is now probably the bestknown Catholic Church leader in this country There are eight other cardinals four of whom are retired and the other three have not been national spokesmen for the countrys bishops Among American Catholic leaders he is the one most often consulted by foreign leaders in the church And in the American hierarchy he has no equals in the knowledge of church governance and structure Yet his religious career has developed outside most of the rules that have governed Vatican appointments in this country for more than a century He does not have a degree in theology he never studied in Rome and he is not an alumnus of the North American College whose oldboy network dominates Catholic episcopal thrones in the United States He was already in college when he decided to become a priest and went to study Latin and philosophy at seminary colleges in Kentucky and Baltimore before taking his final training at the Catholic University of America in Washington He has little interest in the status quo and all his thinking about the church is in terms of action which makes some church conservatives wary of him On the other hand he is loyal to the Vaticans positions on most theological and moral questions and that makes some of the more eager innovators within the church uncomfortable When at 38 he became an auxiliary bishop in Atlanta in 1966 he was the youngest bishop in the nation Soon after he began to play a broader role in church affairs From 1968 to 1972 he was general secretary of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops and was elected its president in 1974 He was one of four Americans elected as a delegate to the last three world synods of bishops and at each was elected to the 15member Permanent Council that writes the agenda of the next synod One of his colleagues on the first two councils was Karol Cardinal Wojtyla now Pope John Paul II He has been a member of a number of important congregations of the Vatican Curia including the Sacred Congregation for Bishops and he was on the commission that recently issued a new code of church canon law His official duties take him to Rome fairly often and his acquaintance in the Vatican is wide There is always speculation about how close he is to the Pope Asked if he keeps in touch on the telephone he laughs and says Ive never had a phone call from him I do see the Pope when I am in Rome but otherwise the usual way is through the Apostolic Delegate in Washington His innovative plans for the Chicago archdiocese are fully in line with its history which has included leadership in social action missionary work the training of priests and the development of national lay organizations In this century the Cardinals George Mundelein Samuel Stritch and Albert Meyer were not only outspoken liberals in the church and supporters of socialwelfare programs in the country but also very popular  in part for their notable willingness to allow a wide range of experimentation and spontaneous lay organization in the archdiocese The fate of Cardinal Bernardins immediate predecessor John Cardinal Cody was different Although he promoted many programs such as subsidizing innercity schools for which his predecessors would have been praised he was autocratic overly cautious uncommunicative and isolated from his clergy The fact that after his death a Federal grand jury dropped its investigation into allegations that he had diverted church funds to a woman friend did little to dissipate an air of scandal about his final years When Cardinal Bernardin arrived in Chicago last August he quickly created an image of himself as a reconciler reopening an old church that had been closed amid great dissent visiting a large high school once Catholic but since abandoned by the archdiocese announcing plans to set up a Diocesan Council a layclerical parliament He also appointed a committee of businessmen to supervise an audit of church finances which he distributed widely During his first eight months in Chicago he has met as often as four or five times a week with many groups labor unions government bodies civic groups church organizations and lay people To some he delivers simple pastoral messages a few of which have become legend At a Christmas mass in Cook County jail he startled inmates when he said I ask you to accept my presence as a sign of my affection and respect and also as a pledge of continued prayers and support in the future For other groups he outlines agendas He reminded city labor leaders that they had a tradition of social action and suggested they return to it After telling Protestant leaders that there would be more ecumenical cooperation from his side he noted that the dialogue between the two religions has become intellectually flabby and hinted that ignoring real issues is not very healthy His talk to the Chicago Board of Rabbis and the Jewish Federation is almost a classic example of his style He began by informing them that he had inaugurated programs to teach Jewish history and culture to Catholics went on to restate the American bishops support for Israel and then spelled out their support for a Palestinian homeland in the Middle East He rejected Jewish criticism of the Pope for having received Yassir Arafat in the Vatican last year saying Such comments deeply offend many Catholics and are not conducive to dialogue He finished by urging public discussion of differences on such matters as abortion and public support for parents with children in private schools He sometimes sets off an argument but his reception is invariably enthusiastic Martin E Marty a Lutheran minister and a professor at the University of Chicago says The secret is that what you see is what you get He is absolutely open He has no enemies Critics he does have but he tends to disarm them since he leaves the impression that a solution might be found to almost any problem He will meet and listen to any group for hours and will express entirely credible sympathy with them but his own direction is clearly in line with Romes In fact it is fair to characterize his pastoral theology in general as fairly conservative Although he keeps a crushing 17hour work day that worries many of his friends he does know how to relax One of the first things he did after arriving in Chicago was to subscribe to the Chicago Symphony And although he complains that he hasnt time to read much his conversation and speeches are studded with quotations from news stories movies and the works of many writers including Luther Emerson Tolstoy and John Betjeman He writes his own papers and speeches in a precise and direct style And for all his accessibility  it is said he spoke personally with every priest in the archdiocese within a few months of his arrival  he values his privacy finding it where he can in his car as he drives to appointments or in airplanes on numerous trips which he generally makes alone Ask him what Joseph Bernardin is deeply essentially and he says A priest Two years ago he wrote a widely distributed pamphlet Called to Serve Called to Lead a classic meditation on priesthood which includes practical suggestions about prayer patience sexuality and personality not often found in such guides It is characteristic of him to have insisted in the pamphlet that a priest finds his true personal identity only in his priesthood My principal role he says is to proclaim the Lord and the Gospel and it has a very evangelistic thrust I have tried to witness to that not only in preaching but in the way I live and relate to people There is a great spiritual hunger in this country For some years we have gone through a period of questioning and a great loss of faith but I see a reawakening That the rebirth he sees is a faith found on the other side of disillusionment does not trouble him People may be tired of the institutions but they want the Lord We may come out of this with a much stronger faith than before Challenged about his traditional views on moral questions especially sexual mores he says People have been given some strange notions not only about sexuality but about their own purposes and identities I am not so much interested in dos and donts I support the rules but I really want people to come to church to have a relationship with the Lord If they do he says they will find it is much more demanding than the rules That kind of view is almost certain to bring the church into increasing conflict with the rest of society if not with the civil order and the Cardinal acknowledges that If we live a religious life and encourage others to do that there is no doubt we will come into increasing conflict with the prevailing values of this society It is hard to guess how much he thinks is enough but there is a lot of combative instinct in the man His effect on crowds of Chicago Catholics is difficult to define It is more than celebrity although he knows how to use that very well and there is a terrific excitement about him He sometimes seems bothered by the applause perhaps the only thing he talks about that makes him hesitant or nervous Something strange is happening and its a new experience for me he says I find it increasingly difficult to get out of the crowds I get into The Cardinal does not seem to be running for anything except the next meeting on his busy schedule but there is an extraordinary amount of speculation about his future among people in and outside the church Dr Gottschalk of Cincinnatis Hebrew Union College offers what he calls a Jewish perspective on the matter If ever an American could be Pope he says Joe would be wonderful Chicagoans have their own perspectives There is the applause the admiration the apprehension the questioning many individual judgments In a basement bar a block away from Holy Name Cathedral a sometime church usher pondering a second Scotch offers this one The Cardinals a terrific guy all in all I guess hell make it here I hope he does We need it But I would find it all easier to take if his parents hadnt been named Mary and Joseph

AN ECONOMIST IN THE HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/01/books/an-economist-in-the-house.html,HOW WE LIVE By Victor R Fuchs 293 pp Cambridge Mass Harvard University Press 1750 TOO often economics is as dismal a science as many believe it to be Most economists pass their days in sober contemplation of next months price for hog bellies or last months default rate on bank loans to nonoilexporting less developed countries But during the last few decades economics has broadened its horizons Academic economists frustrated by diminishing intellectual yields on their own ground have been cultivating the fields of psychologists philosophers anthropologists social historians  you name it Economists for example have more or less convincingly demonstrated that the Southern plantation gentry carefully minded the morals of their female slaves that the ancient cultures of China South America and Europe were driven in diverse directions by their choice of feed grains and that the certainty of punishment is a better deterrent to crime than the punishments severity The economists latest enthusiasm serendipitously coinciding with popular concerns is the family How We Live is a compendium of economic research on the subject an economists eye view on everything from why some women smoke during pregnancy to whether it makes sense to send Junior to Harvard to why Juniors widowed mom wont move back in with the kids Victor R Fuchs a professor of economics at Stanford University and a research associate at the National Bureau of Economic Research promises more than he can deliver But this accessible little book is chockfull of fascinating facts and educated conjectures Some of the most interesting of these are only marginally related to economics Consider for example the question of why infant mortality among black Americans has remained 60 to 90 percent above that among whites since the 1940s The conventional wisdom is that blacks suffer from poor diet and medical care which leads to smaller babies at birth which puts the infants at greater risk When econometric techniques are used to eliminate these factors however most of the weight difference remains Why then do black women give birth to so many infants below the crucial 5 12pound mark Mr Fuchs doesnt know for certain but he infers from other studies of disadvantaged ethnics that the causes are social not medical Puerto Rican and Mexican women living in the continental United States he notes are on average equally poor and equally deprived of good medical care But many more Puerto Rican babies are born underweight than Mexican babies and Mr Fuchs argues that this must be attributable to the relative instability of Puerto Rican families What is more recognizably in the realm of economics rather than of sociology is Mr Fuchss explanation of why more married women are now working than in years past  more accurately why more married women are working outside their homes The obvious explanation is that their families need the money That may be true but it doesnt explain why a higher proportion of married women were typing letters or working on assembly lines during the affluent 1960s than during the relatively poor 1950s A larger female labor force could be a byproduct of feminism a growing percentage of women no longer feels fulfilled by housework Thats a plausible explanation but its not correct The first surge in female participation in the work force came during the early 1950s a decade before The Feminine Mystique was published How did the availability of timesaving innovations  dishwashers TV dinners washandwear clothes affect womens decisions to go to work There is a temptation here Mr Fuchs says to confuse cause and effect Supermarkets the biggest timesavers of all existed at least 35 years ago But they did not really catch on until women felt the need to reduce the time they devoted to shopping Perhaps then womens going to work in increasing numbers is related to the postponement of childbearing No way In 1948 10 percent of the married women with children under 6 were working By 1980 the figure was 47 percent The key to understanding changes in womens participation in the labor force Mr Fuchs says lies in the higher opportunity cost attached to staying home Womens wages have been rising for a long long time But only during the last few decades have many women been able to earn enough to make it worthwhile to cut back on housework or to hire someone else to clean and babysit This explanation he notes is consistent with the fact that women with more education and earning potential were among the first to enter the work force in the postwar years ACTUALLY Mr Fuchs says simple principles such as opportunity cost form the basis on which most of the new economics of the family is built For example the University of Chicago economist Gary Becker would liken the institution of marriage to Adam Smiths pin factory When pin workers began to specialize in the separate steps needed to create the finished product they became far more productive Analogously couples historically benefited by dividing the labor between home and field or factory Now for a variety of economic and cultural reasons the benefits from the division of labor in marriage are fading And that perhaps also explains why divorce rates have risen Once you get the idea just about anyone who got a B in Econ 101 is eligible to play the game Why are better educated mothers more likely to have their children immunized against polio The answer is that schooling lowers moms rate of time discount the future payoff she requires to invest time and money now rather than later Why do more unmarried mothers keep their babies today than did in the past Due to the reduced economic and psychic cost of contraception and abortion fewer unwanted babies are now born And because of more generous government incomesupport programs the cost of setting up a singleparent household is lower than it has ever been Why even when the results are controlled for family income are firstborn and only children healthier and why do they do better in school The answer Parents value the scarce product more highly and therefore invest more in its care How We Live may irritate those who believe that people cant be explained by simple economic principles And it is sure to infuriate those who believe that competing disciplines  psychology politics biology  tell us all we need to know about human behavior It is not fair though to judge the book or its author from extreme perspectives Economists arent going to revolutionize the study of family life Yet larded between the obvious and the ridiculous in How We Live there is much insightful research And Mr Fuchss compact style makes the book a pleasure to read
ABOUT NEW YORK,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/04/nyregion/about-new-york.html,Public School 15 is on one side of East Fourth Street between Avenues C and D On the other side of the street are four brickedup abandoned buildings and a grocery store that is never open On one side of the school building there is a big vacant lot in which someone has put up two solitary swings The lot glitters in the sun with green broken glass and offers a fine view of Fifth Street where there are more vacant lots more glass and more brickedup buildings Across from the big lot is what was once a little lot and is now a brave little community garden with a patch of tall red tulips and some slender stalks of grape hyacinth All the plants have signs in front of them with Latin names and information Lavandula Angustifolia it says in front of the lavender The gates to the garden are padlocked Across the street in PS 15 the children in the afterschool arts program put on their spring play the other day It was typical of elementary school programs in a lot of ways There were a great many mistakes The anatomy chart that was supposed to be a major prop in Captain Nemo and His Magic Submarine never showed up on stage because someone left it in the back room The Isadora Duncan gowns in the rose petal dance lost a little something in the translation because all the dancers wore Tshirts underneath It was sometimes difficult to hear all the words to Aba Daba Honeymoon But there was something special about the performers energies and the audience enthusiasm for a simple little entertainment in a neighborhood in which children complain about how many junkies there are on the streets and how sometimes they fall in front of you and you have to step over them There was something wonderful about the ordinariness of it all the cardboard swords and the police officers uniform made from a brown paper bag First there was a circus parade with paper masks Then William Mason a skinny boy with a baby face who is 10 years old and lives in the projects nearby came on stage in a satin cape and made a rubber ball appear from beneath a black handkerchief Oh wow cried someone in the front room and the students applauded respectfully Then there were some cartwheels and piggyback rides set to music Captain Nemo came later a greatly doctored version featuring a long firstact speech between three girls about the relative virtures of Charlie Miguel and Ricky of the Puerto Rican rock group Menudo But the high point of the show came when all the performers gathered in a line and sang Blue Skies as though it was brand new Their clear voices filled the room Blue skies smiling at me Nothing but blue skies do I see The children had chosen that song over Physical to perform in the show The afterschool program is directed by the Third Street Music School Settlement and financed by the New York City Youth Board About 40 children stay every afternoon from 3 until 5 PM learning from dancers artists singers Some of their parents send them because they hope the program will keep them off the streets and some send them because they hope it will keep them out of their hair Pablo Delano directs the program I have to kick somebody out every once in a while he said Theyre just too wild Its scary at 5 oclock when I send them home and the street is all filled with junkies But they know everything  junkies pregnancy abortion They learn everything in this neighborhood The children live right around PS 15 Its a little bit bad because they sell drugs on Third Street said Eduardo Ortiz who is 12 Its an all right place but there are too many druggies added William All over the streets there are men with bright eyes and fast patter selling heroin and the needles to use it with All over the streets there are sleepy people who bought what the men had to sell Down the street from PS 15 there is the famous mural of the eagle with a hypodermic needle clutched in his claws and the legend Come fly with me fool There are less sophisticated messages nearby Shoplift something in black on one wall and Warfarin the name of the rat poison But the amazing thing about the area around PS 15 is not how much of it is dead or dying but how much of it is still alive Here and there are other gardens On some lampposts are pasted leaflets that say Drugs Kill Another reads Community Garden Now Being Organized with a number to call Someone is putting together a block party a group spent a day sweeping the streets And the other day the children in the afterschool program put on their play and had a party afterward William got angry at Pablo and said Shut up man but he still signed the card the girls were passing around for the director with a printed bouquet of pink flowers and the message Its a joy to know you I love you Pablo said Lucy Gonzalez 11 who was still wearing the blue eye shadow and eyebrow pencil from the show and who looked disquietingly old Pablo has been working on the afterschool program for three years It was the end of another season when he sent the children home Across the street from the school a man was on the nod the crook of his arm all pitted with little red holes Junkie said one of the performers disdainfully holding one of the flowers that had been given out after the play Each year the program loses some children They move on They grow up Some of them may fly with the fools eagle and some of them may plant gardens At the very least they know the words to Blue Skies They all did that one perfectly Blue days all of them gone Nothing but

"COUNCIL OF CHURCHES, MEETING THIS WEEK, IS FACING DISCORD",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/09/us/council-of-churches-meeting-this-week-is-facing-discord.html,The National Council of Churches the largest ecumenical organization in the United States will confront some of the most difficult issues in its history when it meets in San Francisco this week The fourday gathering beginning Tuesday comes on the heels of renewed charges that the council leans too far to the left on social issues and growing concern that it may have lost touch with the members of its 33 Protestant and Orthodox denominations The councils 180member governing board is scheduled to spend an entire day discussing whether the Metropolitan Community Churches a denomination formed as a haven for homosexual Christians is eligible for membership The board will also hear a preliminary report from a panel appointed to chart the future of the 32yearold council When complete the report is expected to suggest major changes in the way denominations cooperate with one another Panel members say church leaders believe the council has a cumbersome bureaucracy that confuses church officials and fails to respond to the interests of member churches Need for Change Acknowledged The councils president Bishop James Armstrong of the Indiana Conference of the United Methodist Church acknowledges that changes are needed If we try to do things today the way we did them 15 years ago we have signed our own death warrant said the Bishop who named the panel on the councils future as soon as he was elected president in 1981 Bishop Armstrong and several other leaders would also like the council to include a broader range of American Christianity The Roman Catholic Church is not a member though it joins in some activities Most major evangelical and conservative churches also shun the council because of its liberal theological and social positions Recent public criticism of the council focuses on allegations that it supports leftist groups in Central America and elsewhere and that it gives insufficient attention to the value of democracy The allegations were made largely through a Washington organization the Institute on Religion and Democracy composed mainly of neoconservative theologians and political activists Under its present system the National Council of Churches creates committees that are not directly supervised by council leaders or representatives of the member churches Links however tenuous with special interest groups such as the Interreligious Task Force on El Salvador and Central America have caused trouble when the groups became involved in controversies Accountability and governance are being closely examined said the Rev EO Smith dean of St Pauls Episcopal Cathedral in Buffalo a member of the panel on the councils future He said the panel was discussing which programs are the albatrosses that could be discontinued The councils focus on social concerns may have cost it support among churchgoers who are worried more about the challenges to their own faith than about religious liberty in Albania the subject of a resolution on the docket this week Expanding Theological Work In response to criticism the council has been trying to expand its theological and spiritual work The Commission on Faith and Order its main theological unit has undertaken several ecumenical studies at the behest of the churches The commission includes Roman Catholic priests and theologians giving it the broader base that many in the churches want The commission did a painstaking theological study on the membership application from the Universal Fellowship of Metropolitan Community Churches which was formed in 1968 to minister to homosexuals Council membership for the 30000member denomination is problematic because while its doctrinal statements are as orthodox as those of any denomination in the council its views on homosexuality are unacceptable to most churches The Commission on Faith and Order was asked to decide whether a church formed around homosexuality could be considered eligible for membership Its study concluded that since the council had not developed a theology that would give a definitive answer each church would have to make its own decision Some denominations believe the council could admit the Metropolitan Community Churches without sanctioning its views on homosexuality since member churches disagree on other ethical issues such as abortion But a majority of the denominations strongly argue against admission Some say that there may be no theological reason for denying membership but that approval it would cause several denominations including the Eastern Orthodox Churches to quit the council Final Vote in November Talks this week may reveal whether any compromise can be reached before a final vote is taken in November The council which has headqaurters in New York has also been slow to adjust to major changes in American religion When it was founded it represented strong national denominations flush with postwar growth and optimism It quickly became embroiled in politics and was buoyed by its early support of the civil rights movement But today most national church bodies faced with declining membership and internal problems give less attention to the ecumenical organization We use the NCC in very few places said the Rev William Norgren chief ecumenical officer for the Episcopal Church What we want from it most is reliable information and research Officials of the Episcopal Church he said are convinced the council needs to be much leaner Despite the criticisms and uneasiness most church officials say they need an organization like the council They readily praise its accomplishments including the Revised Standard Version of the Bible and a huge program of worldwide relief and development activities Most do not want the council to back away from engagement with social issues But said the Rev James M Wall editor of the independent weekly Christian Century and a supporter of the council some selectivity is needed
TRANSPLANTATION OF FETAL CURES POINTS TOWARD DIABETES CELL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/arts/transplantation-of-fetal-cures-points-toward-diabetes-cell.html,SCIENTISTS in California and Australia have eliminated diabetes in some laboratory animals by giving them pancreas glands transplanted from fetuses of the same species The research represents one of several dramatically new modes of attack on human diabetes a widespread disease that still despite decades of research can be neither prevented nor cured but only alleviated and even with the best medical management continues to cause blindness loss of limbs and premature death in some patients If applied to humans however the new technique of transplanting the fetal pancreas might raise a highly emotional issue The only source for such transplants would be aborted human fetuses In the United States a Federal commission studied the propriety of using human fetal tissues for medical research in the mid1970s and found it ethically acceptable That determination was written into regulations of what is now the Department of Health and Human Services But in Australia the pancreas transplant research has evoked recent protests from antiabortion activists even though the first use of the technique in humans may still be several years away Dr Josiah Brown of the University of California at Los Angeles a pioneer in the fetal transplant research estimates that the method will be ready for its first trial in humans in about three years He and other scientists involved insist that the use of tissues from an aborted fetus is an issue separate from the issue of abortion itself That too was essentially the finding of the National Commission for the Protection of Human Subjects of Biomedical and Behavioral Research The issue was explored at length because Congress in 1974 had ordered a moratorium on all research involving the living human fetus until the commission had studied the propriety of the research and had given an opinion After the commissions report in 1975 the moratorium was lifted There has been little public controversy since then Furthermore pancreatic transplants involve only fetal tissues not the living fetus At present there is a substantial body of fetal research in progress most of it aimed at understanding development in the womb and finding ways of avoiding abnormalities There has been relatively little work on transplantation of fetal tissues except those of the pancreas and thyroid Diabetes is a complex disease in which the body either produces too little insulin or fails to make proper use of the supplies it does make Most of the estimated 10 million Americans who suffer from the disease can be maintained in acceptably good daytoday health by use of diet alone but more than a million including most of those who develop diabetes as children must have regular injections of insulin The injections maintain approximately the proper chemical balance in the patients body but they do not cure the disease or eliminate the risk of longterm complications including blindness loss of limbs through blood vessel deterioration heart and kidney disease and shortened lifespan Failure to prevent the complications has spurred scientists to look for radically new treatments Recent research has taken three principal tacks all depending on the fact that the bodys main source of insulin is the tiny islands of cells called islets of Langerhans in the pancreas Certain cells in these islets called beta cells produce the hormone and send it to the liver and other tissues throughout the body One research approach has been to transplant the adult pancreas from a person who has just died Another is to collect the insulinproducing cells from such a gland and transplant them alone The third used only in animal research so far is that of transplanting the fetal pancreas Each method has potential advantages but also disadvantages said Dr Brown All except the fetal pancreas transplants would suffer from a serious shortage of supply if widely used Dr Paul E Lacy and colleagues of Washington University in St Louis have pioneered research on the transplantation of islet cells alone even succeeded in transplants between mice and rats crossing the species barrier that ordinarily would have caused the recipient animals immune defenses to destroy the foreign tissue Dr Lacey believes some of the same techniques will be applicable to humans soon Within a year we will be close to trying he said the other day Dr Lacey does not believe the word cure is appropriate for the treatments under development because he says this term implies understanding the cause of a disease well enough to thwart it altogether The underlying process by which diabetes does its damage is still mysterious He is hopeful that some form of transplantation may prevent the destructive complications of diabetes even before their origin is thoroughly understood Preventing these complications is the main objective of the research Dr Brown in collaboration with Dr Kevin Lafferty of Australias National University in Canberra has developed a method for transplanting the fetal pancreas in animals in such a way that only the insulinproducing tissue survives This is an important advantage of the method because digestive enzymes made by other tissues of a transplanted pancreas can have a destructive effect Dr Brown said With the proper timing the transplant survives as an organ devoted almost entirely to insulin production In the rat this surviving tissue grows enormously Dr Brown said and eventually produces 20 to 25 percent as much insulin as a normal rat pancreas If the transplant is placed so that the production goes first to the recipients liver where it is most needed this is fully adequate for the bodys insulin needs he said The results of such transplants in rats have been spectacular It was fantastic a dramatic change Dr Brown said The diabetes just went away The timing of such transplants is critical and delicate They must be done at a stage of gestation in which the fetal insulinproducing tissues have developed but the enzymeproducing cells have not yet begun to act In the rat this strategic point is at about 17 12 days of gestation out of the total of 21 to 22 Dr Brown and his colleages have found If the experimenters wait just another half day the destructive enzymes appear and the transplant is too late In the pig the animal in which much current research is being done the proper time is around the 55th day of a gestation period of about 114 In the human the optimum is around the 16th week of fetal development This has been demonstrated by laboratory experiments that did not involve transplantation of the fetal human pancreas The timing is significant in terms of future supply About 9 percent of abortions are done at about that time according to some estimates As with other organs the main unsolved problem with pancreas transplants is that of destruction of the transplanted tissues by the recipients immune defenses One key approach has been to look for ways of preparing the pancreas tissues so that they do not evoke an immune attack This would free the patient from lifetime use of immunosuppressive drugs Dr Lacey and his colleagues in St Louis have attacked immunity problems in four different ways by growing islet cells a for a week at low temperature by growing them in the presence of excessive oxygen by treating the islet sample with antibodies before transplantation or by treating the recipient animals in advance with antibodies to make them tolerant to the transplanted tissue Much of this work builds on Dr Laffertys evidence that white blood cells in the pancreatic tissue are important in evoking the destructive response by the transplant recipients body The research team in St Louis has also developed new effective ways of collecting samples of islet cells free of the other pancreatic tissues In one method the scientists digest the pancreas structural framework with an enzyme called collagenase to free the islet cells The nonislet cell portion is captured by the tiny plastic barbs of a sheet of Velcro It is lovely said Dr Lacey in describing the method The islet cells make up only about 1 percent of the whole pancreas When concentrated and separated from the rest of the gland they can be transplanted as only about a thimbleful of tissue In research on dogs Dr David Scharp at Washington University has developed automated procedures for collecting the islet cells Even before these new developments transplantation of the adult pancreas helped some patients at least for a time More than 190 human pancreas transplants have been done during the past two decades according to the latest report of an international registry At their last published tabulation last year 19 patients were alive and free of any need for insulin injections Nine had been so for more than a year But this time span is far too short for an assessment of the effects on the complications of diabetes The registry report in the journal Diabetes published by the American Diabetes Association said there have also been 76 attempts to transplant human islet cells in 71 patients A variety of tissue sources methods of preparation sites of implantation and immunosuppressants have been used but almost all attempts have failed the report said Four patients were said to have become insulinindependent for sustained periods after islet transplantation but insufficient details are available in these cases for critical analysis The new research in St Louis Los Angeles Canberra and elsewhere suggests that a new era in such transplants may be dawning today
ADMINISTRATION PRESSES COURT ON TEEN-AGE CONTRACEPTIVE RULE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/10/us/administration-presses-court-on-teen-age-contraceptive-rule.html,The Reagan Administration asked the United States Court of Appeals today to uphold a new Federal rule that would require certain family planning clinics to notify parents when they prescribe contraceptives for minors Another court proceeding today involved a Utah law that would require retailers to notify parents when they sell prescription or nonprescription contraceptives to minors A Federal district judge issued a temporary restraining order to bar enforcement of that law which attorneys for the American Civil Liberties Union and Planned Parenthood of Utah say infringes upon privacy rights protected by the Constitution Judge David K Winder in Salt Lake City said that there was sufficient justification for him to delay enforcement of the state law until he could hold a hearing on its merits later this year She Says Authority Is Clear At the Court of Appeals hearing in Washington Carolyn B Kuhl a Justice Department lawyer told the court It is absolutely clear that the Secretary of Health and Human Services had the authority to issue the regulations challenged in this case Congress she said wanted to encourage family participation in adolescents contraceptive decisions and the family cannot participate in an activity that it does not know is taking place Federal district judges in Washington and New York have struck down the new rule saying it would increase adolescent pregnancies by discouraging young women from seeking birth control services The Government has appealed both decisions The rule would apply to family planning clinics that receive Federal money The Government says there are 5000 such clinics In 1981 they served 615000 people under the age of 18 The hearing was held before a threejudge panel of the appeals court here The judges were J Skelly Wright Harry T Edwards and Robert H Bork Questions posed to Miss Kuhl by Judge Edwards suggested that he saw little merit in the Governments position Judge Wright was noncommittal and Judge Bork seemed to be searching for some legal rationale that might support the proposed rule Judge Disputes Her Miss Kuhl declared Its entirely legitimate for a parent to be involved in family planning decisions of an adolescent child Judge Edwards interrupting her said Thats a moral question an ethical question not a statutory issue President Reagan defended the parental notification rule when he spoke to a convention of evangelical Christians in Orlando Fla on March 8 Mr Reagan said that the fight against parental notification is really only one example of many attempts to water down traditional values and even abrogate the original terms of American democracy Critics of the rule never mention morality as playing a part in the subject of sex the President said He asked Is all of JudeoChristian tradition wrong Are we to believe that something so sacred can be looked upon as a purely physical thing with no potential for emotional and psychological harm The lawsuits here were filed by the Planned Parenthood Federation of America and the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association a nonprofit group representing clinics that receive Federal money Edwards Faults Language In an amendment to the Public Health Service Act Congress in 1981 said that clinics receiving Federal funds for contraceptive services should to the extent practical encourage family participation in their activities If Congress had wanted to require parental notification Judge Edwards said it could have used more explicit language John W Nields Jr a lawyer for the National Family Planning and Reproductive Health Association said that Congress recognized the need for clinics to respect confidentiality when dispensing contraceptives under Title X of the Public Health Service Act That title enacted in 1970 authorized Federal support for family planning services including prescription and nonprescription contraceptives Tracing the history of the legislation Mr Nields said There is nothing to suggest that Congress liked teenage sex But Congress liked abortion spending billions of dollars in welfare funds and potentially ruined lives for our nations teenagers a lot less Nancy L Buc a lawyer for the Planned Parenthood Federation said that the Department of Health and Human Services had failed in its legal duty to weigh and evaluate the 120000 comments filed on its proposed rule The department she said cited its desire to protect the health of adolescents as a major reason for the rule But according to medical experts she said prescription contraceptives such as birth control pills diaphragms and intrauterine devices present few health risks to women under the age of 18 He Signed With Reluctance In Utah the parental notification law was to have taken effect on Tuesday When Gov Scott M Matheson a Democrat signed the legislation in March he said he was doing so with great reluctance because of several constitutional questions and the clearly difficult enforcement problems Nan Hunter the civil liberties union lawyer who filed the lawsuit for Planned Parenthood of Utah said that Judge Winders ruling would keep a very harmful law from taking effect Doug Balvin an assistant attorney general of Utah said the judges order did not necessarily mean that the law would be permanently struck down But he said Its a setback The Utah suit contends that the state law is enormously broad and adds It requires persons ranging from a minors relatives to grocery store clerks to physicians to hunt down both parents prior to any sale gift or medical prescription of a contraceptive

HONORING FATHERS AND MOTHERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/books/honoring-fathers-and-mothers.html,THE WAR OVER THE FAMILY Capturing the Middle Ground By Brigitte Berger and Peter L Berger 252 pp New York Anchor PressDoubleday 1495 THE family has been a much argued subject and Brigitte and Peter Berger sociologists who teach at Wellesley College and Boston University are not too far afield when they mention a war in their books title One or another view of abortion for instance can inspire extreme suspicion fear anger and bitterness  emotions rampant in a population at war The Equal Rights Amendment was favored and opposed by groups who have scant respect for each other and have made clear their intense mutual dislike mostly with words but sometimes with physical encounters Discussion of topics such as the advisability and adequacy of day care or the prevention of teenage pregnancy should parents be informed when their children receive contraceptive devices from an agency funded by the Government prompt such fierce polemics that the debate seems directed not at one or another issue but at the overall moral assumptions held by some and disputed by others Not that the Bergers wish to abstain from this continuing series of truculent confrontations This is an unashamedly preachy book  a series of essays each brief and pungent meant to assert some positions refute others and carve out a particular point of view no matter the disagreements sure to come from various quarters The authors proclaim a strong skepticism about the influence of those social scientists who have lectured the rest of us on the nature and purpose of the American family Setting aside socalled valuefree social science often a fantasy anyway they strongly embrace and advocate the traditional family as the repository of important personal and social virtues Again and again they urge the reader to rally round the nuclear family which they regard as a precondition rather than a consequence of modernization In this they openly write a different history from other contemporary scholars It is really a chronology of consciousness as triumphant over condition  of the shaping influence from one generation to another exerted on society by those who live a certain kind of family life Where others and not only Marxists would find social and economic forces  the decline of the yeomanry the rise of urban capitalism  responsible for the emergence of the small and intensely private family that is frugal and ambitious circumspect and childcentered the Bergers stress the initiatives of certain 18thcentury families small producers working their own property  the class from which the bourgeoisie of the industrial revolution sprang Those families cultivated privacy and encouraged a strenuous individualism two hallmarks of 19thcentury American smalltown life They regarded each child as a potential work of high art  to be fashioned and treasured as well as nourished attended loved The work of Philippe Aries in Centuries of Childhood has helped the Bergers construct their historical picture of a family life in which the child was a sign of Gods grace That grace was not they argue a mere ideological footnote for burghers obsessed with the acquisition of money property power Max Webers early 20thcentury ideas about the link between Protestantism and capitalism have prompted these two late 20thcentury sociologists to treat religion with considerable respect The fate of the bourgeoisie its ethic and its family form was very intimately tied to the fate of religion The Bergers express admiration for the Protestant version of Christianity Without it they say our bourgeois world would not have emerged in all its political and economic significance Only by accepting a higher form located outside the individual the family and society as a whole could there be a perceived unity between individual family and societal interests The Bergers remind us that the Roman Catholic Church of past centuries at least  was too communal and mystical to be of much use as a sanctioning light for what they call a bourgeoisProtestant morality so essential to the family life they like If the Bergers accord religion the dubious merit of commanding functional persuasiveness they scorn our contemporary secular knowledge as a sad if not stupid and banal effort to replace the Hebrew prophets and Jesus Christ with the dreary dicta of say sociology and psychology On this score they are relentless unyielding and on occasion brilliantly polemical They turn on their own kind with full appreciation of the irony  experts denouncing experts Meanwhile of course the Bergers offer still more authoritative statements to those millions of vulnerable souls who wait eagerly and humbly for the next words of wisdomhow to do this or that feat of parenting how to go through yet another hurdle called a stage or a period or a phase in a life whose mysteries many believe only important experts are qualified to reveal It is no minor matter this hold that socalled expertise has upon us The Bergers echo Christopher Lasch in their assault on an aspect of exalted American professionalism  the ridiculous words the intimidating phrases the selfserving arrogance The professionals of course have an interest in defining situations in such a way that their services appear necessary But the Bergers are not content with such remarks There are others even more severe in tone directed at a secular religion really  those popular gurus for American husbands and wives mothers and fathers The themes of War Over the Family are connected to a vigorous defense of the continuing moral worth of some important segments of the population The authors scorn the knowledge class and are skeptical of the liberation many have claimed or wanted to achieve They speak of a decadence syndrome that has weakened the personal and family life of far too many men women and children Yet they claim this kind of hope for us There are other classes notably the lower middle and working classes and large unassimilated ethnic groups that are much less marked by this decadence syndrome and in some instances not touched at all by it Such groups are the ones who take up the old symbolic bannners cast aside contemptuously by the decadent elite And they continue provocatively American society may well depend for its survival on the continuing influx of immigrants legal or illegal with a sturdy sense of family work and ambition If one is concerned for the future of America one might willingly exchange the entire membership of the American Sociological Association or for that matter the combined faculties of all the Ivy League universities for the people who cross the Rio Grande in any given year Well many will cheer maybe too readily at such a tough populist assault on lots of privileged pomposity and certainly applaud the back of the hand given to the personal liberation industry with its idiot expressions mindlessly mouthed and to the professional empires of experts and advicegivers all supported more and more we are reminded by public money And yet To array immigrants and working people against professors and their students and their students parents the welltodo American intelligentsia young and old is perhaps to do a substantial injustice to both groups This is the more suprising coming from two intelligent and thoughtful writers who aim in their book for a subtle examination of the character and prospects of the American family THE Bergers hold on for dear life to socalled working class people yet fail to mention their trials and tribulations  drinking the rising use of drugs child abuse and delinquency among youth Unemployment is not given its due as a terrible agent of family deterioration in such families Indeed it is nothing but condescending to idealize working people to simplify the complexity the inconsistencies and the ambiguities of their personal and political lives so that they become in sum a weapon to wield against those whose values we dislike Moreover the Bergers do not scorn elitists other than those who work in particular professions or universities They ignore those who own advertising agencies and the corporations that use them and Hollywood studios and television networks for instance They do not mention the executives and copywriters and scriptwriters who work in such places and who surely push us all toward decadence They make no provision for the possibility that in their family lives a good number of the elitists they ridicule might be the sensitive upright decent people that the Bergers applaud in this book Such rhetorical postures undermine the authors stated intention a summons to a middle ground and make less credible their valuable critique of a good deal that is wrongheaded in our contemporary culture
ONE WOMAN'S CHOICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/15/nyregion/one-woman-s-choice.html,The writer of this article requested anonymity A Fantasy I bought a cradle today Its antique pine with curving sides and the patina of mothers fingerprints along the edge When nudged it gently rocks as if in memory of many Nebraska babes who slept and cried in it I almost didnt buy it for fear of offending mother nature with my presumption of the future As I left the antiques show carrying this badge of maternity on my shoulder people called after me Good luck and When are you due and Enjoy using it I smiled from deep inside me While many women like Marilyn Levinson Tomorrow a Job Opinion Page flirt with the idea of going to work I long to be a homemaker To them working outside the home is a fantasy of excitement and dressing up in grownup clothes But Id gladly give up the hurried commute the humiliation of bosses the aggravation of deadlines the boredom between assignments and the subdivided paychecks Id play with my newborn child until it fell asleep then cradle and sing to it While the baby slept Id do another laundry dust or write that letter to my niece Id cook nutritious meals from scratch and sew tiny garments Id teach the baby to read and to garden and Id cut articles on computers from the newspapers for my busy husband to read Id fix that wobbly chair and patch the bedroom ceiling in the corner where we had the leak last year And if I craved fulfillment Id oil my rusty fingers with the greatest unctions of the 19th century the piano sonatas of Beethoven the

and once from a careeroriented woman who went her own way my friend may be especially angry but his indignation is typical These men think that if liberation has allowed us to choose untraditional paths the choice should be irreversible But our needs change As we fulfill one goal in life we go on to another A person may be overjoyed to work in the mailroom at age 22 but that same individual

away every day to bring home money for food and rent But how do you tell yourself you never had the children you wanted because circumstances never seemed just right Liberation does mean choice Choosing to be dependent if you wish or choosing to do it all if you have the courage and energy to give it a shot Or choosing a new direction if the old one isnt working out Liberation also means compromising when the choices are not simple knowing youll manage if you want something badly enough And my bearded 5foot10 friend Ill be a wiser mother now for having seen something of the world for no longer being awed by it or in such a hurry to conquer it Id love to have a husband to share this with and to support us while our children are young but it hasnt worked out that way I have to earn a living in order to nourish my body And I have chosen to complicate my life with a child because I also have to nourish my soul Besides I cant wait to see the look on my bearded friends face when he

BOOKS OF THE TIMES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/16/books/books-of-the-times-168349.html,STATECRAFT AS SOULCRAFT What Government Does By George F Will 186 Pages Simon  Schuster 1395 FOR a few passages in Statecraft as Soulcraft George F Will the erudite conservative columnist sounds like a closet liberal He chides other conservatives caught in the web of their careless antigovernment rhetoric for their grudging attitude toward Washingtons efforts to assist the less fortunate He reminds them that Disraeli and Bismarck conservatives both pioneered the welfare state  run to be sure on conservative principles with reliance on the private sector Much as Mr Will esteems the operations of free enterprise he esteems the ideal of community more and he laments the attenuation of Americas sense of community into thin gruel No fear however that Mr Will has changed his spots He remains a deepdyed conservative and his main strictures are directed at liberals who are quick to use the powers of the state to satisfy the hours desires but not to enhance our moral condition which he believes is gravely imperiled For liberalism seems to him to have become a doctrine of liberation often understood as wishfulness He is impatient with those who champion the rights of pornographers or the right to abortion yet deny that they are thereby imposing their own morality upon the nation The three horsemen of the Will apocalypse are pornography abortion and sexual permissiveness In places these essays which began life as lectures at Harvard in 1981 sound like Wills Familiar and Less Familiar Quotations Here may be found the quotable wisdom of everybody from Montaigne to Metternich from Mill to Mencken from Madison to Moynihan And Mr Will delivers some smart lines of his own As has been recently demonstrated in the worlds of art and academics if you redefine excellence recklessly enough there will be no shortage of excellence The transformation of the word elite into an epithet is symptomatic that society no longer understands that the political question is always which elites shall rule not whether elites shall rule There is much of the preacher in Mr Will A young body matures without much social intervention not so a young soul Viewing Western society as the flowering of ideas whose seeds have been planted over many centuries Mr Will a lapsed professor of political philosophy blames Hobbes and Machiavelli for much of the contemporary obsession with selfinterest narrowly conceived He places himself in a different line of thinkers from Aristotle to his special hero Edmund Burke who have appreciated the organic nature of a good society He dislikes modern politics for its readiness to accommodate to human passions rather than to encourage human potential In this nation preoccupied with the material he wants a politics that nurtures the spiritual Thats what he means by soulcraft Mr Wills style of conservatism though it can claim a long tradition has not been much honored in our time when conservatives have become mere guardians of privilege identified with the haves against the havenots He disdains such a role By his definition Conservatism is about the cultivation and so conservation of certain values or it is nothing One value high on his list is the gentling effect on mens ruder instincts of a benevolent government abetted by a free societys many mediating institutions The task he sets for true conservatives in our liberal bourgeois democratic society is not to make society inhospitable to pluralism but to make pluralism safe for society He takes his stand against radicals of every disposition who would destroy a societys arduously built foundations in behalf of some ideological program That way he warns lies totalitarianism He observes that many of the people who most avidly espouse theories explaining why our lives are out of control have in mind political arrangements that would enable them to control us Some readers are likely to find Mr Wills exhortations for moral uplift quaint and possibly a touch unsettling the history of official efforts to purify souls has been a bloody one Liberals in particular may be hard put to share his enthusiasm for school prayer or his abhorrence of abortion The refined sensibility that marks Mr Wills writing is more affronted by Times Square smut shops than by cuts in social programs One may hear in his call for a leadership that is able to inflict shortterm pain for longterm gain the smugness of those who are pretty sure they will gain painlessly in both the short and the long term Yet there is much for liberals to ponder here about the direction and limits of policies that they have embraced without due reflection or regard for their consequences And these welltempered essays remind us all liberals and conservatives together that there are other political divisions in the world today than those of left and right  and more important ones notably the division between intellectual tolerance and allornothing zealotry On this issue liberals should have no trouble joining George Will on the side of honest informed reasoned and civil discourse
COURTING HISPANIC VOTERS NOW A REAGAN PRIORITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/19/us/courting-hispanic-voters-now-a-reagan-priority.html,Discouraged by its failure to attract black voters the Republican Party is making an effort to reverse its slippage with another ethnic group that is viewed by party strategists as an awakening giant in American politics the nations 146 million Hispanic Americans Hispanic Americans constitute the countrys second largest and fastest growing minority and if present trends continue could replace blacks as the largest minority by the year 2000 a projection that has major implications for both parties as they compete for the political energy this group is capable of releasing Republican strategists have concluded that the Hispanic vote is not only essential to President Reagans reelection chances in 1984 if he should run but is also vital to the future of the party itself The priority Republicans have assigned to the courtship of Hispanic people is reflected by the role the President is playing in the campaign to reach out to this traditionally Democratic segment Mr Reagan will travel to Miami on Friday to address an audience of CubanAmericans who as a group are the most conservative and most Republican of Hispanic Americans This trip comes a week after Mr Reagan pardoned Eugenio Martinez one of the CubanAmericans convicted in the Watergate breakin Only the Beginning Earlier this month the President was in San Antonio Tex to participate in that citys Cinco de Mayo festival which celebrates an important defeat of the French by Mexican forces in 1862 Also in Texas Ricardo Hinojosa a 33yearold lawyer is to be sworn in on Saturday as a Federal district judge the first Hispanic person put on the Federal bench in that state by a Republican President This is only the beginning said one Reagan aide The President is going to be making a major effort to strengthen his position with Hispanic voters Were talking about a real effort to reach them on the issues not just a lot of public relations gimmicks that have the President wearing a sombrero eating tamales and doing the tango Republicans thought they scored a major breakthrough with this ethnic group in 1980 when Mr Reagan won more than 30 percent of the Hispanic vote the largest share ever captured by a Republican Presidential candidate In recent months however party leaders have been jolted by surveys showing that both Mr Reagan and his party are losing political ground among Hispanic voters California Texas and Florida A memorandum being circulated by the Republican National Committee says that the percentage of Hispanic Americans identifying themselves as Republican slipped six points last year alone and that Mr Reagans approval rating among Hispanic Americans is falling rapidly primarily because of high unemployment and other economic issues Republicans need to put an end to these trends now the memorandum says William Greener a spokesman for the Republican National Committee said the importance of the Hispanic vote in the 1984 Presidential election can be summed up in three words California Texas Florida Those three states account for onethird of the electoral vote needed to win the Presidency he said and each of the states has a large Hispanic population According to the 1980 census 59 percent of the nations Spanishspeaking population are of Mexican heritage 138 percent are Puerto Ricans most of whom reside in New York and 63 percent are Cubans a majority of whom are concentrated in south Florida The problem for both political parties is that Hispanic Americans are not a homogenous ethnic group CubanAmericans tend to be more antiCommunist and more conservative than most Mexicans and Puerto Ricans who are more likely to list social and economic issues as major concerns 755 Said To Vote Democratic Republican political strategists concede that expanding the partys Hispanic base will not be easy Although Hispanic Americans long have had one of the lowest voter turnout rates of the major ethnic groups those who do go to the polls vote overwhelmingly for Democratic candidates A survey conducted last year by the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation a conservative research group in Washington found that 755 percent of the Hispanic Americans polled said they usually voted Democratic while only 85 percent said they tended to vote Republican Despite this voting pattern the survey concluded the Democratic hold on Hispanics is far from firm because Hispanic people tend to be susceptible to appeals from conservatives regardless of party labels The Republicans need not win a majority of the Hispanic vote in order to keep themselves competitive the report said However the GOP must insure that the Democrats do not win the Hispanic vote by a margin of 3 to 1 Given the ideological bent of the group a conservative candidate who recognizes the link between culture and political attitudes should be able to do reasonably well among Hispanics Republicans believe they have such a candidate in Mr Reagan and they are counting on the President making inroads with Hispanic voters in 1984 as the first step toward building a solid Republican base with this group A Golden Opportunity The President and the Republican Party have a golden opportunity to gain Hispanic support said one White House official From the standpoint of basic values Reagan is closer to Hispanics than any of the Democratic candidates Were talking the most important things in a persons life the values of family religion education and neighborhood If the Hispanic people are allowed to see and hear Reagan as Reagan they will recognize this This political assumption is fine as far as it goes It is true that a majority of Hispanic people consider themselves to be moderate to conservative that they tend to support the Presidents antiCommunist initiatives in Central America and that they are close to his positions on such issues as crime abortion and prayer in the schools But even White House political strategists acknowledge that before such issues can work in Mr Reagans favor there must be a solid economic recovery Robert Brischetto research director for the Southwest Voter Registration and Education Project in San Antonio said It is true that Reagan made a cut into the Hispanic bloc in 1980 but if we look at recent polling results it is clear that Reagans policies dont come out too well with MexicanAmericans Unemployment according to all our polls is the major concern among Hispanics and if Reagan is going to have any chance of regaining Hispanic support the economy is going to have to turn around Signs From the White House Mr Brischetto said the White House recently asked his organization to provide it with the results of some of its surveys of Hispanic political attitudes Were getting signs from the White House that the President is going to move on some of the Hispanic issues such as bilingual education stronger enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and immigration policies he said These are issues that Reagan can safely take proHispanic positions on and I think hes likely to do that Representative Bill Richardson Democrat of New Mexico said that the Presidents only residual strength with Hispanic people in his district is on the issues of military spending and foreign policy especially Central America I dont see any other issues the President can use to recover with Hispanics said Mr Richardson who represents a district in which more than 37 percent of the voters are Hispanic American The Presidents problems with Hispanic Americans are reflected in the results of a 1982 New York Times CBS News Election Day poll of voters in contested House districts The survey found that 70 percent of the Hispanic Americans voted for Democratic candidates and 23 percent for Republicans Among all voters in that sample 55 percent cast ballots for Democrats and 42 percent for Republicans According to the poll 61 percent of the Hispanic voters blamed Mr Reagans policies for economic hard times and only 29 percent cited Democratic Administrations Among all voters the percentages were 38 and 49 respectively High Disapproval Rating Mr Reagans disapproval rating among this sample of Hispanic voters was 67 percent 23 percent higher than among voters as a whole Dr Tirso Del Junco a Los Angeles surgeon who heads the National Republican Hispanic Assembly said that Hispanic Americans were only beginning to vote on the basis of issues In the past they tended to vote Democratic because the Democrats had the political machines and the attractive candidates said Dr Junco The politicians would go into their communities and talk about welfare and little else That is changing More and more Hispanics are becoming concerned with the kind of issues that are important to most Americans  jobs taxes education crime and family values  and I think that is where our potential lies He said a reasonable goal for the Republican Party was to attract 30 to 35 percent of the Hispanic vote Hispanics he added need to be represented on both sides of the political aisle so they dont suffer the same fate as blacks who are trapped in the Democratic Party

THE SIREN'S STORY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/books/the-sirens-story.html,LORELEI TWO My Life With Conrad Aiken By Clarissa M Lorenz 231 pp Athens Ga The University of Georgia Press 1995LORELEI TWO was the name Conrad Aiken gave the second of his three wives in his autobiographical memoir Ushant The other wives were Lorelei One and Lorelei Three What he began in Ushant as an obscure account of himself as a kind of Ulysses threatened by sirens and shipwreck has become in this volume an explicit story of an actual disaster that of his second marriage as told by Lorelei Two One sees that the nickname was not as playful and teasing as it first appears Clarissa Lorenz reveals to any who are in doubt how harrowing it is to live with a genius especially if he is a dedicated poet She has heard praise of perfect wives such as Dostoyevskys and Carl Sandburgs who sublimated themselves to their mates When she met Bernard Shaw and listened to his monologues she marveled at Charlotte Shaws silence and the inner turmoil she must suffer in the great mans shadow Face to face with Thomas Hardys widow she wondered why so many literary mens wives have limp handshakes Unfortunately she says artists have a domestic streak and long for family life Thats the hitch Lorelei Two never mastered the difficult role of wife to Conrad Aiken They met in 1926 when she interviewed him for The Boston Evening Transcript in what Aiken called the fatal interview from which she walked away that foggy night telling herself Im in love She didnt know he was married and the father of three young children whom he would have to decide whether or not to abandon Nor did she know of the tragedy in his childhood and he didnt tell her It had happened one night in Savannah  Aiken was 11  when he heard his mothers halfstifled scream his father counting to three and two loud shots Alone he tiptoed into the dark room where the two bodies lay motionless and apart and finding them dead found himself possessed of them forever To the reader as well as to Clarissa Lorenz the question occurs why after a stormy threeyear trial period described as courtship through a wringer did she marry him There was after all no likelihood of happiness When she became pregnant he forced her to have an abortion In jealous rages similar to his fathers he accused her of promiscuity and wrote I shall be driven to murder Yet he divorced his first wife and the marriage took place in 1930 in Rutherford NJ with Mr and Mrs William Carlos Williams as witnesses At the marriage license window Aiken explained to the clerk that he was an adulterer Hell arent we all the clerk said The couple moved to England where without consulting her Aiken leased a house in Sussex Not only did his former wife who had remarried live in the county but they had occupied this very house with their children Eventually he returned there with Lorelei Three The place was damp and cold deathwatch beetles ticked in the wood yet Aiken insisted that nothing be changed I intend to run this marriage Is that clear he asked her Crystal clear she said Malcolm Lowry turned up from Cambridge University to spend his vacations with them as a paying guest he was Aikens protege and drinking companion with whom she associated sprees and catastrophe though Aiken reminded her that all good writers drank By the second year of their marriage he was saying I dont really need you any more and declared her to be incompetent slipshod embarrassing all the time withdrawing more and more into his poetry Aiken proved to be a shy and austere man whom unaccountably even to herself she deeply loved IN the turbulent summer of 1932 he feared he was going insane My fathers death should have freed me he said but it didnt Ive been dreaming again and again of killing myself I shouldnt really be alive On a night when the tensions were particularly bad she escaped the house and went to the movies Halfway through the picture she had a sudden premonition of danger and in panic ran all the way home to find that he had turned on the gas and was lying unconscious on the kitchen floor In Ushant he narrates the attempted suicide differently Lorelei Two having gone off for the evening to the cinema he had sat down to read an article by Wyndham Lewis that he found excruciatingly funny and with the gas rings and oven fizzing softly behind him he had awaited the end perfectly serene The reason she appeared in the nick of time he says was that she had already seen the second feature Why had I hung on so long she asked when the marriage was finally over There was the man who had fallen in love with her and there was the poet who found marriage intolerable I could never reconcile the tyrant with the poet who wrote Senlin and Punch  But did she remember Punchs forlorn outcry in the poem Was there in all this wide world never  One woman I might love forever She returned to America on Dec 11 1936 the day of Edward VIIIs abdication for the woman he loved More than 40 years later after Aikens death in 1973 she undertook to write this memoir from the wounding evidence in the diary she had kept of their life together a diary so infuriating to him when he found and read it that she began using shorthand She wrote the book I think not in spite but for clarification for justice even she wrote it to admit her own share in their problems His parting shot to her had been Its all your fault and you know it With these unhappy words echoing the reader wonders why Clarissa Lorenz chose to keep such painful recollections alive  and why confessional writing so often deals exclusively with hurts given and received One must also recall that Aiken in a veiled fashion elected to tell much of the story himself though it happened he says in Ushant Far away and long ago And so many ships between so many ships between
REAGAN ATTACKS U.S. SCHOOL AID IN JERSEY SPEECH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/22/us/reagan-attacks-us-school-aid-in-jersey-speech.html,President Reagan declared today that parents and local governments should be given greater control over schools and that teachers should be paid and promoted on the basis of their merit and competence In a commencement address at Seton Hall University Mr Reagan said most politicians had felt that more money was the solution to the nations educational problems Well they tried that approach and failed he said adding that educational quality had gone down despite spending increases in the last 10 years Mr Reagan said an increased Federal financial role was appropriate in one area tax credits to help parents pay for tuition in private schools He also called for channeling school aid into a voucher system so parents could choose between public and private schools for their children Both proposals are on the Presidents legislative agenda this year Radio Address on Military In his weekly radio address broadcast today Mr Reagan urged increased spending in another area the modernization of strategic nuclear forces with the MX and a smaller missile We must show the Soviets that were determined to spend what it takes to deter war he said I know that the paradox of peace through a credible military posture may be difficult for some people to accept he went on Some even argue that if we really want to reduce nuclear weapons we should simply stop building them ourselves That argument makes about as much sense as saying that the way to prevent fires is to close down the fire department Senator Howard M Metzenbaum of Ohio giving a Democratic response asserted that Mr Reagan despite his statements on cutting Government spending has now turned into an indiscriminate spender throwing billions at goldplated weapons that we dont need and that may not even work Receives Honorary Degree Mr Reagan wearing a blue academic gown received an honorary law degree from Seton Hall a Roman Catholic institution near Newark at an outdoor ceremony here Two thousand students and 3000 guests sitting in bleachers and folding chairs in a rainsoaked athletic field greeted him warmly A half dozen faculty members wearing white arm bands walked out as Mr Reagan began speaking and a few hecklers in the audience were quickly hushed up by their fellow graduates But the President was obviously pleased with the overall reception and used the occasion to reminisce about his own days as a college student and as a graduate hitchhiking around the Middle West looking for a job at a radio station in the Depression White House officials regarded Mr Reagans trip here as a political signal that contrary to some reports he was not writing off the Northeast and industrial Middle West particularly the middle class and workingclass Catholic community Mr Reagan appeared here with Labor Secretary Raymond J Donovan and Governor Kean and flew to Washington after his speech to spend the rest of the weekend at Camp David Md Urges Optimism on Jobs In his speech Mr Reagan urged students to be optimistic about job prospects despite the uncertain economy Dont get discouraged with the situation of the world he said Things are getting better And believe it we need you We need your youth we need your idealism we need your strength out there in what were trying to accomplish His comments about tuition tax credits and a voucher system drew applause However although the honorary degree citation referred to Mr Reagans firm opposition to abortion he did not mention that subject in his speech This was unusual because he usually mentions abortion in addressing Roman Catholic audiences Mr Reagans speech was similar to previous comments he has made in response to the recent report by the National Commission on Excellence in Education The report called for upgrading teachers and teaching time and for other steps that experts say would require more money Mr Reagan has dismissed that approach at least on the Federal level At his request Congress has cut school aid in the last two years and he favors further cuts for the next fiscal year Reagan Quotes Califano The commission report linked the decline in American education standards to changes in population patterns the breakup of families and other factors But Mr Reagan again focused on what he calls Federal intrusion in schools He quoted Joseph A Califano Jr Secretary of Health Education and Welfare under President Carter whom he cited as a cardcarrying liberal in warning against the threat to academic freedom posed by an enlarged Federal role in education Well I couldnt agree more Mr Reagan said The road to better education for all our people simply cannot be paved with more and more recycled tax dollars collected redistributed and overregulated by Washington bureaucrats The Presidents proposals for tuition tax credits and vouchers have been criticized by teachers unions and Democrats as hurting public education Mr Reagan again called for the reestablishment of organized voluntary prayer in school noting with a smile I know that this idea is not too popular in some supposedly sophisticated circles White House aides say Mr Reagan will make more speeches and announcements on education They say they fear the Democrats could make political gains by arguing that his school spending cuts threaten the next generations ability to cope with modern problems
POLAND'S HARD LIFE FINDS MORE WOMEN CHOOSING ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/23/style/poland-s-hard-life-finds-more-women-choosing-abortion.html,The stand of the Roman Catholic Church on abortion in this devoutly religious country as elsewhere in the world is quite clear it is not permissible But many estimates by Polish experts find that the abortion rate in Poland is now higher than the countrys birthrate They attribute that situation largely to increasing food shortages and the critical housing situation a combination that forces some Poles to put economic reality before religion But doctors here say there is another major reason for the rising abortion rate abortion is used as a method of birth control The few available means of chemical contraception here are horrible repulsive and on top of that uncertain according to one gynecologist There are three kinds of oral contraceptives here but they are hard to find and one specialist said They are good for mares not people There are a few foreign contraceptives for sale in the hardcurrency stores but most women either do not know about them or do not have the foreign currency needed to buy them A Swedish device for example costs 7 which is more than onethird of the average monthly salary The Polish Government says officially that 200000 to 300000 abortions are performed in the country each year But Polish doctors clergy and demographics experts point out that this is the same figure given by the Government 20 years ago and does not reflect the increasing economic hardships Poles face today Instead these experts say the true abortion figure is much higher  from 800000 to 1 million At the same time the Government says that 702000 children were born in 1982 in this country of 36 million In this largely Catholic country where the church wields an almost unchallengeable influence over daily life an increasing number of women are able to base their childbearing decisions not strictly on religion but on personal need The reported abortion boom is a striking example of the nature of Catholicism in Poland Religion numerous sociologists have noted is for many far more a matter of nationalistic symbolism and ritual than it is a strict adherence to church doctrine I think God understands me and is really on my side said one young Catholic a writer in explaining her decision to have an abortion I felt it much more honorable to feel guilt for a while and avoid a lifelong disaster she said If wed married we would have had no apartment and I would have had to quit my studies I would hate him and he would hate me too The writer sounded a common theme here There are few young couples in Poland who live by themselves most share already cramped quarters with parents or other relatives Waiting lists for apartments are staggeringly long In some cities the wait can be 18 years or more The church is keenly aware of this and also of the financial difficulty of providing for unplanned children As a result several churchbacked groups that seek to persuade women not to have abortions offer them financial and emotional support People say they have no money no apartment of their own dont want to give up their standard of living said the Rev Stanislaw Malkowski a Warsaw priest who devotes most of his time to Gaudium Vitae an antiabortion group he helped to found So I may say to them I will help you The help is in different forms the priest said As an example he pointed to four boxes in his living room that contained clothing and foodstuffs sent from Iceland for women he had talked out of having abortions A Mother Is Grateful Four generations of one family that receives such aid live in a oneroom apartment on Kasprowicza Street The baby is now six months old and the mother says she is grateful to the priest for changing her mind She was unwanted the priest translated for the mother but now she is the most beloved Father Malkowski reflecting the church position is sympathetic to the economic pressures on people here He advocates what he calls natural family planning rather than abortion or any use of contraceptives Polands abortion rate in fact is lower than those of other countries in the Eastern bloc Hungary for example has a higher one as does the Soviet Union But many here say the Communists encourage abortion because with so many women working they want to reduce the number of threeyear paid maternity leaves Abortion here is quick and easy performed free of charge at the state hospitals with a threeday medical leave provided Some say that with the party faithful on the watch in their work places the pressure not to have children can be tremendous When I was pregnant with my fourth child they made my life hell Miroslawa T said of her fellow workers at a Warsaw factory I heard them whisper That one is pregnant again The state will have to pay again But the worst was when my boss said My dear it cannot be so that others work for you all the time  The State Offers Family Planning There is only one official organization offering family planning advice and not all of its initiatives are successful During its school for the engaged program recently a lecture on contraception was attended by only a journalist and two elderly women who said they had come because their adult children were too busy A psychologist recently surveyed 150 women here who were awaiting abortions The results showed that more than 80 percent were married and that most already had children Six of the women gave medical reasons for the operation but more than half cited financial problems or not having their own homes When Bozena M a 24yearold Catholic with one child became pregnant again she decided to have an abortion She and her husband a truck driver with a monthly wage of about 120 live with her parents and her sister in a tiny Warsaw apartment But her gynecologist notified another doctor a volunteer with the Pro Familia society which opposes abortion and that doctor went to her home to persuade her otherwise She finally agreed to have the child on one condition that the doctor use his influence to expedite her request for an apartment Shortly afterward the following conversation took place at the Pro Familia headquarters I am glad I persuaded you the doctor said Not 100 percent Bozena M reminded him It all depends on the meeting at the housing office I will not expose my second child to such an uncertain life
MATCH MADE BY COMPUTER IN ADOPTIONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/23/us/match-made-by-computer-in-adoptions.html,Gilbert needed a mother Beverlie Blackwell wanted a child He has delayed motor development She said she could love a child who was not perfect A computer was fed the information and matched the two and a social worker decided they were meant to be a family And last month Miss Blackwell and Gilbert became the first parent and child brought together by the National Adoption Exchange Time is critical in the life of a child said Marlene Piasecki director of the Philadelphiabased organization Knowing that this child was placed quickly with a mother who will care for him makes all the difference Established in October 1982 with a 350000 grant from the Department of Health and Human Services the National Adoption Exchange is the first nationwide effort to expedite the adoption of the more than 50000 difficulttoplace children by computerizing listings of both children and prospective parents Although the definition varies by time and location children who are difficult to place are often members of minority groups are older have physical or emotional handicaps or are in groups of siblings who want to remain together A Way to Increase Volume We felt that using uptodate technology we could increase the volume of listings we could handle and expand the pool from which to choose families for these children said Carolyn Johnson executive director of the Adoption Center of the Delaware Valley which operates the exchange The names of children are given to the exchange by state and private adoption agencies that have custody of them Prospective parents who have been cleared by a social worker can register themselves with the exchange or go through an agency In a second match approved recently the exchange placed a 13yearold girl from Ohio named Tina with Rick and Becky Fah of Silverton Idaho Tina is a healthy teenager with a desire to be a cheerleader and a longing for a permanent family Her caseworker at Montgomery County Ohio Children Services felt that Tinas age and the fact that she had been in foster care most of her life made her difficult to place The agency registered her with the National Adoption Exchange and approved the Fahs as her adoptive parents Mr and Mrs Fah who have a 15yearold son realize that it will take time for Tina to feel secure in her new environment Take It Step by Step We told her that this was her home and she was stuck with us Mrs Fah said Shes had a tough go of it Were all going to have to take it step by step Mrs Johnson who has adopted three children said the key to the exchange was volume The idea is not to be afraid of large numbers she said The computer deals with the volume and cleans up the paper work to free people to work with people According to adoption authorities more people are expressing interest in adopting children with special needs Part of the reason they suggest is that fewer healthy white babies are available because of better birth control methods more liberal abortion laws and societys greater acceptance of single parents People are becoming aware that the healthy white infant is scarce said Nancy Troian the caseworker for 1yearold Gilbert at the Childrens Home Society of Florida We try to show them that there are other children out there who need them After the formalities were completed Miss Blackwell flew to Florida from her home in Pittsburgh and met the child whom she has renamed Christopher Keith She said that to ease her sons adjustment to his new home she had bought a dark wood crib like the one he had been using in his foster home Dont Have Any Delusions She has also looked into infant stimulation programs in her area so her new son can continue physical therapy to correct the rigidity in his upper body I dont have any delusions of grandeur that Im his savior said Miss Blackwell who lives with her parents and younger brother and works for the Allegheny Department of Health Ill do whatever I have to to help him grow into a healthy child A few years ago Miss Blackwell would not have been considered a candidate to adopt an infant She is 41 old by many adoption agency standards and is single and black In some agencies Christopher would not have been considered a special needs case Being black makes him harder to place but he is a baby which makes him more desirable and his disabilities are minor We feel it is up to the local agencies to define what is hard to place in their region and which children need to be listed nationally Mrs Piasecki said We are in no way attempting to be the only adoption registry she said We tell adoption agencies to list children with their state exchanges in addition to us 120 Children Registered Since midJanuary when its computer system was put into place the National Adoption Exchange has received the registrations of about 210 families and 120 children from 44 states the District of Columbia and Puerto Rico More than 50 matches have been generated by the computer and forwarded to the home agencies which are responsible for approving each adoption The exchange hopes to handle 1000 children and 2500 families in its first year It charges no fees now but plans to begin charging the agencies involved At first people were apprehensive because they thought everything would be handled by computer said Joyce Hart an adoption coordinator at the exchange She is one of three people who review the computerized matches decide which should be sent on to the adoption agencies and follow up on those cases We feed the information into the terminal and evaluate what it computes Miss Hart said The computer expedites the paper work but we still handle the human needs
VETERANS' LOBBIES RETAIN TAX STATUS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/24/us/veterans-lobbies-retain-tax-status.html,The Supreme Court today upheld the Federal Governments preferential tax treatment of organizations that lobby for veterans The Court ruled unanimously that Congress did not violate the Constitution by giving veterans groups a privilege that it did not give to other nonprofit charitable organizations Under the Internal Revenue Code veterans groups that engage in lobbying retain their eligibility to receive taxdeductible contributions while all other nonprofit groups forfeit this tax benefit if they engage in substantial lobbying The decision written by Associate Justice William H Rehnquist overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals here That court ruled last year that the preferential treatment of veterans groups violated the constitutional right of other nonprofit groups to equal protection of the law Ruling Gave Congress a Choice The appellate courts opinion gave Congress the choice of either extending the veterans lobbying privilege to the other groups or making the veterans groups subject to the same restrictions as the other organizations The appellate courts opinion created an uproar among veterans organizations 35000 of which have been granted taxexempt status by the Internal Revenue Service The Justice Department appealed the decision to the Supreme Court arguing that Congress should be free to express the nations special gratitude to veterans by giving their lobby special privileges There are 330000 other nonprofit organizations that are eligible for taxexempt status as long as they do not use taxdeductible contributions for lobbying The veterans lobbying privilege was challenged by Taxation With Representation a Washingtonbased organization that was denied the taxexempt status it sought from the Internal Revenue Service because it intended to lobby on tax issues Nonprofit organizations generally regard the ability to receive taxdeductible contributions as vital to their survival In its lawsuit Taxation With Representation argued that the lobbying restriction violated both its First Amendment right to free speech and its Fifth Amendment right to equal protection The Federal District Court here ruled for the Government on both counts Then the Court of Appeals rejected the First Amendment challenge but ruled that the restriction did violate the equal protection guarantee Both issues were before the Supreme Court today in Regan v Taxation With Representation No 812338 Addressing the free speech question first Justice Rehnquist said the fact that Taxation With Representation had a First Amendment right to lobby did not give it a corresponding right to have its free speech subsidized with Federal funds Both tax exemptions and taxdeductibility are a form of subsidy that is administered through the tax system Justice Rehnquist said In refusing to grant taxdeductible status to nonveteran lobbying groups he added Congress has merely refused to pay for the lobbying out of public monies Justice Rehnquist continued We have held in several contexts that a legislatures decision not to subsidize the exercise of a fundamental right does not infringe the right Medicaid Abortion Ruling Cited One of the precedents he cited was the Supreme Courts 1980 ruling that Congress need not pay for abortions for poor women under the Medicaid program On the equal protection question Justice Rehnquist said Congress needed only to show a rational basis for giving veterans groups a favored tax status Our country has a longstanding policy of compensating veterans for their past contributions by providing them with numerous advantages he said referring in a footnote to veterans employment preferences and educational benefits He concluded This policy has always been deemed to be legitimate The 35000 taxexempt veterans groups include the local posts of major national organizations such as the American Legion and the Veterans of Foreign Wars The Supreme Court also dealt with these matters today Miranda Warnings The Justices agreed to decide whether a New York City police officer had violated the constitutional rights of a robbery suspect by asking him where he had thrown his gun without first giving him the socalled Miranda warnings The officer had caught the fleeing suspect in a Queens supermarket and noticing his empty shoulder holster asked him where the gun was Over there the suspect said indicating a carton where the officer found the gun The trial judge his action affirmed by the New York appellate courts refused to allow either the statement or the gun itself to be introduced as evidence District Attorney John J Santucci of Queens filed the appeal NY v Quarles No 821213 arguing that the Miranda rule was not violated and that in any event the gun itself should be permitted as evidence Jurisdiction The Court ruled unanimously that Congress acted within its constitutional authority in enacting a 1976 law that permits foreign corporations to bring commercial lawsuits against foreign governments in United States courts The decision Verlinden v Central Bank of Nigeria No 81920 overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York That court barred a breach of contract suit by a Dutch corporation against the Government of Nigeria ruling that the Federal courts could not constitutionally assume jurisdiction over lawsuits by foreign plaintiffs against foreign governments In an opinion by Chief Justice Warren E Burger the Court held that the Foreign Sovereign Immunities Act of 1976 met constitutional standards in opening Federal courts to certain types of foreign suits But the Court did not resolve the Dutch lawsuit sending the case back to the lower courts for further proceedings The Justice Department and several business groups including the National Association of Manufacturers and the Chamber of Commerce of the United States had urged the Court to overturn the lower court decision Forfeiture The Court ruled 8 to 1 that the Customs Service did not violate a narcotics suspects due process rights by seizing the 8850 in undeclared currency she was carrying through the Los Angeles International Airport and holding the money for 18 months before filing a formal forfeiture proceeding The opinion by Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor overturned a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit which ruled that the delay was so unreasonable as to be unconstitutional The decision US v 8850 No 811062 did not provide a blanket rule for customs seizures concluding instead that each delay had to be analyzed on a casebycase basis Associate Justice John Paul Stevens filed a dissenting opinion

REAGAN CIVIL RIGHTS POLICIES ARE DEFENDED AND CRITICIZED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/30/us/reagan-civil-rights-policies-are-defended-and-criticized.html,President Reagans top civil rights enforcement officer said today that racism was at the root of affirmative action programs but a black leader charged that the Administration acts as if the white male is the minority William Bradford Reynolds Assistant Attorney General for Civil Rights defended the Administrations efforts to set a color blind course on civil rights assuring that hiring and advancement programs preserve the rights of both blacks and whites But Benjamin L Hooks executive director of the Nation Association for the Advancement of Colored People and Vernon E Jordan Jr former president of the National Urban League argued that affirmative action must be pursued to redress centuries of bias against blacks and women The Reagan Administration acts as if the white male is the minority said Mr Hooks who was interviewed along with Mr Jordan and Mr Reynolds on the ABC News program This Week Courts School Bias Ruling Cited Mr Reynolds also said that the Supreme Court ruling last week denying tax breaks to schools that practice racial bias was consistent with Mr Reagans view in its immediate result but said that its ramifications were fairly ominous We think those schools should be denied taxexempt status he said The concern he said is that under the ruling the Internal Revenue Service not Congress will have the authority to make those public policy decisions about who gets tax breaks The longterm ramifications of that I think are fairly ominous he said suggesting that the IRS one day could deny exemptions to hospitals for their position on abortion to singlesex high schools or even to churches that support a nuclear freeze Mr Hooks and Mr Jordan took Mr Reagan to task for actions across the board including his nominations last week for the replacement of three of six members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights The move will mean five of the commissioners will be Reagan appointees Concern for Independence Mr Jordan said two of Mr Reagans nominations to the commission last year both of whom failed to win Senate confirmation were an insult to black intelligence and also called the latest maneuvers the polarization or politicization of the Civil Rights Commission The wholesale change gives the impression the commission is no longer an independent body he said and opens the door to charges the new appointees would be patsies for the Administration Also Mr Hooks said affirmative action programs opposed by the Administration as quotas were necessary in a society that has openly discriminated against a portion of its community Mr Reynolds insisted that rather than ignoring the plight of blacks the Administration was seeking to defend all Americans and was vigorously enforcing the law He said the Supreme Court had directed the Government to remove discrimination from this country root and branch That means he said that we cannot tolerate a society where we are going to condemn discrimination on the one hand and condone discrimination on the other hand To use race to get beyond racism make no more sense than to prescribe alcohol to get beyond alcoholism Asked what was wrong with a color blind approach Mr Hooks responded Its wrong because its stupid and he listed preferences given to other special groups such as veterans the handicapped and flood victims The overriding feeling the overriding impression in this society said Mr Jordan who has called for Mr Reynoldss resignation is that this is not an Administration that is a guardian or the protector of the people Mr Reynolds replied This is the Administration that has brought more criminal prosecutions against police brutality against Ku Klux Klan activities against racial violence against involuntary servitude than any other Administration in the history of the civil rights division He also cited his work in almost singlehandedly fighting off bids to dilute minority voting strength in Congressional reapportionment following the 1980 census This was Mr Hookss first public appearance since the chairman of the NAACP Margaret Bush Wilson suspended him May 18 Mrs Wilson reinstated him under pressure on Thursday and on Saturday a majority of board members voted to curb her powers and asked for her resignation
SEXOLOGY STRUGGLING TO ESTABLISH ITSELF AMID WIDE HOSTILITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/31/science/sexology-struggling-to-establish-itself-amid-wide-hostility.html,Sexologists are struggling to enhance the scientific credibility and public acceptance of their research at a time when sexual studies and sex education in this country are under increasing attack This became clear last week when more than 1000 sexologists convened here for the sixth World Congress of Sexology billed as the largest gathering of sexologists ever held Speakers and panel chairmen repeatedly lamented that their field is suffering from a conservative political backlash that often portrays sex research and education as little more than pornography and sex therapy as almost illicit The organizers tried unsuccessfully to get official welcoming messages from the White House and the Mayors office ordinarily a routine courtesy but neither political office would oblige They said it was inappropriate complained William A Grantzig president of the organizing committee This is not porn city Some of the talks are even boring But at the conference itself it was not always easy to separate the science from more questionable fare While some sessions heard sober papers from such recognized scholars as Wardell B Pomeroy an associate of the late Alfred C Kinsey William H Masters and Virginia JohnsonMasters pioneer explorers of the physiology of sex Mary Calderone a muchhonored expert on family planning and sex education Helen Singer Kaplan a psychiatrist and psychologist who treats sexual disorders and John Money an expert on gender identity from Johns Hopkins University other sessions were devoted to Xrated films or the views of authors of bestselling books A bevy of pornographic movie stars even showed up one night to mingle with the participants and promote their industry In the exhibit hall textbooks could be ordered alongside video cassettes of adult movies and the Journal of Sex Research a leading scholarly journal in the field was being promoted next to a booth distributing swingers magazines that carry pictures of nude people in blatant sexual poses seeking partners for a variety of explicit purposes Its a frustrating experience said Erwin J Haeberle cochairman of the scientific committee for the conference who complains that sexologists are often forced to accept money from disreputable sources because the Government and private foundations are reluctant to finance much sexology research and most academic institutions shy away from the field Im not one who opposes taking the Devils money to do the Lords work he added The conference dealt with an array of topics that seemed only loosely related ranging from theories of orgasm to prostitution in Peking from 1912 to 1950 The participants were even more varied They included a wide range of doctors psychologists psychiatrists biologists physiologists humanists sociologists anthropologists animal experts educators authors social workers marriage counselors nurses and philosophers or virtually anyone who studies or deals with sexuality on a professional basis Dr Haeberle who is director of historical research at the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality a tiny degreegranting school in San Francisco acknowledged in an interview that sex research presents a confusing picture because it embraces a wide variety of people and methodologies pursuing a wide variety of subjects It is not a science with one definite object and one method of studying it he said Some workers in the area are sound scientists he said while others make sensational claims on flimsy grounds In Total Confusion The field is in total confusion he added Its like the state criminology was in 80 years ago when it was just getting started But I would still call sexology a science an interdisciplinary effort where the natural sciences and the humanities have to work together And Im a great believer that sexology in spite of all the obstacles will clarify itself and crystallize as a legitimate science Sexology was defined by Dr Haeberle in an openingday address as the theoretical study of sex based on objective and systematic observations of love and reproduction He distinguished it from erotology the practical study of lovemaking as embodied for example in the Hindu love manuals or Alex Comforts Joy of Sex The field of sexology first took form in Germany some 75 years ago with publication of the first sexology journal in 1908 followed by the founding of the first society for sexology in 1913 Dr Haeberle said But the Nazis virtually obliterated the fledgling science by driving its pioneers mostly German and Austrian Jews into exile burning their books and disbanding their societies Sexology has not yet fully recovered After the war American scholars took the lead and have tried increasingly to bring scientific rigor to the field As we look back over the years said Shirley Zussman a New York City sex counselor and therapist in a featured address what has emerged most dramatically in the area of sexuality has been the scientific dimension The pioneer was the late Alfred C Kinsey who performed interview surveys of sexual behavior in American males and females in the late 1940s and early 1950s thus breaking the barriers against empirical sexual research in this country Dr Kinsey is still the bench mark by which many sexologists measure their work and his surveys are being extended by modern scholars in the field John Gagnon of the State University of New York at Stony Brook for example told the conference that his continuing analysis of data from a 1967 survey of college students found that the incidence and frequency of masturbation appears unrelated to other sexual conduct or to social and academic adjustment despite popular beliefs to the contrary Masters and Johnson Studies The next great trailblazers according to Dr Zussman were William Masters and Virginia Johnson who studied the physiology of human sexual response under laboratory conditions and devised new behavioral treatments for sexual problems their latest treatment results were announced here last week On the eve of the conference Bernie Zilbergeld a California psychologist charged that claims of success in treatment by Masters and Johnson techniques were inflated because their criteria for success were set too low But other leading therapists here said the treatment techniques seem to work in a variety of clinical settings and that the physiological work remains a landmark Nobody is happy about Zilbergelds cheap shots said Helen Kaplan New technologies are reshaping the field of sexology pushing it inexorably from a largely psychological perspective toward more emphasis on physiology Monitoring devices attached to the penis at night have become an important diagnostic tool in determining whether male erectile difficulties are organic or psychological And devices that measure lubrication and blood flow in the vagina are important research tools for determining whether women are sexually aroused by various stimuli even when unaware of the arousal Sexual Responses of Fetuses Ultrasound pictures of fetuses in the womb have produced dramatic new evidence of the beginnings of sexual arousal Dr Calderone said she had received three sonograms  pictures made inside the body by highfrequency sound waves  of fetal erections indicating to her that sexual response is a birthright that functions during the entire life span You cant say Its something that happens much later in life so we wont teach you about sex until youre 18  she said Pharmacology is also exerting an impact on sexology Dr Money has already used a drug to turn desire off in sex offenders and Dr Kaplan predicts that a drug to do the opposite a highly effective chemical aphrodisiac will come along any year now Sexology has made some advances toward academic respectability Several scholarly journals and organizations have been founded since the mid1960s And several universities including New York University the University of Pennsylvania four institutions in Europe and another in Canada conduct educational programs in sexology or human sexuality This is not a flybynight operation showing pornographic movies to the students says Bernard Goldstein a professor of biology who headed the program at San Francisco State High quality programs are available at the university level But no major American university awards a doctorate in sexology says Dr Haeberle The only doctoral awards in this country are granted by the Institute for Advanced Study in San Francisco which has been refused accreditation by the Western Association of Colleges but has just received accreditation by the less prestigious National Association of Private Nontraditional Schools and Colleges Several speakers at the conference said sexology was on the upswing in the late 1960s and early 1970s driven in part by the womens movement the homosexual liberation movement attention from news organizations changing public attitudes scientific advances and court decisions easing restrictions on abortion and on obscene materials But in the late 1970s and early 1980s they said development of the field has slowed because of budget cuts and a more conservative political climate Most remained optimistic however Dr Pomeroy assured his audience that the march toward greater freedom and openness in dealing with sexual matters was so inexorable that they would ultimately prevail if not in two years then surely in 20
"NEW YORK, JERSEY AND CONNECTICUT LEGISLATORS FACE KEY ISSUES",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/05/31/nyregion/new-york-jersey-and-connecticut-legislators-face-key-issues-201066.html,Connecticuts General Assembly must adjourn by June 8 according to the State Constitution and legislative leaders say they are determined to meet that goal  even if it takes all summer The problem is that the legislature is in a close race with the calendar to round up enough votes by the official adjournment day to approve a state budget and a package of new and higher taxes to pay for it No budget means no adjournment according to Gov William A ONeill He has said that if the regular legislative session ends June 8 without a budget he will call the lawmakers back for an immediate special session The session will end the Speaker of the House Irving J Stolberg a New Haven Democrat said Friday Whether we will have a budget I honestly do not know We will try Votes for Taxes Fall Short The Appropriations Committee has proposed a 36 billion spending plan for the fiscal year starting July 1 which is 435 million more than the Governor requested in February But the leaders of the Democratic majorities in the Senate and House have had trouble finding the votes to approve the taxes to balance the budget With the Republican minorities vowing to oppose most tax increases the Democratic leaders need Democratic votes  19 in the Senate and 76 in the House  to pass a tax package Some Democrats have held out for a state personal income tax But faced with the Governors almost daily pledges to veto an income tax legislative sentiment is belatedly beginning to shift toward other tax increases Senate Democrats are nearing final agreement on a 272 million tax package which would include a nonbinding statewide referendum in November to see whether Connecticut voters want an income tax House Leader Dislikes Senate Plan However Mr Stolberg has strong misgivings about the Senate proposal which would impose a 35 percent sales tax on personal and professional services including medical services tax the interest income of people earning more than 50000 a year raise the corporation profits tax to 115 percent from 10 percent increase the business services tax to 75 percent from 35 percent and raise the tax on cigarettes by 5 cents a pack Some legislators are already resigned to a special session where they said the heat of summer the vacation season and the July 1 start of a new fiscal year may be the elements that finally force a fiscal agreement There is no airconditioning in the cavernous House and Senate chambers Have you ever been here in the summer Representative Janet Polinsky a Waterford Democrat and cochairman of the Appropriations Committee said with a grimace the other day Any new tax increases would come on top of a smaller tax package passed in March and signed by the Governor That measure raised the state excise tax on gasoline by 3 cents a gallon and imposed the states 75 percent sales tax on meals costing less than 1 and on seed and fertilizer for nonfarm use With only seven working days left the rush is on to try to resolve several major nonbudgetary issues such as these  Toll removal Legislation actively sought by Fairfield County legislators to phase out the 35cent tolls on the Connecticut Turnpike is awaiting action in the House If approved the measure would still have to go to the Senate  Plant closings The House has passed and sent to the Senate a measure backed by the Governor requiring companies to pay workers health insurance benefits for up to 90 days after closing or relocating a plant out of state  Drunken driving Various measures advocated by many legislators to increase the penalities for drunken driving are pending in the House and also must be considered by the Senate  Interstate banking Both houses have approved and sent to the Governor legislation allowing Connecticut banks to merge with banks in the other New England states but not with those in New York Although the states fiscal problems have dominated events since the General Assembly convened Jan 5 some completed actions by the legislature have been significant State Opposes Big Trucks Connecticut became the first state to enact a ban on doubletrailer trucks in defiance of a recent Federal law permitting the larger trucks on the nations major highways The Federal Government filed suit Friday to overturn the law The legislature also passed and Mr ONeill signed a measure limiting the cost that electricity consumers would pay for construction of the Millstone 3 nuclear power plant which is to be completed in 1986 Lawmakers said Connecticut was the first state to try to legislate limits on the rising cost of nuclear power plant construction Other hotly contested measures have fallen by the wayside during the long hours of debate The Senate rejected an increase in the states minimum drinking age to 21 from 19 The House killed a measure that would have allowed terminally ill patients to order the removal of lifesupport systems The Senate defeated a bill that would have required parents to be notified in advance of a minors abortion The House killed a measure barring discrimination against homosexuals Lawmakers Guided by ONeill For Mr ONeill a Democrat who was elected to a full fouryear term last November the legislature has generally followed his lead on several key issues So far at least his adamant opposition to a state income tax has forced legislators to search for alternative tax increases His legislation dealing with plant closings appears likely to prevail despite strong opposition from organized labor which wanted companies moving out of state to be required to give advance notice to their workers Up to now the Governor has signed into law 243 bills sent to him by the legislature He has yet to veto his first bill

Presidential candidacy say he is running against the grain Detractors say he is running on empty The former Florida Governor says reporters should quit worrying about where he is running in the polls Im not always last in the polls sometimes Im next to last Mr Askew recently told a group of reporters who were pressing him about his status as the darkest horse in the Democratic field Youd always like to be a little better in them but I dont worry about polls because they have been notoriously irrelevant in terms of whos going to win Mr Askew said The press has a propensity to spend a lot of time dwelling on them If you ever went back and read some of your stories on what you were thinking prior to some of the others you might find that those prognostications werent that accurate But I dont find many of you going back and reading any The note of anger is genuine Increasingly Mr Askew is voicing the frustration shared privately by other secondtier candidates in the sixman Democratic field They blame the press and the polltakers for skewing the campaign process by judging the candidates on their national name recognition Rated a Top Governor The problem is especially acute for Reubin ODonovan Askew the only candidate in the field who is not a man of Washington Although he served here as United States Trade Representative under President Carter Mr Askews candidacy and his political identity are based on his governorship from 1971 to 78 Since few people in the nation know why Mr Askew was chosen one of the 10 best governors of the century in a Harvard Univeristy study he is confronted at every turn by doubts that voters will accept another unheralded Southerner Yet Democratic insiders have long touted Mr Askew as the New South leader that Mr Carter appeared to be While the Georgian opposed busing for example Mr Askew put his prestige on the line to defeat an antibusing amendment to the state constitution In Florida Mr Askews principled stands and teetotaling habits earned him the nickname Reubin the Good The states press cheered his battles against political corruption and editorialists suggested in 1976 that Mr Askew would make a better Presidential candidate then than Mr Carter But things reached a sour turn a few days ago when Mr Askew snapped at a group of dubious Florida reporters Later he said I try not to grow weary of it but its amusing when I think of how many of the same reporters kept asking me badgering me almost at every news conference from 74 to early 76 Why wouldnt I run for President Now when I announce that I want to run for President they say What makes you think you can get elected President  Only Democrat Against Abortion Mr Askews answer to that question rests on a triad of practical considerations  timing energy money management  and a fourth element embodied in his againstthegrain message Although a liberal by Southern standards he has placed himself well to the right of the Democratic field on some issues He is the only Democrat opposing groups favoring choice on abortion He is the strongest opponent of organized labors call for protectionist legislation He said his strong ties to the business community would allow him to end the adversarial relationship between business and labor by bringing the two together in a forged consensus In sum Mr Askew like Senator Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina is running a candidacy intended to make former Vice President Walter F Mondale and other liberals appear to be captives of the partys special interests Of this approach favoring a generalized centrist appeal Mr Askew said The key to it is the willingess to lose some votes by not trying to give everybody their full agenda in order to have credibility particularly with business and labor and not be so overly obligated to each when I assume the office that Im not free to challenge both on behalf of my constituency Hopes for Super Tuesday The weak point in a strategy that defies the party activists is that they play a strong role in selecting the 3924 convention delegates 46 percent of whom will be chosen in caucuses or appointed under party rules In 1980 only 29 percent were selected by these methods Despite the lesser importance of primaries in 1984 Mr Askew believes that the popular vote will put him into the running and he expects a major breakthrough when Florida Georgia and Alabama elect 287 delegates on March 13 the first super Tuesday of the campaign I then unquestionably will be perceived as the candidate that I think Im going to be said Mr Askew and thats when we start talking about the New Yorks and the Californias With the fatalism of a man of whom little is expected Mr Askew said he intended to rise or fall with this high risk strategy Thats the challenge to me he concluded My ambition is not to get elected President of the United States per se My ambition is to get elected President of the United States in such a way where I can freely govern and theres a difference Since announcing on Feb 23 Mr Askew has been haunted by the suspicion that his true ambition is to be elected Vice President He has responded with Shermanlike statements  I dont intend under any circumstances to accept it  that could prove awkward if the convention decided a 54yearold Floridian born in Oklahoma would be a fine ticketbalancer No Pollsters or Consultants To those who denigrate his chances Mr Askew cites his two Florida gubernatorial campaigns as the model for his national effort There too he started as a lightly regarded dark horse who ran a frugal campaign and held back his money for a late media blitz That is Mr Askews plan for 1984 His paid staff of 25 is the smallest in the field He has hired no polltaker or consultants James Bacchus a 34yearold Miami lawyer serves as press secretary speech writer issue coordinator political thinker and traveling companion Such economizing has enabled Mr Askew to build a 425000 cash surplus but it has also given the campaign a bootstrap quality that borders on amateurism At the Massachusetts state convention for example delegates poked fun at the Floridians low voteperpig ratio after he threw a 5000 barbecue and got only 12 votes out of 4000 in the straw ballot I think Mr Baccus said ruefully that people misinterpreted that barbecue Without professional management Mr Askews campaign often does things that can be misinterpreted Last week for instance he was in Manchester NH to see the new signboards on city buses that underline his theme of using businesslabor cooperation to create new jobs The signs read With your help American can work again But the message got a little blurred when Mr Askew arrived to be photographed in a Renault Alliance trailed by aides in a Toyota and a Volkswagen Rabbit Despite some difficulties in adjusting to the national arena Mr Askew is by instinct a sound politician and he has undertaken one of the more subtle manuvers of the campaign in regard to Mr Carter While Mr Mondale is distancing himself from the President he served Mr Askew seldom misses a chance to praise Mr Carter Voters Mr Askew observed have appreciated the fact that I have not been defensive in pointing out some of the good things that President Carter did Someone else who might appreciate it is Mr Carter himself With his remarks Mr Askew like Senator John Glenn has placed himself to benefit should Mr Carter take offense at Mr Mondales coolness and decide to withdraw or modify his endorsement of the former Vice President
NEW JERSEY JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/nyregion/new-jersey-journal.html,TRENTON HIGH Class of 67 is the setting for the movie Baby Its You which was made by a Trenton graduate Amy Robinson The Paramount film which recently opened in theaters in Princeton and Paramus is a love story about Jill a middle class girl who wants to become a serious actress and Albert a workingclass boy who wants to become an ersatz Frank Sinatra Miss Robinson was Trenton High 66 Jill was 67 her father is a doctor as is Jills and she went off to Sarah Lawrence College in pursuit of the arts ditto Jill But the filmmaker says that the resemblance ends there For the record the director and screenplay writer John Sayles who lives in Hoboken did not grow up in a workingclass family  or even in the state What happened says Miss Robinson who coproduced the film with Griffin Dunne of New York City was that John and I talked about our high school experiences Out of these the actual plot and screenplay developed We wanted to do a film about high school because thats the last time the middle and lower classes mix freely When they get out into the real world they dont That was the political undertone here Although it may have been the jumpingoff point and fictionalized setting for the movie Trenton High was not actually in the picture Most of the people who were in the film live in New York City explained Miss Robinson who now lives there too We had to shoot at a commutable distance Actual film locations were various cities in northern New Jersey Hoboken Jersey City and Newark Cliffside Park High School served as the exterior of Trenton High Scenes were shot during Easter vacation so as not to disrupt classes However local teenagers did get into the act In addition to several hundred used as extras three North Bergen youngsters  Steven Reed Stephen Donato and Susan Busset  had small parts in the prom scene What was the real Trenton High School like for Miss Robinson back in the 60s Terrific she said It was a great school very good academically And exciting I had a great time Louis Kousin of Cranford is a peaceful man who can be very aggressive about combating the threat of nuclear war I walk in cold to institutions  churches synagogues community centers  and try to convince them to have a peace site said the 73yearold project coordinator for New Jersey SANE which celebrated its 25th anniversary last month A peace site as defined by Mr Kousin is the other side of the coin from a war site such as a missile base Army camp or Navy depot It is he says a permanent presence for education and action for peace  and it ties in with the nuclearfreeze movement Sites are located where natural peaceful endeavors have been going on places where you pray play work study and live Mr Kousin explained Space is set aside at each site for a library of peace materials Twentysix peace sites have been established in New Jersey since October 1981 They include 11 YWCAs several churches synagogues Ethical Culture Societies a parochial school two state colleges and a retail business all in northern and central parts of the state The newest dedication ceremony for a peace site will be held at the Clay Cellar a pottery shop in Montclair on June 25 In addition to the 26 instate sites New Jersey SANE has organized three outside the state at Ethical Culture Societies in Brooklyn and Baltimore and at a community center in Seattle This makes a bridge of peace from the East to the West Coast Mr Kousin said The Morris County Park Commission and Junior League of Morristown have been working hard to put 180 acres of farmland and buildings back into the 19th century Fosterfields a Morris Township estate was built in 1854 by Joseph Warren Revere a grandson of Paul Revere After he died in 1880 the house and farm were acquired by Charles Foster one of the earliest farmers in the state to own a herd of registered Jersey cattle When his daughter Caroline Rose Foster died in 1979 at the age of 102 she left the property to the Park Commission What she wanted was for people to experience what a farm was like when she was a kid said Joseph R Hovance director of the Park Commissions Outdoor Education Division who heads the project Fosterfields now has a working farmer who has planted five acres of grain using a team of four draft horses and his own collection of antique farm machinery Eventually the project hopes to include cows pigs sheep goats and chickens Pretty much the kinds of animals that Miss Foster had said Mr Hovance Although the idea is to recreate a living historical farm Fosterfields was designated New Jerseys first by the states Agricultural Society Mr Hovance said that we may have to resort to modernday technology to clear the pastures and reclaim the land Meanwhile inside the main house  it is called The Willows  members of the Junior League have been combing the rooms cataloguing their contents Robert P Guter of Morristown a historicpreservation consultant traced the houses history and made recommendations about its restoration Next says Catherine M Schulte of Mountain Lakes the leagues project chairman Well hire a decorativearts expert to help us decide what era these rooms should assume when the house is opened as a museum Three generations lived there The Same Day Surgery Center across the road from St Barnabas Medical Center in Livingston is scheduled to open next month It is reportedly the states only freestanding unit so close to a hospital This is one of its advantages said Dr Norman J Zeig chairman of the Department of Anesthesiology at St Barnabas and the centers director All the centers physicians will have privileges at the hospital In case of complications patients can be admitted to the hospital across the road very quickly he noted Another big plus Dr Zeig said is financial because it will eliminate the cost of an overnight stay in a hospital which could save patients hundreds of dollars What the center will do is treat patients who require elective nonmajor surgical procedures These include dilation and curettage a gynecological operation commonly known as a D  C diagnostic pelvic laparoscopy internal diagnosis of a pelvic condition with a surgical viewing instrument tubal ligation a female sterilization procedure abortion vasectomy male sterilization arthroscopy internal diagnosis of joint problems herniorrhaphy repair of a hernia myringotomy lancing of the ear drum which is usually done on children and some plastic surgery procedures such as breast enlargement Surgeons at the center Dr Zeig said will try to separate out those procedures that can be done safely on a oneday basis Were taking care of essentially healthy people who need elective surgery who can avoid exposure to a hospital ODDS  ENDS The office of the Canadian Consulate General in New York City recently announced that it would donate 3000 worth of FrenchCanadian literary works to libraries at Ramapo and Montclair State Colleges to support FrenchCanadian studies  The AYUDA Toy Shop headquartered at Rahway State Prison opened a new facility outside the prison walls last month to provide more space for its more than 60000 toys These are collected Christmaswrapped and donated to poor and hospitalized children by an inmate group headed by Rick Rowe  Trentons

'SOCIAL ISSUES' REHEATED TO WARM UP THE G.O.P.,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/05/weekinreview/social-issues-reheated-to-warm-up-the-gop.html,Twice recently a Senate subcommittee scheduled sessions to draft a constitutional amendment that would permit organized prayer in public schools Both meetings were canceled when the White House and Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who heads the panel could not agree on a proposal The divisions among supporters of legalized prayer persist but another meeting of the Senate panel is planned for Thursday In addition Senate leaders have promised to hold a floor debate on the issue of legalized abortion this month perhaps as early as this week As these events indicate the social issues are emerging again on Capitol Hill For the first two years of the Reagan Presidency conservatives unsuccessfully fought to push their agenda of moral causes through Congress Their chances for success seem even smaller now Nevertheless the conservative cadres are determined to force Congress to confront these issues once again With the 1984 elections only 17 months away the White House is happy to go along From President Reagans viewpoint advancing the social issues is a way of wooing some key voter groups ethnic Catholics in the North evangelical Protestants in the South and Hispanic people in the Southwest Representative Tony Coelho of California who runs the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee assessed the White House strategy this way Theyre trying to reidentify with their 1980 voters and get them back into their column again Senator Lowell P Weicker Jr a Connecticut Republican added Reagan obviously feels the religious issue is one of his strongest wickets I expect to see his biggest push on that  the whole element of binding government and religion As part of his drive to tap religious feelings for his political cause the President has also endorsed a proposal to provide tax credits for parents who enroll their children in private schools The measure has virtually no chance of becoming law Mr Reagans position thus encourages the widely held belief that he seems more interested in scoring political points with the social issues than in actually passing legislation Seldom has the President bent arms or cashed chits in pursuit of votes for these measures and he is expected to keep his efforts on a rhetorical plane A Republican aide in the Senate noted The Administration doesnt like the President climbing on wagons as theyre going over the cliff After the 1980 elections advocates of the social issues proclaimed that a conservative tide was rolling over the country But their ability to pass legislation was thwarted for several reasons including fragmentation in their own ranks Compromise is the essence of successful lawmaking on Capitol Hill but these issues engender such strong emotions that accommodation becomes virtually impossible These are clearly not matters on which you can split the difference said a Republican staff member Youve got people involved who believe in absolute legal or constitutional or moral rights Moreover many voters and lawmakers who felt comfortable espousing general moral principles turned distinctly uncomfortable when faced with proposals that would translate those principles into binding standards of behavior Americans generally dont like intrusions into their private lives noted Representative James M Shannon Democrat of Massachusetts a Catholic who has been attacked by church officials in recent campaigns because of his prochoice stand on abortion Theres no consensus when you run into the details Passions Arent Burning A third factor that lessened the fervor for social issues was the recession I dont see a lot of burning passion on these issues said Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the Republican whip The economy has just been allencompassing Still these issues and the attendant controversies are likely to recur in a number of forms On school prayer Senator Hatch backs an amendment that would permit silent devotion and allow religious groups to use public school facilities for meetings As a Mormon the Senator is sensitive to the problems of religious minorities and he does not want pupils to be embarrassed by public prayers He also does not like the idea of a statewritten prayer and he believes that only an amendment sanctioning silent prayer has any chance for passage But the Hatch compromise does not seem to please either side The White House and its more ardent allies continue to favor an amendment that would permit public organized prayer To the American Civil Liberties Union any sort of prayer amounts to an official sanction of religion and is thus unacceptable In another attempt at compromise Senator Hatch has sponsored a constitutional amendment that would simply overturn the Supreme Court decision of 1973 that legalized abortion leaving further legislation to the states and the Federal Government This proposal has also drawn fire from all camps Many opponents of abortion hold out for a much tougher proposal that would ban the procedure outright and leave no room for local option Advocates of a womans right to choose abortion favor the status quo and reject any further restrictions For the last several years Congress has adopted a rider banning the use of Medicaid funds to finance abortion Representative Henry J Hyde the Illinois Republican who sponsored the original amendment is now pushing another bill that would make the ban permanent A similar battle is brewing over a proposal to ban the use of Federal health insurance for abortions Meanwhile advocates of the prochoice position on abortion are looking for a new cause that can keep their members stirred up and their treasuries full So they are planning a fullscale drive to repeal the Hyde amendment and restore Medicaid funding for abortions For now the least heated of the social issues is school busing The Senate passed a bill last year that would limit a courts right to order busing as a remedy for segregation and similar legislation could pop up again But in private the overwhelming desire on Capitol Hill is for busing restrictions like the rest of the social issues to simply disappear
G.O.P. STARTS TRAINING IN 'GENDER GAP' POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/06/us/gop-starts-training-in-gender-gap-politics.html,The Republican Party opened its 1984 Presidential campaign for the votes of women here this weekend It was the partys first organized attack on the socalled gender gap the evidence in polling data that women are increasingly tending to vote for Democrats It took the form of the first Republican Womens Leadership Forum where 100 participants were told that their party could sink under womens votes for the other side The gender gap is part of an enormous wave of demographic change sweeping the country that threatens to swamp the Republican Party Edward J Rollins President Reagans chief political adviser told the meeting last night It is clear that if the sexes continue to align on a partisan basis the Republican Party will once again be locked into a minority position he said at another point Training for Local Leaders The gathering was organized by the Republican National Committee to begin training the partys women leaders in the region in the themes of next years campaign and in answers to the challenge of the demographic changes that Mr Rollins spoke of These changes include the growing number of working women singleparent families and widows dependent on Federal programs who often perceive the Democrats as more attuned to their lives and desires Mr Rollins said According to the most recent New York TimesCBS Poll taken in April women tend to view the Reagan Administration much more critically than men in matters of the economy and foreign policy and in issues of war and peace And while men split evenly on their assessments of the Administrations overall performance women responded disapprovingly by 48 percent to 38 percent Mr Rollins said White House polling had found a difference of nine percentage points between womens and mens party preferences and the sense of urgency at the meeting was real Balance of the Future The political party that gets the womens vote will be the party of the majority in the future Mr Rollins said From Friday night until noon today Republican staff members from the White House and Congress displayed the ammunition we have available and how it will carry Republicans to victory in 1984 as Betty Heitman cochairman of the Republican National Committee put it in her keynote speech The party has planned at least three more such regional conferences Two themes emerged in the speeches and workshops The first an argument often made by the party in the past was that the Republicans perform while the Democrats promise The reason behind the gender gap is that this President and this Administration have a terrific story to tell but I dont think weve told it Mrs Heitman said Stress on Independence The other theme emerged from conversations with some of the participants most of whom were middleaged suburban women in small business and the professions who have become leaders in their local party organizations and who argued that the Republican emphasis on selfreliance is in key with the values of the womens movement In the Republican Party when a woman runs for office she runs because shes the best candidate and because she wants to run not because they want a token woman for that job and so they let her run like the other party said Hannelore Huisman who lost a race for County Clerk last year in heavily Democratic Rock Island County Ill That I think is true liberation Mrs Huisman said she was a member of the National Organization for Women which on several occasions this weekend was dismissed as a Democratic front The conference speakers offered a glimpse of the major womens themes in the campaign for the 1984 Presidential candidate who they expect will be Mr Reagan These themes include the benefits to working women in signs of economic recovery the importance of the abatement of inflation to the poor and the advantages to widows in the elimination of most estate tax charges Mr Reagans appointments of women to top posts three to Cabinetrank positions and one to the Supreme Court were presented as more than any previous administration had made over a comparable period and received heavy attention But issues that the Democrats can be expected to raise such as abortion rights day care and affirmative action were not raised Instead economic issues held center stage The only way that we can get working women out of the Democratic Party and into the Republican Party Mr Rollins said is to demonstrate to them that the Republican Party policy on economic growth is what they need
SECRECY IN A DISMISSAL BY STANFORD FUELS ACADEMIC FREEDOM DISPUTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/07/us/secrecy-in-a-dismissal-by-stanford-fuels-academic-freedom-dispute.html,Stanford Universitys expulsion of a graduate student on the basis of a secret report by faculty members who investigated his anthropological work in China has touched off a dispute about academic freedom The student Steven W Mosher was dismissed from Stanfords doctoral program by an 110 vote of the anthropology department last February with no reported dissent But the secrecy surrounding the decision and conflicting accounts of the charges against the student have raised questions over whether Stanford had bowed to pressure from Peking to retaliate against Mr Mosher Mr Mosher 34 years old conducted research in a village near Canton in 1979 and 1980 He was one of the first American scholars allowed to work in China after normal relations between Peking and Washington were restored Work Led to Chinese Ban He gathered a highly unusual collection of local police and government documents that the Chinese consider secret and he later published an article in a Taiwanese magazine that described a campaign to force many women to undergo abortions as part of Chinas birth control program The Chinese were angered by Mr Moshers activities and soon after his departure whether by coincidence or not banned all further field research by American academics In conversations with other American scholars Chinese officials also began accusing Mr Mosher of a long list of charges including spying smuggling and immoral conduct with a woman Several of the scholars reported the charges to Stanford Stanford then set up a threemember investigating committee that reported that Mr Mosher had engaged in illegal and seriously unethical conduct in China But the anthropology department has refused to release the 47page committee report on which the vote to expel Mr Mosher was based contending that it contains information that may be injurious to innocent parties In a statement this spring responding to critical letters and editorials Donald Kennedy president of Stanford termed the dispute over Mr Mosher one of those unfortunate cases in which we find two important social values in collision He said the university would like to be able to release the information to answer questions about possible infringements on academic freedom or about the operation of political influence But an equally strong set of values attaches to the need for privacy he went on saying that the information might be damaging to other people A spokesman for the university said Mr Kennedy had not read the investigating committees report ExWife Said to Be a Source Although members of the anthropology department have offered differing accounts of the charges against Mr Mosher several professors said the critical evidence had been supplied by his former wife Maggie So a Chinese born in Hong Kong In the spring of 1980 after a bitter quarrel over Mr Moshers demand for a divorce Miss So went to the United States Consulate in Canton where she accused him of bribing local officials to obtain documents the anthropology professors said She complained that Mr Moshers actions were endangering her relatives who still lived in the village they said In early 1982 after the couple were divorced the professors said she repeated her accusations to the Stanford investigating committee calling collect from France One professor said Miss So had also charged Mr Mosher with financing his operation by smuggling Chinese antiques to Hong Kong though other professors said this was untrue Miss Sos current whereabouts are unknown Abolutely False He Says Mr Mosher derides Miss Sos information as absolutely false and unsubstantiated slander from a scorned woman who vowed to ruin me In a telephone interview from Taiwan where he now lives Mr Mosher said he had been dismissed because of Chinese anger over the abortion article and pressure from American China scholars eager to please Peking Stanford has denied both charges Clifford R Barnett the chairman of the anthropology department insisted that the department had been fair and had for example excluded China specialists who might have appeared to be subject to pressure from the Chinese Government from the investigating committee and the departmental vote Stanford Widely Criticized The university however has been widely criticized for its handling of the case Editorials in The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal questioned the need for secrecy and suggested that Mr Mosher might have been expelled to mollify the Chinese Arthur Wolf a Stanford anthropology professor said all department members had received critical letters from groups that oppose abortion Several professors at such universities as Harvard Brown and Yale who asked not to be named to avoid cooler relations with colleagues at Stanford have raised questions about how much authority a university should exercise over students actions off campus They pointed out that Harvard University along with some other Ivy League schools had adopted a policy of limiting disciplinary action to offenses connected with a students academic record or behavior on campus Irving Louis Horowitz the editor of Society magazine and a professor of political science and sociology at Rutgers University said there was a serious question whether Stanford could withhold a degree from a student without making public the charges against him Quality of Work Termed Issue The issue is not whether Moshers a nice man but the quality of his work said Mr Horowitz Ive read his manuscript he added referring to Mr Moshers proposed dissertation and Id be glad to have him as a graduate student I think Stanford felt they had to deliver a head to the Peoples Republic Mr Horowitz charged If Mosher had done the same things in the Soviet Union hed be a hero He noted that many American academics disliked the Soviet Union but had a favorable attitude toward China Thomas Grey a professor at the Stanford law school and one of the three members of the investigating committee disputed Mr Horowitzs contention We were aware from the beginning that the Sinological community had a bias in this so we kept them out Mr Grey said I certainly didnt have any ax to grind he added and it took a lot of time away from my work at the law school As an indication of Stanfords sensitivity Norman K Wessels dean of the School of Humanities and Sciences has appointed a panel of three scholars including one from outside Stanford to hear a threepage grievance Mr Mosher has filed against the school Mr Wessels asked the panel to recommend how he should deal with the case and requested a report that could be published Student Says He May Sue for Libel Mr Mosher who has the investigative committees report on the charges against him has not released it He has said he might sue Stanford for libel and that releasing the report himself would undermine his case Mr Barnett stressing that he had tried to insure a fair investigation said the department had rejected a number of unsubstantiated accusations made by Peking and by fellow China scholars including the charge that Mr Mosher was a spy and that he illegally imported a van into China and gave it to village officials Still Mr Barnett asserted that some of the Chinese charges including one that Mr Mosher traveled without authorization into Guizhou Province which is closed to foreigners indicated a pattern of questionable behavior One Stanford professor said Miss Sos evidence had been corroborated at least in part by Richard Williams who was the United States Consul General in Canton when Mr Mosher was in China Mr Williams now deputy consul general in Hong Kong said by telephone that it wouldnt be appropriate for him to comment on the case To support his contention that Stanford bowed to pressure by China scholars Mr Mosher cited a letter from Kenneth Prewitt president of the Social Sciences Research Council in New York to Stanford after he talked with Chinese officials late in 1981 The exchange program between China and the United States could be harmed if the American scholarly community took no action on what the Chinese regarded as improper behavior by Mosher Mr Prewitt warned Stanford itself has conducted an active exchange program with China Abortion Campaign Described In a book Broken Earth The Rural Chinese to be published in September Mr Mosher paints a portrait of apathy corruption and poverty among Chinas peasants and village officials He also describes as he did in the article published in Taiwan a campaign in his village in the spring of 1980 to force abortions on pregnant women who were not permitted to have children under Pekings strict birth control rules At a family planning meeting he attended he wrote a local official told the pregnant women None of you have any choice in this matter The two of you who are eight or nine months pregnant will have a Caesarean Mr Mosher quotes the official as saying The rest of you will have a shot that will cause you to abort In a nearby village Mr Mosher asserted a woman seven months pregnant who had no sons had an ordered abortion and was found to have been carrying twin boys The womans husband Mr Mosher wrote went in a fury to the home of the official who had ordered the abortion Seizing the mans two sons aged 8 and 10 he wrote he heaved them into the courtyard well and then leaped in himself All three drowned The magazine article published in May 1981 brought accusations from Peking that its content and its publication in Taiwan was an attack on China And the head of Mr Moshers dissertation committee at Stanford the anthropologist G William Skinner wrote Mr Mosher that he was appalled at your irresponsibility and insensitivity in not concealing the identity of the women facing abortions Concealing subjects identity is a canon of anthropological ethics Chinese Had Been Complaining Chinese officials had already been complaining to American scholars about Mr Mosher and Stanford decided to set up the investigating committee When it began its work in October 1981 however it lacked proof The committee head Prof Jane F Collier wrote to Zhao Fusan a deputy director of the Chinese Academy of Social Sciences appealing for evidence Much of the information we have received on these charges she said has been indirect and secondhand consisting of reports by American scholars of complaints made to them by Chinese officials Mr Zhaos response only reiterated the allegations that had been gossiped about said Mr Barnett the anthropology department chairman But in December 1981 Miss So began making her accusations to Stanford according to several professors familiar with the investigative report Mr Mosher asserts that Miss So had little firsthand knowledge of the village though she had cousins there because she visited him infrequently Instead she was either finishing graduate school at the University of California at Berkeley or working out of Hong Kong for an importexport company I Will Ruin You Matters came to a head in March 1980 Mr Mosher said She came to the village and I said I wanted a divorce She replied You cant I will ruin you  Mr Mosher said About the confidential documents Mr Mosher insists he was given access to them legally after three Chinese officials from Peking visited the village shortly before his arrival in 1979 and ordered the local authorities to cooperate with him The documents included land registers household registers and class status registers giving a social and economic profile of each peasant going back to the 1940s Mr Mosher also obtained crime reports prepared by the local secret police Scholars say no American had ever gained access to such material Mr Mosher said he did give his Mazda van to the village and turn over to his wifes cousins a house he built But his only other gifts Mr Mosher said were dinner invitations to peasants who helped him Gifts Held Improper Professor Barnett concedes that anthropologists routinely provide their research subjects with money or gifts in exchange for their information or time But without elaborating he asserted that Mr Mosher went way over the line with his gifts Before he was expelled Mr Mosher had planned to give all his documents to the Hoover Institution on War Revolution and Peace at Stanford An official of the politically conservative institution said he had already turned over some materials on education and a microfilm file of the local county newspaper a valuable tool for scholars Unfortunately the film he took was of such poor quality that it is unusable the official added
POLITICS; HOLLINGS HACKS AWAY AT HIS RIVALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/08/us/politics-hollings-hacks-away-at-his-rivals.html,To have a chance in the Democratic Presidential race Senator Ernest F Hollings figures he must beat out Senator John Glenn for the moderate vote Therefore Senator Hollings seldom misses a chance to denigrate Senator Glenns political experience or his ideas particularly his plan to finance an acid rain cleanup with a consumer tax on electricity The problem with this plan Senator Hollings observed is that a lot of the acid rain that falls on New Hampshire site of the first Presidential primary is caused by industrial pollution in Senator Glenns home state of Ohio So here comes this joker saying Were going to squirt this acid rain on you and make you pay for it  said Senator Hollings Then he unfurled his patrician drawl to full amplitude and wrapped it around the punch line Ive heard of nofault he said but this is yofault The South Carolinian who has served in the Senate since 1966 offered these remarks and more to dazed companions in an airport layover in the tiring flight from Washington to Des Moines This man can talk and while his rivals are boasting about the gentlemanly tone of the campaign Senator Hollings has started hacking away at them at the Democratic Party power blocs at Presidents past and present and at entire categories of citizens he blames for a series of failed chief executives Shoot All the Pollsters Ive just seen too many economists he observed in a typical jeremiad They waffle all around You ought to shoot all the economists and elect a couple of historians You know what I mean Get a feel of whence youre coming and where youre headed as the President Thats our trouble Its been ad hocery Its sort of the seven oclock news and whats the issue and where are the people and get the pollster Shoot all the pollsters In the Senate such torrents have earned the Senator a reputation for overstatement His advisers seem uncertain how the public will react to them but before that can be determined Senator Hollings must overcome another problem As Billy Keyserling the campaign manager put it Nobody knows who he is Ernest Frederick Hollings a silverhaired man with ramrod posture is one of the more interesting men in the Democratic race Providence has blessed him with an appearance so striking that rank strangers assume he must be important The happenstance of being born 61 years ago in Charleston SC equipped him with a trademark accent that has more twists than a snakes spine Birth in that citadel of Confederate nostalgia and segregationist politics also endowed Senator Hollings with a political biography equally full of switchbacks In 1959 he was elected Governor of South Carolina as a defender of segregation having promised to protect the Southern way of life against the dictation of a powerhappy Federal Government Wed Run Out of Courts I knew it was wrong but there wasnt anything you could do about it coming along politically Senator Hollings now says of his behavior in those days He conducted what he calls a separate but equal kind of governorship He opposed Ku Klux Klan violence but at the same time he committed the state to a policy of using every available legal maneuver to defend segregation Wed appeal all the courts with the dimestores and the licensetoparade and every other dern thing and we were wrong he now says Finally Wed run out of courts and we had to integrate Clemson and I said we had to decide whether to be a government of men or a government of laws The peaceful integration of Clemson University and Senator Hollingss decision to support John F Kennedy in the 1960 Presidential race marked his break with racial politics Now with some regret he acknowledges that for much of the decade that he led his states defense of segregation he had no private belief in the cause His secret conversion Senator Hollings said came when he was helping represent South Carolina before the Supreme Court in a case that eventually figured in the 1954 school desegregation decision I sat there with those arguments going on Senator Hollings said then on I sort of shook my head and knew that the game was over That was back in December in 52 Perception on Fiscal Affairs Senator Hollings said this conflict between private belief and public performance caused him inner turmoil and led him to take strict law enforcement measures to prevent the kind of violence that occurred elsewhere in the South I was tough he said particularly on whites I wouldnt let them get out of hand These days Senator Hollings is tough on his own party His campaign is based on the premise that the other Democratic candidates by pandering to labor and other interest groups have gotten a reputation for fiscal irresponsibility that will make it impossible for them to challenge President Reagan Among voters he said The definite perception is Ye gods this fellows got a 200 billion deficit but if we let Tip ONeill and Cranston and Mondale and Hart and that crowd get back in there therell be 400 billion deficitsT  In contrast Senator Hollings said he would run on a Sun Belt philosophy that calls for a freeze on Federal spending and protectionist measures to give American industry time to catch up with foreign competitors He said he would do as President what he did as a Southern governor arrange a governmentbusiness partnership that produces the economic growth needed to finance social programs in education health and nutrition Liberal Litany of Abortion We know what it is to pay the bill and yet provide and weve been through these practical struggles he said in describing his differences with the other Democrats So why should we have them come down with this liberal litany of abortion and gay rights I respect everybody as a citizen regardless of their sex practices but why should we be putting in caucuses for gays and all of that nonsense like that Thats not a problem for America when were hungry and on bread lines out there In offering himself as the Sun Belt champion Senator Hollings professes to see no threat from the regions other candidate former Gov Reubin Askew of Florida My competition is Glenn he said If I had the name recognition of Mondale or Glenn there would hardly be any race Id have the nomination Absent that name recognition Senator Hollings is pinning his hopes almost entirely on a strong showing in the first primary in New Hampshire followed by a breakthrough in several Southern states that vote a week later He is mounting only a modest effort for the Iowa caucuses saying it is too expensive and timeconsuming for a dark horse to build a organization there If Senator Hollings has the simplest campaign plan he also has a style that is so relaxed as to seem almost covert Last week for example he drew only 60 people in stops in Boone Carroll and Fort Dodge Iowa In most towns his staff had failed to notify the legislators and local officials that he was coming and the task of introducing the Senator sometimes fell to party leaders already committed to Senator Glenn A Joke From Mrs Hollings At several campaign stops the Senators wife Peatsy sat in the car reading a novel because she said the staff had not given her any buttons or brochures to pass out Like the Senator Mrs Hollings is from Charleston She was working in Mr Hollingss office here when they married in 1971 about a year after his first wife got a Mexican divorce The couple frequently campaign together and Mrs Hollings tells the best joke produced by the campaign to date As she tells it a hotel clerk in California rang the room early one morning and demanded to know whether a Senator Hollings was present Holding the telephone so that the clerk would be sure to hear she turned to her husband and said Hey honey is your name Hollings Win or lose Mrs Hollings said she and her husband intend to keep a sense of humor But sometimes that plan conflicts with her job of reminding the Senator that he does tend to overspeak a little bit For example there was the Iowa luncheon where the Senator ignoring the fact that his wife was rolling her eyes and shaking her head regaled a group of elderly women with a joke about birth control After that they seemed to understand that this Southerner was not like the straitlaced Baptist who won the state in 1976 That too is part of the message of a candidate who believes Dixie deserves another turn I dont believe we had a good chance at bat with Jimmy Carter Senator Hollings said We didnt put our best foot forward with him
CONFEREES START TO DRAFT BUDGET,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/09/us/conferees-start-to-draft-budget.html,Senate and House conferees began trying to draft a compromise budget for the Federal Government today and lawmakers from both parties stressed that if Congress failed to adopt a spending plan the economic recovery could be undermined I think were going to have chaos if we dont have a budget resolution Senator Pete V Domenici the New Mexico Republican who heads the Senate Budget Committee told the conferees at their first meeting this morning Senator Donald W Riegle Jr Democrat of Michigan added I think were going to have to find a way to meet in the middle The alternative is fiscal anarchy But heated exchanges between Republicans on the budget conference demonstrated how difficult it is going to be for the lawmakers to meet in the middle and draft a blueprint that will pass both houses of Congress and then function as an effective guideline for the many decisions on spending and revenue that lie ahead this year Meanwhile an unusual coalition of liberals and conservatives in the House defeated an appropriation bill covering the Treasury and Postal Service The conservatives felt the 12 billion appropriation was about 1 billion larger than the Reagan Administration wanted and the liberals were angered over an amendment adopted earlier that would bar the use of Federal health insurance to finance abortions The bill was defeated by a vote of 259 to 149 You Cant Win Its very simple said Representative Silvio O Conte of Massachusetts the ranking Republican on the Appropriations Committee All those prochoice people voted against it Then there were the people on our side who like to vote against spending When youve got those teams together you cant win The Treasury measure was the fifth of the 13 appropriation bills to reach the House floor in recent days Earlier in the day the lawmakers approved a 32 billion appropriation bill for the Agriculture Department The budget sets broad spending guidelines for the Government but the appropriation bills actually allocate the funds President Reagan has vowed to veto any of the bills he does not like and at least four are considered candidates for vetoes The major cloud hanging over the budget conference is Mr Reagans unhappiness with both the House and Senate budgets Mr Reagan cannot veto the budget but he has vowed to veto bills to carry out the budget that he does not like and today Representative Ed Bethune Republican of Arkansas warned conferees that unless they approved a budget that could pass muster at the White House their efforts will be irrelevant Reagans Veto Strategy The President has a veto prerogative and he intends to use it Mr Bethune asserted Along with some other Republicans Senator Domenici has been increasingly irritated at Mr Reagans threat to follow a veto strategy In replying to Mr Bethune he said such a strategy may lead nowhere in getting things done An aide to Mr Domenici added later Bethune believes that a veto strategy leads to a coherent way of running the Government and we dont After the conference ended for the day Mr Bethune acknowledged that there is a distinct division fragmenting Republicans on budget policy Speaking of Mr Domenici the Arkansas Republican said I strongly disagree with what he had to say I think this is an irrelevant procedure The core of that division lies in the differing perspectives and priorities advanced by Republicans in the White House and on Capitol Hill Mr Reagan and his allies have apparently decided that by vetoing legislation Mr Reagan can portray himself as a fighter for fiscal responsibility while blaming Congress for the problems of the economy Most Congress members on the other hand come to believe in the legislative process and generally try to make the compromises necessary to meet in the middle and ultimately pass a bill Moreover Republicans leaders like Mr Domenici believe strongly that the party has a responsibility to run the Government and not run against the Government as they believe Mr Reagan is doing Three Key Areas of Conflict The tax issue is one of the three main areas of controversy facing the budget conference The Housepassed version mandates 30 billion in new revenues while the Senate sets a 9 billion target Mr Reagan wants virtually no new revenues but the conference is likely to settle on something like the Senate figure The second major area is military spending which the conference started to discuss this afternoon The House resolution proposes an increase of about 4 percent real growth above inflation and the Senate is at about 6 percent Mr Reagan originally proposed 10 percent and later said he would settle for 75 percent but the likely compromise is about 5 percent The third major disagreement is over domestic spending The House proposes an increase of 33 billion while the Senate has approved 126 billion Mr Reagan wants virtually no increase This area could prove the most troublesome since liberal Democrats want to leave room in the budget for new programs to aid victims of the recession And if the budget conference trims domestic spending too deeply the compromise could have trouble attracting enough Democrats to win approval in the House That point was emphasized today when Representative William H Gray 3d Democrat of Pennsylvania urged the conference to make sure that the holes made in the safety net over the last two years are repaired By safety net he was referring to domestic programs designed to protect the truly needy But Senate Republicans have warned that their budget passed by only one vote and that any significant increases in domestic spending above their figure could doom the compromise in the Senate Senator Slade Gorton the Washington Republican who authored the Senate budget said the onevote margin leaves us very very little room to maneuver in terms of accepting House proposals In overall terms the House budget proposes outlays in the fiscal year 1984 of 8633 billion and a deficit of 1745 billion The Senate bill suggests 8497 billion in spending and a deficit of 1786 billion

SUMMARY OF 1983 REGULAR SESSION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/nyregion/summary-of-1983-regular-session.html,Following are some of the major issues dealt with by the 1983 regular session of the General Assembly which adjourned Wednesday Finances The General Assembly adjourned its regular session without adopting a budget for the fiscal year beginning July 1 Governor ONeill immediately called the legislature back into special session to try to enact a budget before the start of the new fiscal year The Appropriations Committee did put together a 36 billion budget measure but the Democratic majorities particularly in the House of Representatives could not muster enough votes to pass it or the package of new and higher taxes that would balance it The proposed budget is likely to form the starting point for future negotiations in the special session It calls for spending about 45 million more than what the Governor proposed in February The major increases would pay for a 3 percent

the deficit in the current fiscal year Increase the state tax on gasoline by 3 cents a gallon Impose the sales tax on meals costing less than 1 Impose the sales tax on seed and fertilizer for nonfarm

'VENGEANCE VOTE' WORRIES WHITE HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/weekinreview/vengeance-vote-worries-white-house.html,One of the Presidents men raised the specter last week that the GOP is in danger of becoming known for the next generation as the party of the men  a minority party in an era when female voters are in the ascendance and are showing a statistical preference for Democrats that has become more pronounced during President Reagans incumbency Unfortunately perhaps for purposes of the warning presented by Edward J Rollins the White House political director the message was delivered to Republican women who already know there are difficulties in trying to sell parts of the Reagan record to their sisters Mr Rollinss warning about an approaching turning point in American political history seemed better directed at Republican men and the message might easily be compounded to question whether the GOP is in danger of being further stereotyped as the party of the white men Mr Rollins who is well attuned to the traditional voting blocs only a few days before addressing the women had heard the sternest warning from a group of black Republicans that the Reagan record in office was nothing they could sell in the black community and that in fact it was stirring a likely vengeance vote in which blacks angered by the Presidents policies would turn out heavily for Democrats next year Were not prepared to be apologists for that record as it stands today a black Republican said afterward citing a long list of complaints ranging from social budget cuts to changes in civil rights policies in the Justice Department and the alleged easing of foreign policy pressure toward South Africas racism Definitions of Decency In denying the thrust of the complaints Mr Rollins pleaded the basic decency of President Reagan But he conceded that unfair as he considered it a vengeance vote was a possibility Theres no question the potential is out there he said later in an interview Weve got to tell our story to take the edge off to tell the black community that our economic program helps all Americans The disgruntlement expressed at the meeting was all the more noteworthy since it came from a marginal political quarter Republican blacks not noted for table thumping but rather for patient dwelling on the fringe of the party of Lincoln Participants at the meeting described a moment when Prof J Clay Smith a law professor from Howard University felt obliged to interrupt as the Presidents personal decency was being emphasized The professor said the point was not the Presidents decency but rather the basic decency of American blacks and how the policies invoked by the Administration somehow seem to bring this into question Policies that focus on welfare cheats and the inconvenience suffered by white students in school busing cases seem designed more to spur a strong bluecollar vote among whites than to reassure black voters the black Republicans complained in trying to explain why the Presidents rate of disapproval among blacks is running at 80 percent The message from women seems no less threatening for Republicans In a recent New York TimesCBS News poll Mr Reagan had the approval of 48 percent of men but only 38 percent of women Election results from last fall showed Republicans doing worse by 5 to 15 percentage points among women voters than among the men MrReagans problem is measured in such issues as the economy Republican pollsters talk of such gender gap implications as the Democrats reaping a 30point advantage in preference among single women MrRollins gets to the urgent heart of the numbers in noting In 1984 more women than men will vote The Administrations approach in dealing with the complaints of blacks and women is to emphasize general economic recovery as the overriding cure and to hope that the improving measurements of recovery will be noted gratefully by voters in both categories where the hardships of recession and unemployment have been disproportionately concentrated There is some discreet agitation among White House officials who question whether this is enough of an electioneering message In one symptom of discomfort anonymous carping already can be heard from members of the Presidents predominantly male inner circle about the latest woman to join the Administration Faith Ryan Whittlesey director of public liaison MrsWhittlesey seems an unlikely scapegoat for reelection anxiety about the gender gap since she only recently joined the Administration and she reflects the Presidents own view that the gap is exaggerated and economic recovery will cover a multitude of dissatisfactions More interesting than the staff sniping are the views expressed by some among the quiet female cadre who work for the ranking staff members in the West Wing Loyal Republicans a number of these women fervently privately object to any number of Administration positions on such issues as the equal rights amendment and the attempt to outlaw abortion Lately they have been attuned to a round of inconclusive Cabinet meetings on a package of relatively noncontroversial issues affecting women that the Administration has had under consideration for some time The lingering proposals relating to such topics as equity in pensions and insurance left one White House woman muttering the other day about the slow rate that marks the retreat of slavery Its uncomfortable for some of us here another woman of the West Wing conceded But he was elected she said referring to President Reagan

ABORTION BATTLE MOVING TO STATES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/12/us/abortion-battle-moving-to-states.html,After a decade of working to abolish abortion through Federal action the antiabortion movement is winning passage of restrictive measures on the state and local levels both sides agree In fact the major organization lobbying for legalized abortions has concluded that the chief battleground on the issue is shifting It appears that the prochoice forces are winning the Federal fight said Nanette Falkenberg director of the National Abortion Rights Action League and as a result the antichoice movement is taking their efforts to the state and local level where they will chip away at womens access to abortion services through a wide range of restrictive legislation Judie Brown president of the American Life Lobby one of several antiabortion groups active in Washington disagreed sharply with the statement that advocates of choice were winning the Federal fight but she agreed that the righttolife movement was winning a number of battles at the state level Push for Amendment Mrs Falkenberg attributed the shift to the abortion opponents failure in repeated attempts to obtain a constitutional amendment to reverse the Supreme Court decision of 1973 upholding the right to abortion Antiabortion forces have been divided over what kind of a measure to promote and the amendment that has been tentatively scheduled for Senate action within a few days was sent to the floor by the Judiciary Committee without recommendation for passage That measure was sponsored by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah who has acknowledged that it stands little chance of approval A spokesman for Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina who had advocated a stronger version termed the Hatch legislation halfbaked and ineffective Mrs Brown of the American Life Lobby said that despite the failure of the proposed contitutional amendments progress was being made in Congress in adding prolife language to Federal statutes She said she felt certain that this year Congress would pass a bill that would take issue with the Supreme Court which would probably have no force in its own but could cause the Court to reconsider its 1973 decision But she acknowledged that the antiabortion movement was strongest in the states and said every effort was being made there to protect the unborn New Drive for Funds In response the abortion rights league has begun a fundraising drive to increase its lobbying efforts in state capitals The pervasiveness of this state threat Mrs Falkenberg said in a memorandum explaining the need for a shift in strategy is illustrated by the fact that nearly every state legislature that met in 1983 had at least one restrictive measure introduced The restrictions that are being enacted including some local ordinances could have a devastating cumulative effect Mrs Falkenberg said State regulation of abortions would be further enhanced she said if the Supreme Court upholds any of the restrictions at issue in three cases that it is expected to decide this month The Supreme Court has struck down several state restrictions since 1973 including blanket requirements of a parents or husbands consent Parental Consent Required Nevertheless Mrs Falkenberg said Kentucky Louisiana Massachusetts Michigan Missouri North Dakota Oklahoma Pennsylvania and Rhode Island had enacted laws requiring parental consent in some circumstances for teenagers seeking abortions Arizona Idaho Illinois Indiana Maine Maryland Minnesota Montana Nebraska Nevada and Utah require that parents be notified Eleven states require a waiting period before an abortion can be performed They are Delaware Illinois Indiana Kentucky Massachusetts Maine Nebraska Nevada Pennsylvania South Dakota and Utah And 15 states bar the use of any state Medicaid funds just as Federal law bars use of Federal funds for abortions They are Alaska California Colorado Connecticut Hawaii Massachusetts Maryland Michigan New Jersey New York North Carolina Oregon Pennsylvania Washington and West Virginia Medicaid is the joint Federalstate program that provides medical services to poor people

JUSTICE BLACKMUN TELLS NEW LAWYERS 'TAKE RISKS',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/13/nyregion/justice-blackmun-tells-new-lawyers-take-risks.html,Justice Harry A Blackmun who has emerged in recent years as one of the most outspoken members of the United States Supreme Court urged the graduating class of New York Law School yesterday to take the proper risks the calculated risks that innovation and progress require Speaking at commencement ceremonies at Avery Fisher Hall Justice Blackmun expressed his hopes for the young lawyers that they concern themselves with the little person teach others if not in the classroom then by example dedicate themselves to public service and set their sights on something more lofty than making money For those in the legal profession there comes a time when one must choose what he or she intends to make out of life he said In our profession what we know today is the result of the effort and thought and experimentation imagination courage and disappointments of a long list of names If I had really wanted to make money I would never have left my firm in Minneapolis never have gone to Rochester and never gone on the bench said Justice Blackmun who served as resident counsel to the Mayo Clinic in Rochester Minn before his appointment to the United States Court of Appeals in 1959 Thats no place to grow rich and its certainly no place to become very popular Problems Finding Law Jobs For many in the audience there was a certain irony in Justice Blackmuns comments about the pitfalls and opportunities of legal practice Unlike their peers at more prominent institutions like Columbia and New York Universities students at New York Law School have had increasing difficulty finding lawrelated jobs in recent years A considerable number of graduates have been forced to take positions only peripherally connected with their hardearned expensive legal training Placement is a serious problem acknowledged James F Simon the schools acting dean We have to convince the law firms that we have very highly qualified students Its partly a marketing exercise on our part but partly its the economy itself You cant find jobs when there are no jobs available Despite the uncertain employment prospects there was a festive even boisterous tone to yesterdays proceedings particularly for those who attended school at night while holding down fulltime jobs Flashbulbs popped hands waved wildly and individual cheering sections almost drowned out Pomp and Circumstance Justice Blackmuns visit marked another step in the New York Law Schools long and difficult road back to its former eminence Founded in 1894 by a group of dissident law professors at Columbia the school was once the largest in the country Its early faculty included Charles Evans Hughes and John Marshall Harlan class of 1924 both of whom went on to the United States Supreme Court Schools Decline Reversed In the 1930s and 1940s however New York Law School went into decline and even closed at one point That pattern has been reversed in the past decade and now more than 1500 students attend its day and night divisions The school is on Worth Street in lower Manahttan The enthusiastic reception given Justice Blackmun  best known for writing the 1973 majority opinion in Roe v Wade which legalized abortion  reflected the increasing attention and respect he has earned in legal academic circles since joining the High Court in 1970 Both before and after his speech he received standing ovations Dean Simon hailed him for his capacity for growth as a jurist and his openmindness and noted that like many of those graduating Justice Blackmun came from a family of limited means His opinions Dean Simon continued reflect the man loyal to his country and its institutions caring and sensitive to the needs of its individual citizens Getting Away From Washington On several occasions principally in dissent Justice Blackmun has urged his colleagues to emerge from the isolation of their Washington chambers and become as he wrote in one opinion part of the real world One has to get away from Washington every once in a while he said before his speech I like law students I like what I see in law schools these days and it does me a lot of good I come back refreshed and it makes me feel a little bit younger The oldest and perhaps the most joyous graduate yesterday was Martin P Levin 64 years old Mr Levin once head of the Association of American Publishers will retire this year as head of the book publishing group of The Times Mirror Company to practice law teach and serve as a liaison to the publishing industry in the Mayors Office of Economic Development Most people when they get to retirement look at it as a termination theyre going to play golf and go fishing Mr Levin said To me its really a new beginning Look around you see these kids and I feel just as young as they are and just as happy Maybe happier Justice Blackmun was one of four people who received honorary Doctor of Law degrees The other recipients were CONSTANCE BAKER MOTLEY Chief Judge United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in view of your brilliant

'PRENATAL ADOPTION' IS THE OBJECTIVE OF NEW TECHNIQUE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/14/science/prenatal-adoption-is-the-objective-of-new-technique.html,THE art of laboratory fertilization of humans has progressed far in recent years and now some medical scientists are trying to add yet another new dimension to the work through a technique that might broaden farther the range of infertility problems that can be overcome The technique is known as ovum transfer or adoptive pregnancy because the ovum the mature female egg cell  is supplied by a woman donor not by the prospective mother herself and is implanted in the prospective mothers womb after fertilization in the donor If future success with ovum transfer matches the hopes of scientists in the field it might make pregnancy possible for women who lack functional ovaries altogether It could also be used for women unwilling to risk normal pregnancies with their own genetic contribution because of family history of such serious diseases as hemophilia TaySachs disease or cystic fibrosis Their husbands sperm cells could be used but the donors egg cells would be used as substitutes for their own For the present however the objective of such prenatal adoptions is to offer a safe and effective alternative to present techniques and to avoid the surgery that such techniques require Ovum transfer in the laboratory has produced successful pregnancies in species ranging from rats to baboons and chimpanzees and is fast becoming routine in cattle breeding To date only a group at the University of California at Los Angeles is known to have tried it on humans though a related technique has been used at least once in Australia in an effort to achieve an adoptive pregnancy in a woman The procedures involve the same ethical and legal concerns that have attended laboratory fertilizations and pregnancies produced by artificial insemination with donated sperm Some people oppose any interference in natural reproduction processes Others contend that if such interference can overcome a problem of infertility or prevent tragic illness it should be encouraged The new efforts have evoked some controversy in Australia but evidently not in the United States where the program was preceded by extensive review and discussion by special panels at the university The attempt in Australia produced a pregnancy that ended in spontaneous abortion after a short time In the United States three attempts have been made the first of which failed to produce a pregnancy the scientists said in a brief report in the British medical journal The Lancet As for the two more recent attempts in California Dr John E Buster leader of the medical research team there said it was still too early to tell whether a pregnancy had been established or not Dr Stephen P Boyers who helped design the University of California project and was a member of the research team until last year said the first such success would appear to be only a matter of time Similar methods have been used in research with about 14 different animal species since 1890 he said Indeed ovum transfer has become a major tool of commercial cattle breeding in this country within the last few years Dr Boyers estimated that as many as 60000 cows had been born from such adoptive pregnancies in the United States with no detectable increase in the frequency of birth defects The conventional technique of laboratory fertilization for humans was developed by Dr Robert Edwards and Dr Patrick Steptoe in England The first such testtube baby was born in 1978 and the method has since been used successfully throughout the world In the conventional technique mature egg cells are removed from the prospective mother by surgery and fertilized in laboratory glassware with the husbands sperm A fertilized egg is then returned to the womans reproductive tract after growth in vitro literally in glass for several days The technique is called in vitro fertilization and a great deal of evidence has accumulated that it is effective safe and produces healthy babies But in vitro fertilization unlike ovum transfer requires surgery under general anesthesia An incision is made near the womans umbilicus for removal of the mature egg cell The women to whom it offers the last hope of pregnancy have often repeatedly undergone surgery in efforts to repair the blocked Fallopian tubes that had prevented normal pregnancy Such women would need yet another operation for every effort at in vitro fertilization Dr Boyers noted and multiple attempts must often be made to achieve pregnancy Many patients are willing to accept this necessity Others are not In the Australian case of ovum transfer reported earlier this year by Dr John Leeton and colleagues at Monash University in Melbourne a woman who had failed to become pregnant in many attempts through artificial insemination was given a laboratoryfertilized donor egg cell from another woman and became pregnant according to a report from that group The woman aborted spontaneously after 10 weeks Method Used on Coast The method developed in California is substantially different The prospective mother is first matched as to blood type and physical characteristics with potential donors Donors patient and the patients husband are all screened both medically and psychologically to satisfy the medical team that they understand the experimental treatment and are suitable for it The actual attempt is made when a donor and patient are found to be synchronized in ovulatory cycle At a time determined by hormone measurements the donor is impregnated through artificial insemination using sperm from the prospective mothers husband The fertilized egg is then removed by lavage a washing of the uterine cavity with a harmless fluid In the case described in The Lancet the artificial insemination was done March 15 Five days later the donors egg cell now fertilized was washed gently out of the donors reproductive tract By then the egg cell had grown to an early embryo of 14 cells which was recovered photographed for the scientific record then deposited by catheter in the patient This is to our knowledge the first report of deliberate in vivo fertilization successful nonsurgical recovery of a deliberately fertilized ovum and attempted transfer of that fertilized ovum to an infertile woman the report in the medical journal said The authors were Dr Buster Dr Boyers who is now in private practice Maria Bustillo Ian Thorneycroft James A Simon and John R Marshall all of the University of California group and Richard G Seed and John A Louw of Fertility and Genetic Research Inc a company that has supported the research with a 400000 grant and developed equipment used in the procedure We see nonsurgical ovum donor transfer as an alternative to in vitro fertilization when an infertile couple is willing to accept a donated ovum the report in The Lancet said The scientists said the technique could be performed in the doctors office and moreover could be repeated until pregnancy was achieved Possible Problem for Donor Ovum transfer entails one unusual potential problem A donor might become pregnant accidentally if lavage fails to remove a fertilized egg Prospective donors are informed of this possibility which is considered unlikely and are offered the opportunity of abortion within days of the unsuccessful lavage Dr Georgeanna S Jones a pioneer in use of in vitro fertilization at Eastern Virginia Medical School in Norfolk said the California group was well qualified for such research The aspect she found most worth considering was the future possibility of offering a semiadoptive pregnancy to a woman for whom in vitro fertilization would be impossible because of ovarian failure or for whom the risk of hereditary disease precluded normal pregnancy For women capable of ovulating she said most would probably prefer to have their own egg cells used Last week at the annual meeting of the Endocrine Society in San Antonio she said clinical research on laboratory fertilization providing new hope for therapy of hitherto untreatable infertility is enormously important Dr Luigi Mastroianni Jr chairman of obstetrics and gynecology at the University of Pennsylvania said the technique used in California would probably be acceptable to some women but that many would probably insist on becoming pregnant with their own egg cells fertilized by their husbands sperm The National Center for Health Statistics recently published a survey on fertility problems among Americans indicating that one of every 10 American couples can be classified as infertile The survey data do not indicate how many of these could have children with the aid of the in vitro fertilization technique or the new method pioneered in California The report by the Federal agency said that there were about 43 million women of childbearing age who appeared to be infertile for one or another reason and that at least two million of them wanted children
EXCERPTS FROM COURT'S OPINION AND DISSENT ON ABORTION CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/excerpts-from-court-s-opinion-and-dissent-on-abortion-case.html,Following are excerpts from the Supreme Courts principal abortion decision today declaring unconstitutional an ordinance in Akron Ohio that limited access to abortion Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr wrote the opinion and Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor wrote the dissent From the Opinion By Justice Powell These cases come to us a decade after we held in Roe v Wade that the right of privacy grounded in the concept of personal liberty guaranteed by the Constitution encompasses a womans right to decide whether to terminate her pregnancy Legislative responses to the Courts decision have required us on several occasions and again today to define the limits of a states authority to regulate the performance of abortions And arguments continue to be made in these cases as well that we erred in interpreting the Constitution Nonetheless the doctrine of stare decisis while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a constitutional question is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law We respect it today and reaffirm Roe v Wade Today however the dissenting opinion rejects the basic premise of Roe and its progeny The dissent stops short of arguing flatly that Roe should be overruled Rather it adopts reasoning that for all practical purposes would accomplish precisely that result The dissent states that even assuming that there is a fundamental right to terminate pregnancy in some situations the states compelling interests in maternal health and potential human life are present throughout pregnancy The existence of these compelling interests turns out to be largely unnecessary however for the dissent does not think that even one of the numerous abortion regulations at issue imposes a sufficient burden on the limited fundamental right to require heightened scrutiny I In February 1978 the City Council of Arkon enacted Ordinance No 1601978 entitled Regulations of Abortions The ordinance sets forth 17 provisions that regulate the performance of abortions five of which are at issue in this case i Section 187003 requires that all abortions performed after the first trimester of pregnancy be performed in a hospital ii Section 187005 sets forth requirements for notification of and consent by parents before abortions may be performed on unmarried minors iii Section 187006 requires that the attending physician make certain specified statements to the patient to insure that the consent for an abortion is truly informed consent iv Section 187007 requires a 24hour waiting period between the time the woman signs a consent form and the time the abortion is performed v Section 187016 requires that fetal remains be disposed of in a humane and sanitary manner A violation of any section of the ordinance is punishable as a criminal misdeameanor II In Roe v Wade the Court held that the right of privacy  founded in the Fourteenth Amendments concept of personal liberty and restrictions upon state action  is broad enough to encompass a womans decision whether or not to terminate her pregnancy Although the Constitution does not specifically identify this right the history of this Courts constitutional adjudication leaves no doubt that the full scope of the liberty guaranteed by the Due Process Clause cannot be found in or limited by the precise terms of the specific guarantees elsewhere provided in the Constitution Central among these protected liberties is an individuals freedom of personal choice in matters of marriage and family life The decision in Roe was based firmly on this longrecognized and essential element of personal liberty At the same time the Court in Roe acknowledged that the womans fundamental right is not unqualified and must be considered against important state interests in abortion But restrictive state regulation of the right to choose abortion as with other fundamental rights subject to searching judicial examination must be supported by a compelling state interest From approximately the end of the first trimester of pregnancy the state may regulate the abortion procedure to the extent that the regulation reasonably relates to the preservation and protection of maternal health The states discretion to regulate on this basis does not however permit it to adopt abortion regulations that depart from accepted medical practice If a state requires licensing or undertakes to regulate the performance of abortions during this period the health standards adopted must be legimately related to the objective the state seeks to accomplish III Section 187003 of the Akron ordinance requires that any abortion performed upon a pregnant woman subsequent to the end of the first trimester of her pregnancy must be performed in a hospital We now hold that Sec 187003 is unconstitutional There can be no doubt that Sec 187003s secondtrimester hospitalization requirement places a significant obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion A primary burden created by the requirement is additional cost to the woman The Court of Appeals noted that there was testimony that a secondtrimester abortion costs more than twice as much in a hospital as in a clinic inhospital abortion costs 850900 whereas a dilatationandevacuation D and E abortion performed in a clinic costs 350400 Moreover the court indicated that secondtrimester abortions were rarely performed in Akron hospitals Thus a secondtrimester hospitalization requirement may force women to travel to find available facilities resulting in both financial expense and additional health risk Akron does not contend that Sec 187003 imposes only an insignificant burden on womens access to abortion but rather defends it as a reasonable health regulation This position had strong support at the time of Roe v Wade as hospitalization for secondtrimester abortions was recommended by the American Public Health Association APHA and the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG Since then however the safety of secondtrimester abortions has incresed dramatically The principal reason is that the D and E procedure is now widely and successfully used for secondtrimester abortions The Court of Appeals found that there was an abundance of evidence that D and E is the safest method of performing postfirst trimester abortions today Change in Groups View For our purposes an even more significant factor is that experience indicates that D and E may be performed safely on an outpatient basis in appropriate nonhospital facilities The evidence is strong enough to have convinced the APHA to abandon its prior recommendation of hospitalization for all secondtrimester abortions Similarly the ACOG no longer suggests that all secondtrimester abortions be performed in hospital It recommends that abortions performed in a physicians office or outpatient clinic be limited to 14 weeks of pregnancy but it indicates that abortions may be performned safely in a hospitalbased or in a freestanding ambulatory surgical facility or in an outpatient clinic meeting the criteria required for a freestanding surgical facility until 18 weeks of pregnancy These developments and the professional commentary supporting them constitute impressive evidence that  at least during the early weeks of the second trimester  D and E abortions may be performed as safely in an outpatient clinic as in a fullservice hospital We conclude therefore that present medical knowledge convincingly undercuts Akrons justification for requiring that all secondtrimester abortions be performed in a hospital By preventing the performance of D and E abortions in an appropriate nonhospital setting Akron has imposed a heavy and unnecessary burden on womens access to a relatively inexpensive otherwise accessible and safe abortion procedure IV We turn next to Sec 187005B the provision prohibiting a physician from performing an abortion on a minor pregnant woman under the age of 15 unless he obtains the informed written consent of one of her parents or her legal guardian or unless the minor obtains an order from a court having jurisdiction over her that the obortion be performed or induced The relevant legal standards are not in dispute The Court has held that the state may not impose a blanket provision  requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor In Bellotti v Baird 1979 a majority of the Court indicated that a states interest in protecting immature minors will sustain a requirement of a consent substitute either parental or judicial The Bellotti II plurality cautioned however that the state must provide an alternative procedure whereby a pregnant minor may demonstrate that she is sufficiently mature to make the abortion decision herself or that despite her immaturity an abortion would be in her best interests Under these decisions it is clear that Akron may not make a blanket determination that all minors under the age of 15 are too immature to make this decision or that an abortion never may be in the minors best interests without parental approval proceedings but that statute neither mentions minors abortions nor suggests that the Ohio Juvenile Court has authority to inquire into a minors maturity or emancipation In these circumstances we do not think that the Akron ordinance as applied in Ohio juvenile proceedings is reasonably susceptible of being construed to create an opportunity for casebycase evaluations of the maturity of pregnant minors We therefore affirm the Court of Appeals judgment that Sec 187005B is unconstitutional V The Akron ordinance provides that no abortion shall be performed except with the informed written consent of the pregnant woman  given freely and without coercion Sec 187006A The decision to have an abortion has implications far broader than those associated with most other kinds of medical treatment and thus the state legitimately may seek to insure that it has been made in the light of all attendant circumstances  psychological and emotional as well as physical  that might be relevant to the wellbeing of the patient This does not mean however that a state has unreviewable authority to decide what information a woman must be given before she chooses to have an abortion It remains primarily the responsibility of the physician to insure that appropriate information is conveyed to his patient depending on her particular circumstances Danforths recognition of the states interest in insuring that this information be given will not justify abortion regulations designed to influence the womans informed choice between abortion or childbirth Viewing the citys regulations in this light we believe that Sec 187006B attempts to extend the states interest in insuring informed consent beyond permissible limits First it is fair to say that much of the information required is designed not to inform the womans consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether Subsection 3 requires the physician to inform his patient that the unborn child is a human life from the moment of conception a requirement inconsistent with the Courts holding in Roe v Wade that a state may not adopt one theory of when life begins to justify its regulation of abortions Moreover much of the detailed description of the anatomical and physiological characteristics of the particular unborn child required by subsection 3 would involve at best speculation by the physician And subsection 5 that begins with the dubious statement that abortion is a major surgical procedure and proceeds to describe numerous possible physical and psychological complications of abortion is a parade of horribles intended to suggest that abortion is a particularly dangerous procedure An additional and equally decisive objection to Sec 187006B is its intrusion upon the discretion of the pregnant womans physician In Danforth the Court wanred against placing the physician in just such an undesired and uncomfortable straitjacket VI The Akron ordinance prohibits a physician from performing an abortion until 24 hours after the pregnant woman signs a consent form Sec 187007 We find that Akron has failed to demonstrate that any legitimate state interest is furthered by an arbitrary and inflexible waiting period There is no evidence suggesting that the abortion procedure will be performed more safely Nor are we convinced that the states legitimate concern that the womans decision be informed is reasonably served by requiring a 24hour delay as a matter of course In accordance with the ethical standards of the profession a physician will advise the patient to defer the abortion when he thinks this will be beneficial to her But if a woman after appropriate counseling is prepared to give her written informed consent and proceed with the abortion a state may not demand that she delay the effectuation of that decision From the Dissent By Justice OConnor Joined by Justice White and Justice Rehnquist It is apparent from the Courts opinion that neither sound constitutional theory nor our need to decide cases based on the application of neutral principles can accommodate an analytical framework that varies according to the stages of pregnancy where those stages and their concomitant standards of review differ according to the level of medical technology available when a particular challenge to state regulation occurs Our recent cases indicate that a regulation imposed on a lawful abortion is not unconstitutional unless it unduly burdens the right to seek an abortion  In my view this unduly burdensome standard should be applied to the challenged regulations throughout the entire pregnancy without reference to the particular stage of pregnancy involved If the particular regulation does not unduly burden the fundamental right then our evaluation of that regulation is limited to our determination that the regulation rationally relates to legitimate state purpose Irrespective of what we may believe is wise or prudent policy in this difficult area the Constitution does not constitute us as Platonic Guardians nor does it vest in this Court the authority to strike down laws because they do not meet our standards of desirable social policy wisdom or common sense  The trimester or threestage approach adopted by the Court in Roe and in a modified form employed by the Court to analyze the state regulations in these cases cannot be supported as a legitimate or useful framework for accommodating the womens right and the states interests The decision of the Court today graphically illustrates why the trimester approach is a completely unworkable method of accommodating the conflicting personal rights and compelling state interests that are involved in the abortion context As the Court indicates today the states compelling interest in maternal health changes as medical technology changes and any health regulation must not depart from accepted medical practice In applying this standard the Court holds that the safety of secondtrimester abortions has increased dramatically since 1973 when Roe was decided Lines Have Been Blurred It is not difficult to see that despite the Courts purported adherence to the trimester approach adopted in Roe the lines drawn in that decision have now been blurred because of what the Court accepts as technological advancement in the safety of abortion procedure The state must continuously and conscientiously study contemporary medical and scientific literature in order to determine whether the effect of a particular regulation is to depart from accepted medical practice insofar as particular procedures and particular periods within the trimester are concerned Assuming that legislative bodies are able to engage in this exacting task it is difficult to believe that our Constitution requires that they do it as a prelude to protecting the health of their citizens It is even more difficult to believe that this court without the resources available to those bodies entrusted with making legislative choices believes itself competent to make these inquiries and to revise these standards every time the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists ACOG or similar group revises its views about what is and what is not appropriate medical procedure in this area Indeed the ACOG standards on which the Court relies were changed in 1982 after trial in the present cases Before ACOG changed its standards in 1982 it recommended that all midtrimester abortions be performed in a hospital As todays decision indicates medical technology is changing and this change will necessitate our continued functioning as the nations ex officio medical board with powers to approve or disapprove medical and operative practices and standards throughout the United States Just as improvements in medical technology inevitably will move forward the point at which the state may regulate for reasons of maternal health different technological improvements will move backward the point of viability at which the state may proscribe abortions except when necessary to preserve the life and health of the mother Scientific Gains Noted In 1973 viability before 28 weeks was considered unusual However recent studies have demonstrated increasingly earlier fetal viability It is certainly reasonable to believe that fetal viability in the first trimester of pregnancy may be possible in the not too distant future The Roe framework then is clearly on a collision course with itself As the medical risks of various abortion procedures decrease the point at which the state may regulate for reasons of maternal health is moved further forward to actual childbirth As medical science becomes better able to provide for the separate existence of the fetus the point of viability is moved further back toward conception Moreover it is clear that the trimester approach violates the fundamental aspiration of judicial decisionmaking through the application of neutral principles sufficiently absolute to give them roots throughout the community and continuity over significant periods of time  The state interest in potential human life is extant throughout pregnancy In Roe the Court held that although the State had an important and legitimate interest in protecting potential life that interest could not become compelling until the point at which the fetus was viable The difficulty with this analysis is clear potential life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterward At any stage in pregnancy there is the potential for human life The choice of viability as the point at which the state interest in potential life becomes compelling is no less arbitrary than choosing any point before viability or any point afterward Accordingly I believe that the states interest in protecting potential human life exists throughout the pregnancy We must always be mindful that the Constitution does not compel a state to finetune its statutes so as to encourage or facilitate abortions To the contrary state action encouraging childbirth except in the most urgent circumstances is rationally related to the legitimate government objective of protecting potential life  The hospitalization requirement does not imose an undue burden and it is not necessary to apply an exacting standard of review Further the regulation has a rational relation to a valid state objective of insuring the health and welfare of its citizens The states compelling interests in maternal physical and mental health and protection of fetal life clearly justify the waiting period As we acknowledged in Danforth the decision to abort is a stressful one and the waiting period reasonably relates to the states interest in insuring that a woman does not make this serious decision in undue haste The decision also has grave consequences for the fetus whose life the state has a compelling interest to protect and preserve No other medical procedure involves the purposeful termination of a potential life The waiting period is surely a small cost to impose to insure that the womans decision is wellconsidered in light of its certain and irreparable consequences on fetal life and the possible effects on her own

"COURT REAFFIRMS RIGHT TO ABORTION AND BARS VARIETY OF LOCAL CURBS; Excerpts from Akron case, page B10.",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/court-reaffirms-right-abortion-bars-variety-local-curbs-excerpts-akron-case-page.html,The Supreme Court today forcefully reaffirmed the constitutional right to obtain an abortion and struck down an array of local legislative restrictions on access to abortions In the most sweeping of three decisions the Court declared unconstitutional an Akron Ohio ordinance that placed a number of obstacles in the path of access to abortion The provisions struck down by the 6to3 ruling included a 24hour waiting period a requirement that all abortions after the first three months of pregnancy be performed in hospitals and a highly detailed informed consent provision that required a doctor to tell a woman seeking an abortion that the fetus is a human life from the moment of conception and that abortion can have dire physical and emotional consequences It is fair to say Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr wrote for the Court that much of the information required is designed not to inform the womans consent but rather to persuade her to withhold it altogether a motive that he said was forbidden by the Courts earlier abortion rulings The decisions had considerable practical and symbolic importance Twentyone states including New York New Jersey and Connecticut limit secondtrimester abortions to hospitals Those restrictions are now invalid The rulings were hailed as major victories by all the principal organizations advocating free choice on abortion A lawyer for the American Civil Liberties Union hailed the decision on the Akron law as an enormous victory for womens rights but a spokesman for the National Right to Life Committee said the Court had defended the interests not of women but of the assemblyline abortion industry Page B11 Dissent by Justice OConnor The Akron City Council enacted the ordinance in 1978 and intended it to be a national model for regulating abortions The Reagan Administration argued before the Supreme Court in support of the ordinance urging the Justices to adopt a deferential standard in reviewing legislators decisions to restrict access to abortion The majority opinion in the Akron case was joined by Chief Justice Warren E Burger and Associate Justices Harry A Blackmun William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and John Paul Stevens Associate Justice Sandra Day OCon Excerpts from Akron case page B10 By LINDA GREENHOUSE Special to the New York Times nor wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Associate Justices Byron R White and William H Rehnquist Justice OConnor said the state had a legitimate interest in protecting the fetuss health through the entire pregnancy The decision was the first indication of Justice OConnors views on abortion since she joined the Court in October 1981 and her position came as something of a surprise She had supported free choice on abortion in her early years in Arizona politics a position she had never completely disavowed and President Reagan was criticized by antiabortion groups for naming to the Supreme Court someone who was not an implacable opponent of abortion 10 Years Since Roe v Wade The decisions came 10 years and several months after the Supreme Court ruled in Roe v Wade that the fundamental right of privacy guaranteed by the Constitution included the right to decide to have an abortion While the question of whether to overrule Roe v Wade was technically not before the Court the Reagan Administrations participation as well as the continuing debate in Congress over whether to amend the Constitution to restrict abortion created a charged atmosphere insuring that the decisions would have an impact beyond the confines of the specific questions the cases presented In his opinion Justice Powell obliquely acknowledged the atmosphere surrounding the cases and went out of his way to emphasize that the Court intended to stand by the 1973 decision and had no plans to overrule it Since Roe v Wade he said The Court repeatedly and consistently has accepted and applied the basic principle that a woman has a fundamental right to make the highly personal choice whether or not to terminate her pregnancy Arguments continue to be made he said that we erred in interpreting the Constitution Nonetheless the doctrine of stare decisis while perhaps never entirely persuasive on a constitutional question is a doctrine that demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law We respect it today and reaffirm Roe v Wade Stare decisis is a judicial doctrine under which courts consider themselves bound by precedent Janet Benshoof director of the reproductive freedom project of the American Civil Liberties Union which brought the constitutional challenge to the Akron ordinance said the decision was the most farreaching victory on reproductive rights since Roe v Wade That view was echoed by leaders of the National Abortion Rights Action League Planned Parenthood and other groups Not All Curbs Struck Down The Court did not strike down every abortion restriction presented by todays cases A second decision involved a Missouri law regulating abortion While invalidating Missouris secondtrimester hospitalization requirement by the same 6to3 vote the Court voted 5 to 4 to uphold three other sections of that law These require a pathologists analysis of tissue removed in clinic abortions a second physicians assistance at thirdtrimester abortions which are typically serious medical emergencies to protect the interests of a possibly viable fetus and parental or judicial consent before an abortion may be performed on a teenage girl who is not considered emancipated or mature enough to make her own decision The parental consent ruling appeared essentially to restate a 1979 Supreme Court decision on a similar requirement in Massachusetts While upholding the Missouri approach which strictly limits the right of the judge to withhold consent the Court today struck down the parental consent portion of the Akron ordinance finding that it did not adequately protect the right of mature minors to make their own decisions Justice Powell also wrote the Missouri decision Only Chief Justice Burger signed his opinion on the three disputed sections but Justices OConnor Rehnquist and White agreed with the result in a separate opinion Doctors Conviction Affirmed In the third decision today the Court affirmed the criminal conviction of a Virginia obstetrician for performing a secondtrimester abortion in a clinic that was not licensed for that purpose In an 8to1 decision by Justice Powell the Court rejected the doctors challenge to Virginias hospitalization requirement concluding that Virginia unlike Akron and Missouri properly permitted secondtrimester abortions in adequately equipped clinics Central to the decision striking down the Akron and Missouri hospitalization requirements were data presented to the Court by medical groups principally the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists The data showed that new techniques had made secondtrimester abortions much safer than they were in 1973 when the Court suggested in Roe v Wade that states could limit abortions to hospitals after the first 12 weeks of pregnancy The college changed its own guidelines last year to endorse outpatient abortions up to the 18th week of pregnancy Justice Powell said he found this evidence impressive and concluded that the hospital requirement which typically doubles the cost of the procedure imposed a heavy and unnecessary burden on womens access to a relatively inexpensive otherwise accessible and safe abortion procedure Womans Health Is Key The opinion Akron v Akron Center for Reproductive Health No 81746 reaffirmed the holding of Roe v Wade that the states only legitimate purpose for regulating abortion in the second trimester was to protect the pregnant womans health It was this approach to which Justice OConnor objected in her dissenting opinion The states interest in protecting the fetus which Roe v Wade held to be appropriate only after the fetus is viable exists throughout the pregnancy she said adding Potential life is no less potential in the first weeks of pregnancy than it is at viability or afterward Justice Powell responded in a footnote to his majority opinion writing that the dissenting opinion rejects the basic premise of Roe The effect of the dissents views would be to drive the performance of many abortions back underground he said
PRESBYTERIANS SUPPORT PRELATES' ARMS LETTER,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/presbyterians-support-prelates-arms-letter.html,The highest policymaking body of the Presbyterian Church USA has voted to send each of its 13000 congregations a copy of the United States Roman Catholic bishops pastoral letter on nuclear war The churchs General Assembly which ended its annual meeting in Atlanta yesterday urged members to consider the letter of great historical theological and educational significance In the action described by officials of the conference as a virtual endorsement of the views expressed in the bishops letter the Presbyterian convention noted that it was not in agreement with the letters comments opposing abortion The nearly 1000 delegates from congregations of the 32millionmember church also endorsed the idea of an AmericanSoviet freeze on nuclear weapons and asked for a delay in the deployment of any new nuclear weapons The resolution on the bishops letter and the nuclear freeze received overwhelming approval from the delegates in a standing vote On Tuesday the convention adopted a resolution that said abortion could be considered a responsible choice within a Christian ethical framework However the resolution said Presbyterians might have varied opinions on abortion and asked the church to work to minimize abortion The statement which parallels views expressed at other assemblies by North American Presbyterians was approved by a vote of 800 to 100 as the newly formed Presbyterian denomination conducted its first business sessions after merging the United Presbyterian Church in the USA with the Presbyterian Church in the US The statement on abortion said the operation could be a responsible choice when serious genetic problems arise or when the resources are not adequate to care for a child appropriately In other action the church said it would emphasize evangelism as a necessary urgent and major priority Membership in Presbyterian churches has been declining although the loss has slowed in recent years The Rev Robert Meneilly of Prairie Village Kan called for goals of a million more active Presbyterians in the next five years A special presbytery or regional unit of the church will be formed for Koreans in Hawaii and southern California under convention action

CIVIL LIBERTIES UNION HAILS RULING AS WOMEN'S RIGHTS VICTORY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/16/us/civil-liberties-union-hails-ruling-as-women-s-rights-victory.html,Lawyers at the American Civil Liberties Union who specialize in cases involving free choice on abortion yesterday hailed the Supreme Court ruling on the Akron Ohio law and said they expected it to lead to nullification of laws limiting womens choice in many other states This is an enormous victory for womens rights said Suzanne Lynn one of the organizations lawyers who prepared arguments for the Court in behalf of three abortion clinics that opposed the Akron law Douglas Johnson legislative director of the National Right to Life Committee in Washington the leading antiabortion organization agreed that the Akron case was the most significant of the rulings and that it would likely lead to the nullification of state laws that delay or restrict access to abortions But in contrast to the civil liberties group Mr Johnson said We think the Court defended the interests not of women but of the assemblyline abortion industry Hatch Argues for Debate Senator Orrin G Hatch the Utah Republican who is sponsoring a constitutional amendment to reverse the 1973 Supreme Court ruling that legalized abortion said the decisions were a tremendous disappointment to the right to life movement He said the rulings underscored the importance of Senate debate on his proposed amendment I dont have a lot of confidence that the Senate with its present makeup will pass this constitutional amendment he said but I think it is important to have it debated In Akron Ray Kapper president of the City Council which enacted the law in 1978 said he believed the Supreme Court was not in tune with whats going on in life But he said he thought the city would accept what it regarded as a defeat and not try to enact another antiabortion ordinance On the matter of parental consent for minors abortions required under the ordinance Mr Kapper said I still maintain that in this state a girl 11 to 15 years old is not mature enough to make decisions on matters such as this Halt to Legislation Seen Miss Lynn who said the civil liberties union operated the only unit devoted exclusively to nationwide litigation on abortion rights said she believed the Courts rulings would put a virtual stop to the passage of state and city laws restricting womens access to abortions But she said she expected opponents of abortion to renew their drive for a constitutional amendment to outlaw the procedure Mr Johnson said his organization was certainly going to pursue a constitutional amendment But he added we also hope the President will take note of the extremism of the Supreme Court and will keep it in mind when there are future openings on the court Lawyers at the civil liberties union characterized the decisions as a defeat for the Reagan Administration But Solicitor General Rex E Lee who argued the case for the Administration said the result was neither a major victory nor a major defeat for either side in the national debate If you look at it from the standpoint of individual issues Mr Lee said we won some and we lost some

The Court Draws the Line,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/17/opinion/the-court-draws-the-line.html,In forthright terms the Supreme Court has now turned back a sneak attack on Roe v Wade the 1973 decision that declared a womans right to decide whether to give birth to an unwanted child Rather than challenge that basic right directly antiabortion forces asked only that the Court approve a few rules like  Forcing women to have secondtrimester operations in hospitals where the costs average twice as high as in competently run clinics  Forcing all teenagers regardless of maturity or family circumstances to seek parental consent for abortions  Forcing all women to wait an extra 24 hours after requesting an abortion whatever the added cost or hardship  Forcing doctors under threat of criminal prosecution to tell each patient that the fetus is a human life from the moment of conception and that the operation is a major surgical procedure fraught with danger The city of Akron and the State of Missouri defended these housekeeping rules and three Justices voted to uphold them But Justice Lewis Powell writing for the majority recognized that approving them could imperil the abortion right itself Justice Powells realism was more than a match for the icy indifference of Justice Sandra OConnors dissent She saw nothing wrong with requiring hospitalization for even the earliest abortions But that Justice Powell replied would drive the performance of many abortions back underground free of effective regulation and often without the attendance of a physician A 24hour coolingoff period may seem reasonable but the majority realized as Justice OConnor would not its devastating effect on poor women who cant afford the time or the travel to return for the operation And forcing doctors to utter statecomposed theories of when human life begins would demean their profession and accomplish indirectly what the state may not do directly talk the woman out of exercising her right in the guise of encouraging informed consent The dissents sharpest argument was against the Courts sanction for accepted medical practice and improved technical skills that now make it unreasonable to outlaw clinical abortions in the middle three months of pregnancy The majority merely recognized reality Justices OConnor Rehnquist and White lamented the Courts attempt to draw such lines for privacy and personal liberty contending that the same legislatures that draw up these oppressive regulations are in the best position to decide how to regulate abortion The majority fortunately understand that drawing the lines they did is basic to the Courts  and the laws  selfrespect thus far and no farther will it give ground on fundamental rights
REAGAN URGES CONGRESS TO NULLIFY SUPREME COURT'S ABORTION RULINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/17/us/reagan-urges-congress-to-nullify-supreme-court-s-abortion-rulings.html,President Reagan in an unusual comment on a Supreme Court decision expressed profound disappointment today at the Courts reaffirmation of the constitutional right to abortion In a statement issued at the White House the President called on Congress to make its voice heard and pass legislation to overrule the Court which on Wednesday struck down several legislative restrictions on access to abortions Our society is confronted with a great moral issue the taking of the life of an unborn child Mr Reagan declared in the printed statement Accordingly I join millions of Americans expressing profound disappointment at the decisions announced by the Supreme Court in striking down several efforts by states and localities to control the circumstances under which abortion may be performed The Presidents view was echoed by such Roman Catholic leaders as Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York who said that one of our most basic institutions had dealt a lethal blow to human values Denouncing the manipulation by so many mothers to destroy unborn life the Cardinal issued an appeal for a constitutional amendment to overrule the Court Battle in Senate Expected Organizations supporting the Courts decisions said that while the ruling limited the possibilities for legislative restrictions on abortion the controversy was far from over The next skirmish is expected to occur later this month when the Senate debates an antiabortion proposal The measure a constitutional amendment reads in its entirety A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution Several other proposals to restrict abortions are pending in Congress While the President issued the strong statement today White House officials said there was no plan on the Administrations part to try to resolve the differences among antiabortion groups over the varying proposals The President mentioned the issue only briefly when he spoke at a fundraising event tonight for Senator Jesse Helms the North Carolina Republican who has championed antiabortion proposals In speaking at the Sheraton Washington the President referred to the Senators yearning for two blessed days These he said are the day when we welcome the Lord back into the classroom and the day when we protect the life of the unborn Termed a Legislative Question The issue of abortion must be resolved by democratic process Mr Reagan declared in his White House statement He favorably cited the dissent from the 6to3 ruling by his appointee Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor in which she contended that the legislature is the appropriate forum for regulation of abortion In issuing the Presidents statement a White House official responded to questions by saying that of course the Administration intended to enforce the law as defined by the Court while also seeking its reversal Once again the President said I call on the Congress to make its voice heard against abortion on demand and to restore legal protections for the unborn whether by statute or constitutional amendment

STATES ARE CHANGING THE ABORTION RULES VOIDED BY TOP COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/18/nyregion/states-are-changing-the-abortion-rules-voided-by-top-court.html,The State Health Departments of New York New Jersey and Connecticut reported yesterday they were preparing to revise their regulations to comply with the United States Supreme Courts decision allowing abortions after the first three months of pregnancy to be performed in clinics The courts decision on Tuesday invalidated health regulations in the three states along with similar regulations in 18 others that required that abortions in the second trimester of pregnancy  or from the 12th to the 20th week of pregnancy  be performed in hospitals Hospital abortions in the final trimester of pregnancy or after 20 weeks are rarely performed and then only when the life of the mother is threatened At least one abortion clinic the Eastern Womens Center at 14 East 60th Street in Manhattan said it would begin to offer secondtrimester abortions immediately However other clinics are not expected to perform them until their staffs have been retrained Make Abortions Much Safer According to Alfred E Moran executive vice president of Planned Parenthood of New York the courts ruling will make abortions much safer and less expensive by allowing firsttrimester abortion techniques used in clinics to be used in secondtrimester procedures Mr Moran said the prevailing procedure in hospitals was to induce delivery of the aborted fetus by injecting a saline solution He said clinical experience showed that abortions employing dilatation and evacuation techniques were more appropriate in most cases Mr Moran also said the courts ruling eliminates regulations that require first and secondtrimester abortions to be performed in different health facilities Dr Thomas Kerenyi medical director of the Eastern Womens Center said Improved medical techniques associated with low risk factors allow physicians to safely terminate most late pregnancies by dilatation and evacuation
HIGH COURT CLEARS UP ANY DOUBTS ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/weekinreview/high-court-clears-up-any-doubts-on-abortion.html,A key part of the antiabortion movements strategy during the past few years has been to send the Supreme Court a message According to this scenario continual efforts to amend the Constitution and to strip the Court of its jurisdiction to decide abortion cases would keep the pressure on Justices who have grown increasingly weary and conservative eventually persuading them to reconsider their 1973 decision that established a constitutional right to abortion Last week the movement got the reconsideration it sought It was the Supreme Court however that sent a message The 6to3 decision did more than strike down a potpourri of local restrictions on access to abortion The Justices could have declared the Akron Ohio abortion regulations unconstitutional while still leaving in doubt the strength of their commitment to the decadeold principles of Roe v Wade which established that the fundamental constitutional right to privacy includes the right to have an abortion Instead the Court reached beyond the Akron case using the decision as a vehicle to make a very deliberate very forceful point We meant it Justice Lewis F Powell Jr wrote for the majority when in 1973 we said a woman has a fundamental right to make the highly personal choice whether or not to terminate her pregnancy We did not decide Roe v Wade casually it was not an aberration and we do not apologize for it We have reaffirmed it repeatedly and consistently In a society governed by the rule of law we stand by our precedents Once stated the result seems obvious in a dozen abortion rulings since 1973 as the political climate grew ever more fervid the Court had not turned away from the principles of Roe v Wade The decision was a legal embarrassment for the Reagan Administration The Federal Government had not participated in the lower courts in either the Akron case or a companion case from Missouri neither of which implicated any Federal program or other legal interest Nonetheless Solicitor General Rex E Lee filed a brief urging the Justices to use these appeals to create a new rule that judges should abandon strict constitutional scrutiny in reviewing abortion cases and should instead accord heavy deference to the preferences of legislators The alternative Mr Lee warned the Justices during the argument last November is having these cases come back year after year after year with the list of applicable Federal constitutional rules becoming longer and longer and longer The Court declined the invitation with even Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor indicating in a footnote to her dissenting opinion that the Administration had overstated its case As it turned out the majority might have hit on the best weapon against the specter of endless litigation raised by the Solicitor General  a reaffirmation forceful enough to persuade people that further efforts to change the rules will be futile Indeed the legacy of last weeks ruling may be to defuse abortion as a political issue That was not its immediate result of course Antiabortion spokesmen vowed to keep up the fight Congressional supporters of a constitutional amendment to ban abortion said they would bring it to the floor this week President Reagan expressed his profound disappointment at the decision calling on Congress to make its voice heard against abortion on demand A Mainstream Principle Nonetheless in ways that may take time to manifest themselves fully the decision changed the framework of the abortion debate It subtly shifted the burden of battle Until last week the burden was on prochoice advocates who were fighting to preserve the status quo There was always the argument that the Supreme Court in 1973 had not fully understood the implications of what it was doing that Roe v Wade would wash away like a sand castle under the relentless waves of hostile opinion Last week when six men whose average age is 73 and who have a decade of reflection behind them reaffirmed their initial stand the constitutional right to abortion became the status quo as it had not been before The Court indeed proved conservative but in the dictionarys literal definition of preservative disposed to maintain existing institutions With the decision the right to abortion  exercised last year by 12 million American women  entered the mainstream and the burden shifted to the other side to show why it should not remain there Another effect was to illuminate the views of the newest Justice Sandra Day OConnor For the first time in nearly two full terms on the Court Justice OConnor who remained ambiguous on the subject during her confirmation hearings was forced to declare herself on the abortion question She vindicated President Reagan who endured heavy rightwing criticism two years ago for naming to the Court someone without strong antiabortion credentials The President last week singled out for special praise Justice OConnors dissenting opinion Her dissent filled with references to fetal life and potential life said the Court should reject the theoretical basis of Roe v Wade and relax its standard of review in abortion cases She was joined by Byron R White and William H Rehnquist the two Justices who dissented in Roe v Wade and who have remained unreconciled to that decision Justice OConnors arrival on the Court increases the antiabortion core to three In theory President Reagan could be lucky enough to increase it to five But he runs the risk that a Supreme Court nominee conservative enough to meet his other criteria might turn out to be a conservative who like Justice Powell or Chief Justice Warren E Burger believes that adherence to precedent demands respect in a society governed by the rule of law
FOUR NEW GOVERNORS STRIVE TO MASTER THE POLITICS OF DECLINE; LINCOLN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/weekinreview/four-new-governors-strive-to-master-the-politics-of-decline-lincoln.html,THE last four years have been hard on governors whether liberal or conservative Democrat or Republican With rare exceptions their work has been circumscribed by rising deficits and decreasing services and by an electorate that is snappish about any suggestion of new taxes Voters in economically depressed farm and industrial states of the Middle West have been throwing out incumbents and trying something new There are some in Nebraska who believe this conservative but populist state may have gone too far last November in turning out the stolid Republican Charles Thone who fit the traditional mold for Corn Belt political leaders and taking on an unconventional Vietnam veteran making his first run at statewide politics by expressing some unconventional ideas The traditionalists have had six months to push Gov Bob Kerry about At times observers here say he seems a little dazed But there are signs he is settling into the only kind of leadership role that seems to work in the current climate First he has bowed to the notion that Democratic governors in Nebraska have to adopt a conservative stance He has pushed through some marginal tax increases to help offset the persistent deficit dominating politics I believe we should view this fiscal situation he said not so much as an overwhelming or overriding preoccupation but a golden opportunity to streamline and strengthen state government That is the usual approach of governors facing sizable deficits and strong resistance to new taxes But having taken that position he has gone on to lead people into new ways of thinking Public opinion polls have shown that governors whatever their powers from state to state are the most visible public officials Some state leaders such as former Gov Bob Ray of Iowa and Gov William Winter of Mississippi have used this visibility to turn hard times into increased support for their programs usually by convincing the public that they were personally concerned about unemployment and were using whatever innovations were available to improve the economy But some such as Al Quie of Minnesota failed to master the politics of decline Mr Kerry seems to be seeking desperately to avoid that fate His election last year was a major upset An active demonstrator against the war in Vietnam who later prospered as a restaurant owner he was able to move campaign debate off abortion the death penalty and the states righttowork law and on to the economy attacking the Governor for insisting there was little he could do about unemployment and farm foreclosures The Governor cant bring down interest rates Mr Kerry said but I can make people mad about them Stirring public reaction may have been Mr Kerrys major achievement in his first six months in office His life style has increased his visibility A film crew has been shooting a movie in Lincoln to be called Terms of Endearment It stars Jack Nicholson Shirley MacLaine and Debra Winger If that were not enough to attract attention Mr Kerry had a weekend date with Miss Winger who won acclaim for her role in An Officer and a Gentleman He turns back suggestions of being another Jerry Brown of California by saying Im a fiscally conservative businessman One recent evening after a day of tussling with Nebraskas conservative unicameral Legislature Mr Kerry settled behind his desk and talked about innovations he was undertaking that would require wide public support reform of the education system a venture capital program for attracting new industries and reordering of job training and health care services At the heart of his plans are continuing efforts to educate his constituents on the need for government action A businessman came to me to complain about taxes he said I said Look you are in the top income bracket If you were smart you must have taken advantage of every tax shelter there is The trouble is everyone wants the government benefits cut for others but not for themselves  JOHN HERBERS
TOPICS; FRIVOLOUS ACTIVITIES; Supreme Waste of Time,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/19/opinion/topics-frivolous-activities-supreme-waste-of-time.html,The Supreme Court which complains its so overworked that it needs a new court to lighten the load has decided to give itself still more work The justices will now vote on which pleadings are frivolous and award damages to the other side The decision creates a whole new body of jurisprudence and a new market for lawyers Last week alone the Court voted 5 to 3 for damages in one case 7 to 2 against in another case and 6 to 3 against in two more All this over filings that justices used to glance at for two seconds and discard So far only litigious individuals are vulnerable but governments may not long be immune And what about the Justice Department Is Rex Lee the Solicitor General to go scot free after filing a brief about abortion that got no votes even on a divided Court And how about the Supreme Court itself Shouldnt someone pay when after searching for a loophole in the exclusionary rule it concluded with apologies to all that it had picked the wrong case The justices might think twice if they had to pay for their own frivolities  or they might create a new court to handle the load

AROUND THE NATION; Civil Liberties Leader Assails Administration,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/20/us/around-the-nation-civil-liberties-leader-assails-administration.html,Violating the Bill of Rights appears to be the primary goal of the Reagan Administration the executive director of the American Civil Liberties Union Ira Glasser said today We continue to face major threats across a broad range of civil liberties issues Mr Glasser told more than 300 delegates at the opening of the organizations biennial conference He said that in the first two years of the Administration the ACLU won almost every major issue involving civil liberties before Congress and in state and local legislative bodies school prayer a womans right to an abortion and proposals to limit Federal court jurisdiction over liberties guaranteed by the Constitution Still for all of those victories by the end of 1982 there were still some dark clouds ahead he said Although we had won all those victories in Congress each one of them had been eroded by executive action from the Administration itself As examples Mr Glasser cited reductions in funds for the Legal Services Corporation which provides lawyers for poor people support of the abortion restrictions that were struck down last week by the Supreme Court and attempts to limit political activity by publicly financed organizations A White House spokesman Sheila Dixon said the White House had no comment on Mr Glassers remarks
JUSTICES UPHOLD 'CANINE SNIFF' OF LUGGAGE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/21/us/justices-uphold-canine-sniff-of-luggage.html,The Supreme Court ruled today that the police may expose a travelers luggage to a narcoticsdetecting dog without violating the Constitution but the luggage may be held for only a brief period A canine sniff the Court said in an opinion by Associate Justice Sandra Day OConnor is by itself not a search within the meaning of the Fourth Amendments protection against unreasonable search and seizure But the Court said the removal of the luggage from its owner is an investigatory detention subject to constitutional limitations The Justices agreed unanimously that Federal narcotics agents violated a travelers constitutional rights when they held his suitcase at Kennedy International Airport for 90 minutes Three of the Justices said however that it was unnecessary for the Court to address the question of the canine sniff 2d Circuit Ruling Affirmed The decision affirmed a ruling by the United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit in New York That court ruled in 1981 that the detention of the luggage violated the Constitution because the Federal agents did not have probable cause to believe that it contained narcotics The Justice Department appealed seeking an endorsement by the Supreme Court of an investigatory practice that has created considerable confusion in Federal courts around the country The decision was a disappointment to the department While the Court agreed that probable cause was not required in order to detain the luggage the limits that the Justices put on the procedure left its usefulness in doubt Wider Application Possible The fact that the case involved a narcoticssniffing dog was incidental to the Courts ruling The Court analyzed the case in terms that would apply equally to the temporary detention of luggage for other purposes The holding today applies only to domestic police investigations and not to Customs searches The Supreme Court has long held that the Fourth Amendment places no limits on searches by Customs agents at the border The defendant in the case Raymond J Place was intercepted after a flight from Miami to La Guardia Airport Because there are no trained dogs at La Guardia the Federal agents had to take the luggage to Kennedy A dog there responded to one of the bags which proved to contain cocaine In Effect a Seizure The Federal agents took Mr Places luggage from him after he refused to allow them to search it In Fourth Amendment terms the luggage was seized Justice OConnor said that this seizure should be analyzed exactly as the Court has analyzed temporary detentions of people The Court ruled in 1968 in a landmark decision called Terry v Ohio that police officers who reasonably suspect illegal activity can briefly detain a person on less than probable cause The Court has never defined precisely how brief such encounters known as Terry stops must be but it is clear that they are measured in minutes and not hours The Justice Department had argued that while a prolonged detention of a person would violate the Constitution a similar detention of property can be reasonable The Court disagreed A seizure of luggage is likely to disrupt a travelers plans and can effectively restrain the person Justice OConnor said adding The limitations applicable to investigative detentions of the person should define the permissible scope of an investigative detention of the persons luggage Making of Rule Declined The Court said it would refrain from putting a rigid time limitation on a Terry stop concluding only that 90 minutes was unreasonable in this case The canine sniff itself Justice OConnor said is much less intrusive than a typical search and requires no previous suspicion of wrongdoing It was that portion of the opinion US v Place No 811617 that drew protests from Associate Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall and Harry A Blackmun They said that because the Court agreed that the seizure was unconstitutional there was no need to discuss the validity of the sniff that followed Other action at the Court today included the following Police Search The Court ruled unanimously that the police do not need a warrant to search the personal effects of someone who has been arrested and brought to the station house The decision by Chief Justice Warren E Burger overturned a ruling by an Illinois court that the police were not entitled to search a shoulder bag brought to the station house by a man they had arrested for disturbing the peace The bag contained drugs An inventory search of the property of a person under lawful arrest is an entirely reasonable administrative procedure the Chief Justice said Ill v Lafayette No 811859 Standing to Sue As a delayed second chapter to its ruling last month on tax exemptions for discriminatory private schools the Court agreed to decide who has standing  the right to bring a lawsuit  to challenge the Internal Revenue Services administration of the law The case Regan v Wright No 81970 is in one respect the other side of the coin of the ruling last month that the IRS is barred from granting the exemptions While Bob Jones University sued the IRS for refusing to grant a tax exemption the new case began as a lawsuit by black parents who charged that the service granted exemptions to private schools that were in fact discriminating The United States Court of Appeals here permitted the suit to proceed The Government is arguing that private citizens do not have standing to challenge the treatment of a third partys tax status Libel Suit The Court refused to hear an appeal by Kimerli Jayne Pring a former Miss Wyoming who sued Penthouse magazine for libel and won a 125 million judgment that was overturned by a Federal appeals court She sued over a story about a fictional Miss Wyoming that she said was identifiably based on her own life The United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit ruled that the story would have been recognized as fiction by even the most careless reader In their Supreme Court appeal Pring v Penthouse No 821621 her lawyers argued that publishers should not be able to escape liability by including a fictional passage in an article that could otherwise be taken for a factual account Abortion Limits The Court refused to hear an appeal by the City of Virginia Minn from a ruling that it could not prohibit staff physicians from performing abortions at the citys public hospital The hospital is the only one in the small community and the United States Court of Appeals ruled that while the city was not required to subsidize abortions for poor women it could not forbid the use of its facilities altogether Associate Justices Byron R White and William H Rehnquist voted to hear the appeal Virginia v Nyberg No 811782 The Court also refused to hear an appeal by a group of students at the University of California who sued to stop the university from using compulsory student health fees to provide abortions to students The students argued that the policy violated their rights to the free exercise of their religion The California state courts dismissed the suit Erzinger v Regents No 821744
SENATORS ENDORSE TOUGHER CIGARETTE WARNING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/23/us/senators-endorse-tougher-cigarette-warning.html,The Senate Labor and Human Resources Committee today endorsed legislation to strengthen the health warning on cigarette packages The proposal supported by a 15to1 vote would replace the current general warning with a specific one saying Warning Cigarette Smoking Causes Cancer Emphysema And Heart Disease May Complicate Pregnancy And Is Addictive Although the bill has no provision for the warning to accompany cigarette advertising Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon is expected to offer an amendment requiring the warning in advertising when the measure is considered by the full Senate The committees strong endorsement especially by its more conservative members and signs of the tobacco industrys willingness to compromise indicate that some legislative changes involving the cigarette warning label may pass the Senate this year The House is also considering ways to strengthen warnings to cigarette smokers Representative Henry A Waxman the sponsor of the House version of bill said today he was very pleased that the Senate panel had endorsed a strong label But the California Democrat said he still preferred his bills requirement that cigarette packages and advertising carry one of a series of specific health warnings which would be rotated every few months Each warning would focus on a single cigaretterelated problem including birth defects spontaneous abortions and death from heart disease cancer and emphysema The Senate committee dropped similar provisions for rotational warnings from its bill today in an effort to gain support for the single strongly worded warning The Senate legislation was introduced by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah A health warning has been on cigarette packages and advertising since 1966 In 1970 Congress strengthened the warning which said cigarette smoking May be Hazardous to Your Health to the current one stating Warning The Surgeon General Has Determined That Cigarette Smoking Is Dangerous to Your Health The proposed legislation calls for no change in the size of the warning label which is regulated by the Federal Trade Commission The current warning consists of four lines that have a total depth of about half an inch Regulators expect the type size and dimensions of the new warning to be roughly the same as the existing one if the proposal is approved by Congress The Tobacco Institute an industry trade group issued a statement saying that it was severely disappointed with the bill and that the existing warning is quite adequate and is serving its intended purpose Although it opposes the bill the institute has recently shown interest in negotiating a compromise On Tuesday the institute said it would agree to a warning slightly stronger than the current one on the condition that the panel delete sections of the bill that incriminate cigarette smoking as a principal cause of cancer and other diseases Panel Rejects Industry Offer But the committee rejected the industrys offer today and approved the stronger warning as an amendment to the bill which states Cigarette smoking is the largest preventable cause of illness and premature death in the United States This statement and other medical references in the bill closely follow findings in reports issued by the Surgeon General of the United States The institute maintains that while there is a statistical association between smoking and disease there is no proof that cigarettes are a direct cause of disease The industry is concerned that if the Senate panels proposed language is incorporated in law it might increase the industrys exposure to lawsuits involving product liability according to Senator John P East Republican of North Carolina Mr East cast the sole vote against the Senate proposal today He said the legislation was punitive and overregulatory and that the warning goes well beyond what the scientific findings can bear Senator Dan Quayle Republican of Indiana indicated that he had reservations about the bill by voting present

BRIDGING CONSTITUENCIES ON A TIGHTROPE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/weekinreview/bridging-constituencies-on-a-tightrope.html,As a former local official Alfonse M DAmato knows that one way to please the politicians back home is to bring them to Washington So last week the Senator led a delegation of New York State Republican county chairmen around town for a day of briefings on the Hill and at the White House This sort of politicking three and a half years before he must face the voters is hardly considered typical senatorial behavior But Mr DAmato who ran on the Republican and Conservative lines and won with only 451 percent of the vote in a threeway race in 1980 is determined not to follow the path of Senator James Buckley which led directly out of office Mr Buckley running as a Conservative also won a threeway race in 1970 then remained true to the conservatives on fiscal and social issues and was easily defeated by Democrat Daniel Patrick Moynihan in 1976 Mr DAmato in contrast is attempting to satisfy the needs of New York City and the states other urban areas and at the same time keep from alienating his ideological base which included the RighttoLife Party line in 1980 a designation he has said he will seek again So far he has managed to stay on his tightrope Indeed it has led him a long way from Hempstead Town LI where he formerly was Presiding Supervisor On fiscal items of local importance Mr DAmato has usually sided with New York State against the White House Last year he voted to override President Reagans veto of the supplemental spending bill which contained 30 million of education funds for minority and poor students He was one of four Republicans to favor 1 billion in school funds contained in an amendment put forth by Senator Robert T Stafford Republican of Vermont He has also fought for housing subsidies and been a tenacious promoter of operating assistance for mass transit winning praise from state and local officials He thinks all this will accrue to his benefit in a statewide survey pollster Arthur Finkelstein is conducting to test the Senators popularity Preliminary soundings Mr DAmato said show a 67 percent approval rating The conservatives are not unhappy either He hasnt forgotten us says Serphan Maltese executive director of the New York State Conservative Party who is on Mr DAmatos judicial screening panel and who was invited to Washington along with the GOP chairmen Al is big on mass transit but were not necessarily opposed to it He has voted right on the social issues of abortion busing and law enforcement During a cocktail party for his visitors Mr DAmato took pains to note his indebtness to the conservatives Id love to have the freedom to vote like Senator Weicker he said of the maverick Connecticut Republican with whom he has become quite friendly But theyd kill me on the right Another element in the DAmato strategy is the conscientious courting of the Jewish constituency from which he received minimal support in 1980 Immediately after his election he sought advice from Mayor Koch and Richard Ravitch the chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority on how to win over the Jewish community His schedule these days includes speaking dates before at least half a dozen Jewish groups a month His efforts thus far have resulted in some of the biggest contributors to his 1986 campaign Unlike his predecessor Jacob K Javits Mr DAmato lacks the platform of the Foreign Relations Committee but he has used his seat on the Senate foreign operations appropriations subcommittee to take the Administration to task for continuing aid to Syria And from his seat on the United States commission that oversees adherence to the Helsinki human rights accords he has voiced concern about the rights of Soviet Jews Last month in an interview in The Long Island Jewish World Mr DAmato accused Secretary of Defense Caspar W Weinberger of fanning the flames of bigotry and hatred and taking out his personal displeasure against Israel by questioning Israeli troop behavior in Lebanon I think hes been very good and very helpful said Howard Squadron president of the American Jewish Congress He has made it his business to let the Jewish community know that even though they did not support him in the last election he wants to be helpful Another element of the traditional New York State coalition the black community ignored Mr DAmato three years ago Last month the Senator attempted to build bridges by meeting with black leaders in Harlem A member of the select committee on small business he has promised to help small firms there obtain Federal contracts designated for minority businessmen As a result of all this Mr DAmato is viewed as something of a wildcard by the White House and the Senator has not been notably successful in winning patronage He told President Reagans chief of staff James A Baker that he would vote against the nomination of Kenneth L Adelman as Director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency unless the White House approved Mr DAmatos choice for Administrator of the St Lawrence Seaway Development Corporation James Emery former minority leader of the New York State Assembly Mr DAmato eventually voted for Mr Adelman and as it turned out Mr Emery will probably get the Seaway job but only because the White Houses candidate failed an FBI background check The Senator is risking another danger as well The pollster Mr Finkelstein told the New York Republicans last week that the last time around Mr DAmato had the benefit of not having a record He was successful in some measure Mr Finkelstein said because he could be who he needed to be Left unsaid was whether Mr DAmato will be equally successful trying to be all things to all people
ABORTION RULE TO BE CHANGED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/nyregion/abortion-rule-to-be-changed.html,ARECENT Supreme Court decision that struck down a number of state restrictions on access to abortion made Connecticuts regulation calling for hospitalization for all abortions to be performed after the first three months of pregnancy immediately unconstitutional and unenforceable according to Elliot F Gerson Deputy State Attorney General However the regulation as contained in the states Public Health Code will not be adjusted until the Courts opinion is thoroughly analyzed and digested said Richard Lynch a lawyer in charge of the health unit of the Attorney Generals office He said that any redrafting of the regulation would involve the Department of Health Services which would then forward the regulation to the legislatures Regulations Review Committee The matter would likely not require full General Assembly action he said because it is not a state statute As of the middle of last week Mr Lynchs office had not yet received a copy of the Courts opinion I just cant say anything until Ive seen it he said In the most sweeping of three separate decisions the Supreme Court declared as unconstitutional an Akron Ohio ordinance that limited access to abortion by setting forth several provisions In declaring the Akron ordinance unconstitutional the Court reaffirmed its decision made 10 years ago in Roe v Wade that the fundamental constitutional right to privacy includes the right to have an abortion The Courts 1973 decision provided that a state may regulate where the procedure should be done Connecticut is one of 21 states that limits secondtrimester abortions to hospitals Its regulation states that all induced abortions after the first trimester should be done in a licensed hospital with a department of obstetrics and gynecology and a department of anesthesiology Dr Estelle Siker of the Health Departments Community Health Division said that she is waiting for instructions from the Attorney Generals office before we do anything about this Until then she said if a clinic calls us and asks us what to do about a secondtrimester patient Id have to refer them to the Attorney General Abortion clinics in Connecticut are also waiting for clarification We dont consider the decision to be in effect here yet said Marie Maiden of Century Medical Center in Norwalk There are too many important things to consider One of them she said is how late into the second trimester the procedure will be done at the clinic We need to talk to our physicians she said I see us as doing the procedure until about 15 weeks Summit Womens Center which operates statelicensed clinics in Bridgeport and West Hartford is also waiting There are a lot of considerations to be made said Tamara Digman director of community education for the centers We dont want to jump the gun She said the centers will have to design a medical protocol for secondtrimester abortions The Court in its opinion written by Associate Justice Lewis F Powell Jr said the secondtrimester hospitalization requirement placed a significant obstacle in the path of women seeking an abortion The procedure is more costly in the hospital and the fact that some women must travel to find an available hospital may pose a health risk according to the Courts opinion The safety of secondtrimester abortions has increased dramatically since 1973 wrote Justice Powell In 1981 16565 abortions were performed in Connecticut in physicians offices clinics and hospitals Of those 3 percent were done in the second trimester according to Health Department statistics State Senator Regina R Smith Democrat of Northford who has in the past introduced legislation that had involved protective measures for abortion clinics in Connecticut said she was surprised and dismayed by the Supreme Court ruling Personally she said I feel this is unfortunate A woman could be sixmonths pregnant and be undergoing an abortion away from a hospital I suppose we could do something about this in the legislature but it would probably be fruitless ProChoice and Right to Life groups in Connecticut also reacted to the Supreme Court decision We see it as a clear victory for ProChoice Were very pleased said Dereka Smith the acting coordinator of the Connecticut National Abortion Rights Action League Pat Wise president of the Connecticut Right to Life Corporation said the decision has convinced us even more that we must pass an amendment that would restore the legal personhood of the unborn child

CRIME AND THE COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/books/crime-and-the-court.html,MIRANDA Crime Law and Politics By Liva Baker 463 pp New York Atheneum 2295 CRIMINAL JUSTICE REFORM A Blueprint Edited by Patrick B McGuigan and Randall RRader with Claudia A Keiper 273 pp Chicago Free Congress Research and Education Foundation RegneryGateway Cloth 2195 Paper 14 IF you listen to some conservative politicians its easy to solve Americas crime problem Just abolish the insanity defense restore capital punishment eliminate the exclusionary rule which prohibits the use of illegally obtained evidence in criminal trials and stop coddling criminals Then like magic we will all be able to unlock our doors regain our streets for relaxed evening strolls and stop worrying about rape robbery and murder Nonsense some liberals say Crime is a function of poverty unemployment and the failure of government to provide adequate educational opportunities housing and welfare Youre both wrong the criminologists interject The rate of violent crime has little to do with legal rules or economic factors It is a function of complex phenomena such as the average age of the population  the higher the number of men aged 15 to 30 the greater the rate of violent crime The only conclusion everyone agrees on is that violent crime has become a divisive political issue Emotionally laden code words  law and order crime in the streets handcuffing the police epidemic of violence and police brutality  have replaced rational discussion about what steps might realistically be taken to reduce violent crime without savaging the Bill of Rights Perhaps the single word that arouses the strongest emotions in the political controversy over crime is Miranda To viewers of television Miranda refers to the rights that police are obliged to recite to an arrested suspect before they question him To most law enforcement officials Miranda is the symbol of the Supreme Courts shackling of the police and coddling of criminals To some liberals Miranda marks the highest achievement of civil libertarianism as translated into constitutional terms by the US Supreme Court And to a small number of people in Phoenix Miranda represents the reallife drama of a rape and several robberies committed by a 23yearold MexicanAmerican named Ernest Miranda In Miranda Crime Law and Politics Liva Baker the author of Felix Frankfurter A Biography explores every aspect of the Supreme Courts 1966 decision in Miranda v Arizona the criminal the crime the trial the ruling the symbol the controversy the practical effects the politics and the prospects It is an ambitious undertaking employing one important case as a vehicle for explaining the American legal system and exploring all sides of a complex and continuing debate about the politics of criminal justice In some respects it is modeled after Anthony Lewiss enormously successful Gideons Trumpet which used a case involving an indigent defendants right to have an attorney appointed at trial to explain the dynamics of the Supreme Court Because Ernest Mirandas case  involving the right to appointed counsel in the police station  was so much more controversial than Clarence Gideons Mrs Baker must inevitably explore complex issues such as the effects of controversial Court decisions on elections that Mr Lewis was able to avoid The result is that Mrs Baker has produced a roughcut though valuable stone whereas Mr Lewis was able to turn out a pure jewel Comparisons aside Miranda does its job admirably if sometimes a bit tediously Ernest Mirandas story which is told in detail is not the stuff of great literature or even exciting television crime drama By the age of 14 he was already a felon A string of larcenies escalated into burglaries and then robberies By 15 he had attempted rape and was diagnosed as having sexual problems A short stint in the military ended with an undesirable discharge for being a peeping Tom More crimes were followed by a prison term After his release he avoided legal trouble for a couple of years until one night in March 1963 when he abducted and raped an 18yearold woman returning home from her job at a movie theater The victim was able to identify the car and Miranda was arrested 10 days later The Phoenix police took him to the station house and interrogated him Within a short time he confessed not only to the rape under investigation but also to another attempted rape and a robbery What exactly induced the prisonwise defendant to incriminate himself will never be known be cause the only people in the interrogation room were two policemen and Miranda who was killed in a barroom fight in 1976 Not surprisingly Miranda claimed the police promised him leniency if he talked and threatened reprisals if he remained silent The police on the other hand denied any promises or threats This all too typical crime and interrogation eventually led to Miranda v Arizona Mrs Baker is at her best in setting the legal and political stage for Chief Justice Earl Warrens decision in that case She provides a short history of the Supreme Court and discusses its role in prior confession cases and the political factors that created the sharp division among the Justices MRS BAKER proves what most astute Court watchers have always suspected  that great legal decisions often are highly political in nature For all of Justice Hugo Blacks rhetoric about just following the words of the Constitution the Justices are aware that nearly every significant word in that document is subject to multiple interpretations Constitutional policy making not literal interpretation is what most Supreme Court decisions are all about The Miranda case was an extreme example of such policy making Indeed Chief Justice Warrens majority opinion barely alluded to the facts of the case Warren first described the general problem faced by indigent suspects in police interrogation rooms and then established a series of general rules for all such cases  including the famous Miranda warnings In approaching the problem in this manner the Court acted much as a legislature might After establishing the rules the Court hastily returned to its judicial function and  almost as an afterthought  applied them to the facts of the particular case before it The outcry was immediate and sustained It has still not abated Constitutional amendments have been introduced to abrogate Miranda Judges and judicial nominees have promised to overrule it Presidential candidates have campaigned against it Mrs Baker chronicles the continuing debate over the decision and what it has come to symbolize She persuasively demonstrates that the high crime rate in this country is not a function of Supreme Court decisions but rather of complex factors such as demography and economics most of which are beyond the ken of the courts She is wrong however when she concludes that it is no longer fashionable to advance the argument that violent crime is due to the Warren Courts coddling of criminals That view may no longer be fashionable among intellectuals but it is still popular among many politicians  at least if their campaign rhetoric is to be credited NOR is the Supreme Court theory of violent crime limited to extremists and ideologues It is very much in vogue within the current Administration Lest there be any doubt about where several influential members of it stand the Free Congress Research and Education Foundation has performed an important function by compiling a book summarizing the criminaljustice views of such Administration luminaries as Presidential Counselor Edwin Meese 3d Attorney General William French Smith and FBI Director William H Webster as well as an assortment of Republican senators conservative academics and lawyers Criminal Justice Reform A Blueprint contains chapters on the exclusionary rule the insanity defense gun control drugs pornography capital punishment and of course the criminalcoddling courts A common theme runs through the book Permissive court decisions like Miranda are largely responsible for our epidemic of violent crime The blueprint for reducing violent crime therefore is to focus attention on changing these court decisions through legislative abrogation and the appointment of tougher judges Among the proposals are  as one might expect  modification of the exclusionary rule and the insanity defense limitations on the use of the Freedom of Information Act and of writs of habeas corpus and the restoration of capital punishment But the reality of crime is not subject to quickfix solutions The total percentage of criminal defendants who would be affected by all these changes together would be less than 1 percent A recent study by the Comptroller General of the United States established that less than onehalf of 1 percent of all cases are affected by the exclusionary rule about onetenth of 1 percent involve the insanity defense far less than onetenth of 1 percent are capital cases and only a very tiny number of defendants are freed by invoking writs of habeas corpus or the Freedom of Information Act Why then do intelligent writers focus so much of their attention on questionable reforms that if enacted would not make a dent in our violent crime problem Because as Mrs Baker demonstrates courts are an easy target for our collective fear of crime and our anger over societys seeming inability to control it This blueprint for crime control is more an ideological expression of faith in conservatism than a serious discussion of how to reduce crime Nowhere for example is there a consideration of the effects of our current approach to crimes involving heroin attempting to make it scarce thus raising its price and requiring addicts to rob more to satisfy their habits Instead there is a plea for more vigorous prosecution of victimless crimes and less vigorous enforcement of gun control laws Among the books other assertions  Conceivable though probably not achievable government activities  like improving education and housing may actually contribute to the propensity for crime in many individuals  It is true that if one wanted to get at the root cause of crime by economic means he could start by repealing the minimum wage laws for people under the age of 25 so that they could obtain and keep that first job to put some cash in their pockets  The theory of evolution up from the apes in the jungle runs contrary to the experience of devolution back to the jungle as more and more people become animalistic predators on their fellow humans  To restore the teaching of sound morality to our youth and thereby reduce crime encourage religiouslyoriented private schools introduce Ethics or Character Training into the public schools create positive rolemodels in our textbooks and television dramas  Capital punishment possesses certain merciful aspects It may be merciful first in that it may relieve a depraved criminal of the horror of being what he is It may be merciful second in that it can help to protect the less guilty from the more guilty And  capital punishment may mercifully protect the guiltless from the more extreme forms of violence After reading about the evils of secular education minimum wage laws evolution and the earthly realm of existence I fully expected to be lectured on how birth control and abortion cause armed robbery and rape But that is dangerous ground for conservative ideologues because one of the few undisputed facts about violent crime is that it decreases as the percentage of young males in the population decreases Thus one major reason for the increase in crime during the 1960s and 70s was that the postWorld War II baby boom produced a great many males who were in their late teens and early 20s during those years Now that the proportion of young males has begun to decrease we have begun to experience a welcome reduction in the rate of violent crime Doubtless the Reagan Administration will claim the credit In reality however it belongs more to the birthcontrol clinics of Margaret Sanger than to the rhetoric of the lawandorder forces
SIX YEARS FOR THE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/magazine/six-years-for-the-president.html,The idea was debated in the Constitutional Conventiion Andrew Jackson revived it 40 years later Most 19thcentury Presidents favored it and in 1913 Woodrow Wilson had to intervene personally to stop Congress from approving it The idea of electing the President of the United States for only one term of six years wont die Now an impressive new National Committee for a Single SixYear Presidential Term has brought it out again and is pushing the necessary constitutional amendment with what may be betterthanusual prospects for success The latest singleterm movement is being led by a formidable bipartisan array of wellknown public servants In the words of former Secretary of State Cyrus R Vance a liberal Democrat they cover the spectrum from Vance to Simon And thats quite a spectrum since he was referring to William E Simon the conservative Republican who served Presidents Nixon and Ford as Secretary of the Treasury In Congress a similar range of supporters has emerged from Representative John Conyers Jr of Michigan  black liberal and Democratic  to Senator Strom Thurmond of South Carolina white conservative and Republican Mr Thurmond is chairman of the Judiciary Committee which must approve proposed constitutional amendments before they go to the Senate floor Such varied proponents of change many of them members of the new national committee headed by Mr Vance Mr Simon Dr Milton S Eisenhower and Griffin B Bell the Attorney General in the Carter Administration also have the enthusiastic backing of former President Carter himself He suggested in a recent telephone interview  as one example of his reasoning  that negotiations for the release of American hostages in Iran might have been concluded earlier in 1980 except that it was an election year Now another election year is approaching Some political observers think President Reagans tough stance against raising taxes despite huge prospective budget deficits is an example of reelection pressures already at work upon him  the kind that the singleterm amendment would be partially designed to prevent Mr Reagan has been noncommittal on the singleterm issue although some backers of the idea say he favors it in private his support and lobbying could be a major factor in Congressional approval The frontrunning Democratic challenger former Vice President Walter Mondale has strongly opposed the proposal as a lessening of the fundamental accountability that must be built into our political system But theres little chance that whoever is elected in 1984 would be affected precedent suggests that a President in office when a change in tenure was ratified would be exempt from its limitations Mr Vance now a Manhattan lawyer predicted in an interview that the proposed constitutional amendment would be debated in the current Congress and draw wide bipartisan support He and other members of the new committee he said had found in speaking appearances around the country a great deal of resonance and interest  a feeling that yes something does have to be done Cochairman Simon is not so optimistic Interviewed in his Morristown NJ consultants office he expressed devout support for the idea but added I dont think its going to happen I just dont see the steam behind it yet Knowledgeable Congressional sources tend to agree with Mr Simon They say the stronger immediate push will be for one or more of the big three proposed constitutional amendments  the revived equalrights amendment one to prohibit abortion and one to permit prayer in the public schools But singleterm supporters are confident that they can get a vote perhaps by next year after hearings this year As a matter of hard fact however the Gallup Poll which has taken surveys on this issue since l936 has never found more than 34 percent of the public in favor of the single sixyear term That figure was registered in l981 although in December 1980 the Harris Poll found 43 percent supporting the idea Why has this perrenial reform proposal as old as the Republic and at least as hearty refused to go away Probably because it reflects a view thats just as persistent  the American conviction that unseemly politics somehow stands too often in the way of good government by puresouled statesmen dedicated only to the public interest Andrew Jackson was not generally considered in his day such a paragon of nonpolitical government but he nevertheless gave Congress in 1830 a resounding statement of this attitude He recommended a single term in order that the President may  be placed beyond the reach of any improper influences  and that the securities for this independence may be rendered as strong as the nature of power and the weakness of its possessor will admit But the singleterm idea has never prevailed because of an equally strong belief of similar persistence that such good government is elitist in concept and unrealistic in practice while grubby politics reconciles the necessarily conflicting interests of a democracy and makes the wheels of government turn even if slowly More than a century and a quarter after Old Hickorys appeal for purity former President Harry S Truman bluntly stated this opposite point of view A politician is a man who understands government and it takes a politician to run a government And later to a Congressional hearing on the singleterm issue You do not have to be very smart to know that an officeholder who is not eligible for reelection loses a lot of influence So what have you done You have taken a man and put him in the hardest job in the world and sent him out to fight our battles in a lifeanddeath struggle  and you have sent him out to fight with one hand tied behind his back because everyone knows he cannot run for reelection Actually for all the long history of discussion and debate on the single sixyear term the proposal has never been submitted by Congress for approval by threefourths of the states not even the resistance to Franklin D Roosevelts four terms pushed it that far Instead before Congress limited Presidents to two terms with the 22d Amendment in l947 the Senate defeated by 82 to 1 a single sixyear term proposal by Senator W Lee Pappy ODaniel of Texas Approval was more nearly achieved in the lameduck session of the 62d Congress Woodrow Wilson had been elected in 1912 on a Democratic platform calling for a single sixyear term His Republican opponent President William H Taft had promised to approve legislation for an amendment and a survey by The New York World found a big Congressional majority that favored the reform On Feb 13 1913 the Senate approved the constitutional amendment 48 to 23 one vote more than the necessary twothirds But Presidentelect Wilson no doubt with an early eye on his own prospects for a second term already had written A Mitchell Palmer a leading member of Congress to object The proposed amendment died quietly when the 62d Congress went out of office on March 3 Mr Wilson a political scientist by profession and one of the keenest intellects to occupy the White House made to Representative Palmer what still is a strong argument against the single sixyear Presidency A fouryear term he wrote was too long for a President who is not the true spokesman of the people who is imposed upon and does not lead It is too short a term for a President who is doing or attempting a great work of reform  Changing to six years he argued would increase the likelihood of its being too long without any assurance that it would in happy cases be long enough PROPONENTS OF THE SIXyear Presidency give a variety of reasons for renewing the fight the vast growth of the Federal Government for example and the complex role the nation now must play in world affairs In only four years a President can hardly master his difficult job they point out yet no President since Dwight Eisenhower in the 1950s has been elected to and served two full terms They say that every President at least since John F Kennedy has been to some degree a failure Lyndon B Johnson driven from office by oppposition to the war in Vietnam Richard M Nixon forced to resign by the prospect of impeachment Gerald R Ford and Jimmy Carter unable to win reelection Ronald Reagan by no means sure of doing so Save for Mr Johnson in the mid1960s and Mr Reagan in l981 none had the willing cooperation of Congress Particularly in foreign affairs the lack of continuity brought on by frequent changes at the top has baffled and irritated foreign governments and made American policy too often ineffective misunderstood  or even nonexistent Presidents themselves Cyrus Vance believes have been failing to face issues or dealing with them in ways that may look politically attractive but are only superficial Moreover many complex issues  he cites a strategicarms negotiation may require more than the four years allowed to recent oneterm Presidents The business of being President he says is so complicated that adding reelection concerns makes it more than any human being can take Timothy W Stanley president of the International Economic Policy Association has been persuaded by his experience as a former Government official that as now organized our society and our politics dont seem to be equipped to make choices involving tradeoffs between the short term and the long term   Particularly in foreign economic policy he believes any set of policies requires more continuity and less uncertainty than recent Presidencies have provided Herbert Brownell Jr President Eisenhowers Attorney General and a member of the singleterm committee put his finger on what may be an unspoken motive of some former Government servants actively pushing the single sixyear term I think there has been nothing more discouraging over the years to these volunteers who are essential to our welfare than to see that their carefully laid plans on foreign policy or domestic policy or whatever are subordinated so soon and so fast to overriding political considerations Overriding political considerations are at the heart of the matter The basic theory of most who seek to restrict Presidents to one lengthened term is that the necessity or desire to seek reelection causes political considerations  winning and keeping the support of interest groups for example  to dominate all others in a Presidents first term A single sixyear term it is held would remove this political pressure and give a President two more years than he or she can now be sure of to carry out difficult longterm plans Mr Simon a classic good government advocate who says ruefully that the next battle I win with a Presidents political advisers will be the first one argues that the present term is not really four years Its a year and a half The argument that running for reelection takes too much of a Presidents time may be the strongest for the single sixyear term Mr Vance made the point in more detail Every President needs eight or nine months to learn his job Then he has about one and a half years to feel comfortable in a job he knows Then hes running again for 12 to 18 months And of course theres a midterm Congressional election that no President can afford to ignore As for the opposing argument made so strongly by Harry Truman  that a President who cannot be reelected becomes an instant lame duck his coattails Clark Clifford the astute Democratic political adviser once observed would be permanently in mothballs  singleterm proponents have a ready answer If thats a sound argument they say the twoterm limitation of the 22d Amendment already has turned secondterm Presidents into lame ducks But they also question whether it is a sound argument Secondterm Presidents were inhibited by tradition  until FDR  from running again since Harry Truman twoterm Presidents have been constitutionally barred from running again Yet they say the skies havent fallen President Carter in fact believes that being eligible for reelection actually damaged his credibility No matter what he did in the White House he said in l979 it was colored through the news media and in the minds of the American people by Is this a campaign ploy or is it genuinely done in the best interest of our country without any sort of personal advantage involved  General Eisenhower is the only President to have served two full terms since the 22d Amendment took effect and thus to have suffered whatever lameduck effect it may cause Milton Eisenhower recalls that his brother felt no lameduck limitations in his second term He was even more effective as President in his second term than in his first Dr Eisenhower said in a telephone interview He faced the complete control of Congress by the Democrats but he had no real trouble getting his programs through He only had two vetoes overriden in eight years as President thats a pretty good relationship with Congress But not everyone agrees that President Eisenhowers second term was successful Representative Morris K Udall of Arizona writing on the termlimitation issue judged that Ike was politically emasculated following reelection and could not control his own Cabinet much less the Congress Lyndon Johnson was by definition a lame duck for nearly 10 months after he announced on March 31 1968 that he would not seek reelection George Reedy  who served Mr Johnson in several capacities  wrote of the period in his respected study The Twilight of the Presidency The erosion of his power became apparent within weeks   The last 10 months of his Administration were marked by frustration on every issue with the sole exception of the convening of the Paris conference to discuss ways and means of ending the Vietnam War Even at Paris nothing happened until a new President was elected MOST PROPONENTS DO not claim the single sixyear term would be a cureall for whatever ails the Presidency and the country but they argue as Mr Simon does that it would be a major step in the right direction For one thing he thinks it would help bring into the Government people who have the courage to go in and get things done and get out of there President Carter citing the blatantly different policies of his successor on human rights nuclear arms control and nuclear proliferation agrees that the reform would provide much greater stability And a sixyear term with no year taken out for a reelection campaign he told me would allow an incoming President to plan for a more coherent term and give him more time to get things done after his learning period Mr Vance insists that the single sixyear term would provide more stability for a period within which predictability would be possible thus mollifying what he said was a major concern of foreign officials with whom he has talked  a lack of predictability in Washington Proponents also claim that more able Presidential candidates would be lured into the field if they could count on a longer term without the distractions of a reelection campaign particularly since none would have to run against a politically powerful incumbent Mr Carter had a somewhat different reason for urging the removal of incumbents from Presidential races Near the end of a first term he said when a President opens a reelection campaign there is a driving pressure on his likely challengers to dispute or contradict the President on the issues for strictly political reasons This is a very distressing thing Mr Carter said because on the issues in question the President may well be acting in the national interest Then if such a challenger is elected the same national interest will force him to reverse himself  as President Kennedy did when he found in l961 that there was no missile gap and as President Reagan has had to do on strategic arms negotiations A Presidents credibility and political support can suffer as a result This driving pressure on challengers to criticize the incumbents policies might be lessened Mr Carter thinks if an incumbent could not be a candidate to succeed him or herself He recalled how President Ford seeking renomination by the Republican Party in 1976 had to back off from strategic arms agreements reached with the Soviet Union at the Vladivostok summit and from seeking ratification of the Panama Canal treaties when both projects came came under fire from his challenger Ronald Reagan Former Treasury Secretary Simon offers a graphic example of how reelection pressures worked on Mr Ford When we prepared the 1976 State of the Union Message  I wanted to add a few pages on the two very controversial issues of tax and welfare reform After a long debate with the Economic Policy Board I put the pages in and when we discussed the State of the Union Message with the President he said Boy I agree with this 100 percent Were going to do it The political advisers heads snapped around and he added Next year Of course next year  January l977 never came for us Mr Carter was not immune to such pressures He withdrew SALT II from Senate consideration early in 1980 but Mr Vance thinks it would have been different in a nonelection year Its inevitable he says that a President will draw back or not take political risks when facing reelection and the consequences can be serious In the case of SALT II Mr Reagan took office and declared the treaty fatally flawed and dead Mr Carter said in the telephone interview that he was able to get such controversial measures as the Alaska Lands Act and the superfund for cleaning up toxic waste sites through Congress only after he had been defeated in the 1980 election and then only because the Republicans didnt want Mr Reagan to have to face these difficult issues the next year I think every public servant is concerned with his reelection former President Johnson told Walter Cronkite in a television interview in l972 and has to think of that from the day he takes the oath until the time his term expires And I think that were all inclined to put off the hard ones and postpone them sometimes because we think Well well have another term   And if a fellow knew from the beginning that he had a definite limitation and the bells going to ring at a certain time he might be able to tackle some of the problems hes inclined to postpone Mr Carter went in the other direction when he decided to force through the unpopular Panama Canal treaties during what he thought would be his first term Mr Carter termed the treaties the most difficult political problem I ever had in my life including running for President as an unknown in l976 Clark Clifford suggested that so thorny an issue should be reserved for a second term when there would be no problem of reelection Mr Vance who was Secretary of State when the decision to seek the treaties was made feels strongly that Mr Carter had no alternative because there might otherwise have been a popular uprising in Panama with serious consequences in this hemisphere and far broader consequences elsewhere in the third world He concedes that deferring such a battle to a second term was probably right politically but believes the issue had to be addressed when Carters power was greatest Probably there would be no such treaties today if Mr Carter had waited for the expected second term Ronald Reagan the treaties strongest opponent was elected The former President counts the treaty battle among the major reasons Mr Reagan defeated him in l980 and points out that it also helped ruin the Republican Presidential bid of Senator Howard H Baker Jr who incautiously supported the treaties Only seven of 16 senators who voted for them and then had to face the voters in l978 were reelected PRESIDENTS WILSON AND TRUman as quoted above laid out two of the major arguments against the single sixyear term that such an amendment might shorten the tenure of a good President and lengthen that of a poor one and that a President who cannot be reelected will be a weakened President  a lame duck from the start These are not views restricted to liberal Democrats Lyn Nofziger for example Ronald Reagans hardball political adviser once commented that the threat of running again and being reelected is about the only party discipline we have in this country And among the Founding Fathers it was Alexander Hamilton  not exactly a mushy liberal  who most strongly made another point against the singleterm Presidency A Presidents eligibility for reelection was essential Hamilton argued in The Federalist essay 72 to enable the people when they see reason to approve of his conduct to continue him in his station in order to prolong the utility of his talents and virtues   When they see reason to approve of his conduct And when they dont the remedy is obvious as Harry Truman said If he is not a good President and you do not want to keep him you do not have to reelect him Presidents Hamilton and Truman were saying in their different ways should be accountable to the people and the only way to hold them accountable is to subject them to the test of reelection If a President must leave office at the end of six years moreover he might have to step out in the middle of a war or some other serious national crisis Under the 22d Amendment this would also be true of a secondterm President if we ever have another And it is by no means clear to everyone who has studied the problem that reelection pressures lead only to crass political decisions without regard to national interest Representative Udall a Presidential candidate himself in l976 has pointed out that while the approach of the l972 elections led Richard Nixon into the Watergate scandals Mr Nixon also brought American troops home from Vietnam slapped on wage and price controls went to China and moved toward detente with the Russians  in each case reversing prior positions In short his greatest achievements grew out of the pressure of an approaching election In 1968 for another example Lyndon B Johnson refused to seek reelection rather than change his Vietnam policy or risk defeat on that issue Whatever may be thought of that policy Mr Johnsons withdrawal certainly did not reflect a desire for reelection above all If President Reagan decides to seek reelection he might be led to make a compromise agreement with the Russians on limiting intermediaterange missiles in Europe Some might debate whether such an agreement would be in the public interest but without election pressures a hardliner like Mr Reagan might not even consider a compromise And anyway most of those who have opposed recurrent proposals for the single sixyear term strongly disagree with the basic good government reasoning of its advocates  that the President should be relieved as far as possible of political considerations and freed to act as a statesman in the national interest Those who make this argument said the late James C Hagerty President Eisenhowers press secretary and political adviser in his Congressional testimony are confusing and downgrading the essential political aspect of the Presidency  using the word politics in a crude and demeaning manner instead of referring to it in its true meaning  the art of government accomplishment for the public good through reasonable compromise without surrender of principle or integrity George Reedy argued in The Twilight of the Presidency that singleterm proposals are based on the belief that a Presidents authority is somehow separable from his political leadership  The reality is quite different A President whose political leadership is unchallenged can do just about anything that he wishes A President whose political leadership has suffered from erosion is virtually helpless Separating him from the pressures of the public Mr Reedy wrote would only tend to make him an ineffectual voice issuing orders and decrees   Clark Clifford once said that he found the notion that a President should be above politics inconsistent with our system of government just as I find the prospect of a Presidential dictator to be inconceivable under the same system  Politics in the final analysis is an essential part of democracy A President above politics is a President remote from the processes of government and removed from the thoughts and aspirations of his people Beyond these points against the single sixyear term I would raise several other arguments and questions Shouldnt the people have the right to reelect a President of whom they approve And doesnt the 22d Amendment merely limit this right rather than abolish it as the single sixyear term would do A President would not himself be on the ballot in any of the biennial elections during his six years in office Wouldnt this diminish his sense of accountability as well as the publics ability to influence him Onethird of the Senate would have to run in Presidential election years twothirds never would have to do so What effect would this have on a Presidents political support Given a Presidents extraordinary powers as Commander in Chief of the armed forces isnt it risky to entrust him with such powers for six full years with no remedy for abuse save the difficult impeachment process Even if a sixyear term would be an improvement on four is it necessary to insist that an incumbent cant be reelected France with its sevenyear term has no such limitation Mexico does but its not apparent that its sixyear term provides a more stable government than the United States system Most supporters of the sixyear proposal also favor term limitations on members of Congress  12 years for members of each house Theyre too smart to push for that while the Presidential proposal is pending but isnt this distant threat likely to deter Congress from acting lest it invite efforts for its own restriction next The National Committee for a Single SixYear Presidential Term is looking into such problems The committee works in close cooperation with the Foundation for the Study of Presidential and Congressional Terms and the two groups share a Washington office The former columnist Charles L Bartlett acts as a consultant to the committee the staff organizes speaking engagements and debates for committee members We have a practical organization now according to Herbert Brownell The things that have to be done in the way of arousing public opinion and debate are going to be done The talking to Congressmen senators and state legislatures which has to be done is going to be done But as Cyrus Vance acknowledges the Founding Fathers set up a wise slow way to change the Constitution requiring the approval of twothirds of each house of Congress and of threefourths of the states As backers of the original equalrights amendment and District of Columbia statehood have recently learned that makes it almost impossible to amend the Constitution without overwhelming public support Perhaps the single sixyear term if finally instituted would prove so effective a reform that the Presidency would at last be more nearly dominated by measures than by men by abstract judgment of the public interest rather than by the clash and reconciliation of interests And perhaps that would be a good thing Political history however encourages neither proposition But even if the current drive fails this ancient issue is unlikely to go away The human animal is too persistent in its search for a system or a mechanism that will somehow overcome its own vagaries and fallibilities And Americans particularly are too strong in their belief that somehow someday they will  or at least should  be able to purge their Government of politics We want to be rescued from ourselves Maybe said Bill Simon the day the National Committee for a Single SixYear Presidential Term was announced well get some statesmen instead of the standard brand of politician who is just seeking one thing his own reelection Or maybe as Harry Truman said A statesman is a politician whos been dead 10 or 15 years A lot of people think Mr Truman himself proves the point
"SOFTENING SOME IMAGES, IF NOT POLICIES",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/26/weekinreview/softening-some-images-if-not-policies.html,Margaret M Heckler the Secretary of Health and Human Services probably could not change the Reagan Administrations stance on issues of concern to her department even if she wanted to But to some extent she has changed the tone of the department and that is no mean feat Mrs Heckler constantly emphasizes her desire to be fair compassionate and humane to the millions of people who receive assistance from the department Thus she announced a new policy this month to make the Social Security disability program more humane But many analysts detected a paradox in what she was saying On the one hand she insisted that no one had been unjustly cut from the rolls because all had gotten a fair hearing through the appeals process and that no one had to be reinstated On the other hand she acknowledged that there had been some sad results some hardships and heartbreaks for individuals and she said there would be major changes That seemed to capture Mrs Hecklers dual role She defends the President and his record with an exuberance that suggests as one Senator said that she wants to nominate Mr Reagan for a second term At the same time the former Republican Representative from Wellesley Mass whose voting record placed her well to the left of Mr Reagan is trying to burnish the Presidents reputation for fairness and compassion Mr Reagans reputation on that score has been tarnished by two years of budget cuts in social welfare programs In a speech earlier in the month to the United States Conference of Mayors Mrs Heckler again sounded the theme of compassion  this time for victims of acquired immune deficiency syndrome the mysterious ailment that has killed more than 600 Americans by destroying their resistance to infection and disease In expressing concern for homosexual men thoe main victims of the disease Mrs Heckler showed empathy for a minority group rarely noticed by Federal officials of either political party But Mrs Heckler has opposed Congressional efforts to appropriate more money for research on the disease insisting the need could be met by transferring funds from other health programs As usual she was bound to espouse the position taken by the Administration and the Office of Management and Budget Mrs Heckler to take another example held out the hope last April of a new Government program to provide health insurance for the unemployed who frequently lose medical coverage soon after they have lost their jobs Three weeks later David A Stockman the budget director delivered sober news The Administration would support changes in the tax code and a few other steps to encourage health insurance for the unemployed but only if they cost the Federal Government nothing Dr Anthony Robbins president of the American Public Health Association an organization of 50000 health professionals said there had been some very superficial improvements under Mrs Heckler She came in at a time when the Administration wanted to turn around its image he said adding She wants the department to look better so Reagan can get reelected Mrs Heckler was not wellknown for her interest in health issues when she came to the department and she did not appear to have any particular agenda or priorities Representative Henry A Waxman Democrat of California who is chairman of the health subcommittee of the Energy and Commerce Committee said I just havent seen any evidence of her personal involvement in health care issues Mrs Heckler was sworn in March 9 but made her first visit to the National Institutes of Health the Governments worldfamous biomedical research complex in Bethesda Md only this month for a briefing on AIDS Mrs Heckler has also pursued appeals of court decisions that invalidated a new rule requiring parental notice whenever minors receive prescription contraceptives from a clinic supported by the Federal Government As cochairman of the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues Mrs Heckler had urged the Reagan Administration to abandon the rule But now she defends it saying My own prior views were personal views On another issue of concern to women Mrs Heckler shares the Presidents strong opposition to abortion But she had no comment on the recent ruling by the Supreme Court that struck down a variety of local laws restricting access to abortions However to assess Secretary m Hecklers first 100 days in terms of her work on specific health and welfare programs is to miss a big part of her role She is the third woman appointed by Mr Reagan to a Cabinetlevel position she is a canny politician and she has been trying to get the President to speak out on issues of importance to women such as pension rights and day care Mrs Heckler has brought a note of humility to the department a willingness to acknowledge mistakes that stands in marked contrast to the more combative tone of other officials such as the new Under Secretary John A Svahn As Commissioner of Social Security Mr Svahn supervised the effort to purge ineligible people from the disability rolls Mrs Heckler is not halting that effort but with her keen political instincts is trying to soften the effects by making the review process more equitable Chris Koyanagi of the National Mental Health Association a private nonprofit group said it was a cruel hoax to pretend that the announced changes would protect people already on the disability rolls or seeking benefits When she was sworn in Mrs Heckler told President Reagan that she would symbolize the commitment and caring he felt for people in need The question now is whether she will be more than a symbol whether she will translate that commitment into action Answers may come later this year as the department revises regulations for hospices nursing homes and facilities serving the mentally retarded
CANADIAN JUDGE WEIGHS KEY DIOXIN CASE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/27/us/canadian-judge-weighs-key-dioxin-case.html,A lawyer for the plaintiffs in his final argument called the trial a World Series of scientific dispute saying he felt he was in the batters box in the ninth inning of the seventh game with the bases loaded No matter what happens as a result of this hearing the record will stand for all time Richard Murtha declared The issue is whether the court should grant a request by 15 people and stop the planned spraying by a pulp and paper company of socalled phenoxy herbicides containing dioxin The 15 plaintiffs live near forests where the company plans to spray Testimony in the case in Nova Scotia Supreme Court in Sydney on Cape Breton Island was recently completed after more than a month and a ruling is expected by the end of June Central Questions Raised Indeed the case has struck at some of the central questions of this chemical age At a time of accelerating scientific knowledge and heightened public concern what is environmental danger and how is it defined What degree of risk is acceptable particularly when that risk must be balanced against other societal needs and values Have some people overreacted and become too frightened of dioxin as some in the United States have recently suggested And what of the question of the legal systems competence to judge evidence on the frontiers of science carrying health implications perhaps as far as a halfcentury in the future Because of the exceedingly technical nature of these questions Judge Merlin D Nunn ruled against a jury trial But as he points out he too is a layman in such sophisticated scientific issues So who should decide The plaintiffs a group of farmers fishermen and Indian chiefs from Cape Breton a craggy island northeast of the Nova Scotia mainland presented scientific data they say suggests that any quantity of dioxin no matter how small is unsafe and that as little as one molecule coming in contact with one human cell may cause cancer birth defects and other maladies And the plaintiffs position presumes that any doubt must be resolved in favor of safety Banned in US but Not Canada The defendants Nova Scotia Forest Industries a subsidiary of Stora Kopparbergs of Sweden counter that the herbicide called 245T is totally safe in the quantities intended for use This phenoxy herbicide which in a stronger concentration was used in Vietnam as a defoliant known as Agent Orange has been banned in the United States for forestry and most other uses but is heavily subsidized by the Canadian Government for forestry applications It is said to be needed to protect new softwood seedlings from overgrowth by hardwoods The law does not exist to protect plaintiffs from unfounded fear Harvey Morrison a company lawyer said Defense witnesses conceded the extreme toxicity of dioxin although they questioned its ability to cause cancer and other longterm effects Dr Frank Dost a toxicologist from Oregon State University said the worse form of dioxin TCDD was exquisitely toxic But the defense witnesses repeatedly testified that in the herbicides proposed the amount of TCDD was too small to have any impact on human health Essentially they argued that many useful chemicals are risky and that the quantity is what matters They say the quantity to be sprayed on Nova Scotia would be thousands of times below the danger level Canada Supports Spraying Such substances as aspirin and caffein for instance can be more toxic than phenoxies in sufficient quantities they said I would not be concerned about an increase in birth defects said F Clark Fraser a medical geneticist who works for the Canadian Government which supports the spraying plans Dr Kenneth Crump a biostatistician from Louisiana argued that 1000 people eating phenoxycontaminated berries generation after generation would expect one cancer every 7 million years Dr Richard Wilson chairman of the physics department of Harvard University testified It is really hard to assess a risk this low The plaintiffs lawyers strongly attacked these probabilities causing Dr Crump to admit that in one instance he was off by a factor of 10000 in one of his calculations They also delighted in Dr Wilsons mention of a specific license plate number he had seen in the parking lot to illustrate the extremely small probability of ever seeing a particular number It turned out to be the judges Science Data Still Evolving But even the plaintiffs attorneys said the defense case had a logical tightness theirs lacked partly they said because science in this area is still evolving Underlying the entire discussion was the fact that phenoxy herbicides have been used and people have been exposed to them in various places and various degrees for 40 years all over the world Repeatedly Judge Nunn asked for concrete evidence of deaths or severe health problems resulting from phenoxy exposure If this stuff is so horrendous youd have the evidence the judge said The plaintiffs denied that there is no solid evidence against dioxin and they called 12 expert witnesses to present their case In a Ball Park by Itself For days their witnesses hammered away on the basic theme that even a very little can be too much Dr David S Wulfman a chemistry professor from the University of Missouri testified that compared with other cancercausing substances dioxin is in a ball park by itself and that a noeffect level has not been demonstrated Dr John D Constable a Harvard University surgeon said that at the molecular level phenoxy herbicides are enough to cause reproductive changes Dr William McNulty of the Oregon State Primate Research Center said his experiments with monkeys showed single doses of dioxin in the smallest of concentrations caused spontaneous abortions As part of the dosage argument several witnesses for the plaintiffs contended that dioxin exposure is cumulative in the same manner as radiation even if one exposure does not cause health problems it might when combined with later exposures In part this possibility was used to try to controvert an uncontested defense assertion that much larger amounts of dioxin than those to be sprayed on Cape Breton have not caused such known dioxin reactions as chloracne a stinging skin disease that normally vanishes after a few weeks Witnesses also suggested that it is wrong to think of any one carcinogen in isolation Rather known cancercausing substances interact with unknown ones in endlessly complicated ways that are exceedingly difficult to prove Rats dont also smoke Dr Mikael Eriksson a Swedish cancer expert told the court Epidemiology Discussed From a scientific viewpoint one of the more interesting aspects of the trial was a discussion of epidemiology the science of tracing the causes of disease in human populations One type of epidemiological study is to find people with the disease and then look backward to find common factors they might have experienced The plaintiffs presented a Swedish study showing a correlation between phenoxy exposure and the incidence of a rare form of tissue cancer This connection is widely accepted by the real authorities in this field Dr Eriksson said under sharp attack from the defense attorneys Another type of epidemiological study is to examine people who were exposed to a common event and then compare their health with others who were not Dr Constable of Harvard testified about a study of 40000 Vietnamese that he said showed that wives of soldiers exposed to Agent Orange experienced more miscarriages and birth defects He said dioxin appeared to be the first human toxic substance that when given to a man may increase his wifes reproductive misadventures Statistics are obviously an integral part of epidemiology Accordingly the plaintiffs presented a statistician Dr Theodor D Sterling of Simon Fraser University in British Columbia partly to argue that no single epidemiological study should be looked at alone For instance the study of miscarriages experienced by Oregon women after 245T spraying that led to the United States ban is convincing when combined with other evidence despite many criticisms of that specific study he said Like CardGame Statistics Dr Sterling agreed with the statement by Judge Nunn that epidemiology is not unlike the statistics of a card game  you may never get that perfect hand The statistician also criticized a study by a Dow Chemical scientist indicating that there is a level of dioxin exposure below which laboratory rats were not affected He did not question an assertion that in five rats livers and thalamuses where dioxin collects had not much enlarged But he argued that five rats were too few to test low levels of exposure Clearly though his prescription might be difficult to carry out If you are going to use a very low dose ideally you might want 10 million animals he said The trials outcome could hinge on the simple issue of trespass The judge could take a novel position that people should not have to put up with minuscule amounts of uninvited molecules on their property anymore than noxious odors This would entail the judges accepting the disputed argument by the plaintiffs that the chemicals have a good chance of being dispersed however careful the applicators Im not an expert but I know that water flows downhill and wind blows in all directions said Charles Mullendore a plaintiff who is a clergyman and parttime farmer Regulatory System Cited But if Judge Nunn orders a injunction on the basis of concern over the safety of phenoxy herbicides he would be taking a large step the defense lawyers believe he does not have to take They say the letter of the law is enough that 245T has been specifically approved by Canadian regulators who have not allowed some herbicides approved by the United States Government To rule against them would be tantamount to overthrowing the regulatory system George Cooper one of the lawyers said There are a number of courses the judge could take other than a straight yesorno decision Among other things he could approve spraying of some sites and not others approve the use of some herbicides but not 245T or grant an injunction only for a limited period of time He could also reject spraying of all sites on the basis of the two Indian plaintiffs definition of their native rights In any case the Judge Nunns decision is not going to be easy Can I possibly absorb all this stuff he asked at the trial I have a great problem with a great deal of the evidence
"SENATE TRADITION, MONDAY ABSENTEES",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/us/senate-tradition-monday-absentees.html,It was Senator Orrin G Hatch was saying this afternoon one of the most important moments of this session of Congress the first time that the merits of a Constitutional amendment on abortion had been debated in the Senate But on this Monday one of the hottest days of the sultry Washington summer so far Senator Max Baucus Democrat of Montana was at an economic development conference in Great Falls Senator Joseph R Biden Jr Democrat of Delaware was at a fundraiser in Chicago Senator Ernest F Hollings Democrat of South Carolina was on the Presidential campaign trail wooing voters in the state of Washington And Senator Rudy Boschwitz Republican of Minnesota was in Minneapolis taping a television show and appearing on a radio callin program All together according to a telephone check 19 of the 100 Senators were either outside Washington or did not go to their offices today It was members of the Senate said a rather typical Monday on Capitol Hill Its not unusual said Senator Howard Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio On Mondays we very seldom have rollcall votes and as a consequence many are out campaigning or attending to personal matters Im not prepared to say thats wrong Criticism by Goldwater Historically Senators have carefully guarded the traditions and folkways of Congress not the least of which has been the custom of confining the major portion of the Senates legislative work to the middle of the week As a result the TuesdayThursday week has become something of an institution Senators frequently arrive in Washington late Monday or even Tuesday morning and often depart after the completion of business on Thursday Last week however Senator Barry Goldwater Republican of Arizona took to the floor to criticize the way the Senate has come to operate The Senate is now run really on a Tuesday to Thursday evening basis with the weekends given over to those people who feel that they must be raising money for a campaign still over a year away or who feel that they must be home every weekend in order to keep their fences mended said Mr Goldwater one of the Senates most respected veterans Now I do not happen to think either excuse is valid Senator Goldwater himself was not in Washington today he left to attend the funeral in Lockport NY of former Representative William E Miller his running mate in his unsuccessful 1964 campaign for the White House Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan was ill and remained in New York But the 19 others who found duties elsewhere knew late last week that they were as a high Senate official put it safe to remain outside Washington today At Work in Wilmington Their party leaders told them that the debate on abortion was scheduled for today but added that the rollcall vote on the amendment was not scheduled until Tuesday Thus Senator Alan Cranston of California a candidate for the Democratic Presidential nomination was free to conduct sessions with senior citizens and environmentalists in Boston and to schedule a fundraiser in the evening And Senator Russell B Long Democrat of Louisiana could remain in his mountain cabin in Virginia At the same time Senator William V Roth Jr of Delaware worked out of his Wilmington office Senator Arlen Specter Republican of Pennsylvania delivered a speech in Hershey before the Pennsylvania Association of Boroughs then visited a retraining program for steel workers Senator Frank R Lautenberg Democrat of New Jersey planned an appearance before the convention of the New Jersey Building and Trade Construction Council in Atlantic City and then the taping of a cable television program And Senator Paul E Tsongas Democrat of Massachusetts was returning from Greece where he delivered the commencement address at the American College there Senator Walter D Huddleston Democrat of Kentucky had one of the most active schedules He was paid for a speech he made at the meeting of the North Carolina Coal Institute in Myrtle Beach SC then flew to New York City where he had scheduled a fundraiser for his reelection campaign A lot of the members dont feel pressure to stay here around the clock said an aide to the Senate leadership When you get down to Thursday you find that all these people have airline tickets out of here at 6 You cant do anything Theyre ready to leave Contact With Constituents Most members of the Senate believe legislators work should not be confined to Washington They contend moreover that they benefit substantially by speaking with their constituents and with local leaders For example Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York gave a breakfast speech before the Rockland County Association and toured a detention center of the Immigration and Naturalization Service in Brooklyn Last week Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the Senate majority leader urged that Senators curtail the time they spend in Washington He suggested they spend more days in their home states and return to the citizenlegislator ideal envisoned by the Founding Fathers A number of legislators believe however that these attendance problems underline the need for an overhaul of the way the Senate conducts its affairs Its troubling that we do not attend to business here said Senator Dennis DeConcini Democrat of Arizona We have responsibilities and many of us live far from here but many people rationalize not being here Wed serve ourselves much better if we had rules that set out attendance patterns This is not an efficient body Senator Goldwater critical of what he described as the bodys bankers hours said Senators should begin work promptly on Monday morning remain at it until Friday evening and work Saturdays if necessary The last time I tallied it up we had been in session 155 days and 50 of them had been spent at work he said I can tell you as a former businessman my business would not have lasted 155 days if I tried to work in that manner
SENATE OPENS DEBATE ON ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/us/senate-opens-debate-on-abortion.html,The Senate opened a highly unusual floor debate today over whether to amend the Constitution so that Congress and the states could ban abortions While the sponsor of the measure involved Senator Orrin G Hatch conceded he did not have the votes to win he insisted This is not an exercise in futility This is the first step said the Utah Republican The womens suffrage issue took 93 years to resolve Weve only been at this 10 years he added alluding to the Supreme Court ruling that women are entitled to privacy to decide whether to have an abortion The Senate has debated and rejected a number of proposed statutory restrictions on abortion but has never before attempted a flat reversal of the Supreme Court through constitutional action Two weeks ago the Court bolstered that decision by invalidating a number of state and local limits on abortion leaving foes with little recourse outside a constitutional amendment President Reagan assailed the latest ruling and called upon Congress to make its voice heard against abortion on demand whether by statute or constitutional amendment Packwood Opposes Amendment But Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon said the Courts rulings should stand forever The womans right to make childbearing decisions is her right to bodily integrity said Senator Packwood who is leading the opposition to the amendment Without that freedom there cannot be any equality for women Those who are seeking to overturn the Supreme Court he added dont like the morality of that decision It offends their personal or religious or other deeply held views And they want to impose their morality on others who do not share their deeply held views The amendment which says A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution would require ratification by 38 states if cleared by Congress It would not outlaw abortion nor would it restore old laws struck down by the 1973 decision of the Court But it would empower both the states and Congress to pass new bans or restrictions
CELLS AND SOULS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/opinion/cells-and-souls.html,While genetic engineering in humans seems close enough to justify public concern we must not be swept away by fear of exaggerated dangers Unfortunately a broad spectrum of clergymen recently demanded a total ban on attempts at one kind of genetic engineering germline intervention that is insertion of genes into a cell that will become an embryo It was argued that a distinction cannot be drawn between medical and eugenic uses and that we should not try to eliminate defective genes because we have no right to tamper with evolution In contrast to the apocalyptic tone of this discussion a Presidential commission has realistically analyzed many conceivable dangers Its excellent report issued in December strongly supported the goal of somatic gene therapy  that is insertion of genes into body cells but not into germ cells sperm or eggs But the commission also expressed deep concern about changes perpetuated in future generations because such intervention would open up the awesome prospect of directing future evolution of the species The commission did not call for a ban but its position may have encouraged such a call It is important to examine this evolutionary argument carefully and to identify the real issues Let us consider parents who both carry a recessive gene for sickle cell disease along with the corresponding normal gene A child who inherits the defective gene from each parent will have the disease but a child with a single defective copy will not Three methods for preventing or curing the disease are conceivable identifying the double defect in an embryo by prenatal diagnosis thereby giving the parents the option of abortion and another pregnancy prenatal selection replacing the defective gene in somatic cells after birth or replacing it in the embryo It is easy to see that all three approaches would influence evolution Prenatal selection would encourage parents to produce carriers while somatic correction would produce people with a healthy body but a double defect in their germ cells Both would increase the frequency of the sickle cell gene in the next generation Germline correction in contrast would decrease the frequency If there were no other considerations what sensible person would not prefer germline intervention provided it is limited to therapy But there are other considerations First the real longterm danger is that genetic engineering might be used not only for therapy but also to improve our blueprint people according to somebodys plan But somatic cells might also be manipulated for this purpose And while the range of conceivable effects is broader for germline intervention the important line to draw is that between medical and eugenic uses rather than between somatic and germline cells Fortunately we are unlikely to face eugenic uses in this century because the traits one might be tempted to manipulate such as memory intelligence or motor skills are so complex and involve so many genes that the prospects for their meaningful control are very distant While the evolutionary and the blueprinting arguments thus prove to be weak there are other overwhelming reasons not to proceed with germline intervention First where a corrective gene enters a chromosome it may interrupt some other important gene producing a new hereditary defect Moreover while somatic therapy in a person already sick warrants a substantial risk the manipulation of a cell that is destined to become an infant would require very stringent standards of reliability far beyond what is in sight today Finally for a few diseases so far we already have a safe and simpler alternative method for reaching the same goal of preventing defective births prenatal diagnosis and selection For all these reasons the motivation for altering the genes in an embryo is very slight If we do not need a ban on germline intervention do we need a permanent commission to monitor human genetic engineering as Congress is considering Probably not A commission with such a narrow assignment might have to invent things to do Its existence would likely arouse false fears for there are always people eager to stir up anxiety and genetics is a favorite target Scary scenarios about manipulating our inner nature  our cells or souls  have wide appeal and the resulting pressures could interfere with beneficial medical research We should surely continue philosophic discussion of human applications on the excellent base provided by the Presidential commission But since we are dealing with potential treatment of individuals and not with possible largescale or irreversible effects we can afford to postpone legislation until a concrete problem comes into view
Prayer Amendment Endorsed,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/28/us/prayer-amendment-endorsed.html,The Reagan Administration today formally endorsed a constitutional amendment restoring voluntary prayer to the classroom Deputy Attorney General Edward Schmults was among the witnesses many from religious organizations before the Senate Judiciary Committee The committee is considering two proposals on school prayer One by the Administration would overrule the Supreme Court and provide for voluntary prayer in the schools The second supported by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon and others would allow silent prayer and meditation and guarantee students the right to meet for Bible study or prayer at school in nonclass hours To settle for a period of silent meditation is not really enough Mr Schmults said Senator Hatfield said his equal access proposal would extend to high schools the right the Supreme Court provided two years ago for students to meet for religious purposes on university campuses He said however that Federal courts in Texas and New York had ruled otherwise He said schools set forums by which students may voluntarily associate to establish a camera club music club or an athletic club or a philosophy club  to discuss Karl Marx or Hegel  but once they cross that boundary and begin to study Isaiah or Jesus Christ then that becomes illegal Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio opposed the amendment saying the nation was founded on the concept of separation of church and state He also said With 13 million Americans unemployed that the main issues in the Senate today have to do with abortion and prayer in the school is a rather sad commentary

FOES OF ABORTION BEATEN IN SENATE ON AMENDMENT BID,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/29/us/foes-of-abortion-beaten-in-senate-on-amendment-bid.html,The Senate today rejected a constitutional amendment that would have set the stage for laws to curb abortions The vote on the 10word amendment stating simply A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution was 50 to 49 18 short of the twothirds majority required Both houses of Congress must approve a constitutional amendment before it can be submitted to the states For it to be added to the Constitution threequarters of the states must also approve it Todays vote the first in Congress on a constitutional amendment designed to restrict abortions came after two days of occasionally emotional Senate debate This latest phase of the Congressional struggle to construct a constitutional framework for the banning of abortions was led by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah AntiAbortion Bill Expected Senator Hatch speaking to reporters just after the vote said the 49 votes his amendment attracted sent a message to the country that this is an issue that has to be resolved Senator Bob Packwood the Oregon Republican who led the opposition to the constitutional amendment said This is the end of any serious effort to overturn the fundamental decision that a woman has a right to make a choice for herself The defeat of the amendment set the stage for an effort by Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina representing another point of view among abortion opponents to offer another measure to curb abortions Mr Helmss measure was expected to be offered as either a bill or an amendment to a bill and as such it would require a simple majority for passage But as a law it would be subject to challenge in the courts Abortion Rights Upheld Less than two weeks ago the Supreme Court strongly reaffirmed the constitutional right to abortion first defined by the court a decade ago in its Rowe v Wade decision The proposed constitutional amendment referred to as the Human Life Federalism Amendment would not by itself have curbed abortions However it would have permitted the states and perhaps Congress itself to pass legislation circumscribing the conditions under which an abortion could be obtained or banning the procedure Although some may observe correctly that basic issues of individual rights are not subject to referendum in a free society this of course begs the question which is precisely what those rights are and what their relative priorities are Mr Hatch said It is the resolution of these precise questions that is unlikely to occur in the absence of a constitutional amendment of the sort of the Human Life Federalism Amendment The defeat of Mr Hatchs proposed constitutional amendment does not remove the issue from the Capitol Hill agenda Senator Helms is expected to offer his measure later in this session of Congress and other abortionrelated proposals are likely Symbolic Goal Is Denied Mr Helms describing the proposed constitutional amendment as at best a Pyrrhic victory for the unborn voted present and thus denied Mr Hatch the symbolic goal of 50 votes He and some antiabortion groups regarded the amendment as a tactical error and were critical of it because it did not provide for an outright banning of abortion Judie Brown president of the American Life Lobby said many opponents of abortion wasted precious time on the amendment We demand that they reassess their goals listen to the grassroots people of this nation and support legislation which can be passed and will do something to stop this dreadful slaughter Judy Goldsmith president of the National Organization of Women said the vote indicates that neither by constitutional amendment nor by statute can an unrepresentative minority force Government intrusion into the lives of individuals This weeks abortion debate was conducted on political legal and emotional levels with many members of the Senate framing the question in strict moral terms WideRanging Debate Abortion is a form of violence Senator Mark O Hatfield Republican of Oregon argued It is condoned by a society that has become callous and indifferent to the ultimate value of human life It is undergirded by a whole moral climate that elevates selfish personal convenience to a supreme status in human decisionmaking Senator Alan Cranston Democrat of California likened the proposed amendment to the 18th Amendment which brought on the Prohibition Era earlier in this century and which he said was an attempt to impose the moral convictions of one segment of our society upon the rest Senator Bill Bradley Democrat of New Jersey said he felt uneasy as a man determining for women whether they will have the right to a legal abortion since it is a decision I will never be asked to make Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum Republican of Kansas one of two women in the Senate said abortion is seldom if ever the right moral choice but it should nevertheless be a choice She added Government has already gone too far in intervening in areas better left to personal decisionmaking This type of Government interference will serve only to further restrict personal choice and to invite the flouting of our laws Senator Paula Hawkins Republican of Florida supported the constitutional amendment
TIME TO VOTE: THE SOUND AND THE FURY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/06/29/us/time-to-vote-the-sound-and-the-fury.html,Representative Gary L Ackerman a liberal Democrat from Queens astounded his colleagues recently when he voted in favor of funds for the MX missile The vote registered as a green light next to Mr Ackermans name on a huge tote board in the galleries on which he is listed first among the 435 House members and immediately the freshman lawmakers friends converged upon him They demanded an explanation I was in my office and looked up and the bells were ringing and I had seven minutes to get to the floor and vote Mr Ackerman recalled I ran over there put my card in the slot and hit the wrong button After his colleagues called attention to his mistake he went to the well of the House and changed his vote Mr Ackerman was not the first House member to hit the wrong button And if the chaos that surrounds most votes in the chamber continues as seems likely since no significant changes in the procedure are being contemplated he almost certainly will not be the last House votes are minireunions lasting 15 minutes the time alloted for all members to get to the chamber and cast their votes Hundreds of representatives arrive on the floor at once disgorged from packed elevators They mill around renewing acquaintances seeking informaton on the issue at hand lobbying one another exchanging gossip making plans for racketball games in the House gymnasium The Lights Are Dimmed Voting is electronic Members put plastic cards in slots behind desks on the House floor then press buttons to register a yea or nay vote The lights are dimmed so that members can see their votes and those of their colleagues on the electronic tote board in the gallery Although a members vote on a key issue can affect reelection prospects and although most members feel deeply about some principles some do not make up their mind until the last possible moment after the debate has concluded and just before the 15minute voting period has expired By that time they have had the benefit not only of the debate but also of knowing how most of their colleagues voted Until she was defeated for reelection last year Margaret M Heckler who is now Secretary of Health and Human Services was noted for casting late votes on the House floor Mrs Heckler frequently took her cue from another Massachusetts Republican Silvio O Conte who himself occasionally voted late and then changed his vote in a playful effort to confuse his colleague Essentially she is not a shootfromthehip person said Roger Woodworth who was Mrs Hecklers press secretary on Capitol Hill and now serves as her special assistant and speech writer She comes from a heavily Democratic district She had to weigh an enormous number of factors Often she did look up to see how everyone else voted It was partly curiosity If she was not a master of an issue she would obviously look for the delegations views Paying Political Debts Senators also play games The Senate Democrats resentful at being assailed by Republicans for supporting a debt limit extension when Jimmy Carter was President all voted against a debt limit extension sought by President Reagan Then they changed their votes after a majority of Republicans including the most conservative in the chamber had gritted their teeth and voted for the new debt limit themselves On some votes members of both chambers are genuinely uncertain about what to do until the final moment This morning for example Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah counted only 47 Senate votes in support of his constitutional amendment that would allow Congress or the states to ban abortion He picked up two supporters when the voting actually occurred Similarly Senator Bob Packwood Republican of Oregon who lead the fight against the amendment counted only 46 votes this morning but picked up four additional votes in the course of the day Occasionally you have a difficult issue and people agonize over it said Representative Dick Cheney of Wyoming chairman of the Republican Policy Committee Then there are members who are always undecided Some want to wait and see how others are going to go Some want things for their district and some are bent out of shape because something was handled badly by the Administration The sheer volume of votes is so great that theres no way you can weigh each and every issue he added If Barber Conable tells you something on taxes you can be sure its solid Mr Conable an upstate New York Republican who is the ranking minority member on the Ways and Means Committee said We have to shift gears seven times a day and have not thought deeply about every issue Thus members look to experts for guidance In every area of public policy you have people whose judgment you respect Mr Conable said If you cant understand why they voted as they did you go over and talk to them Looking to the Experts On education I look to John Erlenborn Mr Conable continued On banking Bill Stanton On military appropriations Jack Edwards You ask How come you voted for this turkey A lot of times youre surprised A bill has been changed in conference In every important vote supporters and opponents of a measure station themselves just inside the doors of both the House and Senate to seek to persuade those who can be persuaded There are relatively few who are truly undecided on a major vote said Representative Tom Loeffler of Texas chief deputy Republican whip They are the targets on close votes We have them talk to the leaders people with expertise White House experts agency experts Exploiting a members indecision are lobbyists who station themselves outside the House and Senate chambers and signal members with a thumb up or a thumb down This also serves as a cue for members who note who is doing the touting and then decide whether they generally agree with the lobbyist One pitfall however is appearing inconsistent in voting As a precaution a copy of previous rollcalls on similar issues is posted in the cloakrooms so that members can see how they voted on the issue the last time around You cast 1000 votes in the

A TRIUMPH FOR THE 'ABORTION PURVEYORS',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/01/opinion/l-a-triumph-for-the-abortion-purveyors-007206.html,To the Editor The Supreme Court Justices have again ruled that the individuals constitutional right to privacy takes precedence over the right to life of her unborn news story June 16 ocal or state officials may no longer legislate any regulations that are not justified for the woman seeking an abortion The Court has again defended the interests not only of abortionminded women but also of the 700millionayear abortion industry President Reagan wrote recently that the American people will reject abortion and infanticide but not until the issue is clearly framed and presented As obstetricians and gynecologists who have witnessed the miracle of birth thousands upon thousands of times and have seen these tiny human beings at all stages of their development we know what President Reagan is talking about It should be the duty of concerned obstetricians and healthcare personnel to help educate the public as to what abortion really is The courts have become increasingly more persistent in their attempts to modify the language and pass off abortion as another method of birth control thereby expunging its ageold stigma They are succeeding in their efforts The United States now leads the world in the number of teenage abortions  over 500000 yearly There are now more than 150000 secondtrimester abortions  the most grisly of all the ones that some hardened abortionists refuse to do because the killing is so real and unmistakable Abortion opponents however do not give up More and more Americans are recognizing the abortion operation for what it really is homicidal surgery on the most helpless of all human beings the unborn Something providential will happen to stop the killing Education and enlightenment could do it Laws protecting the rights of the unborn will follow MATTHEW J BULFIN MD President American Assn of Pro Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists LauderdalebytheSea Fla June 23 1983
Choice Is the Only Just Remedy,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/01/opinion/choice-is-the-only-just-remedy.html,This is not an exercise in futility Senator Orrin Hatch said Monday after the latest effort to overturn the 1973 Supreme Court decision making abortion legal The womens suffrage issue took 93 years to resolve Weve only been at this 10 years Senator Hatchs choice of comparison was curious in the extreme That it took 93 years for American women to win the right to vote is of course shameful But so too is the 10year effort to take away their right to decide for themselves whether to bear an unwanted child The Senators most recent contribution to the battle was a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed Congress and the states to ban abortions After it was beaten in the Senate Tuesday Senator Hatch said its 49 ayes sent a message to the country that this is an issue that has to be resolved On the contrary The bill fell 18 votes short of the needed twothirds majority which shows it already has been There is not and perhaps never will be an end to the abortion debate Some people will always find it morally indefensible others not But those who oppose it need never choose to have abortions Those who support the option should not be denied abortions because of the others beliefs In a perfect world one in which there were no victims of contraceptive failure ignorance or innocence no woman would have to exercise it Failing perfection choice is the only just remedy

THE NATION; ABortion Foes Overreach in The Senate,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/03/weekinreview/the-nation-abortion-foes-overreach-in-the-senate.html,In nearly a decade of Congressional debate those who oppose Federal laws limiting a womans right to abortion have been aided in no small way by squabbling among those who favor limitations Such was the case again last week in the Senate where a restrictive constitutional amendment lost 50 to 49 18 votes short of the necessary twothirds majority Paul Brown director of the Life Amendment Political Action Committee said that his allies in the antiabortion cause had unwisely applied pressure on Senators Orrin G Hatch a Republican from Utah and Thomas F Eagleton a Democrat from Missouri the sponsors of the 10word amendment The proposal stated that A right to abortion is not secured by this Constitution By pushing this futile amendment to the floor of the Senate Mr Brown said the National Right to Life Committee and the National Conference of Catholic Bishops have accomplished what the National Abortion Rights Action League and the Planned Parenthood Federation of America have not been able to do he said They have handed the prolife movement the greatest single legislative setback in its 10year history and have driven a mammoth wedge into the movement itself Senator Jesse Helms a Republican from North Carolina and a proponent of restrictions said that the vote had been a blunder because support for passage clearly hadnt been there from the start He promised that opponents of abortion would be back soon with statutory bans which require only simple majorities
Required Reading; Abortion and Responsibility,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/us/required-reading-abortion-and-responsibility.html,Remarks of Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum Republican of Kansas in Senate debate on the defeated constitutional amendment to allow Congress and the states to ban abortions June 28 1983 I was presiding yesterday when the Senator from Missouri Mr Eagleton gave I thought a very thoughtful analysis of the constitutional history of this very troubling issue I am not a lawyer so I am not able to speak to the legal aspects of this issue but I am addressing my colleagues today as a colleague and as a mother The national debate over abortion began long before I entered the Senate in 1979 Knowing this to be an issue about which feelings on both sides run deep and believing it important that my position not be misunderstood I stated my views on this issue at the outset of my campaign for the Senate As I said then and have repeated many times since I believe that abortion is seldom if ever the right moral choice but it should nevertheless be a choice I understand and respect the opinions of those who disagree with me Nonetheless I remain firm in my conviction that this issue is not one which is appropriately addressed in any legislative forum The tragedy of abortion is one which should be dealt with in the home and church not in Congress In my view one of the primary responsibilities of parenthood is instilling in ones children a sense of moral values This is not the responsibility of Government an institution which is clearly unsuited for such a function Success or failure rests with the family which is the single most important influence on the formation of the principles followed by an individual throughout his or her lifetime If the family fails it is folly to suggest that governmental fiat will make a measurable difference An ordered society rests upon the concept of individual responsibility As the Government itself assumes greater responsibility its citizens are moved further from acknowledging responsibility for their own actions I am one who believes that Government has already gone too far in intervening in areas better left to personal decisionmaking This type of Government interference will serve only to further restrict personal choice and to invite the flouting of our laws There are many times during which we as individuals must acknowledge responsibility for our actions be they right or wrong There are times when we need to think through the choices ourselves and arrive at independent decisions based not on outside mandates but upon the values we hold from our own upbringing and our sense of moral rightness Making a decision about abortion ranks in these categories Many suggest that those who support choice are somehow endorsing abortion as a preferred option This is ridiculous Abortion is a tragedy which no one is actively promoting There is no constitutional decision that makes abortion mandatory
THE ROLE OF 'BARNACLES' IN FOREIGN AID,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/us/the-role-of-barnacles-in-foreign-aid.html,Congress doesnt want the Palestine Liberation Organization or any other guerrilla type organization that has engaged in acts of terrorism to receive foreign aid funds Nor does Congress want to grant funds to Communist nations or to Afghanistan Argentina Chile Angola or Turkey except in special circumstances Nor does it want foreign aid to be used for family planning abortions gifts to officials of foreign governments or nations that are more than six months in arrears on repaying loans to the United States These are among more than 100 restrictions called barnacles attached to the Foreign Assistance Act of 1961 and amendments to it It is the current law governing the disbursement of foreign aid The restrictions which have accelerated in the wake of Vietnam and Watergate are defended by Congressional supporters as the only way Congress can assert its influence over foreign policy These things come about in part because of frustration with the executive branch said Representative Lee H Hamilton Democrat of Indiana Its a result of the activist stance of the Congress on foreign policy questions Years ago there were few barnacles because Congress was very passive very compliant with the executive branch Opponents argue however that the restrictions tie the hands of the President who has the primary responsibility for formulating foreign policy Everybodys a Secretary of State around here said Representative Henry J Hyde Republican of Illinois Its an exercise in power You get a kick out of meddling in foreign policy Its an aphrodisiac Restrictions on El Salvador Most Congressional experts do not believe that these restrictions were affected by the recent Supreme Court decision invalidating the legislative veto This is because they are part of the legislation signed by the President and do not enable Congress to halt Presidential actions after the fact The most recent barnacles involved restrictions on military aid to El Salvador which were adopted by both the Senate Foreign Relations Committee and the House Foreign Affairs Committee Both panels recommended that the military sales be conditioned upon the Presidents certification of improvements in the areas of human rights and criminal justice as well as upon efforts by the Salvadoran Government to enter into negotiations with opposition forces in an effort to achieve a political solution Its a troubling thing said Senator Nancy Landon Kassebaum the Kansas Republican who wrote the El Salvadoran restrictions adopted by the Foreign Relations Committee It seems to me that both the House and Senate are looking at these restrictions as ways of keeping our hand in shaping foreign policy Theres a real danger that we can get so involved in dotting the is and crossing the ts that its a little like the Lilliputians tying up Gulliver she added If Congress was involved earlier and more deeply we might not have to resort to the restrictions Presidents quite naturally resent Congressional restrictions I dont think theres any secret of how anyone in the Administration feels about it said L Craig Johnstone director of the State Departments Office of Central American Affairs It isnt that we dont agree with what the conditions are but they end up being unrealistic Leverage Sometimes Welcomed The general trend is not healthy for the conduct of foreign policy he continued It decentralizes the decisionmaking process and makes it difficult for the President to to represent the country in the conduct of foreign affairs But Presidents occasionally find that the restrictions give them welcome leverage in negotiating with other nations The Administration itself proposed last March that foreign aid to Greece be conditioned upon a Presidential certification that the United States had achieved a satisfactory agreement with Greece in the current negotiations with respect to access to and use of military facilities in that country by US forces This restriction adopted by Congress was proposed in a letter from Powell A Moore Assistant Secretary of State for Congressional Relations Some restrictions are cosmetic When Congress previously asked President Reagan to certify that the Salvadoran Government had made progress in human rights for example Mr Reagan complied although many in Congress and in the Administration doubted the accuracy of the certification In the El Salvador situation we were asking the President to certify the uncertifiable Mr Hamilton said knowing that the President would do so It distorted the whole debate The barnacles have a way of remaining on the law books long after their usefulness has ended In 1981 the Senate Foreign Relations Committee tried to get rid of redundant outdated restrictions such as a Turkish arms embargo that had been suspended But the symbolism of these restrictions proved potent and the lawmakers were unwilling to take on the controversial ones according to Larry Nowels an analyst in foreign affairs at the Congressional Research Service of the Library of Congress Role of Congress Is Key The proliferation of such restrictions nonetheless causes considerable concern on both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue Senator John Tower Republican of Texas said We may well be in a situation today which is analogous to that of the late 1930s when Americas inability to play a more active role in world affairs helped permit the Axis to realize its objectives without serious challenge During this period Congress tied the Presidents hands with disastrous consequences At the core of the debate is the question of the role of Congress in foreign affairs Mr Tower argues that 535 members of Congress with different philosophies regional interests and objectives cannot forge a unified foreign policy that reflects the interests of the United States as a whole Nor can they negotiate with foreign powers meet the requirement for diplomatic confidentiality nor respond decisively to swift changes on the international scene But others argue that the Constitution grants Congress certain powers that bespeak considerable involvement in foreign affairs These include the right to declare war raise an army and advise and consent to appointments In addition of course Congress has the power of the purse Consultation Recommended In their view the barnacles are a legitimate and necessary exercise of our Constitutional responsibility in the words of Representative Stephen J Solarz Democrat of Brooklyn We learned in Vietnam that the President is not necessarily the fount of all wisdom Congress has no monopoly on wisdom either Prospects are enhanced when both Congress and the President play a role Mr Hamilton said that instead of the barnacles the best thing would be consultation between the President and the Congress but the executive branch usually has other things on its mind The only way to get their attention is a restriction Jerel A Rosati a professor of government at the University of South Carolina who previously studied the issue at the Congressional Research Service concludes that despite widespread misgivings the involvement of Congress will deepen The days of constant Presidential supremacy in most areas of foreign policy appear to have come to an end he said Congressional involvement and influence will continue unless a global calamity occurs which creates a chronic and constant state of national emergency for the US
FETAL RESEARCH: NEW FIELD OFFERS PROMISE AMID PROBLEMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/05/science/fetal-research-new-field-offers-promise-amid-problems.html,MEDICAL scientists are confronting a new and potentially explosive issue the treatment of human illness particularly diseases of the brain and central nervous system by transplanting tissue from aborted human embryos Scientists whose research is likely to make such treatment possible in the future discussed the matter at a recent meeting in Brookline Mass They invited a theologian a lawyer and a philosopher to join in the discussion All three attested to the extreme importance of the issue and its potential for dividing the nation even while offering hope for treating some serious diseases that have defied all medical efforts in the past The use of embryonic tissues might be able to correct such tragic conditions as paralysis resulting from spinal cord injury as well as some currently untreatable disorders of the brain Although no one knows how distant this prospect may be research described at the meeting indicated that some applications are not necessarily reserved for the far future The question of using human embryos or their tissues in medical procedures has arisen repeatedly in recent months A frozen fertilized human egg cell was used this year to produce a pregnancy in a woman in Australia where the attempt drew protests from antiabortion activists The pregnancy ended in a spontaneous abortion In the United States and elsewhere animal experiments are being conducted with the longrange goal of perfecting a treatment for human diabetes by transplanting human insulinproducing cells taken from embryos But the newly foreseeable possibility of transplanting human embryonic brain tissues adds an important dimension Such transplants would probably have the largest application of all if they prove practical and effective in years to come At the threeday meeting in Brookline last week specialists in brain research discussed the possibility of using embryonic tissue transplants to accomplish such currently impossible goals as treating paraplegics whose spinal cords have been damaged and correcting the brain defects and degeneration of brain cells that accompany Parkinsons disease Alzheimers disease Huntingtons chorea and other degenerative diseases of the central nervous system The treatments are not yet possible but recent progress in animal research suggests that some applications might be realized within several years Dr Vernon Mark a neurosurgeon at the Harvard Medical School and Boston City Hospital said the moment medical scientists convinced themselves that the time had arrived to try any such clinical application there would be a deluge of patients seeking repair of what are now irreparable losses of nerve and brain functions We are not suggesting that this kind of clinical work will be applied tomorrow or next year or three years from now or even within this decade Dr Mark said We hope that it will We cant predict when the crucial experimental data will be in But he said it was by no means premature to discuss the social and ethical issues inherent in the research I think that it is important to realize he said that in any kind of scientific meeting that emphasizes inquiry where so much is unknown that the doubts the caveats the reservations are an important part of the development of the scientific process None of us would be here if we did not have a fundamental optimism that the kinds of things we have talked about during the last three days will come to fruition He and Dr Thomas D Sabin a colleague at Boston City Hospital and Boston University were the principal organizers of the conference which was sponsored by the American Paralysis Association Dr Sabin emphasized that no attempts had yet been made to use human embryonic tissues for treating human brain problems and that no one could be certain how long it would be before they were possible But he and others said research was progressing rapidly and that the effort had expanded greatly in recent months with more and more research teams entering that field Experiments Are Described One of the scientific highlights of the meeting was the description by Dr Albert J Aguayo of Montreal General Hospital of animal experiments in which nerves of the central nervous system such as those of the spinal cord were induced to grow along transplanted bridges of peripheral nerve fibers This successful elongation of central nervous system fibers has only recently been achieved Dr Aguayo said there was evidence that natural electrical nerve impulses were being transmitted along these nerve fibers but no evidence at all of restored function in the control of limbs paralyzed by damage to the spinal cord One still unsolved problem is that when such a nerve cell extension reenters the spinal cord or brain tissue it seems to stop growing after only a few millimeters Dr Aguayo said many important questions remained to be answered before anything similar was tried in a human Dr William J Freed of St Elizabeths Hospital in Washington and Dr Carl W Cotman of the University of California at Irvine separately reported success in transplanting brain tissue into animals resulting in the production of nervesignal transmission substances in regions of the brain where such production had been experimentally eliminated In some cases the transplants have succeeded despite major genetic differences between the donor and recipient Dr Freeds studies involved transplants of brain cells that produce dopamine the substance that appears to be missing or not properly used in the brains of patients suffering from Parkinsons disease In two cases including one this year surgeons in Sweden have tried a somewhat similar strategy in patients suffering from severe Parkinsons disease In each case dopamineproducing cells were taken from the patients own adrenal glands and transplanted into his brain Scientists at the meeting in Brookline said reports from the Swedish team indicated that neither patient benefited from the attempt Dr Mark Dr Sabin and their colleagues recently tried an even more direct approach in one patient They administered dopamine directly into a natural cavity called a ventricle in the brain of a Parkinsons disease patient The disease was in an advanced state the scientists said at the meeting and the patient was no longer responding to the standard drugs The medical team started with very small amounts of dopamine and increased them gradually to doses far greater than would ever appear in a normal brain The researchers said they were surprised at the patients physical tolerance of the heavy doses but the therapeutic effects were disappointing There was some diminution in the patients abnormal muscle movements but these modest improvements were accompanied by great mental confusion and other severe psychological effects The circumstances strongly suggested that the excess of dopamine in the part of the patients brain exposed to it was responsible for the adverse mental effects the scientists reported They said the result also suggested that tissue transplants to achieve an improved dopamine supply might be premature until more was known about the effects of administering the substance directly into the brain Another implication may be the need for greater precision in delivering the dopamine to the regions of the brain where it would be most needed Since the major focus of the meeting was on transplanting brain tissues as a potential treatment for human patients the three main speakers at the session on ethical problems addressed primarily the problem of using tissues from aborted fetuses The Rev Paul Murphy a Jesuit priest who is a retired professor of theology at Boston College said such use could be morally defensible under some circumstances for example if the embryonic tissue came from a spontaneous abortion On the other hand he said the future demand for such tissues could lead to a crass commerce in aborted fetuses There could be abuses that would make the most dazzling triumph not worth having he said William A Carnahan of the Washington law firm of LeBoeuf Lamb Leiby  McRae said a serious problem arose from the fact that there was no moral consensus in the United States on abortion It is a subject on which reasonable people disagree vigorously he said As a result people who feel strongly on each side of the issue will use legal decisions as weapons in their fight to promote their own moral views he said Prof Robert C Neville dean of humanities and fine arts at the State University of New York at Stony Brook said the prospects for important progress in using transplanted embryonic tissues put at odds two of the finest aspects of humanity the urge to do good for others on the one hand and the deep concern for the independence and integrity of the individual on the other Among other imperatives for the future he said society should never allow conception and pregnancy to occur simply for the purpose of producing embryos for transplants Yet just such a temptation may arise in the future he said Later in a discussion period Dr William Regelson of the Medical College of Virginia said the whole issue of using aborted fetuses for tissue transplants might be rendered obsolete by the continuing stream of improvements in contraceptives and related birth control methods In the future there may simply not be enough fetal tissues available for the possible uses discussed at the meeting he said Dr Regelson said there was a need for a strong research drive to develop improved methods of tissue culture so that cells and tissues could be grown directly in the laboratory for many uses He also called for research aimed at making animal tissues compatible with the human body so that tissues from other species might someday be used for repairs of human organs
THE BUREAUCRACY; INFLUENCE OF SUB-CABINET CONSERVATIVES IS MIXED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/06/us/the-bureaucracy-influence-of-sub-cabinet-conservatives-is-mixed.html,In a recent speech President Reagan said For the first time in half a century weve developed a whole new cadre of young conservatives in Government He was referring to the host of conservative Republicans who have been appointed to subCabinet jobs in his Administration The appointees it now seems clear have had mixed success Some have boldly articulated conservative concerns and altered the direction of Government policy Some have proclaimed the conservative point of view but failed to effect any significant change either because Congress balked because the bureaucracy proved intransigent or because Federal courts stood in the way The most important thing said Susan Phillips director of intergovernmental services at the Department of Education is that we are getting secondline experience Conservatives didnt have that experience before We are learning how the bureaucracy runs We now know how the Government goes about the process of giving away tax dollars If we ever have an opportunity to be in those toplevel frontline positions well know what to do Miss Phillips is the sister of Howard Phillips who is chairman of the Conservative Caucus a lobbying and fundraising group She was recruited by Charles L Heatherly a Deputy Under Secretary of Education who edited Mandate for Leadership the Heritage Foundations 1093page blueprint for change under a conservative President that was published just before Mr Reagan took office Tendency To Be Outspoken It is difficult to overestimate the importance of subCabinet appointees They define the character of an Administration they control the levers of power and they tend to be more outspoken and zealous than the sober cautious people Presidents normally select for Cabinet jobs One of the more effective apostles of neoconservative views within the Reagan Administration is Michael J Horowitz counsel to the director of the Office of Management and Budget whose scorn for liberal orthodoxy is sharpened by the knowledge that he used to subscribe to it As a civil rights worker in the South Mr Horowitz staunchly defends President Reagans record on civil rights including his effort to replace three members of the United States Commission on Civil Rights The Reagan nominees he said were far more distinguished than those they would replace Mr Horowitz likes to assail what he calls the conventional wisdom enjoys a good debate and seems to have an instinctive attraction to controversy He was the point man for the Presidents drive to abolish the Legal Services Corporation He was in his own words blowtorched from the left right and center when he tried to restrict political advocacy by organizations receiving Federal grants and contracts And he showed remarkable prescience when he warned the President last year that we are being savaged by the fairness issue referring to criticism about the impact of Mr Reagans budget cuts on the poor More Difficulty at HSS In his effort to bolster the intellectual underpinnings of the Presidents civil rights policy Mr Horowitz has had the assistance of two other conservatives Michael M Uhlmann a White House adviser who follows legal issues and Bruce E Fein who as a Justice Department official helped devise the legal strategy defending tax exemptions for private schools that practice racial discrimination The Supreme Court rejected those arguments but Mr Fein has been given broader responsibilities in a new job as general counsel of the Federal Communications Commission Conservatives have had more difficulty changing the course of the Department of Health and Human Services where the career civil servants are basically supporters of the programs Mr Reagan wanted to cut Conservatives had hoped that Marjory E Mecklenburg former director of a national antiabortion group would curtail Federal grants to family planning clincs and aggressively investigate reports of hospitals withholding care from infants born with severe defects But Gary L Curran a spokesman for the American Life Lobby said Mrs Mecklenburg had generally been unable to make major changes as director of adolescent pregnancy programs She and several other Reagan appointees at the department had solid conservative credentials he said but they got eaten alive by the technically more competent people who were buried in the Civil Service Friends in the Religious Right Robert Billings a graduate of Bob Jones University in Greenville SC served as president of the National Christian Action Coalition a lobbying group for private schools and as executive director of Moral Majority before joining the Department of Education in 1981 He now supervises the departments 10 regional offices Like Barry Goldwater he said I hope I am Mr Conservative at the Department of Education He described the religious right as my constituents and my friends But at the department he said he could not cite any concrete personal accomplishment that advanced the conservative cause He boasted of reducing the size of his staff but said sheepishly I am not high enough up the ladder to have had a lot of influence William J Bennett the chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities has tried to shift the emphasis of that agencys work away from shallow contemporary studies back toward more rigorous traditional types of scholarship He deplores the fact that at many colleges course after course caters to contemporary fascinations designed to foster the personal development of the student Mr Bennett has charted a straightforward conservative course for the agency and he receives high marks from many conservatives By comparison at a sister agency the National Endowment for the Arts headed by Francis SM Hodsoll the changes have been marginal by most accounts Mr Hodsoll has tightened up the administration of arts programs but has not fundamentally altered the agencys philosophy or mission or its standards for awarding grants He and other conservatives brought into the agency including Ruth Berenson a former art critic for The National Review have been persuaded by the arts establishment that the case for Federal subsidies is somewhat stronger than they had initially thought

HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/07/garden/hers.html,THE headline in The New York Times of May 31 read Long Lives Seen as Threat to Nations Budget and the story said that two economists had calculated that if all the people who died prematurely in 1978 from cancer heart disease and violence including accidents had been able to reach their full life expectancy the Federal Government would have suffered a net loss of 15 billion These statistics from the Federal Office of Management and Budget came hard on the heels of a Reagan Administration proposal to shift the burden of support for the elderly from Governmentfunded programs to the elderly themselves and their children As with the squeal rule designed to deal with teenage sex the impact of the Presidents notion is guaranteed to wreak havoc on the American family It also bespeaks a dangerous naivete about how American families function or fail to in 1983 Families are dispersed ties slacken families are smaller so fewer people share in the cost of supporting the elderly More women have joined the work force so fewer look after the aged at home Neither official pronouncement is designed to make an older person feel exactly wanted Should we be so gauche as to survive the geriatric assaults on our health then the Federal Government would judge us unAmerican If this is indeed a covert declaration of war on the elderly I say lets strike back Were 24 million strong but to make a dent on official Washington weve got to change our public image The gun tobacco oil bank  you name it lobbies dont have to worry about their images they move through Capitol corridors with confidence and wads of century notes The old have nothing going for them but their vast numbers Lets face it were our own worst enemies Weve made selfpity our trademark our favorite prop is the tin cup Weve got to wipe that apprehensive look off our faces stop complaining about the steep steps on buses stop describing our triple bypasses to anyone who will listen stop gushing gratitude when someone gets up to give us a seat We must sit straight  stand tall and put a gleam in our eyes Why not think of ourselves as aging bodies with Jane Fondas screaming to get out Granted to come by this formidable image will take effort well have to nourish and exercise our bodies souls and brains and the earlier we start in life the better There was a time long ago when the old were revered for their wisdom As wisdoms credit grew smaller and smaller the old began with predictable obstinacy to live longer and longer The acute irony here is that the selfsame science that made wisdom obsolete added decades to mans life And now we learn that with every added year of old age we are hammering yet another coffin nail in the American economy Uncle Sams digit is pointed at us the senior citizens and hes saying I want not only the young but you the old to die for their country The debate over the elderly poses medical and philosophical questions of global dimensions The medical aspects are simpler for they deal with the fairly wellknown properties of the aging human body the philosophical ones start waves that pound at every nook and cranny of human existence Some doctors in geriatric medicine concentrate simply on curing the diseases of the old with little concern for its cost or the patients general wellbeing others extend their attention to include the quality of home care nursing homes hospices leisure diet and exercise longterm care in hospitals and the appropriateness of heroic interventions in elderly patients I talked recently to several geriatric specialists in Boston and Houston All were eager to talk about their specialties but when I asked them to consider the larger implications of geriatric medicine they had less to say Dr Baruch Brody a doctor of philosophy and director of the Center for Ethics Medicine and Public Issues at Houstons Baylor School of Medicine came closest to answering my queries We must rethink the last year of life because it accounts for 30 percent of all Medicare costs he said I realize there may be abuses but we will invariably go down that road We must ask ourselves Are we using too much hightech medicine on the elderly In Europe generally kidney dialysis is out of the question for the elderly in Britain bypass surgery is not used just to relieve pain We will have to begin to ask What are we buying Is it appropriate And just in time the hospice movement is pointing the way to better treatment for the terminally ill Dr Brody also favored earlier retirement to make room for the young Young scholars without jobs would like to lynch Claude Pepper he said with some heat To compensate for the longer postjob years Dr Brody would educate people to think beyond their jobs into the rewarding uses of leisure We are too joboriented in this country There are so many other things to be and do Unresolved questions remain for instance If you believe that nature some would call it God has a plan does the plan also encompass the planets going bonkers and threatening to blow itself to bits Does nature truly intend man to selfdestruct It provided him with the resources both natural and intellectual to achieve the nuclear age but the package failed to include a solution for the disposal of its wastes Meanwhile the life force refuses to bow to the death wish Man  and woman  are hellbent to put ever more people on the planet Wars and pestilence no longer control the earths population Yet we annually give birth to millions of redundancies as the gap between what people are able to do and what needs doing inexorably widens Our search for that elusive Quality of Life continues to stagger under the weight of sheer Quantity We know how to control the number of those coming into the world Will we learn how to control those on the way out and how to make distinctions between the personal claims of compassion duty and guilt and the larger more intractable demands of society Doctors have been using euphemisms like triage  and gatekeeping decisions and of course euthanasia has been around for a long time Having been given the right to choose contraception and abortion will we in the next century be given the right to choose death As a family mine has been through the lingering deaths of several aged relatives and viewed them all with a certain skepticism It was not only the wasted resources involved but the more nagging question of the ethics and logic of prolonged dying No question about it the aged are going to be a burning issue for the foreseeable future We ask only that we be made party to the discussions that affect our very lives Reagan may jocosely include himself among the elderly but his proposal sounds perilously like a bid to American breadwinners to slip their aged relatives a Mickey Finn
REPORTER'S NOTEBOOK: TEACHERS' MEETING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/07/us/reporter-s-notebook-teachers-meeting.html,The ghost of Ronald Reagan seemed to fill the vast Civic Center here for the five days of the National Education Associations convention Though the President was 3000 miles away in California he was the bete noire around whom this meeting which ended today often seemed to be revolving Mr Reagan a strong critic of the association was repeatedly castigated and ridiculed There was even a move to defeat an item simply because it included the Presidents name which someone said should never be mentioned in an NEA document The Maine delegation took advantage of the rancor to raise some money to defray its convention costs Mr Reagans espousal of merit pay for teachers has particularly rankled the association and the Maine representatives sold hundreds of buttons reading Try Merit Pay in the White House Its a hot item Paula M Gaudet a second grade teacher in Winthrop Me said We sold a good one last year too But too many delegates didnt get the joke maybe theyre too young That one said Jane Wyman Was Right  One of the complications facing the associations convention planners has been the organizations ban on meeting in any state that did not ratify the proposed Equal Rights Amendment which expired last year for want of ratification from enough states Such convention cities as Chicago Atlanta and Miami Beach were off limits making it difficult to find places to accommodate 8000 delegates and thousands of family members This week however the association quietly voted to remove the ban concluding that its continuation would do little to promote the chances of the new ERA in the Congress and in state legislatures and could prove organizationally burdensome to NEA Did the association widely known as an advocate of liberal causes back down from its principles No said Robert E Harman the groups communications director The issue is moot and states cant do anything about it anymore The associations meeting with its campaigns for office banners funny hats and lengthy floor debates is like a national political convention Adding to this resemblance is the proliferation of caucuses Each of the 50 states has a caucus There are other kinds as well caucuses that cross state lines for teachers who are women or military veterans for example advocates of peace and opponents of abortion There are caucuses for American Indian Hispanic Asian Jewish and Irish teachers One of the newest is the Slavic Caucus At first people laughed said Robert F Oravetz of Shippensburg Pa who organized the group and is its president But now said Mr Oravetz whose grandparents were born in what became Czechoslovakia the caucus is taken seriously and has grown to 177 members The caucus won approval for a resolution backing Solidarity the banned independent union in Poland One of the caucus meetings this week was at the Warsaw Cafe where members dined on borscht Transylvania casserole and palachinki a kind of crepe Mr Oravetz was elated the other day over the newest member We just got our first Albanian he said A gathering this large seems conducive to the promulgation of weighty pronouncements and scattered through the agenda were business items deploring the threat of nuclear war calling for an improved system of health care and denouncing apartheid in South Africa Though sympathetic to these goals some delegates tried to get the delegates to give priority to debating purely educational issues They were concerned that as has happened in the past items at the tail end of the agenda including some dealing with compelling educational issues would remain undiscussed for another year Consideration of collective bargaining issues for teachers should have precedence over whether we support World Childrens Day for example said Betty Kraemer a sixth grade teacher in Berkeley Township NJ When all of our professional issues have been addressed then and only then should we start solving the worlds problems The move was defeated and the association continued solving some of the global ills Among those who came to the convention to talk with the teachers about the condition of education were several of the contenders for the Democratic nomination for President  Priscilla McGuire a high school history teacher in Colebrook NH expects to get a double dose of these speeches when the candidates descend on her state for the first Presidential primary She is starting to wonder though when some politican is going to do something about what she considers the greatest single problem in education salaries We continually hear the rhetoric and Im waiting for one of them to put his money where is mouth is said Miss McGuire who at the age of 36 has been teaching 14 years and has an annual salary of 13600 Thats the problem with education in this country
STANFORD'S ADVISERS REAFFIRM DISMISSAL FOR ANTHROPOLOGIST,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/08/us/stanford-s-advisers-reaffirm-dismissal-for-anthropologist.html,A special panel of professors has found that Stanford University was justified in dismissing a graduate student last winter because of his conduct while working in China the school said yesterday The threemember panel said that the behavior of the student Steven W Mosher showed a pattern of dealings that involved deliberate disregard for the law of China and a manipulative approach toward the people with whom he was living and working in a Chinese village The panel also accused Mr Mosher of a serious lack of candor in his dealings with his supervising professors This behavior was incompatible with being an anthropologist the professors concluded But the panel left unresolved the question of what the exact charges and evidence were about Mr Moshers activities in China Evidence Remains Sealed The panel contended that a secret 47page report on the Mosher case by an investigating committee of the Stanford anthropology department which contains the charges and evidence should remain confidential Disclosure would be inadvisable for ethical considerations relating to the welfare of other persons the panel said without specifying who the others involved were The panel was set up by Dean Norman K Wessels of Stanfords School of Humanities and Sciences in May to review a grievance Mr Mosher had filed against the school for his explusion from its PhD program It consisted of two professors emeritus from Stanford Gordon Wright a historian and Ernest Hilgard a psychologist and Ward Goodenough a professor of anthropology at the University of Pennsylvania The Mosher case has touched off a dispute about academic freedom and raised questions whether Stanford bowed to pressure from Peking and some American China scholars to retaliate against Mr Mosher Mr Mosher 34 years old did his field work in a village near Canton in 1979 and 1980 and gained access to an unusual collection of local government documents that the Chinese regarded as confidential The Chinese were angered by his activities and made charges including smuggling and bribery Mr Mosher also published an article in Taiwan about the issues of forced abortion and infanticide in rural China and many American scholars tied this action to the official Chinese decision to cut off American field work Mr Mosher now lives in Taiwan and could not be reached by telephone
POWER OF WOMEN'S VOTE CITED AT CONVENTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/09/us/power-of-women-s-vote-cited-at-convention.html,The 2000 women attending the National Womens Political Caucus convention here were told in opening ceremonies today that women could elect the President in 1984 You have the power to determine who will fill elected positions from the courthouse to the White House said Gov Mark White of Texas a Democrat who acknowledged that he was elected in 1982 because of womens support Your power cannot be denied A few minutes later Bella S Abzug the former Democratic Congresswoman from Manhattan received a standing ovation when she told the audience Women will decide who the next President of the United States will be 1984 Elections the Theme The Governor and Mrs Abzug were among several speakers who addressed the delegates at the Arneson River Theater on the banks of the San Antonio River They set a theme of the fourday national convention how women can use their voting tendency to their political advantage in the 1984 elections Polling data show that women vote for Democrats more than men do In the latest New York TimesCBS News Poll for example 57 percent of men and 39 percent of women said they approved of Mr Reagans handling of the Presidency Five of the six major declared candidates for the Democratic Presidential nomination will speak Sunday They are former Vice President Walter F Mondale and Senators John Glenn of Ohio Gary Hart of Colorado Alan Cranston of California and Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina Former Gov Reubin Askew of Florida declined to attend the convention Kathy Wilson of Alexandria Va the 31yearold head of the caucus said the organization would make no Presidential endorsement this weekend But if President Reagan doesnt change his policies towards women she added in an interview we may make an endorsement in 1984 The bipartisan organization has never endorsed a Presidential candidate Reagan Is Denounced Mrs Wilson said the Reagan Administration had employed a superficial BandAid approach to womens issues She criticized the Presidents antiabortion stand his opposition to the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and what she called his refusal to address the economic needs of women In a statement distributed at the convention caucus leaders charged that Mr Reagans programs and policies have systematically eroded or eliminated the gains of over two decades Because of his awareness of potentially devastating opposition from women the statement says President Reagan has tried to portray himself in recent months as a man committed to fairness and equality for American women But the Presidents deeds belie his words Republican for the Defense One Reagan supporter at the convention is Betty Heitman of Louisiana the cochairman of the Republican National Committee She acknowledged that some Republican women were disenchanted with Mr Reagan because of his opposition to the equal rights amendment and abortion But I think he has a good record on equal rights for women she added He just doesnt do a good job of publicizing it Mrs Heitman cited as examples the virtual elimination of the estate tax laws which used to force many widows to sell their homes farms or businesses changes in the Federal Individual Retirement Account Savings Act which she said made it easier for women to retire an increase in childcare tax credits for working mothers and new programs for female owners of small businesses The caucus founded in 1971 is dedicated to getting women into political office Its 77000 members make it the countrys second largest feminist political organization behind the National Organization for Women which has 200000 members According to the caucuss statistics there are now 992 women in state legislatures up from 362 when the caucus was formed Women also hold 24 seats in Congress as against 15 in 1971 and are mayors in 76 cities with populations over 30000 up from seven in 1971
HELMS AND ANTI-HELMS CAMPAIGNS GOING STRONG,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/09/us/helms-and-anti-helms-campaigns-going-strong.html,It was a cross between a prayer breakfast and a political rally Jesse Helms is a national treasure the Rev Jerry Falwell told a group of 250 ministers and lay leaders They responded with a chorus of Praise the Lord and Amen Jesse Helms is the most important man in Washington besides the President in the cause of leading this nation back to moral sanity Mr Falwell continued Can you imagine if we had 100 Jesse Helmses in the US Senate My my The audience responded with hosannas when the Senator said Im not doing a thing in the world in the Senate that you would not do if you were there He cited his opposition to abortion and his support of school prayer and profamily promoral legislation a strong national defense and military aid to El Salvador Ministers as Registrars The breakfast was the nexttolast stop in a twoday voter registration drive in which Senator Helms 61 years old joined Mr Falwell the leader of Moral Majority at stops in Asheville Charlotte Wilmington and Raleigh The objective was to use the churches as voter registration centers and enlist the ministers and lay leaders as registrars We plan minimum to enroll 200000 new voters in the state by next year Mr Falwell told the audience And were talking about the kind of people who make a difference A similar drive has been initiated by the Rev Jesse L Jackson who is leading a nationwide effort and is himself considering seeking a Presidential nomination In North Carolina he said he will use the black pulpits in an effort to register 200000 voters with the express purpose of turning Mr Helms out of office Senator Helmss probable opponent for the Senate next year Gov James B Hunt Jr 45 years old is a moderate Democrat who like Mr Falwell hopes to make Jesse Helms the central issue in the campaign Theyve Been Embarrassed People feel deeply about the kind of representation weve had in Washington Mr Hunt said in an interview Theyve been embarrassed A poll published last week by The Charlotte Observer showed Mr Hunt leading Mr Helms by 50 percent to 31 percent with 6 percent favoring other candidates The poll found the Governors support deep and wide with solid support among all voter groups The campaign pits the most prominent politician the state has produced since Senator Sam J Ervin Jr against a popular but cautious Governor The Governor is as difficult to categorize as North Carolina said Gary Pearce his press secretary Its a morally conservative state but in terms of health care and education its a progressive state Strong Showing by Democrats Democrats outnumber Republicans by a ratio of 3 to 1 and last year they ousted two Republican members of the United States House of Representatives Democrats say the states two conservative Republican Senators Mr Helms and John East are political aberrations The campaign has already become a national one Conservatives around the country have contributed to Mr Helmss reelection bid which Mr Hunt estimates will cost 14 million a figure Mr Helms disputes Liberals and moderates from other states have assisted Mr Hunt thereby providing grist for the Helms for Senate Committee The committee has sponsored advertisements quoting the Governor as saying that outofstate campaign contributions create obligations you ought not to have and showing photographs of Mr Jackson Julian Bond Senator Edward M Kennedy Sol Linowitz and several labor leaders who support Mr Hunt Accusations of Racism Some Democrats charge the advertisements are racist in the word of David Price a professor of political science at Duke University who is expected to be elected Saturday as chairman and executive director of the state Democratic Party But Thomas F Ellis a Raleigh lawyer who is Mr Helmss chief political aide said The greatest example of racism is Jesse Jackson when he says weve got to register 200000 blacks to put Helms out of a job The Governor has won acclaim for bringing industry into the state where the 84 percent unemployment rate is below the national average He has also stressed education improved the state university system and created a North Carolina School of Science and Mathematics modeled after the Bronx High School of Science The Governor describes himself as a fiscal conservative He opposes abortion but believes a woman should be able to make her own decision He says Children should be able to pray in school as they do in homes not with politicians making up the prayers Mr Helms told the breakfast rally We have it in our hands to turn this country around Ive often been accused of trying to turn the clock back and that is correct Id like to turn the clock back to where the Constitution meant something Both candidates say they have not fully made up their minds to run But each could have his partys nomination for the asking and their aides believe the die is cast Mr Ellis said that unless the political climate changed mightily in the next several months Mr Helms would definitely run Though Mr Hunt has said he is hesitating for lack of funds Mr Pearce said It clearly looks like the money will be there and hell run
INITIATIVE AND REFERENDUM PROPOSAL FACES SHOWDOWN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/nyregion/initiative-and-referendum-proposal-faces-showdown.html,NO ONE blurts them out immediately but the words Proposition 13 inevitably creep into almost every discussion of a proposal to grant powers of initiative and referendum to New Jersey voters Proposition 13 which clamped a ceiling on California property taxes and limited reassessments symbolizes the possibility that New Jersey citizens if so empowered would tamper with the states tax structure and other fiscal policies A proposal to amend the State Constitution to provide for citizen initiative and referendum has been passed in the Senate but faces a shaky future in th Assembly It must be approved by the lower house by the first week in August if it is to appear on the November ballot Under the Senateapproved measure bills and constiutional amendments could be initiated by direct petition from a requisite number of voters and placed on the ballot in the form of referendums Petitioners however must first seek a legislative vote on their proposal If the Legislature does not act within six months the question would then be placed on the ballot in the ensuing general election Initiative and referendum laws already exist in more than half the states in the nation It was the proces sof initiative and referendum that enabled California voters to pass Proposition 13 in 1978 with the result that municipalities were faced with the loss of more than half their revenue Although tomorrow is expected to be the last day of the present legislative session Samuel V Perelli chairman of United Taxpayers of New Jersey and Joanne Oser executive director of the New Jersey chapter of Common Cause have asked Governor Kean to call a special session to force the measure to a vote Governor Kean was the sponsor of an initiative and referendum bill of his own in 1977 when he was a n Assemblyman Senator John H Dorsey Repulbican of Boonton Township who was also an Assemblyman at the time was cosponsor Mr Dorsey maintained his interest in the matter after his election to the Senate and is sponsor of the current Senate bill Richard A Zimmer Republican of Flemington is the sponsor of a parallel bill in the Assembly The proposals are described by the legislators as bills although technically they are resolutions asking that a proposed amendment to the State Constitution be placed before the voters Mr Perelli said he began his campaign for initiative and referendum when his organization United Taxpayers failed in its efforts to prevent a state income tax We collected one million signatures and presented them to the Legislature but our efforts made absolutely no difference he said I asked myself how it was possible to collect a million signatures and have them count for nothing Mr Perelli says he fears that initiative and referendum will fall by the wayside also as the result of efforts by the Assembly Speaker Alan J Karcher Democrat of Sayreville Mr Karcher has introduced his own version of the Dorsey bill but with changes that Mr Perelli feels render it ineffective Mr Karchers proposal would exclude from the process of initiative and referendum laws regarding elections legislative and Congressional redistricting and apportionment appropriation of money raising of revenue and limitations on government expenditures The Karcher bill also would make it harder to gather signatures on any petition for referendum and would require that the proposal be thrown out if the courts find anyt part of it unconstitutional Mr Dorsey and Mr Zimmer immediately denounced the Karcher measure Mr Karcher said that he supported the concept of initiative and referendum but that he wanted to spare the state some of the programs that its proponents favor The whole thrust of this matter so far is repeal of the state income tax repeal of the sales tax and repeal of the 20th century he said Mr Karcher added that initiative and referendum also could be used to limit the amount of money available for garbage collection libraries or salaries for teachers police officers and firefighters And he said that it could bar the use of public funds for mass transit or divert the use of casino gambling proceeds from projects for the elderly to other special interests Mr Dorsey has his own ideas about how initiative and referendum could be used in New Jersey Sure we could have our own version of Proposition 13 he said but we could also use the measure to eliminate some departments in state government For instance some of us have been dissatisfied with ways in which the Public Advocates office has been functioning Another issue Mr Dorsey said is the bottle bill which has been introduced every year since 1973 but has never been released from committee in either house That measure which would require a deposit on all glass bottles to help reduce litter has been opposed by glass manufacturers Mr Zimmer said that Congressional redistricting was also a possible subject for citizen referendum The Legislature has done a terrible job of gerrymandering the Congressional districts and it was a conflict of interest for the Legislature to have attempted it he said This was a job for an independent panel exclusive of active politicians One of the strongest opponents of initiative and referendum is the New Jersey Education Association which fears that a reduction in taxes could play havoc with the public schools There could be movements to take money out of teachers salaries or pensions or to end systems of tenure and permanent certification said Robert P Brokerick a spokesman for the association The schools could be decimated by any number of measures dealing with the rollback of taxes Michele HOfman legislative analyst for the New Jersey Chamber of Commerce which also opposes initiative and referendum said that her organization feared referendums on hazardous wastes utility rates and business taxes These matters are better left to the legislative process she said The New Jersey League of Women Voters has come out in support of initiative and referendum even though it believes its own interests could be jeopardized by the process Gloria J Jones of Sparta the league president said initiative and referendum could allow an antiabortion law to be brought up for citizen vote The league is in favor of the right to choose abortions Democracy is a dangerous business Mrs Jones said We want the country to be ruled by the wishes of the majority Frank W Haines executive director of the New Jersey Taxpayers Association which represents the states larger coporations on taxes and limitations on spending he said Robert Geary spokesman for the New Jersey Business and Industry Association a 12000  member lobbying organization that opposes initiative and referendum said that the first initiative would most likely be a freeze on utility rates or automobile insurance We think there are better ways to bring down rates than a referendum he said Mr Perelli agrees that the high cost of automobile insurance is a raging issue He said that voters might also wish to eliminate motorvehicle inspections Mrs Oser said that Common Cause favored initiative and referendum because New Jersey is ripe for reform She said that other subjects that might come up for votes were the creation of citizen utility boards and nuclear freeze and Sunday blue laws The New Jersey Federation of Senior Citizens also has come out in favor of initiative and referendum Other groups opposed to the measure include the state AFLCIO the New Jersey Builders Assocation the American Federation of State County and Municipal Employees and the Communication Workers of America which represents state employees
SPAIN SEEKS VOICE IN CHURCH SCHOOLS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/world/spain-seeks-voice-in-church-schools.html,The Spanish Government venturing into a headon conflict with the Roman Catholic Church is working on legislation to change the operations and character of thousands of parochial schools The new law would change the system for state subsidies to the schools regulate standards for student admission and hiring of teachers and give parents and students a powerful voice in administrative decisions The law poses potentially farreaching effects since a third of all Spanish pupils attend religious schools Most are run along traditional lines with strict discipline total control vested in the administration a heavy emphasis on Catholic doctrine and few modern subjects The conservative churchoriented press calls the furor over the law the scholastic war The bill titled the Law of the Right to Education has been approved in draft form by the Cabinet and will come up in Parliament in the fall The Battle Lines Are Drawn Since the Socialists have a commanding majority passage is certain Already the battle lines are drawn with the Government on one side and the conservative Popular Alliance Party and various Catholic groups such as the Association of Catholic Parents and Teachers on the other The struggle most observers believe will be even more bitter than the battle over the Governments bill to remove criminal penalties in cases of therapeutic abortions The Government says it is out to modernize and make rational the educational system which is split between public and private schools to bring it into the 20th century In a modern society tolerant and pluralistic schools can no longer be what they were 30 years ago said Jose Maria Maravall Minister of Education and Science The opponents of the law make much of what they call the right to choose a Catholicinspired education and attack the law as unwarranted state interference Foes See a Sinister Motive The hidden motive these groups suggest is to secularize education or to starve out the religious schools so that the ability of parents to select a religious or secular education for their children will be subverted They are copying the line of Eurocommunism said Maria Jose Fernandez vice president of the Spanish Federation of Religious Instruction In no other country with a system of state subsidies are such conditions imposed on the schools administration This assertion is disputed by Government officials who point out that state subsidies without control have long been unique to Spain They say that the new law simply sets down minimum standards and regulations for private schools that want to continue receiving money from the state In a sense the issue is a byproduct of the years of neglect for social services under the nearly 40 years of Franco dictatorship With a woefully inadequate number of public schools the church was given major rights and responsibilities in the field of education for both practical and ideological reasons The churchs influence even at university level gave it considerable power in shaping Spanish society State Schools Are Overcrowded Today with universal and compulsory education up until the age of 14 the public system cannot handle all the pupils so the private system is a necessity not a luxury About 16 million pupils attend private schools a higher proportion than in any other country in Europe except the Netherlands and Belgium About 60 percent of the 3600 private schools are run by the church Although the Government provides direct subsidies it has had until now virtually no control over how the money is spent or what kind of instruction is given The state subsidies to private schools which began in 1970 were initially small but grew rapidly in the last decade In 1982 they amounted to more than 750 million Under the present system the private school receives its grant by entering into a fouryear or fiveyear contract with the state which simply hands over the money to the sponsoring institution in most cases a church The system is open to abuse since many churches hire teachers on ninemonth contracts and are free to use the remainder of the statesupplied salary money for other purposes Salaries Directly to Teachers The new law would have the state pay salaries directly to the teachers and other subsidies directly to the schools administrations Even more importantly the funds would be distributed on the basis of whether the private school is really needed  if it is in an area already covered by a public school it runs the risk of having its state subsidy reduced or eliminated altogether The money will keep on flowing but on a more rational basis Mr Maravall said in an interview We shall know where it goes The windows will finally be open The state cannot cover the whole level of compulsory education in Spain so we expect it will have to be a mixture of public and private systems for some time What we want is to integrate the two networks Another aspect under dispute is that the law would mandate setting up a school council with representatives of the administration the teachers the parents and the students It would be empowered to name the director select teachers and oversee the budget although students would not take part in staffing decisions A New Concept for Spanish The idea of participation by parents and students in running religious schools is so new it constitutes something of a revolution Finally religious practices of schools receiving state money would be voluntary This would mean for example that a student could choose not to take part in school prayers After consultations between Government officials and the church hierarchy certain features of the religious schools were left untouched One is their right to retain a charter stating the basic religious precepts behind the instruction For this reason Government officials say that while they expect the church to oppose the bill they do not believe it will engage in allout confrontation

Political Caucus today called on President Reagan not to run for reelection Kathy Wilson a Republican who heads the caucus said she was reflecting the feelings of most other Republican women in the 73000member organization in denouncing Mr Reagan as a dangerous man in regard to womens rights Mrs Wilsons harshly worded attack on the President underscored the strong pervasive antiReagan mood among the 800 delegates to the convention which held its first full session today Speakers of both parties have repeatedly cited the public opinion polls that show Mr Reagan has far less support among women than among men A consensus seems to be emerging among the 200 Republican women here that this sex difference is just as wide within their party as it is in the general population That perception is supported by a number of polls including The New York TimesCBS News Poll of June 2026 It shows a 24point gap between Republican men and women on the question of whether Mr Reagan deserves to be reelected Eightysix percent of the Republican men said Mr Reagan deserved a second term while 62 percent of the women held that opinion At this meeting which ends Sunday virtually no women except for Betty Heitman a cochairman of the Republican National Committee are publicly defending Mr Reagan Friday in a discussion session on 1984 Presidential politics most of the Republican women joined in a long fierce standing ovation after Representative Barbara B Kennelly Democrat of Connecticut said Ronald Reagan is hopeless as far as we women are concerned Mrs Wilson is running unopposed for a second twoyear term as chairman of the caucus which was founded in 1971 as the main political arm of the womens movement She said in her speech that Mr Reagan could bridge this gender gap and win the respect of American women by reversing his opposition to an equal rights amendment to the Constitution and abortion and by endorsing legislation to guarantee economic equity for women But short of all that she said there is one thing President Reagan can do to help women and clean up his name with us And thats what I ask him to do today Mr President one term is enough For the sake of American women  Republicans Democrats and independents  please step down Another Republican Patricia P Bailey a Federal Trade Commissioner also said that conscience compelled her to make a speech condemning Mr Reagans benign bewilderment in respose to the womens revolution Mrs Bailey who was passed over by the White House for the chairmanship of the commission said Mr Reagan had created the division between the sexes and thereby handed the Democrats a huge unearned political advantage Other Republican leaders here have taken a more moderate line on Mr Reagan The include Mary Louise Smith of Iowa a former chairman of the Republican National Committee Representative Claudine Schneider of Rhode Island and Representative Olympia J Snowe of Maine They are warning women of the dangers of his policies without denouncing him personally Fears Party Switching Mrs Smith one of her partys most influential women said Republicans were at a crossroads She warned that unless the lag among women in the Republican Party was corrected it could lead to a concentration of women in one party She added I dont want to see all women as Democrats Most Republicans here agree that the erosion of Mr Reagans support among women began at the 1980 Republican National Convention when his supporters overturned 40 years of party tradition by removing endorsement of the equal rights amendment from the partys platform Since then Mrs Snowe observed Mr Reagans economic policies and his heavy military spending have further eroded the diminished support that Mr Reagan had among women in the 1980 Presidential vote It wasnt overwhelming support but it was adequate she said Now hes lost even that standing Mrs Snowe and Mrs Schneider said they were among a group of Republican women who were meeting with Michael K Deaver the White House Deputy Chief of Staff to try to find ways to appeal to women who make up 53 percent of the voting population They said there was no hope that Mr Reagan would change his opposition to abortion and the equal rights amendment So as a compromise step they are urging the White House to sponsor major legislation on such issues as pension equity for women Mrs Snowe said that as a result of the meetings Reagan aides have gotten out of the denial phase and acknowledged that we do have a problem with women A General Negative Feeling But John Deardourff a Republican campaign consultant who spoke here expressed doubt that Mr Reagan could improve his standing with women with legislative proposals The problem for Reagan he said is that the negative attitude among women has gone beyond specifics Its no longer related to any specific issue Its just a general negative feeling For example he observed Mr Reagans attempt to cut Social Security benefits early in the first year of his term alienated elderly conservative Republican women who were his natural allies Almost every way you turn youve got Ronald Reagan guilty of some failure to understand how women live their lives he said His stereotypes about women are just out of date The TimesCBS News Poll bears out Mr Deardourffs observation that the Social Security debate in the spring of 1981 was a turning point for Mr Reagan At that time there was only a 9 percent gap between Republican women and men in assessing Mr Reagans performance in office Last month the gap was 21 percent with 89 percent of Republican men approving and 68 percent of Republican women approving of his handling of the Presidency On a number of key issues according to the June poll the sex difference of about 20 points has become a standard between Republican men and women Differences Over Economy On Mr Reagans handling of the economy 89 percent of Republican men approve and 66 percent of the women approve for a gap of 23 percent On the question of whether Mr Reagan has done enough about inflation 81 percent of the Republican men said he had as against 61 percent of the women Many Republican leaders contend that young working women are most likely to dislike Mr Reagan Others have argued that those concerned with feminist issues fall into that group However the poll indicated instead that the Republican women critical of Mr Reagan were most concerned about the economy and unemployment and that they were older poorer and more likely to come from the partys Middle Western stronghold than Reagan enthusiasts They were also more likely to be single Although Mr Reagan still retains majority support among Republican women on most issues the erosion of their support could tip a close election The Republican gender gap Mrs Smith concluded is real measurable and unacceptable Other Republicans here note that Mr Reagan has never been popular among the Republican feminists in this organization But the polls suggest that their distrust of Mr Reagan is spreading among nonactivist Republican women In any case leaders of the womens political caucus are worried that anger at Mr Reagan is a threat to the partisan balance of the organization About 35 percent of the caucuss members are Republicans Mrs Wilson said the groups leadership was discouraging Republican members who want to switch parties as a means of protest
ABORTION FOES END MEETING OPTIMISTIC DESPITE SETBACKS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/abortion-foes-end-meeting-optimistic-despite-setbacks.html,Local and national leaders of the National Right to Life Committee gathered here this week to celebrate what they consider major victories against abortion and to plan ways to take the sting out of recent defeats Last month the groups 10year campaign to make abortion illegal was dealt legislative and judicial setbacks but the organizations leaders and members said the developments strengthened rather than weakened their resolve The Supreme Court in a 6to3 ruling on June 15 strongly reaffirmed its 1973 decree that women have a constitutional right to an abortion and it struck down a number of local ordinances and state laws enacted since then to restrict abortions And on June 28 the Senate rejected a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed the states and Congress to establish conditions under which an abortion could be obtained Committee Backed Amendment The amendment was supported by the National Right to Life Committee which claims some 2000 chapters nationwide and several million members and supporters Its a question now of is the glass half empty or half full  said Jean Doyle a 52yearold Floridian who became president of the organization at the convention that ended here today The number of senators voting for such a constitutional amendment has reached 49 nearly doubling in the decade since the movement began she said Viewing the High Courts recent action she said abortion foes had increased the ranks of their supporters on the bench by one since the 7to2 ruling in 1973 upholding the right to abortion The additional vote against the majority opinion was cast by Justice Sandra Day OConnor whose appointment by President Reagan two years ago was opposed by the group on the ground that her position on abortion was less than favorable to its cause OConnor is maybe a very pleasant surprise said Mrs Doyle How can we be mad at her Reflecting on the organizations fight against Mrs OConnor at the time of her nomination Mrs Doyle said Her track record at home was bad We were scared to death Debate Over Tactics Our optimism has been tempered by the realization that weve got a bigger task ahead than we thought said David Ball a former college professor who is a veteran of the antiabortion movement and coauthor of several books on abortion Like many others Mr Ball suggested that the setbacks were forcing a reassessment of the groups expectations and tactics Mrs Doyle whose organization came under fire from some smaller antiabortion groups for pushing for a vote on the proposed constitutional amendment this summer said it would be several years before such an effort was made again in Congress Mrs Doyle said that adoption of a constitutional amendment permitting restrictions on abortions is a long way off 30 to 40 years adding This isnt an issue for sprinters She said with a chuckle that in her early days in the movement she thought an amendment could be quickly passed For the time being Mrs Doyle and other members said the group will continue to press Congress for measures that would have the effect of curbing abortions Many leaders also said they would work to reelect President Reagan in the hope that he would appoint additional conservative Justices to the Supreme Court Membership Drive Planned On the local level the group will focus on expanding its membership and campaigning for candidates who embrace their views Felicia Goeken the Illinois director of the National Right to Life Committee contrasted her organizations efforts with those of supporters of the proposed Federal equal rights amendment for women who she said failed to win ratification because they did not get enough support in the states We dont want to make the same mistake as the ERA folks she said They zapped their amendment through Congress but they couldnt on the state level because they werent organized Mrs Goeken 56 of Alton Ill a mother of seven who has been actively seeking to ban abortions since 1969 said the association would focus on organizing in the states Regardless of what we do in Washington the amendment will have to be ratified by the states she said Helms Is an Exception The recent Senate vote Mrs Goeken said gave members a count of their supporters Those who did not vote for the amendment she said are now considered by the group to be supporters of abortion and thus a target of its campaign efforts next year The one exception she said is Senator Jesse Helms Republican of North Carolina who faces a tough reelection battle next year Although Senator Helms did not vote on the proposed amendment saying that it was too weak and the timing was wrong Mrs Goeken said most members respected his position The 1200 or so participants at the threeday convention could see previews of an expected new direction in campaigning against abortion Wellpolished commercials with messages urging people to pull together on the abortion issue are intended to supplant the firebrand assertions that abortion is nothing less than murder of an unborn child Alternatives Are Stressed More emphasis will be placed on establishing alternatives to abortion such as counseling centers and temporary homes for young women who are pondering abortion and feel they have no refuge A daylong session on politicking also suggested a tempering of tones in the pursuit of the organizations goals Also in a departure from the groups historical focus on the issue of abortion more discussions emerged this year among members over their concern for euthanasia the socalled mercy killing of severely ill children and adults Its one small step from the mother getting rid of her inconvenient unborn child to a daughter getting rid of her inconvenient aging mother said Jeanne Head a nurse from Manhattan echoing the views of others The organization took no formal action in that area and again declined to discuss the use of contraceptives death by nuclear war or capital punishment with members noting the wide divergence of opinion on these issues within the 50member board
AROUND THE NAION; 2 Brothers Sentenced In Abduction of Doctor,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/around-the-naion-2-brothers-sentenced-in-abduction-of-doctor.html,Two brothers have been sentenced to prison for their parts in the abduction of a gynecologist and his wife to protest the doctors involvement in an abortion clinic Federal District Judge William L Beatty sentenced Matthew Moore 20 years old to concurrent eightyear sentences on Friday Mr Moore was convicted on charges stemming from the kidnapping of Dr Hector Zevallos and his wife Rosalie Jean Zevallos from their Edwardsville home on Aug 12 1982 Judge Beatty sentenced Wayne Moore 18 to an indeterminate jail term Don Benny Anderson was earlier sentenced to 30 years in prison in the case
"MAJOR NEWS IN SUMMARY; Equalize Pension Pay, Court Rules",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/weekinreview/major-news-in-summary-equalize-pension-pay-court-rules.html,The Supreme Court was in its usual race to finish up last week When the dust settled the Justices had issued 10 decisions for a total of 43 in the final twoandahalf weeks of its 198283 session  almost onethird of their full caseload Several major decisions were held over to next term which begins Oct3 including a ruling on whether the use of home video recorders violates Federal copyright law The deferred judgment surprised many since the Court heard arguments in January presumably a majority had not coalesced Several clear majorities emerged this term  for womens right to have an abortion against tax exemptions for racially discriminatory schools and against the legislative veto It ended with a number of close calls Among them  A 5to4 decision that employersponsored retirement plans cannot give men and women unequal benefits Nearly all annuities pay lower monthly benefits to women on the theory that as a group women live longer than men and over their lifetimes collect an equal amount But Associate Justice Thurgood Marshall said Even a true generalization about a class cannot justify classbased treatment under Federal civil rights law which bars sex discrimination in employment Four Justices joined him A different 5to4 majority said the decision applied only to contributions and benefits made after Aug1 since righting past inequities might cost too much The ruling on a suit brought by Nathalie Norris a supervisor in Arizona States Department of Economic Security the Job Service division applies to millions of public employees and employees of nonprofit institutions Congress is considering banning sex distinctions in all insurance plans It does not necessarily mean more money for women but equal benefits for all  The Court used the case of a convicted murderer Thomas A Barefoot to determine standards for granting or denying any prisoner a stay of execution while an appeal is pending Voting 5 to 4 that a Federal appeals court properly refused Mr Barefoot a stay the Court issued guidelines that could expedite Federal appeals for prisoners who have exhausted the state appellate process Federal appellate courts must decide the merits of an appeal and grant a stay if they need more time the Court said But with appropriate notice they can hear arguments for a stay and arguments on the appeal in one sitting Thats what happened in Mr Barefoots case though the appeals court did not formally note this To say there was no full hearing wrote Associate Justice Byron R White would be an unwarranted exaltation of form over substance As to that substance the Court regrouped and dividing 6 to 3 rejected Mr Barefoots challenge to the prosecutions use of psychiatric testimony that he would endanger society if not executed The American Psychiatric Association has condemned such testimony doctors agree it is impossible to predict dangerousness
FORCEFUL TERM OF SUPREME COURT PUT REINS ON CONGRESS AND REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/10/us/forceful-term-of-supreme-court-put-reins-on-congress-and-reagan.html,Both Congress and the executive branch must adjust to life within new limits as a result of the Supreme Court term that concluded this week The Justices spoke forcefully and in a more united voice than they have in some years with many of the most important cases decided by comfortable margins instead of by the fragile 5to4 majorities of the last few terms By a 7to2 vote the Court abruptly ended Congresss 50yearold experiment with its veto over some executive actions Using that device which was incorporated into 200 Federal laws Congress could unilaterally stop White House or executive agency decisions from taking effect New Leverage Being Sought The Courts decision that the legislative veto violated the constitutionally required separation of powers left Congress scrambling to find a new way to retain its leverage over foreign policy and the regulatory process The Courts term also delivered some unwelcome messages to the White House The Court strongly reaffirmed by a vote of 6 to 3 the constitutional right to an abortion And it ruled unanimously that the Reagan Administrations revoking of a requirement for airbags or automatic seat belts in new cars was arbitrary and capricious That decision made clear for the first time that deregulation requires the same legal justification as regulation and that regulatory policies of the past may not be erased by simple administrative fiat In addition the Courts 8to1 ruling that Bob Jones University and other discriminatory private schools may not receive Federal tax exemptions repudiated a White House policy reversal that had sparked one of the major civil rights debates of recent years The 198283 term which began last Oct 4 ended Wednesday tying a record for length set in 1976 It was a busy term with 152 full opinions as against 143 last year and 123 the year before And as usual the term had a frantic close Nearly a third of all the decisions of the entire ninemonth term were issued in the final three weeks But the flood of new cases arriving at the Court which prompted many complaints and pleas for relief from the Justices appeared to have crested It received 4201 petitions for review a 5 percent decline from the previous term and a decided break from years of steady growth in the Courts docket The opinions were generally free of the bickering and personal animosity between Justices that was notable in last years opinions Another change was the relatively high profile of Chief Justice Warren E Burger who last year wrote few important opinions but this year assigned himself several of the major cases including the legislative veto and the Bob Jones tax exemption case A Pattern Continues Thirtynine percent of the terms decisions were unanimous while 21 percent were decided by 5to4 votes In the closely contested cases last years voting patterns persisted with Chief Justice Burger and Justices William H Rehnquist and Sandra Day OConnor usually forming one voting bloc typically joined by Justice Lewis F Powell Jr or Justice Byron R White The opposing more liberal bloc was composed of Justices William J Brennan Jr Thurgood Marshall John Paul Stevens and Harry A Blackmun These patterns were not immutable On criminal law issues for example Justice Blackmun frequently voted with the BurgerRehnquist group There were 62 decisions in which Justices Rehnquist and Brennan took opposite sides Justice Rehnquist was joined by Justice OConnor in 50 of those cases by Justice Powell in 45 by Justice White in 40 and by Justice Blackmun in 16 eight of those criminal cases Each Justice wrote from 15 to 20 opinions for the Court Justice Stevens wrote the most dissenting opinions 20 while Chief Justice Burger wrote the least four Justice Marshall voted in dissent the greatest number of times 48 Chief Justice Burger dissented the least 12 times These are the highlights of the Courts term Individual Rights In Bob Jones v US the Court ruled that racially discriminatory private schools are not eligible for Federal taxexempt status The Court gave notice that it was not backing down from its 10yearold decision that the Constitution protects the right to have an abortion It struck down a variety of state and local obstacles to access to abortion including laws requiring abortions in the second three months of pregnancy to be performed in hospitals Akron v Akron Center In Arizona v Norris the Court ruled 5 to 4 that the Federal law against sex discrimination in employment prohibits employersponsored retirement plans that give men and women unequal benefits The ruling was not retroactive The Court restricted the ability of individuals to seek Federal court injunctions against the repeat of government conduct they believe to be unconstitutional In Los Angeles v Lyons the Court ruled 5 to 4 that a man who was nearly choked to death by the Los Angeles police could not sue for an injunction because there was no proof the police would choke him again Separation of Powers The legislative veto was declared unconstitutional in Immigration and Naturalization Service v Chadha on the last day of the term the Court also struck down vetoes of rules issued by the Federal Trade Commission and the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission FederalState Relations The Court ruled 5 to 4 that Congress acted within its constitutional authority when it prohibited state and local governments from discriminating against their employees on the basis of age The case Equal Employment Opportunity Commission v Wyoming effectively overruled a 1976 decision National League of Cities v Usery and ended the notion that the 10th Amendment to the Constitution shelters state governments from Federal regulation Upholding Californias moratorium on nuclear power plants the Court ruled unanimously that states may ban nuclear plants for economic reasons although not for safety reasons Pacific Gas  Electric v Energy Resources Regulatory Actions The Court ruled in Motor Vehicle Manufacturers v State Farm that the Reagan Administration improperly revoked a requirement that new cars be equipped with airbags or automatic seat belts Rejecting the Securities and Exchange Commissions views on insider trading in the stock market the Court limited the liability of those who make use of nonpublic information they receive from corporate insiders Dirks v SEC The Court upheld the Federal Governments preferential tax treatment of organizations that lobby on behalf of veterans Regan v Taxation With Representation The Court declared unconstitutional a Federal law making it a crime to send unsolicited advertisements for contraceptives through the mail Bolger v Youngs Drug The Court upheld Federal regulations designed to force utility companies to cooperate in the development of alternative competing sources of energy American Paper Inst v American Electric Power The Court ruled that generic drugs cannot be sold without approval of the Food and Drug Administration even if their active ingredients duplicate those found in drugs already approved by the agency Religion The Court ruled that states may permit tax deductions for educational expenses even if parochial schools reap nearly all the benefit The 5to4 decision in Mueller v Allen was the first time the Court endorsed a form of tuition aid for parochial schools but the majoritys insistence that the benefit be at least nominally available to public school parents as well cast doubt on the Reagan Administrations plan for tuition tax credits for private school tuition The Court ruled in Marsh v Chambers that the Constitution permits a legislature to pay a chaplain to open each days session with a prayer In Larkin v Grendels Den the Court declared unconstitutional a Massachusetts law giving churches a veto power over the issuing of nearby liquor licenses Election Law The Court struck down New Jerseys Congressional district lines on the ground that even miniscule unjustified variations from absolute numerical equality violate the principle of one man one vote The 5to4 ruling Karcher v Daggett cast doubt on a number of other states Congressional districts The Court ruled in Anderson v Celebrezze that states may not require independent candidates for President to meet substantially more onerous requirements than major party candidates in order to quality for the ballot Criminal Law The Court ruled 5 to 4 that a life sentence without possibility of parole for a man who committed a string of petty nonviolent crimes constituted cruel an unusual punishment Solem v Helm In the major death penalty ruling of the term the Court voted 5 to 4 to uphold the use of expedited procedures by Federal Courts of Appeals reviewing habeas corpus petitions from death row inmates Barefoot v Estelle In US v Sells Engineering the Court limited the ability of Federal prosecutors to share grand jury information with other Government lawyers and agencies Ruling that a state cannot give a police officer the discretion to arrest a person for failing to identify himself to the officers satisfaction the Court struck down Californias vagrancy law Kolender v Lawson In Bearden v Georgia the Court ruled that a state cannot send a convicted defendant to jail just because he is too poor to pay a fine The Court ruled that the exposure of luggage to a narcoticssniffing dog is not a search and requires no previous suspicion of wrongdoing However US v Place held the luggage may be detained for only a brief period The Court ruled that Customs officials may make random inspections of ships on inland waterways without any suspicion that a crime is being committed US v VillamonteMarquez For the second time the Court was unable definitively to resolve the constitutional implications of the drug courier profile used by narcotics agents to pick out likely suspects at airports In a fractured 5to4 ruling in Florida v Royer the Court ruled that even if the agent was justified in intercepting the passenger that initial suspicion does not justify a more prolonged interrogation Business and Taxes The Court ruled unanimously that the threeyearold Federal windfall profits tax on decontrolled crude oil is constitutional US v Ptasynski In Container Corp v Franchise Tax Board the Court ruled that states may include the worldwide income of Americanbased multinational corporations in calculating state tax liability The Court ruled that states may not subject newspaper and magazine publishers to a tax not generally applicable to other businesses The decision Minneapolis Star v Minnesota struck down on First Amendment free press grounds a state tax on the value of paper and ink Without opinion the Court summarily upheld the broad outlines of the antitrust settlement under which the American Telephone and Telegraph Company agreed to divest itself of the companies that provide most of the nations local telephone service The vote was 6 to 3 The Courts refusal on Dec 24 to extend the deadline it had previously given Congress for restructuring that nations bankruptcy courts meant that bankruptcy cases would continue to be handled indefinitely under interim Federal court rules that parties to come cases have challenged as unconstitutional Unfinished Business The Court did not resolve three of the most challenging issues on its calendar but promised to tackle them all again in the term that begins October 3 Most surprising was the Courts lastday announcement that it wanted additional arguments on whether the use of home video recorders to make tapes of copyrighted television broadcasts is a violation of Federal copyright law After promising to decide whether to modify the rule that bars the use of illegally obtained evidence in trials the Court publicly apologized for not resolving the question in Illinois v Gates But the Justices then agreed to hear three separate cases on the same point in the next term The Court heard arguments on whether judges may supercede ordinary lasthired firstfired seniority rules to protect the jobs of recently hired black employees It then dismissed the case Boston Firefighters v Boston NAACP as probably moot Three weeks later the Court accepted for argument next term a case involving the Memphis Fire Department that raises the same question
DEMOCRATS LINE UP ON FEMINIST ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/11/us/democrats-line-up-on-feminist-issues.html,At the convention of the National Womens Political Caucus today four Democratic Presidential candidates said that if elected they would use political deals and tradeoffs to put pressure on states that refuse to ratify the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution While two of the candidates former Vice President Walter F Mondale and Senator Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina implied that they would use Federal funds to bargain for support of the amendment the other two Senator Gary Hart of Colorado and Senator Alan Cranston of California made that promise explicit saying they would withhold money for Federal programs and projects from states whose legislatures opposed the amendment Bidding War for Support A fifth candidate Senator John Glenn of Ohio said he would call an equal rights amendment summit conference at the White House to plan a strategy for passing the amendment which would ban discrimination based on sex A deadline for the proposed amendment expired last year without ratification by threefourths of the states but it has been reintroduced in Congress The candidates pledges on the amendment illustrated the bidding war that developed here as the Democrats vied to see who could most energetically embrace the agenda of the 73000member feminist organization In general the Democrats were warmly received although Senator Hart managed to offend these representatives of one of his partys most powerful constituencies by violating the ground rules for the speeches Several leaders of the group said later that the enthusiasm with which the Democrats endorsed the caucuss key positions made it likely that the group would alter its policy and endorse a Presidential candidate Kathy Wilson reelected today as chairman of the organization said an endorsement would not split the group because President Reagan is so unpopular with Republican women who make up 35 percent of the membership We want our party back and we make a distinction between Ronald Reagan and the rest of the Republican Party said Mrs Wilson a Republican herself who on Saturday called for Mr Reagan not to seek a second term A Distancing From Reagan Saturdays session of the convention was devoted mainly to such denunciations of Mr Reagan by both Democratic and Republican women They said he was responsible for the reported fact in polls of public opinion that fewer women than men support the President creating the socalled gender gap Todays session on the conventions final day was devoted mainly to Democratic candidates efforts to project themselves as Mr Reagans opposite when it comes to passing the constitutional amendment defending the right of women to have abortions and placing issues of health social justice and education ahead of the Reagan Administrations military buildup Mr Mondale ridiculed Mr Reagans assertion that he has been unfairly victimized by a perception problem that makes him appear unfair to women He does have a perception problem Mr Mondale said in a warmly received speech He cant see you at all and you see right through him A few minutes later Mr Cranston said that the President thinks gender gap was an episode of Death Valley Days  the television western for which Mr Reagan was host in the 1960s The Senator went on to suggest that money for bridge building might be withheld from states that refused to ratify the equal rights amendment Senator Hart also endorsed bargaining with Federal funds to force recalcitrant Congressional leaders and state legislatures to support the constitutional amendment Im talking about specific Federal projects the Coloradan said that would be used to bring around people who are on the fence on that or whose support is lukewarm Senator Hollings said he would use the armtwisting style of Lyndon B Johnson to swap around and pass the amendment Mr Mondale described a similar approach in promising to do whatever is necessary to pass the amendment As President of the United States he declared Ill say Now wait a minute you want something and I want something Ill help you if its an honorable objective if youll promise to go back to your state and deliver on the ratification of the equal rights amendment  Among the announced Democratic candidates only former Governor Reubin Askew of Florida declined an invitation to attend His opposition to abortion in some circumstances made him unpopular here In his absence all the Democrats seemed to pass muster on litmustest issues that also included the nuclear arms freeze equal pay and willingess to consider a female Vice Presidential nominee But aside from the poltical issues the male candidates went through a psychological testing going on here Ann F Lewis political director of the Democratic National Committee said the overriding interest in defeating Mr Reagan had made this groups members less concerned with tripping the candidates on fine points of feminist politics and sexist semantics Thinking Mans Candidate Mr Glenn flirted with trouble when he spoke of man and wife rather than using the preferred language of husband and wife Mr Hollings got a forgiving laugh when he apologized for a brochure that called him the thinking mans candidate It was left to Mr Hart to stumble into trouble He provoked open anger and a public chastising when he ignored the time limit on speeches and spoke sharply to the moderator State Senator Harriett Woods of Missouri when she tried to cut him off Senator Hart looking grim later apologized Mrs Wilson observed that the Senator exhibited an attitude of disregard toward women but she predicted that he would escape permanent political damage Mr Mondale who opened his speech by declaring I am a feminist got the most vigorous applause But Mr Hollings Mr Cranston and Mr Glenn all won nods of approval
"VIDEO TERMINALS HARMLESS TO EYE, STUDY ASSERTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/12/science/video-terminals-harmless-to-eye-study-asserts.html,There is no valid scientific evidence that video display terminals  those televisionlike devices used by increasing millions of office workers  permanently damage vision a panel of experts assembled by the National Research Council reported today Nor do they increase the risk of cataracts according to the panel Although 40 percent to 80 percent of the terminal operators questioned in various surveys have complained of eyestrain or other visual problems the panel concluded there is little evidence that their symptoms differ appreciably from those of workers engaged in other close visual tasks and no evidence that the effects are lasting Panel members said they considered the problems associated with video display terminals a matter of annoyance to workers and a threat to productivity rather than a public health issue The study was requested by the National Institute for Occupational Safety and Health a Federal agency that has been studying complaints and potential health hazards associated with the terminals known as VDTs The findings coming after a twoyear review costing about 180000 were made by a 12member panel convened by the research council the operating arm of the National Academies of Science and Engineering the nations most prestigous scientific bodies The panel said that worker complaints might stem partly from poorly designed terminals and partly from poorly lighted poorly designed workplaces and from boring repetitive lowpaying jobs It said terminals were often placed in offices where the lighting and furniture were designed for paperwork on horizontal surfaces rather than video work on a vertical plane Our general conclusion is that eye discomfort blurred vision and other visual disturbances muscular aches and stress reported among VDT workers are probably not due to anything inherent in VDT technology the panels chairman Edward Rinalducci professor of psychology at the Georgia Institute of Technology told a news conference However we found that workers do face significant problems because of the way VDT technology has been used in the workplace More than seven million Americans  clerical workers air traffic controllers computer programmers airline reservation clerks lawyers scientists typesetters writers and editors among others  used terminals at work in 1980 and the number has been rapidly increasing Many individuals are also buying terminals for use at home The panel suggested that home users might have different attitudes than workers who are often forced to use terminals without advance consultation The panel acknowledged that many terminals were poorly designed for worker comfort because they are inexpensive adaptations of components originally designed for casual television viewing at a distance rather than for intense work at close range Another member of the panel Harry L Snyder professor of industrial engineering at Virginia Polytechnic Institute estimated that 60 percent of the terminals sold today do not meet reasonable criteria for comfort and that the number five years ago was far higher But the report found little likelihood that VDT use involves serious health or safety hazards The groups report appeared to uphold worker complaints of physical discomfort but belie fears expressed by many workers and labor leaders that the machines may be causing serious visual harm Workers have complained of eyestrain blurred vision hot tired stinging itching or watery eyes headaches and in a handful of cases cataracts or other ocular diseases that interfere permanently with vision Some workers have also charged that radiation emitted by terminals may cause miscarriages spontaneous abortions and birth defects The panel whose expertise lay in vision rather than human reproduction did not address this issue directly But it mentioned in passing that the only two studies thus far completed of reproductive problems among terminal operators concluded that terminals were unlikely to be a causal factor It also noted that the radiation emitted by terminals was far below that believed to cause birth defects in humans The panel said that virtually every study yet made of the radiation emitted by terminals had found that it fell well below accepted occupational and environmental health and safety standard limits The panel said workers were exposed to less radiation from terminals than they were from fluorescent lights sunshine and other common sources The panel suggested that most of the problems reported in working on display terminals could probably be eliminated by applying existing knowledge of the best way to design terminals arrange office lighting and furniture and organize work It opposed mandatory standards as premature when the technology is changing so rapidly One panelist Lawrence W Stark professor of physiological optics at the Berkeley campus of the University of California dissented from the tone but not the substance of the report He did not dispute any of the detailed findings in his written dissent but complained that Our panel report does not condemn the poor quality and legibility of current VDTs A spokesman for the AFLCIO said the report did not satisfy union concerns because though narrow in scope it could be construed as saying there are no problems with terminals
AN OLD WAR AGAINST THE NEW CHEMICAL WEAPONS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/13/us/an-old-war-against-the-new-chemical-weapons.html,Like Pavlovs dog members of Congress tend to start salivating when a plate of Federal money is placed in front of them Bringing home the bacon from Washington is a timehonored way of pleasing constituents and reinforcing reelection prospects So when Senator David Pryor Democrat of Arkansas says he does not want 1306 million earmarked for his state the story ranks in the manbitesdog category The money that so offends Senator Pryor would be used to manufacture an advanced form of chemical weaponry at a Federal installation in Pine Bluff Later this week he will offer an amendment to delete the funds from the military authorization bill now before the Senate The Chamber of Commerce in Pine Bluff just 80 miles from the Senators home town of Camden vigorously supports the program as a source of jobs and revenue And Senator Pryor who faces reelection next year admitted I think some of them down there might think Im crazy But the Senator has opposed the production of chemical weapons for both moral and military reasons since he served as Governor of Arkansas a decade ago And he will pursue his crusade he says even though his colleagues are tired of hearing from him Issue Goes Back to 69 Its a very emotional issue he said today People dont like to talk about it because its very unpleasant But its like abortion  people hope it wont come up but it will never quite go away The issue of chemical weapons or nerve gas dates from 1969 when President Nixon agreed to halt production of new devices and to try to negotiate a treaty with the Soviet Union banning such weapons entirely Those negotiations have never been successful and are no longer being conducted on a twoway basis but the production moratorium has remained in force for 14 years President Ford tried and failed to get approval for a new production program in the mid1970s and the Reagan Administration has been pushing for an end to the moratorium since it took office In 1981 Congress did approve 21 million for the construction of a factory in Pine Bluff but the actual production funds have never been authorized and the plant stands empty today When the issue came up in the House last month the Administration lobbied furiously for the funds But a broad coalition that crossed both party and ideological lines voted 256 to 161 in favor of an amendment deleting all production money The curious nature of the opposition was exemplified by the chief sponsors of the amendment Representative Clement J Zablocki a liberal Democrat from Wisconsin and Representative Ed Bethune a conservative Republican from Arkansas and a former agent for the Federal Bureau of Investigation Bomb Known as Big Eye The Administration request includes funds for two kinds of weapons artillery shells and an aerial bomb known as Big Eye Both would be binary weapons containing two chemicals instead of one Each chemical is inert by itself the weapon becomes lethal only when the chemicals are mixed after launching as the projectile approaches its target Oldfashioned unitary weapons contain active chemicals while in storage and Administration strategists argue that the new weapons would be much safer In addition the Administration maintains that a new generation of chemical weapons is needed to counter advances in the Soviet arsenal and modernize existing American stockpiles In a letter to Congress in the House debate Gen Bernard W Rogers commander of American troops in Europe said The perspective from Europe is clearcut The Soviets already possess an overwhelming superiority in chemical warfare capabilities Worse yet the dated ammunition in our current stockpile will provide only a nominal deterrent until later in this decade when it becomes largely unusable Without the new weapons requested by the Administration General Rogers added the United States would not be able to deter a Russian attack or force Moscow to negotiate an agreement to eliminate all chemical devices Senator Pryor believes that these arguments do not make sense The military has plenty of nerve gas in its arsenal now to deter the Russians he says and building more weapons would be almost like bringing a wheelbarrow of sand to the Sahara Sending Signals to Russia Like many critics of the MX missile he also derides the notion that the United States can elicit arms reduction agreements with Moscow by increasing arms production I think Senator Pryor said in a sarcastic tone that this Administration is consumed with the idea of communicating with the Russians by sending signals These people love to send signals to the Russians and I think thats absurd Senator Pryor sees another parallel with the MX debate the argument that at a time of limited budgets the miltary can use its money in better ways such as training Were going to the exotic and forgetting the conventional he said Moreover the Senator notes new chemical weapons would have to be stored in Europe and Americas European allies have consistently refused to deploy any new devices or even train their soldiers to use them But the core of Senator Pryors belief and the reason he is willing to displease the businessmen of Pine Bluff is rooted in moral feelings At least one aging Titan missile based in Arkansas has already exploded and Senator Pryor fears for the safety of his state should it become the center of the nerve gas industry Moreover in his view nerve gas is an inherently immoral weapon Nerve gas doesnt kill soldiers it kills civilians he said Senator Pryor admits that he is tired of the issue but as long as the Administration asks for money he will oppose it This issue is like chewing gum you step on in the street he said It sticks to your shoe and you can never quite get away from it

2 SCHOOL PRAYER AMENDMENTS SENT TO SENATE FLOOR BY PANEL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/15/us/2-school-prayer-amendments-sent-to-senate-floor-by-panel.html,The Senate Judiciary Committee today sent to the Senate floor two proposed constitutional amendments that would sanction different forms of organized prayer in public schools One amendment backed by President Reagan and many fundamentalist religious groups would permit audible prayer in the classroom A second amendment written by Senator Orrin G Hatch Republican of Utah would allow only silent prayer or meditation The Supreme Court has held that organized prayer in elementary or secondary schools violates the First Amendment The committee vote was 14 to 3 but several lawmakers stressed that they did not support either measure and were merely voting to give the full Senate the right to debate the issue An aide to the Senate leadership said that the issue would probably come to the floor in the fall but that no commitments have been made to bring it up The chance of any school prayer amendment passing the Senate is considered very small because liberals are prepared to stage a filibuster If an amendment received the twothirds vote necessary to pass the Senate Democratic leaders say they are prepared to keep it buried in the House Ratification by the States After receiving a twothirds majority in each chamber a proposed amendment must be ratified by threefourths of the state legislatures Administration aides concede that President Reagan is trying to please conservative groups Of the social issues its probably the most popular in the polls a White House aide said Theres a big coalition out there a lot of activists An assistant to the Senate leadership added that the religious right is making a big deal of it and that President Reagan wanted to mend his fences with this group in time for the 1984 election Senator Charles McC Mathias Jr Republican of Maryland noted that the issue puts many lawmakers in a very difficult position They do not want to tamper with the Constitution he said but they do not want to appear to be against prayer and religion But Mr Mathias who voted against sending the amendments to the floor said he expected many religious groups to oppose the amendment Breach in the Wall Any intrusion into freedom of conscience is a step in the wrong direction Senator Mathias said Its a breach in the wall of protection erected in the Bill of Rights Conservatives have not been able to agree on a proposal and as in the recent Senate debate over abortion the fragmentation has damaged their effectiveness This is a victory for us said David E Landau an attorney for the American Civil Liberties Union It surrounds the issue in confusion As originally formulated the amendment backed by Mr Reagan said nothing in the Constitution shall be construed to prohibit individual or group prayer in public schools or other institutions It also said no person could be required to participate in prayer Many legislators have been concerned that this wording could sanction some sort of official government prayer As a result a sentence was added today that would bar the Federal Government or any state from composing an official prayer But critics say it would still allow teachers or officials to read or compose a prayer

UP FROM INDIVIDUALISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/books/up-from-individualism.html,STATECRAFT AS SOULCRAFT What Government Does By George F Will 186 pp New York Simon and Schuster 1395 IF Ronald Reagan is the leading practitioner of American conservatism George Will is its high priest A political commentator with a reflective bent Mr Will stands out among columnists as the most elegant voice of contemporary conservative political philosophy But Mr Reagan does not practice what Mr Will preaches In Statecraft as Soulcraft his first booklength work Mr Will laments the lack of genuine conservatives in American politics and shows how the best conservative thought is lost even on the most conservative President in decades I will do many things for my country writes Mr Will but I will not pretend that the careers of say Ronald Reagan and Franklin Roosevelt involve serious philosophical differences Conservatives like Mr Reagan attack big government but Mr Will is more concerned with the reluctance of modern government to cultivate the moral character of its citizens He faults conservatives for agreeing with liberals that the inner life of citizens  our sentiments manners and moral opinions is none of the governments business Mr Will insists that statecraft is soulcraft Government cannot be neutral on major moral issues and shouldnt try Just as all education is moral education because learning conditions conduct much legislation is moral legislation because it conditions the action and the thought of the nation in broad and important spheres of life Of course liberals and conservatives display their opposition to soulcraft in different ways Liberals often oppose attempts to ban abortion or censor pornography nd is the author of Liberalism and the Limits of Justiceor regulate adult sexual behavior on the grounds that it is wrong to legislate morality And many conservatives oppose social programs on the grounds that they constitute an interference in the free market Mr Will points out that those who argue in this way share a common confusion They overlook the fact that to take a political stand is always to affirm some moral view There is no stand that imposes no value judgments at all Permissive obscenity statutes do not keep morality out of the law they represent a moral judgment that allowing pornography is better than banning it Laissezfaire economic policies do not keep politics out of the economy they are themselves a kind of politics A free market economic system Mr Will writes is a public product a creation of government It encourages some values and discourages others In his view the denial of soulcraft has made for an impoverished political agenda with troubling consequences for American lifeWhere government fails to nurture a sense of public spirit and selfrestraint material pursuits prevail the dignity of politics fades and social cohesion dissolves Vulnerable to internal decay and external challenge we need to come up from individualism and strengthen the sense of community that modern society erodes Mr Will does not offer a detailed solution to the predicament he describes His purpose is less to promote particular programs than to change the character and tone of the debate His political vision here might best be described as communitarian conservatism He favors a welfare state that embodies an ethic of common provision a military draft that expresses a deepened citizenship a market economy restrained by considerations of the public good and restrictions on abortion pornography and sexual permissiveness in hopes of elevating societys moral sensibilities Like all communitarian ethics Mr Wills invites the objection that to mix politics and morality for whatever good ends is to consort with totalitarian possibilities Mr Will replies plausibly enough that the greater vulnerability lies in atomized dislocated societies not in stable communities with a lively sense of common purposes and shared traditions Still Statecraft as Soulcraft leaves a lurking worry Missing from it is any clear commitment to democracy For example the American institution most powerfully equipped for democratic soulcraft the public school finds scant support from Mr Will who for all his praise of the public estate would subsidize private schools through tuition tax credits And despite his assurance that soulcraft is the citizenry working on itself he also asserts that the basic political right is to good government not selfgovernment If the aim of politics is as Mr Will says a warm citizenship approximating friendship based on a sense of shared values and a shared fate democracy would seem an essential not merely an incidential ingredient Liberals and democrats would do well to take up the challenge Mr Will puts to his fellow conservatives  to argue for a vision of the good society unembarrassed by the thought that it has nothing to do with politics
CIVIL RIGHTS MOVES ARE FAINTLY PRAISED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/weekinreview/civil-rights-moves-are-faintly-praised.html,Not since Congress passed the Fair Housing Act of 1968 six days after the killing of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr has the capital seen such a flurry of official civil rights activity The Reagan Administration last week filed its first school desegregation suit against the State of Alabama and sent draft legislation to Congress to strengthen enforcement of the housing law President Reagans three nominees to the United States Commission on Civil Rights stressed their concern for blacks women and Hispanic Americans as they went through rigorous questioning at a Senate confirmation hearing The Justice Department asked a Federal court to enforce the Voting Rights Act in two counties of Mississippi And Mr Reagan signed an executive order requiring Federal agencies to give greater attention to minority businesses in awarding contracts William Bradford Reynolds the Assistant Attorney General for civil rights just back from a tour of the Mississippi Delta denied that the moves had been orchestrated and Attorney General William French Smith said any suggestion of a political motive was totally unwarranted But as serious planning for a possible reelection bid got under way last week White House officials went out of their way to emphasize the Presidents longstanding civil rights commitment To many observers it appeared that politics was galvanizing the President to do what he might not have done for the sake of principle Senator Howard M Metzenbaum Democrat of Ohio described the initiatives as tokenism Ralph G Neas executive director of the Leadership Conference on Civil Rights a coalition of 165 national organizations said the Administrations civil rights record had been abysmal The Congressional Black Caucus called it abominable Senator Patrick J Leahy Democrat of Vermont said the activity prior to the hearing on the civil rights commission nominees reminded him of the way in which the Administration had floated arms control proposals while lobbying for Senate confirmation of Kenneth L Adelman as director of the Arms Control and Disarmament Agency Some conservatives doubt whether the civil rights strategy will work Howard Phillips chairman of the Conservative Caucus said The Administration is trying to appease the liberal Democratic black leadership by accepting their premises and arguing about the details But theres no way the President is going to be able to outpromise Walter Mondale or John Glenn He should be going on the offensive to secure the support of the black middle class which is essentially conservative on issues such as crime abortion and national defense Senator Bob Dole Republican of Kansas said it was frustrating for Republican supporters of civil rights to see the President subjected to a daily avalanche of criticism On the whole many Republicans seemed to be saying that Mr Reagans motives were less important than the result support for civil rights But Democrats were skeptical They said the credentials of the Civil Rights Commission nominees all Democrats  were less important than the dangerous precedent Mr Reagan would establish by dismissing the incumbents simply because he disliked their views Democratic senators on the Judiciary Committee forced postponement of a confirmation vote until September William L Taylor a former staff director of the commission called the Reagan initiatives an extraordinary public relations offensive and said It doesnt have any real substance so far as I can tell But he added it was helpful to civil rights groups to have the Administration acknowledge the need for a stronger fair housing law It enhances our chances in Congress he said The housing debate now moves to the question of remedies Civil rights groups want a system of administrative law judges who they say could decide cases much more swiftly than regular Federal judges President Reagan and the National Association of Realtors say that Federal Courts are the proper tribunal Thomas Atkins general counsel of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People called the Administrations approach to school desegregation reluctant and ineffective The Justice Department he said had been under a court order to take action on the Alabama case In cases where the Administration is not under court order lawyers noted it prefers voluntary school desegregation plans as in Chicago Administration officials sometimes imply that their only major disagreement with civil rights groups is over the use of quotas and busing to overcome the effects of discrimination in employment and education But Hyman Bookbinder of the American Jewish Committee a firm opponent of quotas said there was a very broadly held perception that this Administration and this Department of Justice are seeking to roll back the civil rights progress of the last 20 years Public opinion polls show that Mr Reagan has little support among blacks and Administration officials express little hope of winning more Frank R Parker of the Lawyers Committee for Civil Rights Under Law said he saw the Presidents civil rights overtures as an effort to convince white middleclass voters who believe in racial equality that the Administration believes in enforcing the law Others said the strategy appeared designed to counteract a perception that the Administrations programs were unfair to minorities and the poor The White House may have thus concluded that support for civil rights is good politics  that minority rights have majority support But Mr Reagan must walk a fine line He must appear interested in enforcing the civil rights laws But if he appears too zealous according to observers at both ends of the political spectrum he could easily alienate some of his conservative constituency
TV VIEW; WHERE TIME STANDS STILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/arts/tv-view-where-time-stands-still.html,Television more than any other popularentertainment medium has just about demolished ordinary concepts of time The past is constantly being recycled as stations search for material to fill their schedules Old movies are so plentiful on television that todays children are growing up on the same films that proved so absorbing to their parents and even their grandparents Preteens can be as knowledgeable as Woody Allen about such Humphrey Bogart movie classics as Casablanca Although there have long been movie houses specializing in revivals they tend to attract cultish audiences numbering at best in the mere hundreds for any given showing Television conveys the same material to tens of thousands of viewers And it does so continuously around the clock Furthermore televisions tendency to feed upon itself creates an ongoing time warp The daily schedules are crammed with programs produced as far back as a couple of decades ago For older audiences the reruns can generate a warm nostalgic glow but sociologists are still trying to determine the precise effects televisions golden oldies might be having on youngsters watching them for the first time Are these new viewers merely amused or are they taking the content of those relics seriously What do they make of the values morality and interrelationships particularly within the family as depicted in those old programs In any case the sheer volume of present and past in televisions cultural cupboard of popular entertainment continues to expand Indeed covering the massive flow of new programs coming out of California or New York studios reviewers often tend to forget that television is more than the commercial networks and public television And it is more than the new pay channels that offer movies uncensored and without interruptions Television also consists of independent stations that traditionally have relied on not only old movies but recycled television series to fill their daily schedules Theres one good reason for this phenomenon The old stuff is usually cheaper certainly much cheaper than producing new material of similar quality Now cable television has given birth to the superstation which is really an independent station sending its programming over cable lines or via satellites to viewers far from its home base One of the first and most successful superstations is Ted Turners WTBS which operates out of Atlanta but is available to cable subscribers in cities and towns across the country including New York And as it happens WTBS is notoriously partial to old TV series The always colorful Mr Turner is fond of explaining with a sanctimoniousness practically begging for skepticism that the old shows represented good clean family entertainment Unlike their more permissive contemporary counterparts they reflected the decent values that made this country great Of course they also remain cheaper to buy and are a major factor in increasing the stations profits Consider some of the fare that can be seen on WTBS these days scattered throughout the stations schedule from morning to night There are the old sitcoms ranging from the disposable silliness of The Addams Family and Gomer Pyle USMC to the frequent brilliance of I Love Lucy One recent installment of the latter had Lucille Ball eager to get the job of doing commercials on a television show that was to have Desi Arnaz as host After setting up the situation rather laboriously Lucy was required to go through a long rehearsal for selling a health potion that unknown to her was made up of 23 percent alcohol The selling patter ended with Lucy taking a spoonful of the nasty stuff and observing with a wink that its so tasty too  tastes just like candy By the third take of course Lucy began getting noticeably woozy and the selling quickly disintegrated into a hilarious batch of non sequiturs and hiccoughs That kind of routine like the early films of Chaplin or Keaton is truly timeless One wonders if the reliance on insults and wisecracking that so often tries to pass for humor in todays sitcoms will amuse future generations of viewers There are other programs however in which the content supposedly reflects the attitudes of a particular era They are presumably the ones that Mr Turner lauds for their decent values The classic in this category is undoubtedly Father Knows Best the halfhour situation comedy that began on radio in 1949 and then was brought to television in 1954 Its final firstrun broadcast was on April 5 1963 The star of the series for all of those years was Robert Young He played an insurance executive named Jim Anderson in a Midwestern town called Springfield His TV wife Margaret was Jane Wyatt They had three children evidently the perfect total for any decent family Betty Elinor Donahue often called Princess by daddy James Jr Billy Gray aka Bud and Kathy Lauren Chapin daddys Kitten In one episode recently carried on WTBS Betty agrees to take care of a neighbors baby for a few days Daddy of course will not hear of Betty staying by herself in a strangers home so the baby is brought over to the Anderson place Quickly becoming the center of attention the infant triggers outbursts of jealousy and resentment in Bud and Kathy Fortunately the childs parents fretting over its welfare return early furnishing a resolution of sorts The final scene has the Andersons discovering Kathy sleeping in her old crib sucking her thumb Father always knowing best warmly assures her that youre our baby Kitten youll always be our baby And thus the concept of the nuclear family is perceived as it should be not necessarily as it really is The same sort of idealized past can be found in My Three Sons a sitcom that had its premiere in 1960 with Fred MacMurray as Steve Douglas an aviation engineer and head of an allmale household in a mediumsized Middle Western city A week or so ago Steve could be seen genially tolerating the filmmaking aspirations of his oldest son Robbie Don Grady Doing a class project for high school Robbie becomes ensnared in the avantgarde ambitions of an attractive classmate named Gina He begins his film recording some ordinary scenes of his family but Gina soon has him exploring more meaningful themes of personal freedom In the end of course the footage about the family is voted best in the class while Ginas pretentiousness is good only for laughs Gee says dad I guess our dull and ordinary routines are kind of interesting after all It is all very sweet and comforting ages away from the drugs premarital sex and abortions that receive so much attention on some of todays entertainments It is also too simplistic to be real Anybody hankering after the easy answers and comforting certainties of yesteryear can vicariously relive it all with little effort The past is solidly entrenched in the daily television schedule there for the sampling presumably forever
CANDIDATES BEGIN SPRINT FOR CAMPAIGN FUNDS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/weekinreview/candidates-begin-sprint-for-campaign-funds.html,The Democratic National Committee held its issues forum for Presidential candidates in a downtown hotel here last week But another event that revealed a great deal about the status of the Democrats contest took place a few miles away at the Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church There on Thursday night the choir of the black church sang Sign Me Up a spiritual with voterregistration overtones and the minister greeted the Rev Jesse L Jackson with a shout of Run Jesse run Mr Jackson had a grand time encouraging the guessing game over whether he will turn his voterregistration crusade into a fullfledged convention candidacy The black minister from Chicago reminded the committee that he is already running third in many public opinion polls behind former Vice President Walter F Mondale and Senator John Glenn of Ohio That means he said that even without a formal announcement he has greater market appeal than Senators Alan Cranston of California Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina and Gary Hart of Colorado and former Governor Reubin Askew of Florida On the surface the Democrats were cheerful about letting Rev Jackson use their fourday meeting as a stage to generate suspense about his plans Behind the scenes there was plenty of speculation about how badly a Jackson candidacy would hurt Mr Mondale who is counting on heavy minority support But the six announced candidates have other worries They know for example that whatever he does they face the chore of slogging through the dog days of summer despite the indifference of the vacationing public In the period between now and Labor Day the candidates must try to raise as much money as possible before the New Jersey straw poll September 1213 ushers in an unremitting grind that will extend into the 1984 primaries Mr Mondale has been particularly busy and successful at fundraising piling up a 2 million surplus so far Many Democratic strategists believe that cash on hand particularly if saved for advertising could be a big factor in the winnowing process in March when a number of important primaries come close together For Mr Mondale and Mr Glenn other kinds of testing are going on as well Mr Mondale seems to be emerging from a bad period in which Mr Glenn pulled even with him in the polls and Mr Cranston beat him in the Wisconsin straw poll That fed the feeling he had shaky support among party activists and the public was looking for a fresher face In responding to these developments he exhibited a peevish streak that added to his difficulties But Mr Mondale seems to have regained his humor and some momentum among party activists and it seems to be Mr Glenns turn to take the pressure Mr Glenn had an easy ride through the spring gaining in the polls while avoiding the campaign fray But he is entering a period when his skills as a major candidate will get closer scrutiny Mondale advisers have long contended privately that Mr Glenn will not be able to breathe at high altitude as they put it Moving in on a TwoWay Race In fact he got bad reviews from Democratic House members after a closeddoor political meeting in Washington last week In Detroit a question on what he would do in his first hundred days seemed to catch him unprepared In general however his speaking style has improved and his advisers believe that grassroots voters are less concerned than the capitals political community over finetuned answers on policy The other four announced candidates now find themselves struggling against a general consensus that the party has a twoway race Mr Askew looking for a surprise showing in Iowas caucuses has been quietly working among Catholic voters who share his misgivings about abortion Mr Hart skipped the issues forum in Detroit to filibuster against the MX missile part of a boldstroke plan with which his advisers hope to invigorate a campaign that has not drawn the support they expected Mr Cranston and his staff after making gains on the nuclear freeze seem to be taking a breather And Mr Hollings stung last week when the National Association of Colored People rebuked him for what they regarded as a suspect commitment to civil rights is still searching for a way to become more than an asterisk in the polls All these candidates were allotted one hour in Detroit Party leaders were in a quandary as to what to do about Mr Jackson Since he was trailed everywhere by television crews and reporters and is demonstrably popular with black voters who make up 20 percent of the Democratic electorate he could hardly be ignored So it was decreed that Mr Jackson would be alloted 10 minutes on Friday provided he limited himself to civil rights But Mr Jacksons presence alone was sufficient to underscore questions he raises Will a black candidacy benefit the Democratic party by encouraging minority registration or polarize it Will a Jackson candidacy by taking black support from Mr Mondale open the way for Mr Glenn That the Mondale people hope Mr Jackson will eventually bow out and throw his support to them was clear at the Little Rock Missionary Baptist Church When Mr Jackson arrived he had two smiling escorts John Riley the senior adviser in the Mondale campaign and Thomas Donilan a Mondale political consultant
WILL THE REAL REAGAN JUSTICE DEPARTMENT PLEASE STAND UP?,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/weekinreview/will-the-real-reagan-justice-department-please-stand-up.html,It was the best of times and the worst of times for the Justice Department during the Supreme Court term that ended this month In fact it sometimes seemed there were two Justice Departments filing briefs and arguing cases before the High Court One  the traditional defender of Federal agencies their programs and statutes  had a success rate that could only be called impressive Using legal arguments that could have been made and often were any time during the past 10 years by other Administrations this department won many more cases than it lost on topics such as Federal benefit programs immigration taxation criminal procedure and of special satisfaction to many of its lawyers the legislative veto The other Justice Department  the proselytizer for the Reagan Administrations political and social agenda  compiled a record that was at best spotty and sometimes disastrous This was the department that told the Court the Internal Revenue Service had no legal authority to deny tax exempt status to discriminatory private schools that state and local opposition to abortion merited heavy deference from Federal judges and that there was no legal impediment to revoking a previous Administrations regulation that mandated automatic seat belts or airbags in new cars The rule was unpopular with the new deregulators By wide margins the Justices rejected these arguments handing the Administration stunning losses that overshadowed several legal victories on Reagan agenda issues such as tuition tax deductions and limitations on courtawarded attorneys fees All three losses were to some degree selfinflicted wounds The Justice Department was originally on the winning side in the Bob Jones University tax exemption case but switched at the last minute on orders from the White House The Government had to join the legal debate on this matter since the question was one of Federal tax policy but not the abortion case The Supreme Court had already agreed to review regulations in Missouri and Akron Ohio which restricted access to abortion when Solicitor General Rex E Lee filed a brief that said the abortion issue is a matter for elected officials not Federal judges to decide As a nonparty the Government had to seek special permission to argue before the Court It was there that Associate Justice Harry A Blackmun holding high a copy of the brief and glaring at the Solicitor General in a mixture of anger and incredulity demanded Did you write this brief personally A Tradition of Deference The airbag case was an Administration appeal that many Government lawyers had advised against filing The United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia had ruled the Administrations rescission of the airbag rule arbitrary and capricious The appeals court opinion was persuasive More important it turned on the specific facts of a single and unusual case and thus did not seem to meet the usual criteria for a Supreme Court review The Court did take the case however displaying the deference it has traditionally accorded Government appeals it takes roughly twothirds of Government cases as against about 3 percent of everyone elses One question raised by the experience this term is whether the Government can continue to count on that deference The Court rejected the Justice Departments advice on two notable occasions It refused the departments request to hear an appeal by the school board of Nashville Tenn from a Federal court busing order The order based on a finding that Nashville schools remained segregated after 27 years of litigation was consistent with Supreme Court precedents in this area Career lawyers within Justice had warned their superiors that the grounds for Nashvilles appeal were so weak that the department would be jeopardizing its credibility by coming anywhere near the case The second rebuff came the last day of the term The new Reagan Administration majority on the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission wanted to reverse an existing policy that favored states and municipalities over private industry in renewals of operating licenses for hydroelectric power plants Unfortunately for the commission a Federal appeals court had just upheld the policy and an appeal by the utility industry was pending at the Supreme Court Solicitor General Lee asked the Justices to send the case back to the appeals court for reconsideration in light of intervening circumstances namely the energy commissions change of membership and heart It was a highly unusual request and the Court said no by denying the utility industrys appeal So far the Court has appeared able to distinguish one Justice Department from the other separating cases that represent the Governments traditional institutional interests from those that seek to advance Administration goals But further tests of the departments credibility lie ahead It is currently considering whether to join Alabamas appeal from a lower court decision that the states school prayer laws are unconstitutional The department already has asked the Court to rule that a city may include a Nativity scene as part of an official Christmas display According to the Governments brief a Federal appeals court decision that such a display in Pawtucket RI was unconstitutional mandates an artificial and undesirable sterility in public life Erosion of the Governments credibility would be a more serious and lasting institutional blow than the loss of one case or many Highly placed Administration lawyers acknowledge the risk but insist there is nothing wrong with trying to use the Supreme Court to advance the cause Legal arguments that are lost on nine judges may still reassure watchful voters of the Administrations commitment As one official put it If you win too many youre being too timid
WESTCHESTER JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/17/nyregion/westchester-journal-032409.html,time Westchester resident has gone Hollywood For years a lifesize effigy of Paine resided in the writers New Rochelle cottage given to him in 1784 by the state in gratitude for his service during the Revolutionary War Most recently the deteriorating figure had been relegated to storage The members of the HuguenotThomas Paine Historical Association which maintains the cottage and the Thomas Paine Museum decided to try to remedy that Last May they enlisted the aid of a makeup artist from Larchmont Dick Smith known for aging Dustin Hoffman in Little Big Man and Marlon Brando in The Godfather and for creating the demonic Linda Blair in The Exorcist He also designed the apparitions in Ghost Story and the experiments in Altered States They read about me and called Mr Smith said They figured nothing ventured nothing gained What they gained was not an offer to repair the effigy which Mr Smith called a total disaster but to make a new head and pair of hands for it If I had charged them my normal price it would have knocked them off their feet Mr Smith said he charged them nothing Mr Smith worked at his home for a few weeks using an acrylic that was least likely to yellow It was not easy Everything seemed to go wrong for a time he said I never had such a run of bad luck But even adversity had some fortunate consequences The acrylic developed some interesting craters resulting in a more realistically pockmarked face When he had finished his sculpturing Mr Smith obtained a new costume and wig for the statue and delivered it June 2 Im pleased with him he said I see some things I could have done better but the old one didnt even look like Thomas Paine It bore no resemblance to that wonderful bignosed man Peter S Gannon past president of the association was more enthusiastic Its fantastic he said its just so perfectly Paine its incredible Everybody who has seen it is excited Its Paine in the flesh Or at least in the acrylic Westchester residents will have a special opportunity to pass their own judgments next Sunday when the Paine association has a fundraising lawn party from 3 PM to 6 at the cottage at the corner of North and Paine Avenues Mr Smith will be the guest of honor and donations of 6 will be asked The effigy is also on view weekends from 2 to 5 PM There is no admission charge but donations are welcome  Gary Kriss The county Board of Legislators called on the state last week to enact a law to require physicians to notify parents before performing abortions on minors The lawmakers approved a similar measure in 1980 but it was vetoed by Alfred B DelBello who was County Executive as being outside the countys jurisdiction Efforts in Albany to approve notification laws have failed The vote on the request for the state to act was 11 to 6 almost completely along party lines Among the Republicans only Edward M Gibbs of Peekskill vice chairman voted no John A DeRario of New Rochelle was the sole Democrat in favor Mr Gibbs said We have no stand in this matter The state reserves the right to legislate He said that in any case notification has led to physical abuse and the breakup of weak family relationships Mr DeRario argued for an end to the situation where you can take a girl out of school for an abortion without telling the parents John E Hand Republican of Yorktown Heights introduced the resolution saying it asked that any state law be tailored to meet US Supreme Court standards The High Court last month upheld parental or judicial consent when a girl was not emancipated or mature enough to make her own decision But it also struck down an Akron Ohio ordinance because it did not protect the rights of mature minors The ruling recalled that the Court had held that the state may not impose a blanket provision requiring the consent of a parent or person in loco parentis as a condition for abortion of an unmarried minor Audrey G Hochberg Democrat of Scarsdale said the major impact of the legislation would be to delay young womens seeking medical assistance This was characterized by John P OLeary Republican of Yonkers as scare tactics Several legislators spoke of their own daughters but Sandra R Galef Democrat of Ossining said We have to look beyond our personal interests There are many families where problems would follow notification she said It comes down to intrusion on individual rights Edward J Brady Republican of Thornwood and the majority leader asked How can it be that a child cant get an arm set without parental notification Mrs Hochberg said it was because of the threat of medical malpractice suits but doctors are protected regarding venereal disease and in this area Dominick D Pierro Republican of Port Chester said Our earlier law was bad like passing local legislation on the death penalty but now we should get a law thats acceptable to the Supreme Court Ronald C Tocci Democrat of New Rochelle favored notification and called for more study but the vote was taken and the resolution approved  James Feron In its second year in the United States American Foreign Study Programs has added Westchester County to its list of areas in the nation that are available to French students participating in onemonth cultural exchanges However the organizers of the program are learning that finding host families in the county is a little harder than we thought according to Vera Sklaar national coordinator of the organization which has its American headquarters in White Plains With 20 years experience arranging programs for 5000 students a year between France and England the Parisbased program has been seeking families to provide room and meals for students between 14 and 22 In exchange for inviting the world home in the person of a student from another land the program hopes the host families will be exposed to the students cultures Two groups of 15 students each are in the county currently but 20 who are due to arrive Aug 4 are without hosts Things are moving a little slower than we anticipated Mrs Sklaar said Its a little difficult getting through to people that it would be fun Many of the students to be placed are male according to Mrs Sklaar because we always run out of girls first She said the usual advance correspondence between the hosts and students would probably not take place Theres the element of the blind date about it now she said The notforprofit program says it is not educationally oriented Mrs Sklaar said it was affiliated with a French version of ParentTeacher Associations and the Ministry of Education The groups will not attend any classes but will concentrate on developing conversational English All of the 800 students who will visit the United States with 200 on the East Coast have studied English for at least two years Groups in other parts of the country will participate in academic studies Coordinators drawn from the ranks of teachers and social workers are supervisors and recreation planners one French leader is available for each 45 students Executives of the program would like to offer an exchange next year for American teenagers who are members of host families For information call the local coordinator Jane Berkowicz at 9464235  John B OMahoney
"CATHOLIC PAPER, CHILD OF FRENCH HISTORY, IS REBORN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/18/world/catholic-paper-child-of-french-history-is-reborn.html,In our view the daily press is the plague of our era said the editorial in the very first issue The best of the newspapers are worth nothing The words were written 100 years ago last month by the Rev Francois Picard With them he and a group of Assumptionist priests launched La Croix a daily newspaper determined to preach the religious orders combative monarchist version of Roman Catholicism to what was rapidly becoming one of the most secular countries in the West La Croix is celebrating its 100th anniversary this summer but its founders might have some difficulty in recognizing what has become of their journal or indeed of their religious order If I refer to the first editorial of the paper it saw the rights of man as opposed to the rights of God said the Rev Noel Copin a wellknown television journalist who began his career at La Croix and recently returned as its managing editor Today the cause of the rights of man is one of the permanent themes of our combat So is support for democracy the welfare state and help for the third world The changes in the paper and in the Assumptionist order reflect one of the most profound shifts in French life over the last three decades A virtual end to the struggle between Catholicism and the secular republic and the blossoming of a variety of relationships between French Catholicism and the political left Even though a majority of practicing Catholics here still vote for parties of the right the encounter between Catholicism and the left has changed both sides Founder Hated the Revolution And few parts of the church have changed as much as the Assumptionists When the Rev Emmanuel dAlzon founded the order in 1845 at the College of the Assumption in Nimes his purpose was largely to fight the French Republic and its secular doctrines One recently published Catholic guide to the various religious orders described Father dAlzons hatred of the French Revolution as quasiobsessional How profound was the antipathy between the church and the anticlerical left To answer the Rev Henri Guillemin an Assumptionist official took a recent visitor to the Assumptionists headquarters in the Latin Quarter here down a corridor for a look at a 13thcentury statue of Our Lady of Salvation If you notice the nose was originally chipped off and theres damage to the face and the arms and to the Baby Jesus in her arms he said That happened when a supporter of the Paris Commune of 1871 shot the statue in the face and then took a hammer to it The period of the Commune when a group of revolutionaries took control of Paris for two months is heroic in the history of the left but was nothing short of a disaster in the eyes of Catholics Originally the Assumptionists sought to restore the church through religious education and pilgrimages to holy places In 1873 as part of the latter mission they started a magazine called The Pilgrim That said Father Guillemin is when the order learned the power of the press Ten years later La Croix was born and the history of the order its daily and French Catholicism have been intertwined ever since Wrong Side of the Dreyfus Case At the beginning La Croix was monarchist nationalist and antiSemitic said the Rev Charles Monsch who after 34 years as the papers chief librarian serves as what one journalist described as the ministry of memory The papers antiSemitism was especially virulent in 1894 when a Jewish army officer was accused of treason in what has become known as the Dreyfus Affair Despite an anticlerical Governments efforts to shut the paper down at the turn of the century by temporarily throwing the Assumptionists out of France La Croix prospered During the German occupation from 1940 to 1944 La Croix was a mixture of Vatican pronouncements and articles sympathetic to Vichy and the Nazis But Father Guillemin argues that careful readers could see nonVichy messages if they read between the lines and while most Vichyite papers were shut down La Croix was allowed to remain open after the liberation A Postwar Rebirth It was in the postwar period that the new French Catholic church was born and the Assumptionists reflected the change None of us were the same after the war said Father Guillemin who went underground during the occupation to avoid compulsory work in Germany and resumed his religious studies in the late 1940s In the mid1950s a new La Croix also began to take shape It dropped the crucifix from its masthead and its style began to resemble that of a modern daily  and a daily that won praise from secular journalists Politically the paper and the order embraced the modern world moving toward a kind of centrist progressivism that increasingly characterized the churchs approach to politics Today the influence of what Father Monsch called social Catholicism can be seen in both the governing Socialist Party and in the opposition The church and the Socialist Government are skirmishing over the role of religious schools but for the most part the old clericalsecular battles are over Crisis and Reorganization Like many religious orders the Assumptionists have faced a crisis in vocations  their numbers have declined to 1400 from about 1900 in the late 1960s  and the order reorganized itself in the late 1960s The emphasis is on small communities of five to a dozen priests living together with the priests often pursuing entirely different tasks But much of the orders energy is still focused on its publishing house Bayard Press The house puts out not only La Croix  the apple of our eye said Father Guillemin  but a wide range of magazines and books The profits from Bayards other activities cover La Croixs annual deficit of about 1 million and also keep it independent from direct ecclesiastical or private control Unlike most of Frances national papers which rely heavily on newsstand sales this afternoon daily is supported by subscribers who account for over 80 percent of 115000 daily sales A Policy of No Slogans No slogans is how one priest described the papers politics at a mass held in the papers honor last month at Notre Dame The result is that conservatives disagree with the papers social democratic approach to economic issues while some members of the left find the papers opposition to abortion or its occasional criticisms of the disarmament movement hard to accept With a crisp new layout the papers circulation has begun to climb after a decline over the last few years But Catholic it will remain as long as the Assumptionists have anything to do with it If our founders came back theyd initially be very agitated over what has happened to the paper and the order said Father Guillemin But I like to think that theyd eventually understand that were still doing their work in promulgating the Gospel
SHOPPING MALLS PROTEST INTRUSION BY PROTESTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/19/nyregion/shopping-malls-protest-intrusion-by-protesters.html,Many shopping mall operators say they have had the uncomfortable feeling of late that the outside world is seeping into their cool stone windowless palaces of retailing Here in a suburb of Hartford attorneys for the 127store Westfarms Mall have been battling in court for more than two years to keep out the National Organization for Women The womens organization argues that even though such malls are private property they have become the nations new downtowns public places where individuals and groups have as much right to collect signatures on petitions and hand out literature as on any street corner Moreover argues Martin Margulies the groups attorney malls are the place the only place to see people in the suburbs anymore The womens organization won the first round in its court battle with Westfarms Mall early last year when a judge granted them admittance for a set time to gather signatures on petitions supporting ratification of the equal rights amendment In March of this year the group won the right to return to the mall amid dire warnings by attorneys for the mall that this would open the door for radical groups Within days the Ku Klux Klan showed up to distribute literature and the mall attorneys asked for a rehearing A court decision is expected within days in the case one of a rash in Connecticut New York and New Jersey challenging the rights of malls to exclude such groups There is deep concern over allowing the womens group and its folding card table into the mall officials of malldeveloping companies said because the nations more than 2000 enclosed malls are overwhelmingly successful finely tuned selling machines in which everything from climate to clientele have always been closely controlled to produce an impeccably pleasant shopping environment Although malls teeming with thousands of shoppers seem to be public marketplaces they are decidedly not the officials said Retailers not fitting the total marketing concept are not allowed in the officials said and the ones that are have their hours set and their store designs approved by mall managements Malls contain no pool halls or gin mills or those who frequent them no Hare Krishnas soliciting funds no one with leaflets protesting abortion or reminding shoppers of the potential for nuclear holocaust no inclement weather no windows no clocks nothing to break the spell We in the industry are quite concerned about a loss of control said Peter Hollis senior vice president for the Taubman Company one of the nations largest mall developers and the management concern for Westfarms The hasslefree environment is the whole basis of shopping mall development And malls are just a beginning warned Robert Dombroff attorney for Westfarms If the court allows activist groups into malls they must also be allowed into department stores Both are private property Condominiums movie theaters bowling alleys and churches will be next Mall operators worry that if the National Organization for Women is allowed in other groups some of them undesirable will demand equal rights Some worry that if their malls are deemed public they may one day be obliged to lease space to pornography shops When the Klan appeared at the Westfarms Mall it cited its right to be there by virtue of the NOW decision and the police also citing the NOW decision refused to arrest the Klan members for trespassing Palmer McGee Farmington Town Attorney said We made no trespassing arrests because the judges ruling seemed to be going along with rulings in other states that malls are now just like the town green that they are public domain The police also recently refused to arrest on trespassing charges members of an antinuclear power group and the Constitutional Revivalists organization Klan members departed at the suggestion of the police but a fight broke out between antiKlan protesters and police officers in riot gear resulting in several arrests and minor injuries Mr Dombroff immediately asked the court to reverse its ruling admitting NOW something the judge is to decide within a few days Mr Dombroff said that the previous ruling had produced chaos and that the mall could no longer protect its private property He introduced figures indicating a significant loss of sales at the mall the day of the Klan melee Mr Margulies called the clash one of the prices we have to pay for a First Amendment Last March antinuclear activists on Long Island protesting the construction of the Shoreham nuclear power plant won the right to distribute literature in the South Haven Mall Mall officials had argued that the mall was designed to be a relaxed pleasant noncontroversial family oriented place inappropriate to such activity but a State Supreme Court justice said that the mall was public or quasipublic property and that the intrusion on the right of privacy was minimal compared with the groups right of free speech The judge noted that the mall opened its doors to charity auctions permitted recruitment by the Army and local universities and played host to the Boy Scouts and Girl Scouts He added that the mall could be considered to perform the functional equivalent of a town center The decision has been appealed In April a Municipal Court judge in Paramus NJ ruled in favor of the owners of the Bergen Mall in a case brought by a political candidate who wanted to distribute campaign materials there The attorney for the candidate who has appealed the decision said There is no real downtown Paramus Areas of the mall outside the stores are the towns public sidewalks He noted that community events were held at the mall and that it contained a meeting hall a post office and a Roman Catholic chapel The United States Supreme Court held in 1980 that the First Amendment did not guarantee the right to pass petitions and distribute handbills in shopping malls but it said that states could interpret their own constitutions to protect such activities and several states have Most malls involved have been allowed to promulgate rigid guidelines for the activities of such groups once inside such as where tables can be placed and how actively the groups might solicit shoppers The malls have supplanted downtowns said Mr Margulies and have derived substantial benefits Now they must fulfill some responsibilities He and other attorneys across the country are now arguing that the malls invite the public in and that those who accept the invitation take their constitutional rights in with them Mr Hollis said that people in the mall business were closely watching what happens to NOW and its folding card table
WORKING PROFILE; AIDE FOCUSES ON 'ABILITY TO LOOK FOWARD',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/20/us/working-profile-aide-focuses-on-ability-to-look-foward.html,Longrange planning has not received much priority in the modern White House as recent Administrations have rarely looked more than a few months ahead But President Reagan has just hired Bruce K Chapman a Harvardtrained former liberal to think about what the future of the national Government ought to be Jerry Falwell and others of the new right need not worry about his background Mr Chapman has put his past behind him and comes to the job with a conservative philosophy that even Mr Reagan might envy While the President goes back to smalltown Illinois for his vision for America Mr Chapman goes back to Socrates in ancient Greece Mr Chapman 42 years old who has been director of the Census Bureau for the past two years takes over this week as deputy assistant to the President and director of the Office of Planning and Evaluation in the White House an office that has been vacant for some time According to the announcement of the appointment Mr Chapman will report to Edwin Meese 3d the Presidents counselor and will be responsible for longrange issues identification statistical analysis and program evaluation Condemns Liberals in Address On June 4 when Mr Chapman was running the Census Bureau and there was no hint at least in public that he would be moving to the White House he delivered a commencement address at Monmouth College in Illinois that added up to a strong condemnation of liberals and liberal causes so prominent in American government since the New Deal The address was surprising for two reasons First census directors usually concern themselves with the collection of data and leave the enunciation of issues to Cabinet members and others involved in partisan programs Second Mr Chapman a former Treasurer of Washington State had been a moderate Republican throughout his political career which began as a member of the Seattle City Council He was a rebel Republican in his youth when he was a liberal journalist and a member of the Ripon Society a group of moderate and liberal young Republicans who challenged the old conservatives including Mr Reagan His appointment to the White House staff was a surprise Mr Chapman had long been known as Mr Clean a nickname he picked up when he ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Washington and some considered him illsuited for the brawls of the White House where Presidential aides as they have in every Administration fight with long knives Reelection Effort Is Hinted Yet it seemed to some that Mr Chapman having turned in his liberal credentials was being brought to the White House to help shore up the Reagan policies for the reelection effort next year an effort already under way even though Mr Reagan has not announced his intention to run Not so Mr Chapman said in an interview He said he would be called on to supply data on current issues but that his main task would be to give the Government the ability to look forward in the development of policies as it never has before According to the White House announcement Mr Chapman also will help stimulate the climate for public discussion of longrange issues of importance to the Presidents goals For this Mr Chapmans address at Monmouth College suggested he might be the perfect person for the job He represents a converging of the intellectual left with the religious right within the party under the Reagan banner What Mr Chapman believes he believes with a parsons fervor and the Monmouth address was an outpouring of his personal feelings Sophistical Values Are Scorned He drew parallels between modern America with the corrupt democracy of Greece in which the Sophists holding that man himself was the measure of all things opposed Socrates a religious man a man of reason a patriot Isnt it ironic that these shabby discredited sophistical values once more are considered fashionable he said On sexual freedom he said The pendulum has swung far away from traditional morality past liberty and into license But far from the scene of hedonistic bliss as promised we see before us a frightening landscape of personal and social tragedy Medical science itself apparently cannot keep up with the development of exotic new diseases We also are witnessing a steep rise in child abuse a rocketing increase in abortions  terminating one out of three pregnancies  and a sharp rise in the proportion of children born out of wedlock one out of eight children now for the population as a whole On crime Another example of presentday sophistry that needs to be exposed is the idea that crime is a response to bad economic conditions rather than a reflection of the antisocial attitudes of individuals and an atmosphere that subtly tolerates crime The statistics show no particular correlation between high unemployment levels or an increase in poverty and high crime rates On the family A census study shows that poverty is more the result of family dissolution than the cause of family dissolution Rather than providing greater subsidies to the poor the Government should be asking itself What economic and social disincentives to family intactness should be removed  On the national defense Our willingness to promote our ideals patiently and persistently  the will of the West  is weakened by many of our own internal critics For them a reflexive cynicism about their own country is easier perhaps because it often offers a quicker path to career success than to owning up to the demanding and fearsome realities we face In a recent interview Mr Chapman said that the Republican Party had changed more than he had and that it had shed much of the negativism that he and George F Gilder an early advocate of supplyside economics had found objectionable in the book they wrote in 1966 The Party That Lost Its Head But finally he said I have become more conservative as I have grown older And the ideas he expounded at Monmouth College are compatible with those expressed by Senator Barry Goldwater in his climb to the Republican Presidential nomination 20 years ago

2 WOMEN BECOME PREGNANT WITH TRANSFERRED EMBRYOS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/22/us/2-women-become-pregnant-with-transferred-embryos.html,A team of California doctors reported yesterday what it said were the worlds first two pregnancies achieved as a result of a technique in which an embryo is transferred from one woman to another Experts in the fields of obstetrics and embryology hailed the achievement and said it would probably substantially enhance the possibility of parenthood for women who might otherwise be infertile The report comes amid increasing activity in reproductive physiology In the last several years research and laboratory work in the field has led to the birth of more than 100 babies as a result of in vitro fertilization the uniting of sperm and egg outside the womb in a glass dish The new technique differs from that testtube method in that sperm from the prospective father is first placed in the uterus of the woman who donates her ovum Then in the first week of her pregnancy the resulting tiny embryo a microscopic clump of about 100 cells is flushed out of her womb and is transferred to the womb of the woman who will carry the baby to full term and be known as the infants mother Several experts in reproductive physiology said they believed that this in vivo method might well be superior to the testtube method because the chances of success would be far higher Only about onequarter of in vitro attempts at fertilization have been successful Many moral religious and legal questions about such pregnancies have led some researchers to shy away from such experimentation Associates of the medical team at University of California at Los Angeles for example said its members had agreed to undertake the work only after groups of researchers at other hospitals had declined to do so The principal researcher in the team which works at the Harbor General HospitalUCLA Medical Center in Torrance is Dr John E Buster a professor of obstetrics and gynecology at the UCLA Medical School He was assisted by Dr Maria Bustillo an assistant professor and five other specialists Their report was published in the current issue of The Lancet a medical journal printed in London The issue has yet to be distributed in this country Dr Ian Craft a leading British obstetrician said in a telephone interview yesterday that he considered the California work to be important because it might be a more effective method of fertilization Yet he cautioned that the method had yet to be perfected Indeed the group in Los Angeles was successful in only two of the six attempts it made Two Successful Cases In the two successful cases the account in The Lancet said one of the women who received a transferred embryo was in her fifth month of pregnancy and the other was in her fifth week Neither of the women was identified by name or residence nor was the donor or donors of the ovum The report did not make clear if one or more donors had been involved Dr Wayne Decker executive director of the New York Fertility Research Foundation said of the report I think its a great thing I hope it will stimulate more activity in this area I have always felt this approach would have a much higher degree of success than the in vitro method Dr Randolph W Seed an assistant professor of surgery at the Northwestern University Medical School in Chicago who assisted in the development of the new technique along with his brother Dr Richard G Seed said in an interview that the technique was known as adoptive pregnancy Dr Seed said widespread use of the transfer technique might reduce to a small fraction the thousands of couples that would be unable to have children of their own He said the technique would be of value to women who did not have functioning ovaries to those afraid that their own ovum might in some way be genetically damaged and to those who might not be able to tolerate the surgery necessary for the testtube fertilization procedure Tool in Cattle Breeding Ovum transfer has become a major tool of commercial cattle breeding in the United States in recent years The technique has been used in at least a dozen other species since before the turn of the century At least 60000 cattle have been born of ovum transfer in this country with no detectable increase in the frequency of birth defects or other problems associated with pregnancy Laboratory fertilization the conventional technique for humans was developed in Britain by Dr Robert Edwards and Dr Patrick Steptoe The first baby conceived through this method was born in 1978 and as many as 130 others have followed at medical centers around the world One major advantage of the ovum transfer technique over the testtube method is that the woman who is to carry the embryo to full term does not have to undergo surgery In an earlier report in The Lancet the Los Angeles group said We see nonsurgical ovum donor transfer as an alternative to an in vitro fertilization when an infertile couple is willing to accept a donated ovum The team of doctors added that the technique could be performed in a doctors office and could be repeated until pregnancy had been achieved Some specialists believe the method has one potential problem A donor might remain pregnant if the flushing out of the uterus failed to remove a fertilized egg They added that in such cases prospective donors would be informed of this possibility which is considered remote and offered the opportunity of abortion within days of the unsuccessful recovery of the embryo
POPULATION PRIZES FROM U.N. ASSAILED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/world/population-prizes-from-un-assailed.html,Two 12500 awards given by a United Nations population agency to Prime Minister Indira Gandhi of India and to Chinas family planning chief have been denounced as a travesty by a United States economist whom the agency enlisted as an adviser The economist Theodore W Shultz of Chicago said that the United Nations Fund for Population Activities had ignored the recommendations of private consultants and rewarded two nations that have used brutal methods to curb population growth Mr Shultz a recipient of the Nobel Memorial Prize in Economic Science told the agency to remove his name from any material involving the prize In a letter to Rafael M Salas the Funds executive director Mr Shultz said the awards would damage family planning programs The harm was done by awarding the prize to a public official in China where public policy is responsible for the appallingly high rate of female infanticide and a prize to the head of state of India despite her cruel mandated sterlization Mr Shultz wrote Forced Sterilization During the emergency rule she imposed on India from 1975 to 1977 Mrs Gandhis Government was accused of forcing men in villages to undergo sterilization China whose family planning minister Qian Xinzhong received the other award uses a system of punishment for couples who have two or more children Women carrying a second child who refuse an abortion can lose 20 percent of their pay Mr Shultz in a telephone interview said this policy had caused a large increase in female infanticide Mrs Gandhi has said the charges against her were exaggerated but they are among the reasons given for her defeat in elections in 1977 The Chinese Government has said female infanticide stems from a feudal mentality and that those who practice it would be punished Mr Schultz said he was one of five advisers chosen by the United Nations Fund for Population Activities to help a committee of diplomats who chose the winners of the prize He appeared at a meeting in New York last March after studying the files of about 80 nominees he said The diplomats he said announced they would only consider heads of state or high officials for the prize which is given for the most outstanding contribution to the awareness of population questions None of the qualified nominees is a head of state or high public official Mr Shultz said in the interview The decision of the committee was totally selfserving As stateappointed members they decided to court the favor of those to whom they are beholden regardless of the excellent qualifications of other nominees UN Defends Awards Mr Salas the director of the United Nations Fund defended the awards in a telephone conversation from Tokyo He female infanticide is outlawed in China and its official policy is family planning He said Mr Schultzs charge that the harshness of this program encourages killing of female children is an inference Mr Salas acknowledged there were such accusations of forced sterilization in India under Mrs Gandhi in the past but added There is no such complaint in India today Mr Salas said his committee had limited its consideration for this years awards to public statesmen but he denied the judges had engaged in selfpromotion The chairman of the committee Anwarul Karim Chowdhury of Bangladesh declined to make any comment The other diplomats who served as judges came from Australia Mexico Yugoslavia Japan Egypt Burundi Colombia China and Tunisia
THE ANALYST AND HER ANALYSAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/24/books/the-analyst-and-her-analysand.html,AUGUST By Judith Rossner 376 pp Boston Houghton Mifflin Co 1595 LIKE Parisians shrinks leave town in August If theyre New York shrinks they flock to the Hamptons where for one brief month no patients interrupt their lives The patients meanwhile must fend for themselves Along with the shorter breaks at Christmas and Easter the recurrence of the August hiatus lends a rhythm to both sides of the psychoanalytic relationship Enduring it or delighting in it patient and analyst must somehow come to terms with August  the ritualized intrusion of time into the timeless world of the analytic session Judith Rossners new novel takes its title and form from this fact of psychoanalytic sociology Famous as a clinician of disordered minds  most memorably in Looking for Mr Goodbar and Emmeline  Mrs Rossner now turns her attention to the scene where disorders are supposed to get rectified In meticulous detail she narrates the fiveyear analysis of Dawn Henley by Dr Lulu Shinefeld the one a blond New England teenager the other a fortyish Jewish Manhattanite In the ordinary course of things two such different women would never meet but theres nothing ordinary about analysis and as the two women grow and change they make permanent marks on each others livesWalter Kendrick who teaches English at Fordham University is the author of The Novel Machine At the start of analysis with Lulu in July 1975 Dawn is a mess Fresh from a nearfatal car accident an abortion and four wasted years with a male analyst whom she still thinks a god she cries uncontrollably falls asleep without warning and vomits on Lulus kilim rug Her background is enough to give Freud or KrafftEbing pause Orphaned by 2 she was raised by Vera her fathers sister and Tony a lesbian couple whom she learned to call Daddy and Mommy respectively In school they tried to teach her that daddy went to work while mommy stayed home little Dawn insisted that in her household the reverse was true The uproar that followed gave her no chance to explain that both her parents were women Now Vera and Tony are divorced As an apparently direct result Dawn embarked on a series of suicidal disasters that brings her to Dr Shinefeld Lulu however isnt in much better shape Recently divorced from her second husband a psychoanalyst who had an affair with a 15yearold he met in a deli she has two prepubescent boys to take care of Then theres Sascha her 22yearold daughter by her first husband he abandoned Lulu while she was pregnant who ran away from home and hasnt been heard from in four years And Lulus mother dead from an overdose of sleeping pills And her father a confirmed alcoholic Little wonder that at her first August party Lulu gets drunk and goes home with the handsome young bartender AUGUST makes a promising start from these jumbled materials and follows through scrupulously Dawn whose dependence upon Lulu is at first so great that she becomes deeply depressed at the mere thought of August gradually comes under her own control and begins to investigate her birth parents whom she never knew Dawns father like his sister Vera was homosexual Dawn meets his last lover a Harvard professor still alive and flourishing in Provincetown Dawns mother never wanted a child it was the trauma of giving birth to Dawn that killed her In her sessions with Lulu Dawn learns to accommodate not only these new facts but also the old images and fears that have driven her to crazy behavior She discovers why a line from Dylan Thomas makes her panic and why sepia is the color of death In chapters that alternate with accounts of Dawns therapy sessions Lulu endures a rollercoasterish affair with another analyst Charles Herman and eventually gets reconciled sort of with the longabsent Sascha Her selfaccommodation is less drastic than Dawns less clearcut but their difference in age may account for that When the novel and her analysis end Dawn is 23 and setting out on marriage and a new life in Washington Lulu is 44 and still learning how to live well Its clear that for Dawn the hundreds of hours with Lulu have made it possible for her life to continue without them shed have killed herself long since Its less clear that Lulus life wouldnt have taken exactly the same course whether Dawn had entered it or not Five years may be responsible in both cases Analysis gives them to the patient but the doctor would have had them anyway August reeks of real life at least as its lived by certain people in a certain time and place Though the writing is sparse almost to deprivation it conveys a genuine feeling of East Hampton in August the Upper West Side all year round and the manners and mores of those who shuttle between them Most of the novel is dialogue for which Mrs Rossner cant be faulted The giveandtake of real conversation its hesitations repetitions and Freudian slips  all are reproduced with exact fidelity And except for the slightly lurid features of Dawns background none of the characters deeds deviates even slightly from the expected behavior of welltodo urban people in the late 1970s THE reader is warned in an Authors Note that It would be useful to remember that the psychoanalysis that takes place within this novel bears approximately the resemblance to a real analysis that the novel bears to life That resemblance has a PreRaphaelite quality Primary attention is given to exacting detail and the composition of the whole is of less significance Though there are condensations and summaries Dawns analysis is portrayed at greater length and with greater faithfulness than Ive ever seen in a novel before Dawn brings a cassette recorder to her first couple of sessions as a means of intimidating Lulu and reassuring herself she soon abandons it but Mrs Rossner seems to have picked it up The depiction of Dawns analysis  meandering monologues from her an occasional Tell me or What do you mean from Lulu  is so eerily authentic that it seems not to be fiction at all Mrs Rossner has conveyed the exact feel of analysis  its tensions and relaxations its insights achieved or evaded and also at times its longueurs August is absolutely true to its own design its a model of rigor and restraint even when it must take risks For example we never see Dawn except in her sessions with Lulu we see the characters who inhabit her life only as she describes them Theyre interesting people especially Vera and Tony  and one sometimes wishes that Dawn would shut up and let Mrs Rossner tells us their stories Its a sort of compliment to Mrs Rossners skill that she arouses such interest in characters who are never directly portrayed yet I occasionally felt frustrated Dawns journey of selfdiscovery has considerable suspense of its own but no 20yearold no matter how neurotic can consistently reward such intense sustained attention In Lulus chapters the risks and achievements are different Here Mrs Rossner takes the narrative into her own hands providing terse but pointed commentary on Lulus adventures And Lulu is a remarkably welldrawn character She has all the virtues and shortcomings that a woman of her background and station would have and her fiveyear progress as she passes the landmark age of 40 is portrayed with special delicacy Again however the risks are those of restraint Lulus narrator clearly knows more than she does but Lulu never gets the benefit of that wider knowledge When she makes mistakes  like getting involved with Charles Herman a selfserving jerk who doesnt deserve her  the reader wants to grab her shoulders and shake some sense into her The effect is sometimes annoying yet its another compliment to Mrs Rossner that she can make us just as impatient with Lulu as we might be if Lulu were real Appreciation of the almost photographic realism of August depends to some degree on the readers familiarity with the scenes and character types it describes I suspect that readers who have been in analysis will respond much more powerfully to the book than those who have not it also helps to know the Upper West Side and to have attended cookouts in the Hamptons At times the novel takes too much for granted We never learn for instance exactly what sort of analyst Lulu is where she belongs in the Byzantine hierarchy of her profession Shes not an MD but a clinical psychologist with a PhD and she sneers at the orthodoxy of her second husband for whom the Freudian prism had been a comfortable prison Yet Dawns analysis follows the ideal Freudian course complete with dream interpretations the heartbreak of penislessness and a remembered primal scene Aficionados of analysis will no doubt be able to place Lulu but I sometimes felt as if I were moving in a contextual vacuum Both Lulu and Dawn have spent nearly half their lives engaged with analysis yet the social political and moral implications of this consuming devotion are left for the reader to draw It may be that having chosen a potentially sensational subject Mrs Rossner resolved to render it serious by treating it in the most austerely documentary manner she could devise She has succeeded in that indeed the major complaint I have against August is that its too austere not sensational enough In the world of todays novels however that complaint turns into another compliment IN the last few years psychoanalysis has again become a hot topic for both novelists and journalists Now though the excitement no longer comes from the discovery that dreams have meaning or that therapy can yield insights Psychoanalysis has been solidly established in this country for two generations now the excitement comes from recognizing its farreaching effects on our lives and questioning the directions in which it has led us August is testimony to this new interest and a valuable contribution to it I know of no other account imagined or factual that gives such a vivid picture of the analytic experience on both sides of its intense troubled ambiguous relationship
"FOR DANES, 'PAPERLESS MARRIAGES' AND FEWER BIRTHS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/07/25/style/for-danes-paperless-marriages-and-fewer-births.html,Nete Wingender and Vilhelm Niemann are almost but not quite the archetypical young Danish couple They are Blond Unmarried The parents of a 3monthold child They are not strictly typical of course because most Danish couples are not blond But their approach to family life has become as Danish as apple Danish Arrangements outside marriage now represent the standard household unit for young collegeeducated couples like Miss Wingender and Mr Niemann Births from these relationships account for more than one out of every three births in Denmark today a figure three times the rate in France which has the secondhighest level of illegitimacy in the European Economic Community Hardly anyone we know is married says Mr Niemann 31 years old Everyone has entered what we call a paperless marriage  If one of our friends suddenly announced they were going to have a wedding ceremony it would be a sensation asserts Miss Wingender who had been married previously and divorced before she and Mr Niemann began living together in 1978 While it has become commonplace in Europe and the United States for young couples to live together the liaison usually becomes legalized before the birth of a child But here one out of three paperless marriages continues with or without children for longer than five years while the rest of the couples are more likely to end the relationship and start a new one than to marry While a majority of workingclass Danes continue to follow the traditional path to wedlock the divorce rate has doubled in recent years and the former partners are more likely to enter into a form of cohabitation than to remarry immediately according to Government research Cohabitation has no legal status in Denmark and carries no legal consequences no matter how long it may last Custody of offspring however can become an issue for the courts More troubling than illegitimacy to Danish demographers and economists is a decline in all births that has contributed to a minus 06 net population growth rate and has put Denmark in the forefront among rapidly aging populations This negative growth rate is exceeded in the European Economic Community only by West Germany with a 16 rate Because of contraception abortion and recession the number of babies born in Europe in 1981 was twothirds the number born in 1964 and the continents population is expected to grow by less than 3 percent by the end of the century compared with 13 percent for the United States and an explosive 37 percent for the world Most of the growth is expected in southern Europe and Ireland where the population is expected to rise by 20 percent over the next 16 years while the countries of northern Europe show low or negative growth Denmarks net population loss of 2000 a year that began in 1981 should increase according to projections to an annual net loss of 16000 after the turn of the century a significant drain in a small country of slightly more than five million Moreover this trend is coupled with a steady rise in life expectancy that foreshadows a time not so far away when everdecreasing numbers in the work force will be asked to support everincreasing numbers of elderly pensioners Denmark may be one of the first industrialized nations forced to work out a social and economic solution to that equation before it is addressed by other Western nations including the United States For the moment Government planners are waiting to see if a slight upturn in marriages in the past year or two heralds a higher birth rate Extensive Social Changes Scandinavia experienced the greatest expansion of social services combined with economic prosperity in all the West during the postwar decades and with this improved standard of living came educational advances and extensive social changes characterized particularly in Denmark and Sweden by a great influx of women into the work force At the end of the European baby boom in the early 1960s about 50 percent of married women in Denmark were working The share is now 80 percent Denmark leads the Common Market countries not only in the number of women working and in illegitimate births but also in abortion and divorce rates Women in the work force who were economically independent changed all perceptions and expectations of Danish society said Erik Manniche of the University of Copenhagens Institute of Sociology There was an emphasis placed on personal development rather than child raising he explained Even in a recession with more than 10 percent unemployment in Denmark the material side of life in Denmark has never been higher It is the opportunity of a lifetime to be young and unemployed Miss Wingender and Mr Niemann would prefer being employed although neither has held a job since leaving the university Both were trained as teachers and in Denmark with a negative growth rate teaching jobs are vanishing almost as fast as the traditional Danish family Our situation shows the Danish socialsecurity system works quite efficiently said Mr Niemann as he and Miss Wingender sunned themselves in the tranquillity of Orsteds Park in the center of Copenhagen the other day taking turns rocking their infant son in his carriage They receive the equivalent of 240 a week from the Government and they say they are fortunate to have a spacious apartment despite a fierce shortage of good housing in Copenhagen Their dream at the moment is for one of them to secure a teaching job elsewhere in Denmark because they say that Copenhagen with its traffic and noise is not an ideal place to raise their son We want to live near the sea and the woods said Miss Wingender rocking the baby carriage But it is only a dream Many of our friends are like us said Mr Niemann drawing on his pipe No job one child and a lot of dreams

HOUSE DEMOCRATS SHUNNING A VETO BATTLE WITH REAGAN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/03/us/house-democrats-shunning-a-veto-battle-with-reagan.html,Democratic leaders in the House of Representatives said today that they were trying to scale down spending bills to avoid a veto battle with President Reagan According to the leaders the White House is also showing a smaller appetite for a confrontation with Congress than earlier in the year As a result the President who vowed to cast a stream of vetoes against spending bills he considered excessive has yet to reject an appropriation bill passed in the current session of Congress Asked today if the Democratic leadership was consciously staying within spending limits set by the White House Thomas P ONeill Jr the House Speaker told reporters The answer is yes Theres no sense in sending things over there and having them vetoed To lawmakers in both parties Congressional Democrats are moderating their position out of concern that they will be labeled big spenders by Mr Reagan And the President in turn is moving toward the center because he wants to rebut the Democratic charge that he is unfair to the poor Movement on Both Sides Representative Thomas S Foley of Washington the Democratic whip summed up the situation today by saying There is a kind of movement on both sides to avoid unnecessary confrontations Tonight the House voted 381 to 35 to approve a threeyear revenuesharing bill that would return 502 billion a year to local governments down from 53 billion that was in the original House plan The Associated Press reported The final figure is still 450 million a year more than was sought by Mr Reagan The measure now goes to the Senate where the Finance Committee a month ago endorsed an extension that followed the Presidents recommendation Earlier today the sense of accommodation was demonstrated when the House adopted a conference report appropriating 109 billion for the Department of Transportation The final compromise was 368 million below the bill first passed by the House in June but House negotiators agreed to the lower figure to satisfy the Reagan Administration and Senate Republicans Representative William R Ratchford of Connecticut one of the Democratic conferees noted that while the overall spending level in the transportation bill squared with Administration demands the priorities established by Congress within the bill differed substantially from White House priorities In particular Congress allocated more money for mass transit and less for airports than Mr Reagan requested I thought it was important to get the bill signed Mr Ratchford said and I was satisfied with the priorities we were able to set Veto Threat Looms Large In addition the Appropriations Committee today discussed but did not vote on a spending bill covering the Treasury Department and Postal Service that has already been defeated once by the House The main reason for the defeat was a provision banning the use of Federal health insurance for abortions but the bill also drew the fire of conservatives who said it was too large The treasury and postal legislation has been trimmed back by 160 million since its defeat and one committee aide said I think the threat of a veto looms very large If Congress and the President do engage in a veto struggle the most likely issue will be spending for education Democrats feel strongly that Federal aid to education should be increased and they believe Mr Reagan has placed himself in a difficult position to veto a bill by stressing the education issue in recent weeks If a veto comes let it come said Mr Ratchford a member of the Appropriations Committee Then well see if the Administration is interested in rhetoric or in doing something for education Threat of Political Damage Probably the main reason for the Democrats sense of caution is their belief that a veto battle could be politically damaging One senior Democrat noted that according to polls taken for the party the big spender label was still the major negative for Democrats among voters Earlier in the year lawmakers in both parties were convinced that Mr Reagan was intent on vetoing legislation to enhance his own image as a foe of a freespending Congress But now they sense that he wants to fashion a more positive image for himself as a leader who advocates positive steps in such areas as education civil rights and more equity for women
KENNEDY CONCENTRATES ON THE SENATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/05/us/kennedy-concentrates-on-the-senate.html,The invitations still arrive one after the other day after day from automobile workers and public employee unions nuclear freeze organizations and health care groups In recent weeks state Democratic parties in Idaho Washington Oregon and Florida have sought him for the head table But eight months into his selfimposed exile from Democratic Presidential politics Senator Edward M Kennedy is turning down almost all speaking invitations Ive spoken at enough conventions and midterm conventions over the years the Massachusetts legislator said To show up at these things said Robert M Shrum one of the Senators closest aides would create the kind of impression that we dont want to create Senator Kennedy who for a dozen years was in the national political spotlight if not in front of a pack of other potential Democratic Presidential nominees is now somewhat reserved even a bit contemplative Having been rejected by his party in his struggle to wrest the nomination from President Carter in 1980 having announced his refusal to seek or accept the nomination in 1984 he is embarked on a new phase in his career Focusing on Washington Though he has appeared three times in recent months with the declared Presidential challengers he has repeatedly told his aides his colleagues and his supporters that at least for the moment the Senate will be his arena He seems to be trying to establish his political center of gravity in Washington rather than in state and local Democratic groups scattered around the country Hes always had more influence outside the chamber than inside the chamber a Senate colleague from New England said privately I think hes trying to change that This summer as the six declared Democratic candidates prepared to fly to state fairs and union conventions and to struggle with the constraints of their campaign budgets Mr Kennedys political energies were concentrated on his Fund for a Democratic Majority an effort to raise money to help the Democrats regain control of the Senate His staff moreover was drafting plans to have him visit an aircraft carrier a cruiser and a destroyer and to study some of the arcane details of the military budget He now sits on the Senate Armed Services Committee having concluded that military issues are going to be of increasing importance on Capitol Hill and he is one of the leaders of the nuclear freeze movement and the effort to halt deployment of the MX missile Yet for all his new concentration on events in Washington Mr Kennedy who is 51 years old remains the national symbol if not the spokesman of the liberal wing of the Democratic Party Some surveys show him more popular with the rank and file than Senator John Glenn or former Vice President Walter F Mondale Unanswered Questions But there also remains that large residue of voters who regard him warily some because of his strong identity with liberalism others because he is involved in divorce proceedings and has left hanging a number of unanswered questions about his private life And he is still a very irritating burr under the Republican saddle Even if he is not a Presidential candidate said Senator Orrin G Hatch a Utah Republican who has quarreled bitterly with Mr Kennedy over such issues as abortion and school prayer Ted Kennedy is the quintessential liberal in this country When the National Republican Senatorial Committee sent out a mass mailing last month for example it based its fundraising entreaty on the specter that if the Republicans lost their majority Ted Kennedy could control the Senate in 1984 It is still an alluring pitch Kennedy is the one Democrat clearly identifiable to Republicans said Senator Richard G Lugar of Indiana chairman of the committee The other Democrats have tried to mellow themselves or disappear but he has not He remains a symbol of why Republicans are Republicans The Pressures Off Him Mr Kennedys friends say his new career approach has left him less intense and more at ease both with his work in the Senate and with himself The pressures off him said Senator Paul E Tsongas his Democratic colleague from Massachusetts Its the same sort of ease you find around here from people who arent going to run for reelection The days now are filled with quiet briefings beginning at his Virginia home and continuing on his ride to the Capitol and the evenings often are occupied with meetings  a few cocktails with some guests perhaps but serious talk over dinner and later in the living room with scholars and Government experts about such topics as military preparedness reorganizing the Joint Chiefs of Staff and the military balance in Central America The sessions go on late into the night Right now its not for him to make much of a fuss said one aide He wants to learn about these things before he goes off and declares himself an expert Hes taking his time He hasnt done anything special and thats all for the good There was considerable skepticism in the warren of offices of the Senate Armed Services Committee when Mr Kennedy won his assignment there The Senator is regarded as something of a grandstander even by some of his aides and is hardly a natural partner to the committee chairman Senator John Tower a Texas Republican known for his quiet but strong support of the military Nor has he yet acquired the stature of some of the young Democrats on the committee who are regarded as serious students of military matters Won Praise for Diligence Kennedys style is to get ahold of a couple of issues said one of his aides Weve told him he can do that in a year or two Thus far Mr Kennedys contributions have been modest but he has won high marks for his diligence even from some of his detractors Hes used to grabbing a lot of press and not paying much attention but were surprised said one member of the committee staff Hes very active Hes there all the time His staff is working Senator Kennedy is repeatedly asked how he views his new career approach and his answer is almost always the same I am comfortable with my decision he said Ive never really secondguessed it People measure me against my brothers performance he continued in a rare personal reflection Its always been with me But I like to believe that during the time Ive been in the Senate that Ive made some contribution I take some satisfaction in that My brothers were very much their own people I like to think that Im my own man particularly now in this time in my life
STAGE: ESTELLE PARSONS IN 'ORGASMO ADULTO',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/05/theater/stage-estelle-parsons-in-orgasmo-adulto.html,DONT tell Estelle Parsons that biting political satire is all but extinct in the American theater With heroic persistence she is determined to contradict that fact In Orgasmo Adulto Escapes From the Zoo the actress spends almost five hours divided over two nights performing a cycle of largely satirical onewoman plays by the highly regarded leftist Italian husbandandwife team of Dario Fo and Franca Rame Its hard to imagine a more noble mission Its harder still to say that it pays off Miss Parsons works with enormous dedication and energy The plays are uncompromising in their convictions And yet we sit at the Publics Newman Theater with the sinking sensation that Orgasmo Adulto isnt provoking the laughter thought or outrage it intends Miss Parsons does four monodramas a night alternating a Program A and Program B On Tuesdays only she performs a selection from A and B Chineserestaurant style The concerns of all eight pieces are similar As the actress explains in a chatty relaxed prologue Orgasmo Adulto is an entertainment about the condition of women  or more specifically about how were all prisoners of the male organ The characters are usually oppressed wives and mothers who strike back as best they can at the male devil and the tail that this devil wears in front This is reasonable subject matter but the FoRame approach to it here seems limited and tired Most of the plays first performed by Miss Rame in Milan in 1977 express a dogmatic Freudian determinism reminiscent of Lina Wertmuller films like Swept Away and Seven Beauties The imagery of castration and excrement predominate as we continually witness the wages of male sexual aggression Worse Mr Fo and Miss Rame dont cloak this theme in the scabrous black humor that might rehabilitate it The mode is more often conventional and obvious farce typified by a gag in which a woman slams a door on her lovers most vulnerable appendage The other ideological aspects of Orgasmo Adulto are also primitively stated Unlike Caryl Churchill who finds novel ways to dramatize her connections between capitalism and male supremacy Mr Fo and Miss Rame give us a radicalized overlong slice of I Love Lucy slapstick in which a wife who has everything in the way of housekeeping appliances is literally a prisoner in her own home In another similar sketch that might be a reject from Chaplins Modern Times a woman wakes up with nightmares about her factory job frantically prepares for the days drudgery and then  in a meager punchline  discovers that it is Sunday The other big joke of this exercise  the harried wife keeps mixing up such household products as baby powder and grated cheese  is provided in three labored variations As was the case with the other Fo play thus far seen in New York We Wont Pay We Wont Pay its possible that something has been lost in the English adaptation Miss Parsonss own or in the staging attributed to the actress and Miss Rame Maybe too the distance separating Italys sociosexual landscape from ours is just too vast Miss Parsons tries to bridge that gap with asides  she equates Eurocommunists with her liberal friends on Central Park West  but too often American audiences may find themselves listening to unsophisticated lectures that dont travel well Such matters as a womans right to abortion or to a liberated role in lovemaking are melodramatically argued as if they were taboo topics never broached in a theater before In a similar manner simulated sex and scatological language are italicized constantly apparently on the rather sexist assumption that men will be startled to see a woman engage in such ostensibly male prerogatives Although Miss Parsons is an accomplished comedienne she doesnt often overcome the hectoring and at times maudlin tone of the writing Almost every character threatens suicide The materials repetitiveness can emerge as a deadening whininess the attempts to tap into the plays indigenous folkloric Italian roots are intermittent Yet Miss Parsons never stops trying to stretch herself There arent many actors who would bravely plunge right into the final events of Medea as is demanded by the reductivist 15minute version of the Euripides tragedy that concludes Program A In general Miss Parsonss outstanding turns occur in the few noncomic pieces  notably the pair that ends Program B Both of them are moral fables about women who have belatedly raised their consciousnesses As The Freak Mamma a wife who has left her husband and son to become a sort of politicized bag lady shes a pugnacious selfinvented crusader  a populist champion of justice riding a wave of rage that wont quit In Monologue of a Whore in a Lunatic Asylum the actress is a sweaty quivering blur of runny lipstick and frizzy red curls strapped in a chair to face an unseen interrogator The metamorphosis is complete and moving in spite of such rhetorical lines as Im not a whore because I want to be Even when Miss Parsons falls short her commitment both to her craft and to social change are unmistakable Though Orgasmo Adulto mainly arouses feelings of indifference it is informed paradoxically by an artistic impulse that is both passionate and rare Angry Prisoners ORGASMO ADULTO ESCAPES FROM THE ZOO a new English version of Tutta Casa Letto e Chiesa by Franca Rame and Dario Fo directed by Franca Rame and Estelle Parsons costumes by Ruth Morley lighting by Jennifer

Translated by Gerry Bothmer George Blecher and Lone Blecher Introduction by Gail Warshofsky Lapidus Illustrated 194 pp New York Pantheon Books Cloth 1695 Paper 795 IN 1969 the November issue of the wellknown Soviet magazine Novy Mir was held up by official censors while they decided what to do about a novel that was already set in type Problems with the censors were nothing new for the magazine which had published Aleksandr Solzhenitsyns One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich in 1962 and whose editor the late Aleksandr Tvardovsky continued to fight cultural restrictions as the political climate grew more repressive in the late 60s The only thing new was that the disputed piece of writing in 1969 did not deal with Stalinism or other wounds from the past but with everyday Russian domestic life  specifically the difficulties of being a working mother in a society with no reliable contraceptives almost no help from husbands with child care and housework and absolutely no official acknowledgement of the gap between the ideological lip service paid to sexual equality and the overburdened realities of womens lives When A Week Like Any Other by Natalya Baranskaya finally appeared with major cuts by the censors the issue of Novy Mir sold out immediately Moscow Women a collection of 13 interviews conducted in Moscow by two Russianspeaking writers for the Swedish broadcasting system does not pick up where that provocative novel left off Most of the women interviewed are too young to have read A Week Like Any Other when it was published and that issue of Novy Mir has been removed from the shelves of most Soviet libraries Moreover these interviews make it abundantly clear that the absence of any coherent sustained dialogue on womens issues is one of the major differences between sexual politics in the Soviet Union and in the West In fact most Russians  whether politically dissident or orthodox  would be baffled by the term sexual politics The Soviet political system is of course one of the main factors inhibiting a serious evaluation of the role of women Communist Party leaders are no more favorably disposed toward a womens movement than they are toward any unofficial movement However traditional Russian attitudes toward femininity  attitudes that are as Carola Hansson and Karin Liden note shared by both women and men  are equally important Most Russians and all of the women interviewed here subscribe to the notion of intrinsically different masculine and feminine natures with the range of feminine possibility defined in Tolstoyan terms Sweet Kitty dutiful Natasha and doomed Anna are the feminine prototypes there has never been a Nora in the mainstream of Russian literature Masha a 23year old mother and engineer defines femininity as delicacy a little mystery an ability to bring out the attractive qualities within oneself and to hide the bad ones A woman mustnt lose her temper And of course she has to take care of her appearance    As a mother a woman    ought to put her child before herself These interviews suggest that Russian women face two distinct dilemmas One is the familiar problem of combining child rearing with a job  a problem exacerbated by a dearth of consumer products and services ranging from dry cleaners to babysitting agencies The other is that Russian women do not have access to effective contraceptives Abortion performed without anesthetic in a manner many Russian women see as punishment for sexual sins is the main means of birth control Birth control pills are rarely available and when they are many Russian women wont use them because they believe abortions are safer Diaphragms come in only two sizes and are therefore regarded as totally unreliable The lack of information about contraception is revealed in an interview with Sonya a 23 yearold housewife who has clearly confused birth control pills with thalidomide No I never wanted to use the pill It contains hormones and I think it must be harmful I read that a pharmaceutical firm in West Germany    sold pills that caused dreadful birth defects and a lot of disfigured babies were the result without arms and legs I would never even consider taking the pill Much of the information presented in these interviews has already appeared in news reports from Moscow but the voices of individual women revealing their fear and fatalism about their destinies are new Most foreign correspondents in Russia are men and few Russian women would be willing to discuss their intimate lives with any man let alone a foreigner When male correspondents write about women in the Soviet Union their information is likely to have come from their wives conversations with Russian women Moscow Women should have been titled Young Moscow Women because nine of the 13 interviews are with women in their early 20s Their views on sex and childbearing are similar to those expressed by many women of different ages whom I knew in Moscow but their grasp of other subjects  literature economics history  seems woefully limited by their age This deficiency may be as much a fault of the interviewers who seem to have limited themselves to conventional womens issues as it is of the Russian women themselves It is ironic that these liberated Western women did not find it worthwhile to ask the Russian women what they thought about their country Nevertheless the Russian voices in Moscow Women make a useful contribution to Western knowledge of an understudied aspect of Soviet life
TV VIEW; ON BALANCING FILMMAKING AND NEWS JOURNALISM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/07/arts/tv-view-on-balancing-filmmaking-and-news-journalism.html,The documentary is a news form the documentary is an art form too It is also a creature of television The networks however honor documentaries more by applauding them in the abstract than by allowing talented people in their news departments to go out and make them It is public television that is now and has been for some time the documentarys home No one is keeping an accurate count but a fair estimate is that public television presents some 100 documentaries each season which is rather more than the networks combined This season beginning in January public television gave us the weekly series Frontline 26 onehour documentaries that purported to examine the great issues of our time In fact they didnt always examine great issues and sometimes they didnt examine anything at all When Frontline was good it was very good and when it was bad it was terrible When it was good it married news and art when it was bad it forgot about news and indulged itself in art Filmmaking took precedence over journalism Old verities about how you tell a news story were forgotten The narrative was all and it imposed its own rules For example in its opening program of the season The Unauthorized History of the NFL Frontline alleged connections between bigtime gamblers and professional football It also suggested that Carroll Rosenbloom the owner of the Los Angeles Rams had been murdered The program was widely criticized as shoddy journalism although scarcely anyone said it was boring As a film it was exciting It was particularly exciting when one gambler said he had fixed a number of games in the late 60s although he did not mention which games he had fixed Later it was disclosed that Frontline had paid him and two other gamblers for their appearances I was suprised we had to pay so little the producer of the segment was quoted as saying In effect Frontline was hiring performers This critics own nomination for the least sound Frontline of the season was Gods Banker which investigated the death of Roberto Calvi the president of Italys largest private bank In one sequence an author in Milan said that an Italian magistrate one day before he was murdered had told him about an unwholesome payoff involving Mr Calvi and the Archbishop who was the head of the Vatican bank The author in Milan said the magistrate had told him that the source of his information was Michele Sindona the Italian financier Again this was exciting stuff a dead magistrate and a scandalous connection between Mr Calvi Frontline suggested that he had been murdered too and the Vatican Minutes later however Mr Sindona was interviewed in prison He spoke freely about this and that but he was never asked about what he supposedly had said to the murdered magistrate One assumes he was not asked because if he denied that he had said something the denial would have got in the way of the film Gods Banker was full of reporting like that Gods Banker originally appeared on the BBC making a persuasive case that British exports to public television ought to be restricted to Masterpiece Theater Klaus Barbie The American Connection another BBCFrontline production strengthened the case It indicted former American intelligence agents for buying information from and even protecting a Gestapo murderer Granted that the Klaus Barbie case is particularly repugnant The show never produced evidence that the agents it indicted knew about the atrocities Klaus Barbie had committed In fact it inadvertently produced evidence to the contrary which it then ignored What mattered most to the filmmakers was their own high moral tone They were infinitely more interested in expressing their point of view than in substantiating it Something similar happened in The Money Lenders a documentary about the international banking system It said that in Brazil and Mexico the rich got richer by siphoning off money that ought to help the poor To show this there was footage of the rich disporting themselves while the poor suffered Simultaneously the documentary argued that the International Monetary Fund shouldnt put restrictions on how Brazil and Mexico borrowed money because if it did their economies would be crippled and the poor would suffer even more Granted that the I M F is a hard institution to love it is still a contradiction to argue that the fund shouldnt curtail a system that benefits the rich because if it does it will hurt the poor On the other hand the argument is a morally satisfying one to make The filmmakers get some nifty footage and still come down on the side of goodness  against the oligarchies sympathetic to the poor None of this is to suggest that Frontline did not produce some excellent journalism It did  on the murder of five Communists by Ku Klux Klansmen in Greensboro N C on the effect of cutbacks in the Federal budget on Social Security recipients on the District of Columbias government on Pentagon spending and other things And none of this is to suggest either that a sensibility shaped by filmmakers not journalists cannot lead to splendid documentaries Indeed Frontlines finest moments had nothing to do with conventional journalism at all And they were undeniably the work of filmmakers There was for example Carol Langers Children of Pride an extraordinarily moving documentary about a man and his 18 adopted children most of them handicapped physically or emotionally or both There was also Mark Obenhauss Abortion Clinic a stunning work that almost justified the whole season It even had a point of view This involved neither freedom of choice nor anti abortion even though both sides in the debate could find something in the documentary to seize on The point of view was simply the solemnity of abortion and in expressing it the filmmaker made a gripping even painful film Whether it was important journalism is beside the point the point is it proved a filmmaker can practice his craft wonderfully well and still not betray journalism Frontline one hopes will blend good journalism and provocative filmmaking more often next season
A NEW SITUATION IN ADOPTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/08/style/a-new-situation-in-adoption.html,With two young boys to bring up and jobs that barely covered the monthly bills Dan and Brenda were much like any other married couple struggling to get by But after Brenda became pregnant again this year she and her husband made a painful and unusual decision They plan to give their baby up for adoption You ask yourself do you love it enough to give it what it absolutely has to have Brenda said her voice quavering A native of Ohio she is 22 years old and 8 months pregnant Its going to have plenty of love and its going to have clothes and food and a place to live she went on Were having trouble providing that for the kids we have now Dan and Brenda like other parents interviewed asked not to be identified Adoption agencies and lawyers in various parts of the country report that a small number of married couples are giving their babies up for adoption A few say the practice has been increasing in recent years at least partly because of hard economic times They say the babies are generally the result of unplanned pregnancies and are carried to term by women who do not believe in abortion Chance to Get on Our Feet By giving the child up it gives us a chance to get on our feet explained Dan who is 35 He has temporarily left his job as a siding salesman in the West to accompany his wife to Little Rock Ark where several months of their living and medical expenses are being paid by the couple who will adopt their baby in an arrangement made through a lawyer If we kept the baby it would be a matter of us trying to survive on welfare he said We couldnt give her or him what we want to The people I met are super he said of the adoptive couple Theyve got their own home and everything They can give the baby what I couldnt Richard Dietz director of the adoption program of the Arkansas Division of Social Services said financial assistance from adoptive couples which can amount to thousands of dollars might act as an inducement to poor women to surrender their infants His agency has sought a state law that would require all those arranging adoptions to be licensed Arkansas like New York allows doctors and lawyers to arrange adoptions without the approval of a state agency though court authorization is required to make the adoption legal Criticism of the Process The whole process of advertising for babies and arranging adoptions independently is deplored by William Pierce executive director of the National Committee for Adoption an association of agencies He calls it baby brokering Discussing the role of married couples in adoptions Stanley Michelman a New York lawyer whom Dan and Brenda sought out said Ive seen twice as many married couples this year as in the past He estimated the number at 15 to 20 In Santa Monica Calif Karen Lane said that during the last two years of law practice she encountered fewer than 20 married couples among the 100 to 150 people relinquishing babies for adoption In all cases except one they already have a young child they can barely take care of and they dont want to take from one mouth and give to another she said While there is no central source that records statistics on who gives up children for adoption officials of national associations say they have seen the number of married couples increasing for several years Elizabeth Cole of the Child Welfare League of America whose member agencies primarily serve whites said she began noticing such couples coming in about five years ago Many of them were not the typical disorganized poor client who cant cope she said These people seemed put together But if theyd kept the child they would have had less money than they wanted These people also didnt want to give that much emotionally to a child It really is a fairly wise thing to do They might have bruised the child emotionally if not physically Mrs Cole believes the state of the economy has played a role The economy is frightening people she said Theyre uncertain about their futures Jean Price director of social services for the Childrens Home Society of Florida the states largest private statewide adoption agency has noticed some movement in the last two years toward the surrendering of newborns by married couples Of the 400 children the society places each year 10 to 20 infants now come from such couples The economy is one factor she said I think there are other factors too Maybe theyve had all they can parent Richard Pancost executive director of the Childrens Home Society of California said he had noticed that a few more married couples in his state were giving children up for adoption So did Nadine Harris Clark director of adoption services for Lutheran Social Services of Illinois who discerned marital problems arising from a lack of money as a reason An official at the New York State Department of Social Services said no statistics on married couples and adoption were available for New York Officials of private adoption agencies in New York City said they rarely encountered married couples who planned to have their babies adopted Dan and Brenda lost an infant to crib death at Christmas a year ago and are afraid of enduring such a tragedy again They take comfort they say from knowing that the child they are relinquishing will fulfill the dreams of a couple who have been unable to have children But the choice is not easy to make or to live with women who have been through it report I cried a whole lot afterwards said Jean 25 who gave up a son in February There was an empty space in my life It was her second child by the man she has lived with for eight years The couple who adopted her child are Jewish Jean said and with the help of her social worker she is drafting a letter to be given to him on the day of his bar mitzvah when he becomes a man She said I want him to know he was conceived in love and to understand why I had to give him up I was destitute Cost Can Rise to 15000 While she is glad that she was able to make another couple happy she worried about explaining to an older son why she gave his little brother away Jean answered an advertisement placed in an Arkansas newspaper by clients of Mr Michelman With money from the adoptive couple Mr Michelman paid her rent for four months as well as all her medical bills and gave her 70 a week for food utilities and miscellaneous expenses With legal fees the bill for the adoptive couple came to several thousand dollars Mr Michelman who encourages couples seeking babies to advertise said expenses could range up to 15000 In criticizing such a practice Mr Pierce of the National Committee for Adoption which consists of 121 adoption agencies said that considering that there are at least a million infertile couples and that only 50000 infants were adopted last year people can resort to desperate tactics A Baby Is Not a Commodity Whats going on is baby brokering he charged A baby is not a commodity The couples who place the ads arent screened for the things we look at  their age health the stability of the marriage The ad is the perfect way to insure that a vulnerable person is put in touch with a couple with money and a lawyer whose interest is not the baby but the client with money One reason Arkansas officials wanted to exert more control is that they felt that biological mothers were not given enough counseling before relinquishing their infants according to Mr Dietz He said there were cases where biological mothers had not thought about how they could keep their children and had not been told that they had 10 days after birth to withdraw their consent In some instances legal action to get babies back from adoptive couples has been contemplated Dan insists that he and his wife are going to surrender their baby Its better for ourselves and the child he said His wife said In a way youre happy making someone else happy But its sad too Youre giving up a part of yourself
'THE FETUS LOST IN THE LABYRINTHINE WAYS OF THE LAW',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/opinion/l-the-fetus-lost-in-the-labyrinthine-ways-of-the-law-090559.html,To the Editor An uneasy calm has settled over the abortion scene An antiabortion constitutional amendment lies stillborn in the Senate and the Supreme Court has emphatically reaffirmed and even expanded upon the position it staked out 10 years ago in Roe v Wade  that for the first twothirds of a pregnancy the incipient mother is free to dispose of the fetus as though it were a wart or some other such obnoxious excrescence A majority of the present Court has agreed with the Roe v Wade Court that up until the final trimester abortion is to be regarded as just another surgical procedure To regard the destruction of the fetus as just another surgical procedure is to disregard centuries of criminology theology and moral philosophy It is not so much that I disagree with the Courts abortion decisions  what is suggested is that the Court should not have decided them at all The approach taken by the Court in these cases is in the best tradition of legal formalism An examination of the text of the Constitution persuades the Court that a fetus is not a person and so is not worthy of the protections of the 14th Amendment Next evading the question of when life begins the Court neatly calibrates the value of the fetus by dividing its time in the womb into roughly three equal periods Then employing what is called the compelling interest test it decrees that only during the final trimester can the mother have any restrictions placed upon her as regards the fetus Such quaint legal formalism is entirely appropriate to the judicial resolution of property and inheritance matters It is wildly inappropriate in the abortion context where so many complex extrajudicial theories coalesce The Court itself has long recognized that there are some matters that are beyond judicial cognizance One of these is where there are no judicially manageable standards to guide the Court in its decision At one time legislative redistricting was found to fall in this category Clearly the abortion question is a classic example of a situation where the only judicial standards available are artificial informed by a legal formalism that is simply not up to the task The courts should step aside Someone has said that the purest example of true democracy in action is the lynch mob In our constitutional democracy the Supreme Court has enjoyed its finest hour when it has served as an antimajoritarian counterforce to the excesses of democracy Tragically where the fetus is concerned it has abandoned its role of protecting the politically powerless The people through their elected local representatives should be given the nonreviewable power to allocate the relative rights of the fetus and the mother Much as the self in Walker Percys recent book is Lost in the Cosmos so is the fetus lost in the labyrinthine ways of the law BILLUPS P PERCY Professor of Law Tulane University New Orleans July 29 1983
"POLITICS; THIS YEAR, THE PARTY POLITICAL CHIEFS ARE WOMEN",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/10/us/politics-this-year-the-party-political-chiefs-are-women.html,As the Republican and Democratic National Committees gear up for the 1984 Presidential election they will both enter the contest for the first time with women as political directors But there the similarities end Linden H Kettlewell a 30yearold lawyer from Texas who was appointed last month as political director of the Republican National Committee and Ann F Lewis a 45yearold political organizer who was selected two and a half years ago to head the political division of the Democratic National Committee see their roles in entirely different lights Mrs Lewis had never met the chairman of the Democratic National Committee Charles T Manatt when he took over the shambles of the party in the aftermath of the 1980 election A founding organizer of the National Womens Political Caucus former administrative aide to Representatives Barbara A Mikulski Democrat of Maryland and Stanley Lundine Democrat of New York Mrs Lewis said she had applied for the job of political director at the suggestion of a number of Democratic women They didnt think Id get it but they thought the party would owe us one that I could become a bargaining chip said Mrs Lewis who is the sister of Representative Barney Frank Democrat of Massachusetts The assumption was that given the way Washington works the job would go to someone Chuck Manatt knew all his life The fact I was considered was because women had grown in power I am the first woman to serve on the senior staff or a political staff of either party Mrs Lewis said that as a woman in a prominent party post she carried a responsibility to other women and that meant capitalizing on the growing tendency of women to vote Democratic sometimes called the gender gap for the Democrats By any standard she added the job of a political technician like myself is to make the most of this And not only to win elections but to form a government of all the people A Combination of Roles If we win because of women and minorities she said referring to the Presidential election well have to make sure the Government reflects it An avowed feminist and mother of three Mrs Lewis is considered by party officials and other political professionals to have savvy political instincts She says she combines the roles of advocate and technician and hence spends a good deal of time speaking around the country on the genesis of the gender gap and in training sessions for local party officials She noted that several polls published in the spring showed that the entire margins of former Vice President Walter F Mondale and Senator John Glenn over President Reagan were made up of women Women and womens issues have to be an important part of the campaign and more than just appointments she continued The Administration has given a bad name to appointing women Women are looking at a broader spread of issues particularly economic equity The Problem of Money Mrs Lewis said that one of her chief tasks is to make sure that there is a womans component in every facet of the Democratic Party including the training of candidates party building at state and local levels and campaign services But one of the largest problems she added is a lack of money both for the political division and for female candidates Mrs Lewis whose salary is 55000 has an annual budget of about 1 million and a staff of eight Women in the Democratic Party Mrs Lewis says have a much more difficult time putting together a successful candidacy than do men because they do not have the original contacts They are least likely to have access to large early donors in the beginning she said The toughest challenge we face is to be of assistance to women candidates financially Last year a special fund for female candidates named after Eleanor Roosevelt was created at the committee and 50 women in the party received 1000 each In many cases those were the only funds they received from party sources Mrs Lewis said It troubles me that the assumption is made that Im a token said Mrs Kettlewell as she sat at the desk vacated by her predecessor Richard N Bond because I dont think that is the way the party works or the way the chairman Frank Fahrenkopf works Despite the drumbeat of complaints from womens organizations and from Republican legislators who are women about the record of the Reagan Administration on issues ranging from economics to abortion Mrs Kettlewell believes that almost all is well with the Republican Party and with female voters The growing trend among women to vote for Democrats over Republicans could be stopped she contends if the record was explained Its a perception problem she said The White House and the Republican Party have the responsibility to explain the initiatives Mrs Kettlewell cited the drop in inflation and the lowering of mortgage rates as factors that should convince women that the Administration was working in their interest When she came to the capital two years ago as an aide to Senator Paul Laxalt the Nevada Republican who now is also the general chairman of the Republican Party Mrs Kettlewell had never lived east of the Mississippi She grew up in rural western Texas in a family where volunteering in political campaigns was part of the household routine A Move to Nevada In 1976 she was the Texas state youth coordinator for Gerald R Ford in the primary against Ronald Reagan which Mr Reagan won The following year she became the executive director of the Texas Republican County Chairmans Association and in 1978 moved to Reno to take the post of executive director of the Nevada Republican Party There she met Frank J Fahrenkopf Jr then chairman of the state party and now chairman of the Republican National Committee When Mr Fahrenkopf assumed leadership of the party committee at the beginning of the year he invited Mrs Kettlewell to leave her job as legislative director for Senator John Tower of Texas and work as his counselor She says it is not her role to be an advocate for policy positions within the party Asked whether she thought the President should support the Economic Equity Act which deals with sex discrimination in insurance taxes and retirement matters and with the enforcement of child support laws Mrs Kettlewell replied As the political director of this committee I dont have to satisfy questions about why he is not supporting the Economic Equity Act I am neither a policy enforcer or a policy writer I am a political technician Mrs Kettlewell described herself as a strict constitutionalist and said she never supported passage of the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution which until 1980 was contained in the Republican Party platform I had some questions about an amendment as broad as that one she said Personal Stand Against Abortion Reared as a Roman Catholic Mrs Kettlewell says she is opposed to abortion I hold that as a personal stand she said I dont think it has anything to do with the job Im in The Republican National Committees political division has a staff of 130 people and from April to December of this year will operate on a budget of 69 million according to Mrs Kettlewell whose salary is 50000 Her chief task Mrs Kettlewell believes is to turn the party back to grassroots politicking Weve neglected the grass roots thinking that technology can over overcome grassroots organization she said You dont build a party from Congress up or the White House down but from the courthouse up Every time you elect a county judge you make it much more likely that youre going to elect a state legislator or a congressman or a President Another of her chores she said is to recruit more women as candidates Not because of the hue and cry about the gender gap she added but because theyre qualified and give a different

HISPANIC LEADERS SEEK TO MOLD A VOTING BLOC FOR 1984,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/11/us/hispanic-leaders-seek-to-mold-a-voting-bloc-for-1984.html,Both the Republican and Democratic parties are making major efforts to woo votes of Hispanic Americans whose growing numbers and new political sophistication are giving them political power on a scale they have not known in two centuries of American democracy President Reagans scheduled speech this Saturday in El Paso before a Hispanic American veterans group the American GI Forum provides dramatic evidence of this It comes only four days after 200 MexicanAmerican Puerto Rican and other Hispanic leaders gathered here this week in San Antonio to map strategy to register one million more of their people to vote before the 1984 Presidential election They were addressed by such national leaders as Vice President Bush for the Republicans and Senator Edward M Kennedy of Massachusetts for the Democrats While Democrats have long had the bulk of Hispanic support new survey evidencestrongly suggests that Republicans have a chance of eating into that margin as affluence and class distinctions among Hispanic citizens grow The more sophisticated of their leaders are attempting to use this division to wring commitments from both major parties arguing that Hispanic voters may provide the swing vote in a close election The Republicans are right  they do have an opportunity to cut dramatically into the MexicanAmerican vote said William C Valasquez executive director of the Southwest Voter Registration Education Project sponsor of the new national campaign launched here They could do that by responding better to Hispanic needs he said adding Absent that the vote will go 90 percent Democratic New Element in Equation The emergence of the Hispanic minority as a potent political force in the Southwest Northeast Florida and parts of the Middle West has introduced a new and complex element into the political equation The term Hispanic is a vague one that includes many groups with a common Spanish heritage but with local and national interests that are often very divergent By far the largest about 60 percent are of Mexican origin Puerto Ricans make up about 20 percent and the prodominantly Republican Cubans about 10 percent with various Central and South American nationalities accounting for the rest What makes these numbers particularly difficult to assess is that large numbers of these groups except for the Puerto Ricans are not American citizens and therefore are ineligible to vote This weeks meeting was an attempt to bury their differences and stress their commonality as a deprived minority We are beginning to work together said Millie Torres chairman of the National Puerto Rican Coalition This conference is evidence of a new level of political maturity among major Hispanic groups The MexicanAmericans or Chicanos do not fit well into the usual liberalconservative axis that some people use to American politics according to polls conducted by Rodolfo O de la Garza a political scientist who directs the Center for Mexican American Studies at the University of Texas at Austin He said they tended to be conservative on such issues as abortion and school prayer and sharply divided on gun control but liberal on such matters as spending for education and other social programs and on foreign policy Moreover his polls show they tend to be more conservative on the issues than their leaders They are not a natural constituency for Republicans but the new socially mobile MexicanAmericans seem to be leaning in that direction said Professor de la Garza This is very important because if there is mobility it has real implications for the Democratic Party They will have to do something to hold onto them Degree of Power Uncertain Just how much new power Hispanic voters have is uncertain The growth in their numbers has been exaggerated by leaders of this conference and others by widespread misinterpretion of the 1980 Census That census defined Hispanic in a different way from previous surveys making comparisons with 1970 impossible The 1980 Census count put the Hispanic population of voting age at 82 million but this is difficult to interpret because an uncertain number onethird according to conference officials were not citizens It is unclear how many if any illegal aliens are fraudently registered to vote Historically Hispanic people have not voted in large numbers but those who have have generally voted for the Democrats by about 3to1 It is uncertain what percentage of Hispanic Americans are registered today with the figure varying from 40 percent or less to 62 percent depending on how one estimates the number of citizens Nevertheless it is clear that Hispanic influence has grown if only from the growing number of Hispanic mayors Congressmen and state legislators The leadership hopes to increase registration from 34 million in 1980 to 44 million next year adding 200000 in New York 400000 in California 201000 in Texas 40000 in Florida and 35000 in Illinois The hands that historically have picked the lettuce in this country and the hands that historically have picked the cotton in this country are the hands that can pick the next President of this country Gov Toney Anaya of New Mexico a Democrat told the gathering here Unanswered Questions Whether the leaderhip can turn out the vote and achieve this remains to be seen Nor is it obvious that the group will vote as a bloc Still despite the difference between Chicanos and Puerto Ricans they have one thing in common according to Jake I Alarid vice chairman of the American GI Forum He said Our community has long been neglected by local state and Federal governments and by the private sector Despite the unity at the meeting leaders concede there are differences among Hispanic groups Indeed such internal differences emerged in polls of MexicanAmericans in San Antonio and East Los Angeles and among Texas MexicanAmerican leaders conducted by Professor de la Garza and his colleague Robert R Brischetto There was considerable unanimity on such local issues as bilingual education But the average Hispanic person was much more likely to cite inflation rather than unemployment as the major problem facing the country than the leadership In addition support for President Reagan and the Republicans differed substantially according to education income and sex For example Hispanic people with a college education were twice as likely 38 percent to 19 percent to approve of the way Mr Reagan was handling his job although the majority 53 percent still disapproved Conversely Hispanic women were less likely to approve of Mr Reagan disclosing a gender gap similar to that observed nationally Other studies have shown Hispanic people to be divided over immigration issues though most  save the Cubans  oppose the Administrations Central American policies Professor de la Garza said that an incipient but increasing class distinction may mean that a lot of younger better educated Hispanic voters who are already registered will tend to vote Republican But newly enrolled voters he went on are likely to be less affluent and therefore more likely to vote Democratic All of this suggests that Mr Brischetto said If you are looking to appeal to MexicanAmericans as an ideologically singular group you are fooling yourself
CUOMO SELECTS FIRST WOMAN FOR HIGH COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/12/nyregion/cuomo-selects-first-woman-for-high-court.html,Judith S Kaye a partner in a Manhattan law firm and vice president of the Legal Aid Society was nominated by Governor Cuomo yesterday to be the first woman to serve as a judge on the states highest court The appointment of Mrs Kaye to the Court of Appeals is subject to confirmation by the State Senate At a news conference in his office at the World Trade Center Mr Cuomo praised Mrs Kayes extraordinary qualifications and called her a a lawyer of unusual ability integrity and determination Referring to the absence of a woman on the court he said In addition to adding excellence to the court the appointment of Judith Kaye erases a stigma it has borne for too long a time No Experience as a Judge Mrs Kaye a partner at the firm of Olwine Connelly Chase ODonnell  Weyher has never been a judge Mr Cuomo said this would not be a handicap and noted that several Court of Appeals judges had not previously served on the bench including Adrian P Burke for whom he once was clerk Like other great Court of Appeals judges who came to the bench directly from the practice of law he said her daytoday life as an advocate has demonstrated the character temperament capacity for collegial activity and ability to articulate that are essential Mrs Kaye said she felt both inexplicably superb and engulfed by a sense of great responsibility when informed of her nomination yesterday morning I would hope she said that I will continue the tradition of excellence of the Court of Appeals Mrs Kaye 45 years old would succeed Judge Jacob D Fuchsberg who resigned last month shortly in advance of his mandatory retirement Mrs Kaye like Judge Fuchsberg is regarded as a liberal and her ascension to the bench would not be expected to alter the courts ideological balance She declined at the news conference yesterday to characterize her judicial philosophy or to state her positions on such issues as the death penalty or abortion Above all my philosophy if any would be to be a fair reasoned and impartial person attempting to render a just result in each case that comes before me she said Under the states Constitution the State Senate must act on her nomination within 30 days Specialized in Commercial Law Mrs Kaye who was born in Monticello NY graduated from Barnard College and New York University Law School Her specialty is commercial litigation which she first practiced as an associate at the Wall Street firm of Sullivan  Cromwell and more recently as the only woman partner at the 70member Olwein Connelly firm In addition to her law practice Mrs Kaye has served as vice president and director of the Legal Aid Society and is a member of the executive committee of the New York City Bar Association She is also vice chairman of the Clients Security Fund of New York which reimburses clients for losses suffered at the hands of unscrupulous lawyers Governor Cuomo had pledged to appoint a woman to an Appeals Court judgeship which pays 80892 a year and has a 14year term A record number of women including many leading judges and lawyers applied for the post At least 15 were interviewed by the Commission for Judicial Nomination which by state law selects candidates for court posts The Governor chose Mrs Kaye from a list of seven candidates two of whom were women The panels other recommendations were Betty Weinberg Ellerin deputy chief administrative judge for New York City Bertram R Gelfand the Bronx County surrogate Judge Stewart F Hancock Jr of the Appellate Division Fourth Department Judge Leon D Lazer of the Appellate Division Second Department Judge Joseph P Sullivan of the Appellate Division First Department and Judge Abraham D Sofaer of Federal District Court in Manhattan Earlier this month the Womens Bar Association of the State of New York representing 2000 women who are lawyers recommended Judge Ellerin for the court post but declined to endorse Mrs Kaye One of those who had reviewed Mrs Kayes credentials said the association had found that Mrs Kaye was weak in the areas of matrimonial and criminal law and that she had practiced primarily in Federal rather than state courts Judge Ellerin whom the womens bar group recommended highly had served on its board of directors and was a past president of its New York City chapter Mrs Kaye is not a member All seven candidates were found well qualified by a State Bar Association panel Other Views Are Sought Before selecting Mrs Kaye Mr Cuomo and his staff sought the views of many practicing attorneys and former members of the Court of Appeals including Charles D Breitel Stanley Fuld and Domenick J Gabrielli The Governor said that Mrs Kaye was overwhelmingly endorsed by people whose judgment I have great great respect for In a statement issued yesterday Marjorie Karowe the president of the womens bar group called the Governors decision unfortunate We do however extend our best wishes and our support to Mrs Kaye and hope she will prove to be a distinguished member of the bench Mrs Karowe continued Louis A Craco president of the City Bar Association called Mrs Kaye a lawyer of real excellence who has repeatedly demonstrated in practice her belief that the law should be a helping profession for all people Lawrence H Cooke the Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals said the nomination marked a milestone in the history of the court Its important to have the perspective of a woman on the bench he said and its going to be thrilling to have a woman of her capabilities The vacancy created by Judge Fuchsbergs resignation is the second filled by Mr Cuomo Earlier this year he named Richard D Simons to succeed Judge Gabrielli who reached mandatory retirement

FACING THE 'GENDER GAP' WITH CONFLICTING ADVICE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/16/us/facing-the-gender-gap-with-conflicting-advice.html,At the White House a fierce debate surrounds President Reagans recent steps to address feminist issues The debate is under way because there is no agreement over why Mr Reagan continues to fare so poorly among female voters Consider the following arguments  Some Reagan aides view the recession as the primary cause of erosion in Mr Reagans support among women These aides maintain that once unemployment falls women will support Mr Reagan in greater numbers In the meantime these officials want Mr Reagan to emphasize to womens groups his success in bringing down inflation  Other officials disagreeing sharply say that budget cuts in food stamps Social Security and other programs have fallen heavily on women and that Mr Reagan must respond with new programs Thus the President is being advised to push harder for changes in pension laws tax benefits for child care and other programs affecting women  Still other officials say that programs and policies are secondary to the fact that Mr Reagan suffers from a generalized macho image that women dont seem to like They think he should soften his image by meeting more with women particularly working women and appointing more women to Government posts  A final theory accepted by many at the White House attributes the disparity in Mr Reagans support between male and female voters the so called gender gap to heightened fears among women that Mr Reagan is risking war in Central America and elsewhere Here Mr Reagan is being advised to temper his display of firmness with assurances that he is trying to avoid war In fact Mr Reagan is doing all these things and as one woman who holds top Administration position put it There has been a lot of flailing about with no clear unified strategy  no wonder it doesnt seem to be working Problems Are Not Simple Gender gap is the term for a trend that has turned up in virtually all polls The New York TimesCBS News Poll of June 2024 for example showed a 24point gap between Republican men and women on whether Mr Reagan deserves to be reelected Basically the gender gap is as serious for us as its ever been said another official reviewing Mr Reagans recent speeches and actions on womens issues Weve done a lot of analysis of our political problems on women and theyre not simple Theyre going to take time to deal with Many womens groups believe that Mr Reagans strategy not only lacks coherence but overlooks two other issues they feel have led to disenchantment among female voters his opposition to abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution Although women feel strongly about abortion many of them arent aware of how Reagan is trying to take away their rights said Kathy Wilson chairman of the National Womens Political Caucus So were going to be publicizing that fact in the months ahead At the White House there is a feeling that neither abortion nor the proposed amendment are factors in Mr Reagans problems But there is also widespread agreement that Administration efforts to deal with women have been fitful at best Lists but Little Change Many officials complain that the President has been diverted by insubstantial enterprises such as the Fifty States Project That project compiled lists of laws and practices that discriminate against women and recommended changes on a state level but the changes themselves have been slow In addition a Task Force on Legal Equity has compiled lists of discriminatory regulations and laws on the Federal level but most are innocuous references to the male gender A group of major legislative changes has yet to be enacted Last year a coordinating committee on womens issues met periodically at the White House but it was disbanded after its chairman Elizabeth H Dole left her job as a Presidential assistant to become Secretary of Transportation in February Then Faith Ryan Whittlesey who replaced Mrs Dole as a liaison aide to special interest groups offended womens organizations with comments that the gender gap would close once the economy turned around Annoyed by that approach Michael K Deaver the deputy White House chief of staff created a new working group on womens issues and began meeting with Republican women in the House of Representatives to come up with some programs Delay on Child Care Proposal The Deaver group is trying to build on changes enacted in 1981 including passage of a larger tax credit for child care costs and tax breaks for individual retirement accounts for nonworking women But here again there have been problems In his State of the Union Message last January Mr Reagan proposed new steps to reduce delinquencies in child support payments by absent fathers But it took months to negotiate with the Republican Congresswomen on a bill The delay was caused by initial Administration reluctance to include incentives for the collection of child support payments in families not on welfare It was Mr Reagan who broke a stalemate by agreeing to accept inclusion of a program for these families In other areas some in the Reagan Administration want to increase the tax credit for child care and to increase the size of retirement accounts available to nonworking women But the Treasury Department and the Office of Management and Budget are resisting because both steps would increase the Federal deficit Waiting for the Court In January Mr Reagan also endorsed the principle of equity in pension payments to men and women and his aides promised legislation soon But there were delays in this area because top officials wanted to wait first for a crucial Supreme Court ruling on the matter Frankly I would have liked to see us move a lot sooner on the pension issue said a White House official But we had to wait until some ambiguities were clarified by the Court The slowness of all these efforts is frustrating to the men and women working on them And once again they are shadowed by the question Is there any measureable political benefit to be gained by Mr Reagan in seeking changes in pension child support enforcement and other relatively obscure issues Some people are making the case that its a waste of time acknowledged one White House official But Secretary Dole who still keeps on top of these and other issues affecting women said You do these things not because of the political benefit but because of the real problems that need to be addressed It may well have an impact on voters but the primary thing is that women need help
MISSOURIO COURT RULES THAT A FETUS IS A PERSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/18/garden/missourio-court-rules-that-a-fetus-is-a-person.html,A living fetus is legally a person under the states wrongful death law the Missouri Supreme Court said recently ruling that a Kansas couple had the right to sue for damage to their unborn child The ruling reverses a previous interpretation of Missouris wrongful death statute that a fetus was not a person deserving the protection of the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution Parents clearly have an interest in being protected against or compensated for the loss of a child they wish to have wrote Special Judge James A Pudlowski for the court The fetus itself has an interest in being protected from injury before birth James Bartimus the lawyer for the parents called the ruling one of the most significant decisions in Missouri in the last decade I took this case at the beginning knowing I was going to try to change the law he said The previous law had been that the fetus had to be born alive to have a cause of action Connecticut allows such an action on behalf of an unborn fetus New York and New Jersey do not Terry and Kevin OGrady of Kansas City Kan filed the suit against St Joseph Hospital of Kansas City Mo two doctors and a nurse The OGradys charged that negligence in treating Mrs OGradys ruptured uterus caused her baby to be stillborn in 1979 The OGradys said the fetus had shown healthy vital signs Judge Pudlowski noted that in 1973 the United States Supreme Court in Roe v Wade upheld a mothers right to have an abortion but he said that that historic case also recognized that a state had an interest in providing legal protection to the fetus In Roe v Wade the Court defined viable fetus as one in that stage of fetal development when the life of the unborn child may be continued indefinitely outside the womb by natural or artificial lifesupportive systems Mr Bartimus said this decision had no bearing on abortions because they did not involve viable fetuses and the death of the fetus was not through negligence on the part of the doctor but rather an intentional act
ABORTION: A FORUM LEAST APPROPRIATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/19/opinion/l-abortion-a-forum-least-appropriate-108820.html,To the Editor I read with interest Prof Billups Percys recent letter Aug 10 criticizing the Supreme Court for its failure to defer to legislative resolution of the extremely contentious issue of abortion The writer is quite correct in recognizing the limitations of the legal system to address an issue that involves fundamental and uncertain questions of theology morality and science Certainly legal formalisms fail us in such murky waters But my complaint with the writers conclusion is his failure to persuade that legislative solutions predicated principally on politics offer a more salutary and reassuring resolution of the issue In the absence of any institution truly appropriate to deal with such fundamental questions of life it would appear that the Supreme Court insulated from the vagaries of politics offers a more satisfactory avenue for the consideration of this largely philosophic issue than Congress The process is surely imperfect but appears to be as well as we can do when we confront one of those instances in which the issue is beyond the resources of human knowledge BERNARD CHANIN Philadelphia Aug 10 1983 The writer is a lawyer
WESTCHESTER JOURNAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/nyregion/westchester-journal-106469.html,THE county has long had an association with the womens suffrage movement One of the movements leaders Susan B Anthony once taught in New Rochelle Another Carrie Chapman Catt made her home in that same city Their efforts led to the 19th Amendment to the Constitution which granted women the right to vote Next Friday at noon on the 63d anniversary of the enactment of the Amendment women of the county will mark the date by honoring a contemporary Vickie Stein of Scarsdale as Woman of the Year during ceremonies at the County Courthouse plaza in White Plains The event will mark Womens Equality Day which will be proclaimed by County Executive Andrew P ORourke  The purpose of the day is to celebrate the right to vote explained Virginia Knaplund of Scarsdale who along with Lillian Worden  also of Scarsdale was cochairman of the Womens Equality Day committee that selected Mrs Stein as well as the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion which will receive the Project of the Year award for defending womens right to choose for or against abortion The committees members were drawn from 12 sponsoring organizations Catholics for a Free Choice the Northern Westchester YM  YWHA Planned Parenthood of Westchester the Westchester Black Womens Political Caucus the Westchester Coalition for Legal Abortion the Westchester National Organization for Women the Westchester Womens Bar Association the Westchester Womens Bar Association the Westchester Womens Council the Westchester Womens Federal Credit Union Women of Westchester the Yonkers Womens Task Force and the YWCA of White Plains and Central Westchester Mrs Stein who was singled out for her work involving rights for women in cases of divorce and separation rape and family violence said she was very pleased to be recognized but felt that it was more important that family violence and all its implications is being recognized Were almost just getting started dealing with the problems said Mrs Stein who heads the Family Violence Committee of the Womens Council I still think there are many thousands of women in the county out there who are not reporting their abuse because they are ashamed Mrs Stein made her home phone a Westchester hot line for abused women nine years ago and saw her efforts lead to the establishment of shelters and programs for county victims of domestic violence She abandoned the hot line four years ago when the programs and shelters were created but said she was thinking about accepting phone calls again because she said she believed there are women out there who want to talk and dont trust the structures which have been established Mrs Stein who first became involved with domestic violence through her work on the National Organization for Womens task force on marriage and divorce is now deeply concerned with the sexual abuse of women and abuse against the elderly She termed the latter Granny Abuse and said it represented her next big project The elderly have less of a choice than do women she explained They have no place to go Its a difficult problem and its going to take some time to get things started Mrs Stein will also be directing her efforts toward getting Family and Criminal Court judges to order sevenweek educational sessions for men found guilty of violence against their wives She said that this provision adopted into law three years ago has not been extensively used and that consequently the county has not held any sessions in the last year Im going to work very hard on this she said But on Friday Mrs Stein who conceded that she was working behind the scenes said she would enjoy being in the limelight Yes I have an ego she confessed I must say Im enjoying the publicity for a change Her award will be presented by the New York Secretary of State Gail S Shaffer while former Representative Peter Peyser will present the Project of the Year award Some of the past recipients of the Woman of the Year award which was instituted in 1973 are also expected to be present at the ceremonies  Gary Kriss The players will be wearing sneakers not skates but otherwise the rules will be those of professional ice hockey when an allgirls team from Maria Regina High School in Hartsdale takes on the New York Rangers All Stars Friday night The game  which benefits the countys division of the American Cancer Society and the Phil Esposito Foundation  is being played at the Playland Ice Casino building but in order to make the competition more equitable the puck will be pushed over a wooden instead of a frozen surface The idea for the event which pits seven pros against 15 high school students and alumni originated several years ago Nancy Kubicek now a student at Pace University was attending Maria Regina and playing what she calls floor hockey during gym class We used a puck with little ball bearings on it and played on the gym floor she said She was also going to Playland ice rink on weekends to watch the Rangers particularly her favorite Phil Esposito at practice sessions Eventually she decided it would be neat a challenge for her high school team to play the professional team and she set about trying to arrange such an unlikely meeting Everybody said to me Yes right  they thought I was crazy she recalls But my mother who really knows me said You can do it  you can do anything you want  The road to success however proved to be lined with red tape and it took almost three years of persistence to achieve the goal Miss Kubicek sought out Mr Esposito she contacted publicrelations personnel she made numerous phone calls and wrote many letters and made inperson visits Finally Mr Esposito who is now a broadcaster for the team decided simply to round up some of his colleagues and organize a game The result was last years match played at the County Center to benefit the Muscular Distrophy Association Attended by 1000 people it raised 10000 for the charity and as Miss Kubicek recalls it It was fabulous The Rangers put on a show she said The girls would be very determined They would go down with the puck and think they were going to get a goal Then the Rangers would stick out their sticks and laugh sarcastically and stop us The girls would throw penalties at the Rangers too and wed have mock fights Several of the girls did score legitimately and the Rangers looked startled as if to say how did that happen As for this years game Miss Kubicek hopes to raise 15000 for the local American Cancer Society and the Phil Esposito Foundation which aids retired and injured hockey players Tickets are 6 for information call the American Cancer Society 9494800 Mr Esposito and others including Barry Beck the Rangers captain will go up against the Marina Regina team Although he has been traded to another team Ron Dugay is to be on hand too We used a plastic puck with little ball bearings last year and the guys who thought that we would be using a tennis ball were surprised at how fast it can move Miss Kubicek said Were using it again this year Three weeks ago I ran into Ron Dugay in a restaurant I said Were going to beat you weve been practicing He said Weve been practicing too   Lynne Ames The hamlet of Chappaqua has restored a bit of green space near its busy main shopping area by turning an unused plot of land along King Street into a vestpocket park  at least for the moment Through the efforts of several Boy Scouts from the villages Troop 57 visitors to the downtown area will soon be able to relax on two benches in the shade of trees yet unplanted view some floral arrangements and check the bulletin board for community news There may even be murals to cover the blank brick and concrete walls that border the site For 15yearold Benjamin Auslander the timing of the villages decision to do something with the lot couldnt have been better The village wanted to put the 42by72foot lot to temporary good use after tearing down the villages original highway garage which had stood there for more than 50 years and Ben needed a community project to fulfill a requirement to achieve the rank of Eagle Scout  the highest rank possible in Scouting So over the last three weeks Ben and several other Scouts  Paul Haller Chris White  Douglas Bantz Michael Bindra and Richard Gonzales  have been clearing debris digging trenches and laying railroad ties and wood chips The trees and flowerbeds are to be planted by the town this fall Its more work than I thought it was going to be but I hope the town uses it and enjoys it said Ben who along with the other Scouts involved is a sophmore at Horace Greeley High school Along with the experience gained in writing and presenting plans to local officials recruiting and organizing his fellow scouts for the project Ben said he was proud that his Eagle Scout project was out in the open where you can see it But just how long the lot will remain open is now under study by the town of New Castle According to Lois Mitchell the Town Supervisor the site will most likely be paved over again at some point in the future this time as either the entrance or exit of a municipal parking lot Increased development along King Street and in the village has put pressure on existing parking so the town is looking at plans to condemn some privately owned property adjacent to the newly created park No one from the town had mentioned this to Ben Auslander but upon learning of the plots possible fate he responded like a true communityminded Scout Id be a little disappointed if it didnt remain a park but if a parking lot would be best for the town then I guess its OK
THEATER; HOW THE SUMMERFARE MUSICALS FARED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/nyregion/theater-how-the-summerfare-musicals-fared.html,GIVEN the mounting costs of mounting musicials traditional outoftown tryouts have dwindled To a large extent regional theater productions smallscale workshops extensive preBroadway tours and extended periods of previews in New York City have replaced them The production of the three musicals in the Pepsico Summerfare which ended two weeks ago could be perceived as yet another alternative to the outoftown tryout Even though that designation was assiduously avoided by the festivals management the fact remains that producers held options to put on each show if the local reactions were encouraging In the case of two of them such producers  who are usually looking for coproducers  were listed in the program as creative consultants None of the three musicals worked according to the expressed intentions of their creators The first one Booth Is Back in Town which did not list a creative consultant was adjudged an oddity  and a failure  not for its peculiarly placed punctuation mark alone In a developmental stage for a score of years during which it had a Lincoln Center Workshop production and a staging at the Williamstown Theater Festival the musical which purported to deal with the relationship between the Shakespearian actors Junius Booth and his son Edwin was pronounced a monumental muddle by one critic and a mess in need of wholesale surgery by another By consensus it suffered an identity crisis was it a musical Artur Rubinstein composed the score and Gretchen Cryer did the lyrics or was it a play the book was written by Austin Pendleton Creative consultant or not producer Elliot Martin who has been keeping a watchful eye on the project for more than six years and indicated that the late Zero Mostel once wanted to play Junius Booth agreed that the recent version went far afield Cumbersome scenery and too many ideas and plots distorted its essence said Mr Martin who still regards it as a wonderful story that requires extensive rewriting People are more interested in human relationships than in theater lore Mr Martin added referring to the extraneous material that obliterated the shows central conflict Booth had been announced as a starring vehicle for Jason Robards during the forthcoming season at the Paper Mill Playhouse in New Jersey presumably another step toward Broadway As a result of the failure of the Purchase production it has been dropped according to a Paper Mill spokesman A tentative December Broadway opening which has been listed in theatrical calendar publications with Mr Martin as producer and George Rose as star appears unlikely at this point Shakespeare and the Indians was another musicial in its third phase of development With a score by Alan Jay Friedman and lyrics by Rob Preston and Rita Briggs the show was once described by its author Dale Wasserman as a farout western of sorts Last summer it was seen at the Eugene ONeill Theater Center in Waterford Conn and later in the fall at the Firehouse Dinner Theater in Omaha Mr Wasserman who said that the musical had scored a success in Omaha made revisions following that engagement none of which he said were incorporated into the production at Purchase Not pleased with what he saw here  it turned into a musical comedy instead of a serious play with music he said  Mr Wasserman who compared the musicals philosophical theme with Man of La Mancha which he also wrote departed for his ranch in California after the first few performances grimly intent on doing it again elsewhere he said Here again the essence  or the real intentions  of the musical were missed and an overproduced show emerged according to the author Mr Wasserman was attempting to deal with an individuals search for himself here depicted by a character called the drifter who longed to recapture the purity of his past which involved the early American mountain men Ironically Mr Wasserman said he felt that the pressures that rule outof town tryouts in general and the commercial theater in particular were operating here as well Its a contradiction he said I would have passed up this opportunity in favor of a workshop in an insulated atmosphere I came away confused I still dont know what we have None of our revisions were done at Summerfare The object was just to put on a show in a large theater because the paying customers were coming in The author was not alone in his confusion The director the choreographer and the musical arranger he said were all replaced during the rehearsal period A new director Dennis Rosa did a heroic job of pulling the show together in eight days However no single point of view prevailed he declared I still want to find out what it was I did Mr Wasserman added In contrast to the simplicity required for the first two musicals production values were just what the creators of Mrs Farmers Daughter another problemplagued musical wanted With its misleading title and undefined point of view the show was performed in an expansive and experimental theater space instead of the conventional proscenium theater where the other musicals took place Attention focused on form the directorial concept of Tom OHorgan who staged Lenny Jesus Christ Superstar and the Broadway production of Hair Content was unclear Here was yet another inconclusive and discursive exploration  but the director insists not an exploitation  of the life of the rebellious actress Frances Farmer who died of cancer in August 1970 six weeks before her 57th birthday The tribulations of the troubled star as she was called in one scene included a hapless love affair with Clifford Odets the playwright an abortion radical political activities losing bouts with drugs and liquor incarceration in prisons and psychiatric hospitals shock therapy and intimations of lesbianism lobotomies and rape All that has provided titillating material for three recent Off Broadway plays three books a film and a television drama Another movie is in the making according to Joseph Stockdale professor and dean emeritus of the theater arts and film division at State University of New York at Purchase who was a friend of Miss Farmers during the last eight years of her life The Purchase production was a viable way to get a look at it Mr OHorgan said Weve learned a lot The book now has to be restructured A musical panorama with operatic overtones and echoes of cabaret style Mrs Farmers Daughter had a book attributed to Mr OHorgan Jack Eric Williams who wrote the music and lyrics and Mr Stockdale who was also credited with research and documentation and wound up as one of the actors as well Rather than a sordid or sensational account of the actresss life Mr OHorgan envisions Mrs Farmers Daughter  in which three performers played Frances Farmer in her early middle and mature years  as a statement about a survivor Its about what happens to people when they speak out of turn he added Mr Stockdale who is otherwise a stickler for the facts about Miss Farmers life conceded that the musical was conceived in symbolic mythic metaphorical philosophical and theatrically visual terms thus rendering fiction more important than fact Critics were invited to review Booth and Mrs Farmers Daughter much to the dismay of a number of those involved in their productions Reviews of Shakespeare and the Indians were emphatically unsolicited As Kathryn M Gaffney the festival director of marketing said We wanted to take a chance with three fullfledged new musicals They played an important part in Summerfares successs By degrees the musicals must now be rethought redefined and reshaped
"TV VIEW; ON GOSSIP, GLITZ AND OTHER REAL STUFF",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/21/arts/tv-view-on-gossip-glitz-and-other-real-stuff.html,Personal  Confidential a new magazine show that has just had a oneweek trial run on NBC was right up front with what it was all about Were bringing you everything thats personal and confidential Steve Edwards the amiable host said although this was really a contradiction because when you spread that kind of stuff around its no longer personal and confidential Its gossip and glitz It may have had meaning once but expose it on the tube and it has no meaning at all It is not so much that the sacred becomes the profane it is more that the profane becomes trivia Consider the first show in the series It featured the usual celebrity interviews although the centerpiece of the program was a young woman in South Carolina who had shot and killed her husband She sat on a park bench her voice breaking and talked about being a battered wife She was about to tell us what happened when she picked up the gun but she was interrupted by a commercial When the commercial was over Christine Belford the cohost did a little reprise Shes a battered wife and she cant take it anymore Miss Belford said She reminded the viewers of what the young woman was saying lest it had slipped their minds during the commercial Then the young woman went on about the killing Minutes later after an interview with the actress Linda Evans Personal  Confidential had another ambitious segment This one featured a California psychiatrist and his wife advocates of a new technique for sexual enhancement They had brought with them two of their patients a young couple named Linda and Joe In a brief therapy session  if you call a show Personal  Confidential you are obligated to deliver the goods  the psychiatrist asked Joe what the problem was and Joe said that Linda wasnt enjoying their sex life as much as she should Joe said he knew this because of his experiences with other women This viewer wondered if Joe watched television a lot and if this had heightened his expectations about sexual satisfaction Linda meanwhile said that when Joe first expressed his misgivings she was defensive and hurt but that now she understood Perhaps she had become a heavy viewer too The psychiatrist looking confident gave Linda and Joe what appeared to be a book and said they should read it together He said it would be fun Personal  Confidential promised it would follow up on the new therapy in its next installment It also promised to bring on the late William Holdens psychiatrist to give us the untold story about the movie star Whatever questions this raises about medical ethics as opposed to the exciting new careers now open to psychiatrists on television it brings up issues about television programming as well How far for instance will network executives now go to satisfy what they interpret as the viewers insatiable lust for the real stuff the things that go on behind closed doors Coincidentally HBO has been showing a documentary American Family Revisited  The Louds 10 Years Later The Louds  Pat Bill and their five children  may one day be recognized as seminal figures in our culture Certainly they were pioneers In the 12part series American Family which was shown on public television in 1973 Pat asked Bill for a divorce This was as real as real could be sanctified as cinema verite It was also a first the real stuff as entertainment It was only a quick shuffle from there to Maude a comedy where the real supposedly funny stuff was made up of menopause abortions and emotional disorders Maude is no longer with us although the real stuff still is Increasingly it is interpreted as a matter of lifestyle gossip and even news Entertainment Tonight well produced often engaging offers news about show business five nights a week It is nationally syndicated and enormously successful and much of its appeal lies in the rapidity of its presentation Wham bam and we are off on a new item Last week Entertainment Tonight celebrated its 500th program with another skillfully put together show James Stewart was getting radiation for skin cancer Burt Lancaster was facing a bypass operation Rudolf Nureyev had pulled a tendon Meanwhile Mark Hamill carried his own luggage through an airport Carrie Fisher found a new restaurant Priscilla Presley was taking a trip This is overload of course The meaning of things washes out Or else everything means the same thing which is the same as saying it means nothing at all Mr Lancasters bypass and Miss Fishers dining habits register on us with the same emotional force They are equally important or equally trivial The networks meanwhile are showing an increasing interest in duplicating the Entertainment Tonight format on other shows although last week the independently produced Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous beat them to it The program was put together by Robin Leach who is a correspondent for Entertainment Tonight and it was syndicated nationally in its fulsome two hours It was supposed to be the first of four similar specials that Mr Leach who was also the chief reporter on the program will do each year Lifestyles of the Rich and Famous ranged from deferential to obsequious in the treatment of the many many celebrities it presented Liberace breathed the spirit of sincerity Donald Sutherland was a Renaissance man Michael Caine tells it like it is and Susan Anton when she visited China turned the heads of a nation On and on it went and while it wasnt mean spirited it did lead to stupefaction Nothing meant anything not even Meshulim Riklis saying that he loved to do Pia Zadoras laundry On the other hand it was supposed to mean something and if it didnt then what did A young woman talking about killing her husband That was preceded by pictures of Elizabeth Taylor and then it was interrupted by a commercial The message is there is no message What we see is what we see and there is no point in thinking about any of it Everything is all the same
"JUSTICE AIDE RESIGNS, DENOUNCING REAGAN VIEWS ON WOMEN'S RIGHTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/23/us/justice-aide-resigns-denouncing-reagan-views-on-women-s-rights.html,A Reagan appointee who had been working on the Administrations project to eliminate sex discrimination from Federal and state laws resigned today after assailing the project as a sham Barbara Honegger a special assistant in the Justice Departments civil rights division who had worked in the 1980 Reagan campaign and in the White House said in an article published Sunday that she had become convinced that President Reagan did not care about womens rights She said bureaucratic roadblocks and lack of interest in the Administration had so hobbled the effort to identify and propose changes in discriminatory Federal statutes that not a single law has been changed Miss Honeggers article in The Washington Posts opinion pages also denounced the Administrations positions on other issues of concern to women including its opposition to abortion and its recent brief urging the Supreme Court to narrow the coverage of a law barring sex discrimination in programs receiving Federal financial assistance Repeated efforts today to reach Miss Honegger for an interview proved unavailing She did not answer the phone at her home in the Virginia suburbs of Washington Criticisms Are Disputed Moving to limit possible political damage to the Administration a White House spokesman disputed Miss Honeggers criticisms and a Justice Department spokesman characterized her as a lowlevel functionary in a temporary appointment who had inflated the importance of her job and had unsuccessfully sought a more important position Miss Honegger submitted a letter of resignation to Assistant Attorney General William Bradford Reynolds head of the civil rights division effective today according to Linda A McCann the department spokesman apparently without waiting to see how her superiors would respond to her public criticism The spokesman would not disclose the letters contents In her article Miss Honegger said that Mr Reagan has reneged on his commitment to root out Federal and state laws and regulations that discriminate against women The Administration has referred to the project as an ERA alternative and presented it as proof that Mr Reagans opposition to the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution did not mean that he was against equal rights for women Action Is Applauded Feminist leaders applauded Miss Honeggers action Kathy Wilson president of the National Womens Political Caucus a Republican who denounced Mr Reagan last month as a dangerous man on womens rights said today that Miss Honegger had confirmed her view that the project to identify and amend laws that discriminate against women is a bumbling PR campaign at best Before becoming disillusioned Mrs Wilson said Miss Honegger told me a number of times that this President is really dedicated to equal rights for women But later Mrs Wilson continued Miss Honegger had a birds eye view of the policymakers in the Administration and damns them with her view While some career employees in the civil rights division have long complained that the Reagan Administration had cut back legal protections for women and members of minority groups it is highly unusual for a political appointee like Miss Honegger to publicly assail the President she worked for Miss Honegger said in her article that she had been project director of the Attorney Generals Gender Discrimination Agency Review of Federal laws and regulations since she went to work for the Justice Department in the spring of 1982 A Technical Aide But Linda McCann the Justice Department spokesman said today that Miss Honegger is not a project director describing her rather as a technical aide whose job was feeding words into the computer and pulling the data out She stressed that Miss Honegger who is 35 years old is not a lawyer and that her temporary political appointment at the department had been due to expire at the end of September She said she did not know Miss Honeggers salary which was said to be 37000 in various news reports Larry Speakes the chief White House spokesman said the effort to eliminate discriminatory laws and regulations was not a sham At his daily press briefing in California where Mr Reagan is vacationing Mr Speakes provided little detail on the project but he said an interim report from the Justice Department listing discriminatory provisions was being studied by the White House staff and would be submitted to the Cabinet council on legal policy next month White House Job From January 1981 to March 1982 Miss Honegger worked in the White House as special assistant to Martin Anderson then Mr Reagans assistant for policy development Dr Anderson now a senior fellow at the Hoover Institution on War Revolution and Peace at Stanford University said today that Miss Honegger was very intelligent and did an excellent job for me and that her responsbilities included beginning the project of identifying Federal laws that discriminated against women in conjunction with others in the Administration While noting that she gets her facts straight Dr Anderson would not comment on Miss Honeggers conclusion that this effort had proved to be a sham Dr Anderson said Miss Honegger had a graduate degree in parapsychology the investigation of such psychic phenomena as telepathy and clairvoyance as well as a Stanford undergraduate degree with honors in creative writing and literature
Miss Reagan Is Hired As Adviser on Women,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/24/us/miss-reagan-is-hired-as-adviser-on-women.html,President Reagans spokesman confirmed today that Maureen Reagan the Presidents daughter had been hired by the Republican National Committee as a consultant to improve her fathers image among women Speaking to reporters as Mr Reagan flew from Los Angeles to Seattle for a speech to an American Legion convention Larry Speakes the White House spokesman said Its obvious from the polling there are some misconceptions out there among women about the President Thats exactly what were trying to meet headon Mr Speakes called Miss Reagan a good asset adding that as the Presidents daughter shell have strong credibility in making speeches on her fathers behalf The newspaper USA Today reported that Miss Reagan a 42yearold former actress and talk show host will work 80 hours a month The newspaper said she talked with her father about the job six weeks ago My father came to me and said I seem to have this problem and I dont think Im such a bad guy  she told the newspaper Miss Reagan was an unsuccessful candidate for the Republican nomination for a United States Senate seat from California last year She is a strong supporter of the equal rights amendment which the President opposed and of abortion rights
BOSTON'S MAYORAL RACE LULLS VOTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/27/us/boston-s-mayoral-race-lulls-voters.html,At a forum for the citys nine mayoral candidates in an East Boston school Thursday night there were more campaign workers outside holding placards than there were people in the audience inside It was a scene repeated many times this summer as the candidates have struggled with a series of distractions that have left many of Bostons voters confused and indifferent The distractions which began with Mayor Kevin H Whites long indecision over whether to run again appeared to have been finally settled last week when the State Legislature approved a twoweek delay in the mayoral primary scheduling the vote for Oct 11 The delay was made necessary after a Federal judge ordered a change in the citys new system of district representation for the City Council and School Committee But as the campaign approaches Labor Day political analysts and the candidates themselves say the outcome is no clearer than it was months ago with no certain favorites and no emotionally charged issues Campaign Up for Grabs Its like a marathon in which the runners have already passed Heartbreak Hill but in which no one has shot to the front or been carried off said Robert R Kiley one of the candidates He was referring to the steep grade near the end of the Boston Marathon where the winner often pulls away from the rest of the pack The campaign is still up for grabs more so than people think remarked John Marttila who has been conducting polls for the Coordinating Committee a group of leading Boston businessmen and once served as Mayor Whites campaign director Although Mr Marttila declined to comment on his latest poll it is believed to show that none of the candidates has over 20 percent of the vote and that the gap between the top five candidates has narrowed in recent weeks Many specialists estimate that with nine candidates running it will take 20 percent to 25 percent of the vote to win one of the two places in the nonpartisan primary The top two finishers in the primary compete against each other in the general election which has been postponed by one week to Nov 11 because of the court order Five Leading Candidates At present Mr Marttila said five candidates have a good chance to win a spot in the primary The leader is David I Finnegan a former radio talk show host and School Committee president He is followed by Raymond L Flynn a member of the City Council Melvin H King a black former State Representative Dennis J Kearney the Suffolk County Sheriff and Lawrence S DiCara a former City Councillor The remaining candidates are Michael Gelber a follower of the conservative activist Lyndon H LaRouche Eloise Linger of the Socialist Workers Party and Frederick Langone a longtime member of the City Council Many voters have not yet focused on the election because of all the distractions Mr Marttila said noting that the top three candidates now have been the three that were already the best known Even the weather has conspired against the candidates with Bostons best summer in years keeping many voters at the beach or in the mountains But Mr Marttila said he expects a more exciting race after Labor Day as the candidates wage a very aggressive campaign with lots of street activity Boston loves the stuff like the Red Sox he said With such a close race and the number of undecided voters a critical factor may be the endorsement of The Boston Globe the citys dominant newspaper Mr Marttila suggested The Globe which takes a liberal editorial stance is thought to be leaning toward Mr Flynn or Mr DiCara One Candidate Is Enigma Unlike other elections here in recent years racial tensions have not been an issue and with the exception of Mr Finnegan all the top candidates are moderate to liberal Mr Finnegans position is harder to assay Articulate and confident Mr Finnegan comes from a family of Irish American politicians One brother is the state auditor He has built on his family ties to develop a large and well financed campaign organization Earlier in the summer he was the acknowledged leader winning 24 percent in public opinion polls compared to 15 percent for Mr Flynn his closest competitor But he has slipped recently as several candidates have criticized his assertion that Boston is in good financial condition and will not face a budget deficit or need new taxes His opponents and some city officials predict that Boston faces a deficit of 30 million to 40 million for the fiscal year 1984 and up to 100 million the next year with the citys problem compounded by its inability to raise property taxes by a new state law Mr Finnegans optimism about the deficit and the lack of need for new taxes has been compared with the stance of President Reagan Mr Finnegan was also caught on the unpopular side of one of the most widely debated issues  how to revive the citys decaying neighborhoods At first he rejected but has now embraced a call for requiring developers of new office buildings in the prosperous downtown business district to contribute to revitalizing old housing stock in the neighborhoods Champion of Working Poor All the candidates have promised to improve the citys troubled public schools and tackle the crime problem Mr Flynns campaign has shown the most momentum although he is short of money In the course of Bostons school busing crisis in 1974 Mr Flynn was an outspoken opponent of busing to achieve desegregation and introduced a bill in the Legislature to abolish compulsory education as a way to circumvent the problem Mr Flynn has also been a strong opponent of abortion But Mr Flynn a 43yearold native of conservative South Boston has emerged as a populist champion of the working poor He has put together a coalition of labor unions tenants organizations and community activists and some people believe he could prove to be a bridge between the citys white and black communities Liberal Vote Is Split Mr Flynn is one of several candidates who are expected to split the liberal vote and particularly cut into the support for Mr King the only black in the race The large liberal field has also hurt Mr Kiley a former head of the citys transit authority who is regarded as a strong administrator and a favorite of the affluent welleducated community in the Back Bay and Beacon Hill Unlike past Boston elections the candidates have avoided personal attacks on each other making for a lack of drama but a high tone Although Mayor Whites decision in May not to run again dominated all election talk he has rapidly become the forgotten man and there are few questions about the corruption problem that dogged him the candidates say Even a report that Mr White is trying to get 1500 City Hall employees including many of the Mayors aides transferred to permanent state jobs before he leaves office has not provoked an outcry from the candidates
CARDINAL COOKE IS TERMINALLY ILL WITH LEUKEMIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/27/nyregion/cardinal-cooke-is-terminally-ill-with-leukemia.html,Terence Cardinal Cooke the Archbishop of New York is terminally ill with leukemia and could die within months the archdiocese announced yesterday The Cardinal does not plan to resign as the spiritual leader of 18 million Roman Catholics in the metropolitan area a position he has held since 1968 a spokesman for the archdiocese said The Cardinal is also Military Vicar for Roman Catholics in the nations armed forces The prognosis is that the disease is terminal the spokesman the Rev Peter Finn said Its severe and its moving quickly Health Deteriorated Seriously The statement by Father Finn who is director of communications for the archdiocese came after the archdiocese announced that the 62yearold Cardinal was suffering from acute secondary leukemia complicated by a chronic lymphoma condition and that his health had deteriorated seriously The Cardinal could live for several months or a much shorter time if serious complications set in Father Finn said The announcement said that Cardinal Cooke was taking the news of his illness with faith and peace of soul It said that Pope John Paul II who stayed at the Cardinals chancery residence during his visit to the United States in 1979 had been informed of the situation The Cardinal according to the announcement has been confined to his residence in the chancery behind St Patricks Cathedral where he continues to oversee the operations of the archdiocese Father Finn emphasized that the Cardinal was lucid and determined to remain as Archbishop over a diocese that consists of Manhattan Staten Island the Bronx and 10 upstate counties Doctors have treated the Cardinal for myelomonoblastic leukemia and will continue to do so the archdiocese said Father Finn said that the Cardinal was experiencing some discomfort but had been an inspiration to all of us around him Though restricted to his bed and a nearby chair the Cardinal has met daily with his two principal aides Bishop Joseph OKeefe the vicar general and Msgr Joseph P Murphy the archdiocesan chancellor in an effort to keep up with church business Scores of wellwishers voiced their support and prayers for the Cardinal Governor Cuomo said in a statement I join all New Yorkers  Catholics Protestants and Jews  in praying for the Cardinals recovery and part of my prayer is a thanksgiving for the years he has served the people of New York preaching leading healing Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said This is a time for prayer There is not a man in New York who would be so much missed The Cardinal was treated surgically for cancer of the lymph glands in 1964 and began suffering from lymphoma in 1975 Since 1974 he has suffered from malaria Tests Earlier This Week The first news of the Cardinals latest health problems was carried last week by Catholic New York the archdiocesan weekly newspaper The report said the Cardinal had been stricken with a severe urinary tract infection and would be forced to curtail his schedule At that point doctors believed medication and rest would correct the ailment Tests conducted earlier this week produced the more serious diagnosis The ruddyfaced cheerful Archbishop became the youngest Cardinal in the world when he received the traditional red hat from Pope Paul VI in 1969 at age of 48 The previous year he had been the choice to succeed Francis Cardinal Spellman as the seventh archbishop of New York since the see was founded in 1808 He had served Cardinal Spellman as secretary chancellor and vicar general The two churchmen were friends and regular dinner companions A Heavy Workload Cardinal Cooke has carried a heavy workload and his aides say has given unstinting attention and energy to the multiplicity of duties that go with running a sprawling archdiocese the fourth largest in the country in the number of Catholics The Cardinal has consistently borne witness to the needs of the poor a concern that was kindled early in his life He pursued a masters degree in social work after finishing his seminary training and then taught at the Fordham School of Social Work In 1957 the young priest was named Cardinal Spellmans personal secretary and in 1965 he was ordained an Auxiliary Bishop In the process he became well schooled in the complex workings of the archdiocese and combined administrative talents with interest in those trapped by poverty and injustice He was installed as Archbishop of New York in St Patricks Cathedral on April 4 1968 the same day the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr was slain in Memphis The new Archbishop besought his listeners that day to approach poverty and racial tensions in a spirit of love and vowed to help the needy both spiritually and materially Two Challenging Issues His position as a leading world Catholic prelate has required him to be an international figure but the undiminished twang in his voice clearly identifies him everywhere as a true son of New York Aides say he is most comfortable in New York and is devoted to its welfare Two issues have posed challenges to the Cardinal in recent months One was his role in this years St Patricks Day Parade The parade committee picked as grand marshal a supporter of the Irish Republican Army The Cardinal while strongly committed to the parade as a religious and folk tradition was firmly opposed to the militant policies of the IRA His response was to condemn violence and to remain inside St Patricks as the grand marshal passed The second matter concerned the Pastoral Letter on War and Peace issued in May by the National Conference of Catholic Bishops The letter strongly condemns nuclear war accepts nuclear deterrence only as a step toward disarmament and calls for the concept of a nuclear freeze Some aspects of the letter went farther than Cardinal Cooke preferred in opposing nuclear weapons As Military Vicar moreover he met some Catholics in the armed services who believed that the bishops were undercutting their military roles Longstanding Attitudes The Cardinal responded by cautioning them against getting the unfortunate and misleading impression that the church does not appreciate your sacrifices and service as peacemakers He balanced that assurance with the statement that the pastoral letter does raise questions about longstanding attitudes on war and peace Over the years the Cardinal has cultivated a broad variety of associations with leaders in many fields and largely by dint of his personality and ecclesiastical standing has gained access to a wide cross section of the citys civic and political life He has remained aloof from partisan politics and rarely has inserted himself in urban squabbles On questions such as abortion he has been forceful and outspoken in opposition In the subtle areas between church and state he has been the quiet voice behind the scenes
5 Vie for Seats in New Minority Districts,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/28/nyregion/5-vie-for-seats-in-new-minority-districts.html,ERNEST S DAVIS is the Assessor for the City of Mount Vernon An architect by profession and a Democrat by party Mr Davis who is 45 years old says he spent the first of his 23 years in Mount Vernon staying out of local politics James A Dickerson a Republican is a real estate broker who has lived for 59 of his 60 years in the countys fourthlargest city He describes himself as an activist when it comes to Mount Vernon its politics and the issues that affect its residents On Nov 8 kone of these two men could make history by becoming the first black to be elected to the countys Board of Legislators which was created 13 years ago The two are vying for the seat in the newly created 13th District  one of two minority districts created by the Board during reapportionment In the other minority district the 16th in southwest Yonkers Hermank Keith is hoping that the winner in the 13th will have to share the historic distinction with him Mr Keith a black who received the Democratic Party nomination is facing a primary fight Sept 13 against Basil N Apostle for the chance to run against William Ryff the Republican candidate The two races are considered significant in their political implications They may show for example whether minority voters in the county will turn out in large numbers when there are viable black candidates The races will also reflect how well black candidates can do in raising funds gathering endorsements and in attracting white votes The results according to some political observors could influence the political careers and ambitions of other potential minority candidates in the county Although race is a factor in both districts the candidates have strongly played down the racial issue in their campaigns Mr Keith president of the Yonkers branch of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People believes that of the three blacks running for county legislative seats he can least afford to be identified as a black candidate He noted that the 16th Districts 50298 residents 37 percent are black and 21 percent are of Hispanic origin Of about 17000 registered voters 9000 are Democrats and 4500 Republicans Fortytwo percent of my constituents are white he said The 16th is a multiethnic community of Jews Italians Polish Hispanics and Arabs If youre going to represent them and what affects them you cant place the concerns of one ethnic group over those of another Both of Mr Keiths opponents who are white Basil Apostle have said that race will not be made an issue in the campaign But Mr Apostle a 45yearold lawyer who was the first to enter the race in the new district charged that some members within the Democratic Party allowed race to dictate their choice in nominating Mr Keith They felt that because this was cast as a minority district the party had to put up a minority candidate said Mr Apostle who sought and won support from 21 of 36 Democratic district leaders to force a primary I felt the party should look for the best possible candidate in deciding who to endorse Nevertheless Mr Apostle whose campaign workers include his wife Victoria and son Alexander said he would focus his campaign on issues Im asking people to look at my record of service to the community said Mr Apostle who made a losing bid for county legislator in 1979 in a race against Leonard N Spano and also opposed Bruce Caputo in a losing bid for a State Assembly seat I think Im the better qualified of the candidates and I represent a broader constituency than either Mr Keith or Mr Ryff he said Mr Ryff at 38 the youngest of the three candidates readily acknowledges that very little separates the three men He pointed out that all three were active participants in fighting the county on the Ludlow Park sewagetreatment plant which forced the county to consult with the community on changes and modifications that might be made at the facility We all have active records of community service he said during an interview at his home on Franklin Avenue just across the street from where Mr Keith lives I know Herman and Basil Were all friends The way I see it the benefactors of this race will be the people in the 16th District Mr Ryff a businessman who lives with his wife Malene and two sons says he isnt worried about the racial composition of the district or the fact that Democrats outnumber Republicans Yonkers residents have shown that they dont necessarily vote along party lines he said noting that although Democrats outnumber Republicans citywide the Mayor the majority on the City Council and all four incumbent county legislators are Republicans The 46yearold Mr Keith who lost his bid for the Democratic Partys mayoral nomination to Peter L DiAferia this year says he isnt sure whether being black would help or hurt him in the campaign Ive stepped on a lot of toes he said with a smile adding that the housing and schoolsegregation suit now being tried in Federal Court was initiated by the NAACP under his presidency But I think if anyone looks back they will see that everything Ive done has been for the betterment of the city Mr Keith who has a bachelors degree in mathematics and physics lives with his wife Gail and 6yearold son Jamaal He says that a low turnout in the primary could determine his winning or losing the nomination My success will depend on a large turnout among minorities he said Theres no question that a good turnout could help me Meanwhile the race in the 13th District one of two districts representing Mount Vernon appears to be a closely contested battle between two wellknown and wellliked candidates The district formerly represented by Greg Young a Democrat who lost his job as a result of the geographic reapportionment has a population of 51458  61 percent of whom are black and 5 percent of Hispanic origin Of 19489 registered voters Democrats outnumber Republicans 10605 to 4426 Mr Davis a former Buildings Commissioner in Mount Vernon said he was running on his record of service to the city Under his leadership he noted the first female Buildings Inspector was appointed the position of Elevator Inspector was created and a training program for new inspectors was initiated My background as an architect and as Buildings Commissioner and Assessor will be an added asset on the County Board he said in explaining why he had chosen to run Ive been in the political process for seven years I have the qualifications to do the job and be of service to the people of Mount Vernon Although he said he had not yet developed a platform Mr Davis said he favored the creation of a Department of Labor in county government  a concept first put forward by Ogden Reid the Democratic candidate for County Executive  and would work to change the citys negative perception by projecting Mount Vernon in a positive way Mr Dickerson also said he was running on his record of service to the community and stressed that it was a record of voluntary service not paid I was on the Commission of Human Rights Urban Renewal Housing Task force and the Youth Advisory Council he said ticking off a list of his involvements Ive given myself to the community not as a paid person but a volunteer Mr Dickerson who made an unsuccessful bid two years ago for the 17th District legislative seat in Mount Vernon losing to John A DeRario said that if Mount Vernon residents had not voted along party lines he would have won that election But he now believes that his Republican affiliation is something voters should think about in choosing a candidate He explained First the Board is Republicandominated and I doubt that will change Second with Andy ORourke in as County Executive which I expect he will be that will give me and the people of this District a onetwo punch  someone working for them on the eighth floor and a friend on the ninth he said referring to the County Office Building Neither candidate expects that being the first black to serve as a legislator in the county will result in any added pressure placed on them On countywide issues Mr Dickerson said he favors legislation requiring doctors to notify the parents of girls under 18 who are seeking abortions Mr Davis said he could not support such a broadbased bill unless certain provisions were included to take into consideration teenagers who are supported themselves On Indian Point both agreed that the plant should remain closed until it is deemed safe or until an evacuation plan is approved by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission Fiscally both men described themselves as moderates who would seek to hold down spending but not at the expense of social programs
1983 MARCH: LEFT REVIVES; News Analysis,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/29/us/1983-march-left-revives-news-analysis.html,The significance of the civil rights march Saturday that drew more than 200000 to the Lincoln Memorial went far beyond a commemoration of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jrs vision for America two decades ago according to a range of participants and outside observers The diverse outpouring of Americans from across the nation was evidence of a revival of the activist left since Ronald Reagan was elected President in 1980 it was an affirmation of the formation of new coalitions of groups  labor blacks Hispanic Americans women antinuclear activists and environmentalists among others  that have frequently been at odds in recent years It was also seen as an indication that poor blacks may not be quite so isolated from the rest of the nation as their failure to make economic progress over the past 20 years suggests This was underlined by the presence of thousands of nonblack demonstrators who traveled hundreds of miles to Washington to bear witness with the blacks And finally it was a belated vindication of Dr Kings tactic of nonviolence and reconciliation which in 1963 was being challenged by a number of black organizations that subsequently splintered and disappeared in the waves of urban riots that swept the cities Many former leaders and members of those organizations joined Saturdays march to honor his memory The black cause had not been so visible since the mid1960s In that period antiwar environmental womens Hispanic consumer and other movements were coming to the fore and civil rights organizations having achieved most of the laws they sought slipped toward the background New Organizations Involved Yet the consensus Saturday was that black organizations alone could never have organized such a march As Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta points out the 1963 march was a spontaneous outpouring of protest by blacks and whites against the violent resistance that the civil rights movement had been meeting across the South Saturdays march he said was the result of organization by a range of interest groups on the national regional and local levels that did not exist 20 years ago Those groups acting in coalitions formed in response to Reagan conservatism began to show their strength last year They were in a large sense responsible for the nuclear freeze demonstrations in the winter and spring of 1982 that caught official Washington by surprise The coalitions on the left also have shown strength in elections Organizing at the grass roots they were able to turn out enough votes to oust a number of conservatives in Congress state legislatures city halls and county seats Black and Hispanic adults registered and voted in record numbers in many areas resulting in a surge of minoritygroup officeholders including the Governor of New Mexico Toney Anaya and the Mayor of Chicago Harold Washington It was many of those same coalitions operating in more than 350 communities that recruited Saturdays marchers and thus set the tone for the speeches and slogans So many causes were advocated that the event seemed unfocused except for one aspect It was almost universally antiReagan Hooks Tells It in Old Style The Rev Benjamin L Hooks executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People one of the few speakers employing the old fashioned preaching style that galvanized audiences in the 1960s framed it in an emotional cadence We are here because we are committed to the elimination of Reaganism from the face of the earth We have had enough of it Reagan no more in 1984 Reagan no more The President has become the symbol if not the cause of many of the participants troubles Organized labor seeing its base of highpaying industrial jobs in decline before and after the Reagan election has been seeking and finding new allies So has the womens movement in the wake of its loss on an equal rights amendment to the Constitution the peace movement in its most recent concerns about nuclear destruction and the environmental movement in its fears that efforts at economic survival may wipe out what it has gained in the last decade Republicans Out of Picture And although it is too early to say what the coalitions on the left may do for the divided Democratic Party and its candidates their efforts are almost all focused in that direction Mr Reagans capturing of the Republican nomination and the decline in the influence of Republican moderates has resulted in leaving the activist left almost entirely to the Democrats One of the ironies of the weekend march was that the party that once stood for black rights was a presence in the proceedings only as a perceived opponent What effect if any the march itself may have on events is uncertain Marches have become routine in Washington and are easily forgotten as events change and new issues emerge Differences that split coalitions in the 1960s and 70s still exist For example there is the argument between blacks and Jews over whether there should be hiring goals or quotas for minority group workers or there are the conflicts about which goals should be at the top of the national agenda Blacks themselves have become torn on whether big government programs are their answer to economic security For all of its success on civil rights laws the black movement has never been able to deal effectively with the question of economic gains for a large section of the black community Dr King long before he was killed in Memphis in 1968 said economic equality was by far the most difficult goal to obtain and since then a succession of black leaders have agreed And there is always the possibility some who have watched developments pointed out that the intensity of the left might cause a backlash on the right just as it did in the 1970s when the new right organized around such issues as abortion busing to achieve school desegregation and prayer in the schools No Longer So Divided Yet the black movement showed Saturday that it was not so divided as it was in 1963 on tactics At the height of the civil rights protests the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee and the Congress of Racial Equality among others favored abandoning the King tactics of nonviolent protest and Dr King spent much of his energy trying to reconcile those groups with such traditional ones as the Urban League and the NAACP On Saturday the overriding message from leader after leader was to organize and vote The Rev Jesse Jackson the Chicago leader for example used a Biblical metaphor to tell the crowd The regressive Reagan machine won because David did not use all his political rocks and did not pick up his slingshot David had unused rocks just lying around Many black leaders disagree sharply over whether it would be wise for Mr Jackson to run for President as he has indicated he might rather than to align the black vote behind a friendly white candidate Yet there was no call to radicalism and virtually no disagreement that the black protest should be directed chiefly through political organization

LIBERTARIAN PARTY OPENS PARLEY TO PICK 1984 SLATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/us/libertarian-party-opens-parley-to-pick-1984-slate.html,Without bands banners and bunting the unorthodox Libertarian Party quietly opened its weeklong national convention here yesterday in an unorthdox fashion with two men debating abortion before an audience of fewer than 75 party members Like their counterparts in the major political parties Libertarian delegates will be selecting Presidential and Vice Presidential candidates adopting a platform electing national officers and debating various issues There will even be the familiar state standards identifying the various delegations when the full sessions of the convention begin Thursday in the ballroom of the Sheraton Centre Hotel But unlike the major parties there will be no national anthems or pledges of allegience Government should be kept at arms length said Gary Greenberg the convention coordinator Nor will there be opening prayers The only music will be heard Saturday when the candidates are nominated There will be no shortage of talk however including classes on economics and tax seminars that may make the convention tax deductible according to a convention brochure About 700 delegates are expected to attend the convention but party officials say many will not arrive until the full sessions begin Potential Candidate Drops Out The early acknowledged frontrunner for the partys Presidential nomination Gene Burns the host of a radio talk show in Orlando Fla has dropped out telling party leaders that they could not raise enough money for a serious campaign David Bergland a softspoken lawyer from Costa Mesa Calif who was the partys Vice Presidential candidate in 1976 is the new leader But party leaders say they expect a challenge by Earl Ravenal a Georgetown University professor and James E Norwood a retired Air Force officer from Waco Tex Like major party leaders they are hoping to drum up attendance and interest with a contest One major qualification for the Vice Presidential candidate is independent wealth so he can help finance the national ticket party leaders said Three years ago our very generous Vice Presidential candidate David Koch a New York businessman who is not related to the Mayor contributed 2 million of the 32 million spent in behalf of a ticket headed by Edward Clark a Los Angeles lawyer Mr Clark and his wife Alicia the partys national chairman are in effect the political ma and pa of the laissezfaire party which believes that the less government there is the better off people are This even extends to the point of contracting private police and fire services and opposing antidrug legislation as restricting freedom Mr Clark polled 920000 votes in 1980 out of a total of more than 865 million votes cast The party was on the ballot in every state as against 33 states in 1976 when it received 172750 votes and two states in 1972 when the party polled 5000 votes a year after it was founded No Plans to Run Again Mr Clark interviewed as he filled out a registration card in a decidedly unbustling meeting room at Sheraton Centre said he was not interested in running again The party ought not to be closely tied to one man said the 53 yearold Harvard Law School graduate whose casual appearance and quiet manner made him seem more like a tourist than a radical politician The more animated Mrs Clark who is also 53 saw the admittedly hopeless Presidential campaign as a means of educating American voters letting them know our ideas She said the party also hoped to run candidates in as many as half the 435 Congressional districts She said the party had about 30 elected officials nationwide including only one in the tristate area Dick Siano a New Jersey township official Mrs Clark said she did not know the name of the township The party says it has 7000 duespaying members around the nation with almost 1500 in California and about 2000 in the New York New Jersey and Connecticut area according to Mr Greenberg who ran for Governor of New York in 1978 on the Libertarian ticket He said most members were white younger than 40 and a good number of them were professionals The Libertarians want to drastically reduce government including the military They would bring all United States troops home abolish taxes and rely on voluntary contributions Government is viewed as a restriction on individual freedom We the members of the Libertarian Party challenge the cult of the omnipotent state and defend the rights of the individual the partys statement of principles asserts Governments throughout history have regularly operated on the opposite principle that the state has the right to dispose of the lives of individuals and the fruits of their labor Both major parties are cast as proponents of that view Why is the convention so early and so long Mr Greenberg said the party needed all the time it could get to qualify its candidates around the country and to raise funds As for the weeklong session with the main events scheduled for Thursday through Sunday Mr Greenberg said the party hoped to encourage attendance by promoting a combined vacation and convention A banquet a cabaret and a Brooklyn Bridge party and show are among the lighter side events Yesterdays session included in addition to the abortion debate a platform committee panel and debates on tax credits and foreign policy The major parties have fourday conventions next summer But their delegates manage to mix more noisily more convention pleasure with less convention business
FRIENDS SAY FEMINIST HEROINE IS SINCERE IF ECCENTRIC,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/30/us/friends-say-feminist-heroine-is-sincere-if-eccentric.html,When Barbara Honegger denounced President Reagans commitment to equal rights for women as a sham and resigned from the Justice Department last week she became an instant heroine to some womens rights groups But some of her new allies have winced as Miss Honegger has linked her beliefs about womens rights to her beliefs about the occult and the supernatural It adds an element that distracts detracts from the substance of her original statement but the substance holds said a leader of a national womens organization who asked that she not be identified Miss Honegger who is 35 years old has been held up to ridicule by Reagan Administration officials who have portrayed her as a person of small consequence frivolous not to be taken seriously She retorts that this a baseless and desperate attempt to discredit her Some of Miss Honeggers remarks in recent days have combined with the aspersions cast by Reagan aides to raise the question of whether her judgment is credible In a recent interview she said she knew how she wanted to be remembered As the person who through a coincidence of training skill and fate made the difference in the future of America  and particularly of American women Unusual Spiritual Guidance As passionately as she has been a student of politics Miss Honegger is also a dedicated student of the occult her friends say She was widely quoted last week as having said that supernatural influences had guided her course marking her as destined to have an impact on the Reagan Administration and on womens rights One of these influences according to an article in The Los Angeles Times was a source using her voice that told her that she would become a defender of womens rights in the Reagan Administration Another article said she had written of omens of power in Mr Reagans ascension Miss Honegger denied these accounts and said she never referred to a source or to omens But while making these denials she also said that she was indeed influenced by an unusual spiritual dynamic I feel like a catalyst she said in a recent interview I am honored to have been used by the Force if you will with a capital F like in Star Wars Thats how I feel You know the Zeitgeist of history Mentor Praises Her Work Miss Honegger went to the White House as special assistant to Martin Anderson whom Mr Reagan picked from the Hoover Institution on War Revolution and Peace at Stanford University to be the Presidential assistant for policy development Miss Honegger had been his research assistant She demonstrated very good judgment Mr Anderson said She did extraordinarily good work was accurate precise There was never any case he said for complaint about her character Miss Honegger was close friends at the White House with Douglas Bandow a former special assistant to the President for policy development who is now editor of Inquiry magazine Shes a bright engaging person who can get very committed to some issues Mr Bandow said Her cause was womens rights and she claims credit as the author of the Reagan Administrations proposed review of discriminatory laws as its alternative to a Constitutional amendment guaranteeing equal rights A spokesman at the Justice Department which Miss Honegger joined early last year accused her of exaggerating her role labeling her a low level Munchkin The Presidents spokesman Larry Speakes referred to her as the Easter Bunny at the White House Easter Egg Roll But Mr Bandow backed Miss Honeggers version crediting her with originating the alternative Even in the White House she was always outspoken on her views about abortion and the ERA Mr Bandow said When you disagree with the Presidents position its not the usual fare to let people know Earned Reputation as Eccentric Miss Honegger also was outspoken about her interest in parapsychology and coincidences She earned a reputation in the White House as being somewhat odd according to Mr Bandow As an example he said she wrote a manuscript discussing the significance of a particular grouping of three stars on events in the campaign Mr Bandow said this eccentricity did not appear to diminish peoples regard for her work Elizabeth H Dole the Secretary of Transportation and a defender of his policies on women was for a time Miss Honeggers boss when Mrs Dole was assistant to the President for public liaison In a letter of recommendation made public by Miss Honegger Mrs Dole praised Miss Honeggers job skills and said she was a delightful person with whom to work Claims Are Overblown Mr Bandow said he does not doubt the sincerity of Miss Honeggers beliefs but he questioned the validity of her accusations Shes somebody who was sincerely disaffected but whose claims are overblown he said A lot of what happened to her project is just bureaucratic its not that the White House doesnt care about women Mr Bandow asserted that when Miss Honegger moved from the White House to the Justice Department she found people paying less attention to her a situation he said a person more experienced in government might have realized happens all the time She attributed it to attitudes toward womens issues but not so he said When you work at the White House people pay attention to what you say more Its easy to mix those up But a friend of Miss Honeggers from college Suzanne Guyette disagreed If youre jaded you say Well its just the system but if youre innocent you want to do something about it she said Its refreshing to get somebody like Barbara who says Wait this is not the way its supposed to work  Accused Former Employer Miss Honegger had earlier rallied against what she perceived as sexual discrimination and won It happened in 1975 when she was working as a medical school secretary at Stanford She charged her boss Karl Pribram a psychiatrist with mistreatment alleging that he struck her in the head with his fist and that she was denied a job rank she was entitled to Following an investigation the university lowered Dr Pribrams salary by 3000 put him on two years probation and paid Miss Honegger an 8000 outofcourt settlement A mediator also ordered a cash award to her for back pay After that she was unable to find other work at Stanford until Mr Anderson hired her said Williamson Evers a campus friend of Miss Honegger She felt she was mistreated and she stood up and were seeing the same thing Mr Evers said
AROUND THE NATION; Abortion Notice Law Thrown Out on Appeal,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/08/31/us/around-the-nation-abortion-notice-law-thrown-out-on-appeal.html,The United States Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit today barred enforcement of an Indiana law requiring doctors to notify parents before performing abortions on minors The court said the state requirement itself was constitutional but there were insufficient legal provisions for mature girls who want the rule waived The measure went into effect Sept 1 1982 It requires parents be advised 24 hours in advance of a daughters abortion if she is under 18 Specifically todays ruling said the law fails to provide for appointment of a lawyer to represent a daughter seeking a waiver of the notification provision
PLANNED PARENTHOOD LOSES FUND DRIVE VOTE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/01/us/planned-parenthood-loses-fund-drive-vote.html,A Federal committee heeding the arguments of antiabortion activists ruled today that Planned Parenthood should not be included in the Federal employees charity fund The recommendation could be overturned by Donald Devine director of the Office of Personnel Management which oversees the money raised annually through voluntary payroll deductions for Federal workers Last year Mr Devine did overrule the eligibility committees decision and reinstated Planned Parenthood under a Federal court order stating that advocacy groups could participate in the fund The eligibility committee of the Combined Federal Campaign a Federal workers joint charity appeal resembling the United Way voted 7 to 2 against including Planned Parenthood after a debate by antiabortion and abortion rights activists Committee Mood Hinted Just before todays vote the chairman Betty Brake signaled the tone of the committee saying Anything so controversial cannot further the interest of the campaign The decision came as a Federal court across town approved a Planned Parenthood suit seeking to be placed in the international services category of the fund campaign It was not immediately clear what effect the court decision would have on todays eligibility ruling The antiabortion advocates at the committee meeting said Planned Parenthood had failed to meet financial and other criteria required to be among those benefiting from Federal worker payroll deductions The campaign raises about 100 million annually from Federal employees and disperses it to about 180 charities including such groups as the Heart Fund the Lung Association and the Multiple Sclerosis Association Pressure on Planned Parenthood Planned Parenthood has been on the list since 1968 but has come under increasing fire because of its advocacy of birth control and the right to have an abortion Of its 27 million annual budget Planned Parenthood received about 500000 last year from Federal campaign donations Their international activities are paid for exclusively and wholly by Federal funds so what they are doing is misrepresenting themselves said Jim Bopp of the national council for the Right to Life Committee What they are involved with is essentially a deception The president of Planned Parenthood Faye Wattleton argued that her group did not favor abortion but did not favor limiting a womans options in the event of unwanted pregnancy Desperate Struggle Seen I dont know anyone who is pro abortion she said Antiabortion groups attack her organization because it advocates family planning she said adding that attacks on her groups participation in the campaign are a part of a desperate struggle by the anti abortion minority to undermine the work of Planned Parenthood Barry Wood of the Citizens for Moral Decency said Planned Parenthood was actually responsible for the growing number of teenage pregnancies because it provided contraceptives to teenagers I think wed all agree that sexual intercourse is a major cause of pregnancy Mr Wood said Planned Parenthood is encouraging sexual activity by counseling teenagers They provide free foam to girls and they have condoms sitting out front in a big bowl with signs that say Take one  He concluded Planned Parenthood is telling them to go ahead and have sex enjoy its fun
"WHEN PARENTS KILL: THE STORY OF SHAWN, 3",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/02/nyregion/when-parents-kill-the-story-of-shawn-3.html,Early on the Sunday morning of Sept 26 1982 as his brothers looked on and an upstairs neighbor heard his cries Shawn Nicely was beaten to death He was 3 years old His killers were his own mother and father uf921 They have been convicted and jailed Renee Nicely for murder and Allen Bass for manslaughter And Shawn has been buried  one of a million children believed to be abused or neglected each year according to the National Committee for the Prevention of Child Abuse and one of the 5000 who are killed Behind those statistics behind the courtroom verdicts is the story of Shawn Nicely and his 21yearold parents who began having children at the age of 15 and who never married Theirs is the story of relatives courts and state agencies all aware of problems in the family all unable or unwilling to solve them It is the story of neighbors and friends who saw a little boy being beaten over a period of years and for the most part did nothing and told no one But ultimately this is the story of Renee Nicely a girl trying to be a mother denying that Shawn was her child yet seeing in him a reflection of herself and her problems In prison for his murder she would write him a poem I wish I knew who he was because his life was so dim Who gave him to me And why did he suffer so The things I used to do to him Tell me why I dont know I wish he was alive again But he was freed from sin He would have ended up like me But now hes free He reminded me of myself when I was small I hated that life so I would recall Shawn could it be was given to me So I could forget the way it used to be Dont feel bad I had it hard just like you Bad thing is I lived you didnt make it through Youre lucky you know God took you away I wish it was me killed on that Sunday An Unwanted Birth And a Mothers Denial Complaining again about getting fat Renee did her daily situps on the evening of Feb 17 1979 She stayed in bed with stomach pains the next day and her aunt fearing appendicitis called an ambulance It was in the ambulance bounding down the streets of Newark that Shawn Nicely was born Renee was saying Its not happening its not happening  recalled Sharon Boose the aunt with whom Renee was living She looked at me as the baby was coming out and said No no Aunt Sharon it cant be Im not pregnant It cant be  For the first three months of his life the boy had no name The hospital referred to him as baby boy Nicely and Renee preparing to give him up never saw him She had dropped out of high school and her Aunt Sharon  as her mother and another aunt had done before  ordered her out of the house At 16 she had two sons no husband and now no home Renee placed the infant in a foster home until Mildred Bass Allen Basss mother offered to take in her and the children Mrs Bass gained legal custody of Renee her 18 monthold son Davell and the new baby whom Renee reclaimed on May 4 1979 Proud as She Could Be She wanted to name him after his father she said but Allen opposed it Shawn was the second choice At first most friends and relatives agree Renee treated Shawn as she did Davell  with love and doting despite flashes of temper and an ignorance of infant care When she first had the baby said Mary Mann Renees grandmother she was proud as she could be Renee called him Shawnee pooh Yet within weeks Renee began denying that Shawn was her child It was Mrs Bass she said who nurtured these doubts Mrs Bass who declined to be interviewed disputed that in testimony during Renees trial but friends and relatives recall her being as insistent as Renee on the point The two supposedly said Shawns skin was too dark for him to be Renees child They said a slight deformity of his feet proved it They told some people that the hospital had given Renee the wrong child by mistake and others that Renees Aunt Sharon had sold the baby Mrs Bass paid for blood tests for Renee and Allen  the results were inconclusive  and paid 700 to a lawyer apparently in preparation for a lawsuit Renee used to say the baby wasnt hers said Monica Nicely her sister She said it all the time Id say Well he looks kind of like you Shed just say the babies were switched and Shawn wasnt hers Rationale for Neglect No one could shake the idea from Renee not even those who forced her to look at herself and Shawn together in a mirror Renees denial would become the rationale for Shawns neglect beatings and torments Experts in the study of child abuse say such reasoning is common in such cases as is the selection of one child among several as the target of mistreatment At first Renee said in an interview in the Essex County Jail I didnt think somebody could just give you a kid and it not be yours But Mrs Bass kept trying to get me to go to blood tests and lawyers I just started not liking Shawn because I thought I got a kid somewhere in the world that I wouldnt never see because I got Shawn instead I blamed Shawn In December 1979 after arguments with Mrs Bass and fist fights with Allen Renee left the Bass household Taking along her two sons and living on welfare she rented a two room apartment on 20th Avenue in nearby Irvington She was 17 years old and eight months pregnant with her third child Impatience and Ignorance Turn to Abuse Renee remembers leaving the lights on all night in her new apartment because she was afraid of the dark She said she often ran out of food Her furniture consisted of a bed a crib a dresser and a television and she passed her days watching soap operas Her favorite she said was All My Children I was scared Renee recalled I wanted somebody to be there But there wasnt nobody there nobody but me Davell and Shawn And Ping on the way Allen Bass Jr nicknamed Ping was born Jan 13 1980 Now with three children Renee tried belatedly to learn how to be a mother But she knew nothing of feeding schedules or infants diets When Davell was 2 Mrs Boose recalled Renee was giving him potato chips and bologna sandwiches Renee testified that she had never toilet trained Shawn She didnt have any patience Mrs Boose said I put it down to her being young and wanting to go out Expressions of Stress All the impatience and all the stresses found their target in Shawn Stuff had started to change said Gwendolyn Nicholson a friend of Renee I saw Renee beat Shawn a couple of times with her hand I didnt know what hed done wrong half the time Id ask her and she wouldnt say anything She would knock the food out of the childs hand said Karleen Young another friend who sometimes lived with Renee And when she was telling him to pick up his toys if he didnt move fast enough shed hit him upside his head What Renees friends noticed was not so much that she hit Shawn but that she ignored him They recalled her leaving Shawn inside the apartment alone  the punishment Renee had most loathed as a child She told her friends that Shawn was just sleeping an excuse repeated so often they nicknamed him Sleeping Beauty Visits From Sister Others were not so naive Janie Bennett a family friend who sometimes cared for Shawn on weekends remembered that Renee left him in dirtied clothes after he had urinated or defecated Most friends recall Shawns clothes smelling and being ragtag He didnt know how to use the bathroom by himself Renee said so Id say You stay inside until you know how  When Renee made one of her rare visits to her mothers home in nearby East Orange she took her other children but never Shawn The photographs she put in the family album never showed Shawn And when her sister Monica visited  the only family member to regularly do so  she often left near tears Monica used to always come here right after said Mrs Mann Renees grandmother and tell me how Renee kept Shawn in a room how she wouldnt feed him how shed throw things on him how shed hit him Monica said how she bammed him in the nose and the blood just popped out Renee started telling me Shawn was a demon At first I thought she was kidding I said Why do you keep him alone in the room She said To keep his evil spirits off the other kids  As for Allen Bass Renee said he sometimes hit all the children Mr Bass who declined through his mother to be interviewed testified at the trial that he had tried to stop Renee from mistreating Shawn Renees friends said Allen had treated the children kindly and added that in his presence Renee had treated Shawn fairly well But the friends also said Allen had never actively intervened in the growing pattern of abuse Was Allen a good father I dont think so said Mrs Bennett one of Renees friends I never seen him hit the kids or holler at them But one day I asked Allen Why do you let Renee do Shawn that way He said Thats Renee She does what she wants to do I said You dont care He said No  A Neighbors Discovery Of a Hidden Child In August 1980 Renee and her three children moved to their last home together a subsidized apartment on Berkeley Terrace in Irvington Allen Bass friends and neighbors say was an occasional presence If he had lived with Renee she would have lost her welfare payments so he often stayed with his mother He told people that he worked as a model and Mrs Bass testified that he had held a con struction job but had been dismissed for oversleeping and missing work But others  including Renee Miss Nicholson and Mrs Boose  said Allen had supported himself by selling marijuana and pills Irvington police records show that he was arrested but not convicted on charges involving drugs robbery possession of stolen property and nonsupport of his children Kerry White who lived in the apartment above Renees testified that he had seen Allen carrying a gun Renees new neighbors came to know her as a sweet girl pretty though prone to chunkiness with two young children named Davell and Ping Oddly the children called Renee Nay  never Mamma or Mom Then after a few months Dolores Morton who lived across the street heard a strange story  that Renee had a third child hidden in the house Mrs Morton went to Renees apartment on the pretext of seeing the baby Ping and noticed that the bedroom door was closed A few days later she visited again and paced the apartment with Ping in her arms until she could peak into the bedroom I saw Shawn in there balled up on the floor in a little knot Mrs Morton said He looked like a ragamuffin a little vagabond I went in and picked him up He put his little arms around me and gave me a big hug and said Mamma I asked Renee Can I take him for a night She said You can have him Real nonchalant Frances Allen Renees nextdoor neighbor also discovered Shawn thin and dressed raggedly cowering around Renee He looked she said like one of those little Biafran kids Neighbor Heard Cries For months Mrs Allen said she had been hearing the sound of childrens cries coming from the Nicely apartment and had assumed they were from Davell or Ping Now she said she realized the wails were Shawns Once the neighbors learned of Shawn Renee began taking him outdoors Some neighbors said they had seen her hit Shawn for letting his ball roll into the street others that they had heard her call him by obscene names Kerry White testified that in one fit of anger Renee had held Shawn upside down and dropped him on his head Renee said this had never happened but admitted hitting Shawn whipping him with a belt and sometimes leaving him in soiled clothes One day he came to my door and said Miss Frances can I use the bathroom  Mrs Allen said I told him to go home and use his own Davell heard and went and told Renee that Shawn had to go Shawn was standing here crying Renee went on to beat him and punch him She pulled him into the houseI didnt see him come back out Still none of the friends neighbors or relatives called the police or other agencies to report the beatings of Shawn In October 1981 however Renee let Mrs Morton the neighbor across the street keep Shawn I wanted somebody to take him Renee said because I didnt want him He deserved for somebody to take care of him Why not his mother Im not his mother On Shawns first day with her Mrs Morton said he covered his face with his arms when she moved to stroke his hair He shrieked when she began to wash him After she tucked him into bed she said he crawled out and slept curled in a ball beneath the bed  the way he had in Renees house It took three weeks before Shawn slept on the bed Toy Motorcycle and TV But soon Mrs Morton said Shawn looked forward to his bubble baths He rode around her living room on a toy motorcycle and watched baseball games on the television she had bought him She took Shawn to her Bible study meetings and to church Renees behavior toward Shawn Mrs Morton said was curious and contradictory When a portrait photographer going door to door asked Renee if she wanted pictures taken of her children she declined but told him that the woman across the street might want one of her child Mrs Morton had Shawn photographed in his favorite pajamas the ones that looked like a baseball uniform Mrs Morton eventually persuaded Renee to give her custody of Shawn They drew up an agreement but when it came to the point of seeing a lawyer Renee balked She said she had feared that if she gave up Shawn the state might take away her others  Davell Ping and Michael who was born May 8 1981 Instead of giving up Shawn Renee took him back in April 1982 He told me I dont want to go back to Nay Her not like me  Mrs Morton said But legally she said she had no choice It was so hard for me giving him back Mrs Morton said When I was in the house I would have to close my front door because Shawn would be across the street sitting on his steps with his eyes glued over here Almost from the day Shawn was returned to his mother Mrs Morton and Mrs Allen said he looked dirtier thinner and more frightened Finding that Mrs Morton had taught Shawn how to dance Renee said she and Allen would demand that he shake it until he begged to stop Davell Nicely said Allen got Shawn drunk one night and watched him try again and again to stand And once Renee testified she beat Shawn because he disobeyed her and then said Mrs Morton was his real mother My mother used to tell me One day youre going to have a kid and hell have a smart mouth like you  Renee said And I did A Reenactment Of Childhood Pain Deny him as she might Renee Nicely was joined with Shawn She scorned him even as she indentified with him reenacting with him the rejection she had felt as a child Shawn was the second and I was the second Renee said He was different from Davell and them and I was different from my sisters He had a rash and when I was a kid I had a rash I didnt like Shawn and my mother didnt like me Beverly Nicely said she had always loved her daughter Renee but perhaps had never had the time to show it Divorced and working as a keypunch operator trying to move her family out of Newark she had had only two or three hours each night for the vying affections of four children Maybe Renee needed more attention Mrs Nicely said You hate to say that but youre working so hard to get out of that city life I know she never had want for anything Christmastime she got lots of presents School time she got new clothes Maybe I screamed and yelled too much and she couldnt take it Maybe she needed a mother and father to be there with her and we werent Spoiled by Her Father Alfred Nicely Renees father favored her to the point of spoiling her He called her Princess and promised her as Renee testified that one day he was going to take me to a world with just me and him Mrs Mann Renees grandmother recalled that Mr Nicely had told Renee that she could do anything because of how beautiful she was Anything included disobeying her mother Renee recalled ripping her mothers watchbands and necklaces scratching furniture with pens leaving letters written in a strange personal code on her mothers dresser You couldnt say anything to Renee without her blowing up her sister Monica said One Christmas Renees Aunt Sharon bought her a gold bracelet Renee refused the gift saying she wasnt good enough to wear gold Id say Renee why do you punish yourself  the aunt recalled Shed say Because Im no good  Occasionally Mrs Nicely spanked Renee to discipline her But most often she put Renee in her room alone as the other children played  just as Renee would isolate Shawn When Renee was 11 and again when she was 14 Mrs Nicely took her to a family counseling clinic She finally tried to send her to a shelter for juvenile delinquents They said Shes not a criminal  Mrs Nicely remembered I said But she needs help They said Shes incorrigible and thats not a crime You cry out for help and no one wants to help Until its too late Renee was sent to live with her aunt Debra Handy in Irvington And it was there that she met Allen Bass who lived on the same block On Nov 23 1977 they had their first child Davell From Officials and Friends Too Little Help As Renees own family grew and her problems with it she came to the attention of the State Division of Youth and Family Services a judge and a doctor Almost all suspected or knew of the turbulence in her home yet none succeeded in stopping it When Mrs Bass sought custody of Renee and the children Judge Yale L Apter of Essex County Juvenile and Domestic Relations Court ordered the familyservice division to help watch over Renee I do not he said in April 1979 want to see any more children Renee was already 10 days pregnant In all she came under the supervision of the state agency twice  after the births of Davell and of Shawn Both times caseworkers found the babies to be in suitable homes Davell with Renees Aunt Sharon and Shawn with Mrs Bass and Renees case receded among the 35000 others in the state At about 10 PM on June 30 1982 it emerged again An anonymous caller told the familyservice agencys Newark office that a boy named Shawn Nicely had cigarette burns on his body and gave the boys address Within moments of the call an emergency caseworker Linnie Mae Penn arrived at Renees apartment Miss Penn testified that she had found no cigarette burns or other marks of abuse on Shawn She testified that Shawn had not cowered or ducked around Renee A neighbor Lilly White was in Renees apartment at the time and volunteered that Renee did not abuse her children Miss Penn said Examined by Physician Still caseworkers followed up on Shawn Twice records show they had Dr P Sundaram of Irvington examine Shawn for signs of abuse Although an autopsy less than three months later found a number of old injuries including broken bones Dr Sundaram reported no medical evidence of abuse Caseworkers visited Renee 10 times during July August and September of 1982 They noted no injuries on Shawn Thomas Blatner the director of the familyservice agency said the division had offered Renee a range of services foster care for Shawn a paid homemarker day care psychiatric help counseling and even another blood test to prove Shawn was hers But all this was voluntary he said and she turned it all down For Mr Blatner and others the question remains Why couldnt his agency somehow save Shawn The director cited the agencys caseload  at any given time in 1982 each caseworker in the Newark office had 45 cases  and its tendency to answer crises rather than educate families to prevent them And the agency he said was constrained by criticism that it moved too quickly to break up families Finally Mr Blatner said the community did not help Neighbors like as Mrs Allen and Kerry White said caseworkers had never questioned them about Shawn but the neighbors never come forward either This is a tragic example Mr Blatner said of a case where we could not prove child abuse to the point of taking away the child We felt there were problems in the home We were aware the kid was dirty But are we going to remove every kid whos dirty from his home A major issue is that there were neighbors people close to the situation who did not come forward at the time we couldve done something Miss Penn the caseworker returned to Berkeley Terrace after Shawn was killed and found Lilly White the neighbor who had told her that Renee Nicely did not abuse her children Miss Penn asked the woman what she thought now Lilly Whites explanation Miss Penn testified was She didnt want to get committed She didnt want to be involved in it Shawns Not Going To Make It In early September of 1982 Debra Handy went to an amusement park with Allen Renee and all their children Debra came home said Mrs Mann Debras mother and Renees grandmother and said Mamma Im afraid Shawns not going to make it He had this blank stare Hes weak He cant walk on his feet  It was at 8 or 830 on the morning of Sept 26 Kerry White testified that he heard the loud thumps a series of them from the Nicely apartment below Then came the crying and then the sound of Shawn shouting Ow Stop that Then he testified he heard Renee say  Better not do it again or else Ill kick your butt  More thumps  three he testified  followed The crying stopped Kerry heard footsteps in Renees apartment Then he saw Renee running across the street to call the police from Mrs Mortons house She and Allen Bass initially told Mrs Morton and the police the same story Shawn had slipped in the bathtub and hit his head Events Are in Doubt Exactly what happened in Renees apartment that morning remains in some doubt although everyone agrees that it began with Shawn dirtying his pants Allen who had stayed overnight testified that he had slept through whatever occurred Renee testified only that she hit Shawn sometime that morning She now says that she lay in bed through whatever occurred still weak from an abortion the previous day Davell Nicely who at the age of 5 testified against his mother and father said that Renee had hit Shawn in the head with a broom and that Allen had stomped on Shawns back When the police arrived they found blood in the bathtub blood on the towels on the rack and a bloodied towel in the sink Seeing the ambulance Mrs Allen the nextdoor neighbor called the familyservice division to report a suspected case of child abuse She was too late Shawn was pronounced dead on arrival at Beth Israel Medical Center in Newark at 951 AM The Essex County Medical Examiner Dr Andre Talleyrand attributed death to a combination of injuries including internal hemorrhage a laceration of the liver and lacerations and contusions of other internal organs He also found a recent break in Shawns right arm one newly fractured rib three previously fractured ribs hemorrhaging on the tongue bruised gums a slight swelling of the brain from repeated blows to the head a new bruise on the left thigh and old scars on the buttocks thigh and upper back At the time of his death Shawn Nicely stood 36 inches tall and weighed 31 pounds
GRASS-ROOTS GROUPS GO NATIONAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/magazine/grass-roots-groups-go-national.html,IN CITIES SUBURBS AND SMALL TOWNS FROM NEW Hampshire to Oregon platoons of activists ranging from unemployed factory workers to highschool youths are knocking on at least 50000 doors every evening to press the issue of the day be it toxic waste in Missouri utility rates in Ohio or tax reform in Connecticut Late in the evening they return to small bare offices with money commitments for assistance and names and addresses for computers Soon many will be installing telephone banks for the 1984 elections and beyond In many grassroots communities across the nation where periodic waves of discontent have given rise to such protest movements as the agrarian revolt of the 1890s and the labor strikes of the 1930s citizens are once again restless The decline of the nations old industrial base uncertainty about what will replace it and concern over unemployment falling incomes farm foreclosures and bankruptcies have stirred new rumblings A multitude of citizenaction groups on the left which sprang up in the 1970s to secure specific but frequently narrow goals on the state or local level are now seeking to organize the discontent nationally and reverse the drift toward conservatism evident in President Reagans election in 1980 The activism on the left springs from a major development of a decade ago when millions of citizens became disillusioned with the traditional forms of politics They organized neighborhood regional and state groups by the thousands to mount direct actions and legal challenges against what they perceived to be abuses of big government and big business in housing taxes insurance the environment energy prices womens and minority rights They are now broadening their agendas forming coalitions with such oldline liberals as labor and farm groups More important they have been entering elective politics with the kinds of sophisticated candidate support systems that would have been impossible three years ago In so doing they are taking a page from the book written by right wing activists in the 1970s Many leaders of this movement were the angry young of the 1960s who disrupted American society on behalf of civil rights peace and a host of other causes before disappearing from the national scene These oldtime activists on the left are how ever only one element in the new political ferment Thousands of new pressure groups organized around single issues  corporate political action committees PACs and nuclearfreeze advocates for example  are bringing about a profound change in American government away from a representative system and toward a more directly participatory one Yet compared with other groups the evolving and merging groups on the left have received less attention even though their influence both actual and potential may be greater Many of its leaders say the movement has simply been doing what comes naturally moving into national politics as a logical next step with the Reagan Administration as both catalyst and target They explain the rise of the groups as a result of their organizational maturity coinciding with circumstances favorable to expansion They assert that even with a somewhat improved economy unemployment is likely to continue at an elevated level and the high industrial wages that sustained bluecollar families for decades may never return The emergence of issues such as toxic waste has brought together blue collar neighborhoods and environmentalists and moderated their past differences over jobs versus the environment Labor unions which for many years could elect or defeat candidates on their own are losing members and therefore reaching out for allies wherever they can be found The womens movement after its crushing defeat in the battle for the equal rights amendment is looking for new allies All these centrifugal forces are contibuting to a new coalition One group typical of this new development is the Illinois Public Action Council or IPAC a coalition of about 130 organizations across the state In the upcoming 1984 elections the groups new campaign strategies and techniques will invariably be pitted against those of the new right The new movement is nonpartisan and appeals to citizens of various ideological persuasions but in practice it is seeking to make its impact almost exclusively within the Democratic Party Its leaders says it is hopeless to attempt any drastic change among Republicans The idea for IPAC started with Saul Alinsky a charismatic community organizer whose legacy lives on in thousands of selfhelp organizations across the nation Alinsky a product of Chicagos slums perfected confrontational politics at a time when poor communities seemed to have few alternatives If for example a municipality failed to pick up garbage he and his followers would dump it on the steps of City Hall When he died of a heart attack in 1972 his successes in Chicago and elsewhere appeared to have been temporary as urban neighborhoods continued to decline and the revolutionary spirit of the 1960s died Over time however neighborhood groups not only survived but proliferated matured and gained power Many of the groups are now engaged in moneymaking ventures involving real estate and transportation and crimecontrol services Although very different from a neighborhood organization and involved in more enterprises than Alinsky probably ever dreamed of IPAC is a direct descendant of one of his last organizations the Citizen Action Program CAP in Chicago CAP used confrontation stratagems and legal challenges to stop construction of an expressway to force Commonwealth Edison to reduce air pollution and to secure legislation against the redlining of neighborhoods by banks In 1975 Robert B Creamer a Louisianian who had moved to Chicago to work for Alinsky and later became CAPs associate director established IPAC along with several other Alinsky followers as a means for applying pressure on a statewide basis At first the group consisted primarily of neighborhood elderly minority and other specialinterest organizations Recently it has added such liberal labor groups as the International Association of Machinists and the United Automobile Workers as well as several farm groups brought together under a new umbrella organization called the Illinois Farm Alliance Now 36 Creamer calls this organizing a selfconscious effort to build upon the same spirit as the Illinois Populist movement of the late 19th century and the antiforeclosure protests of the 1930s With an annual budget of 14 million IPAC operates offices in six cities canvasses 7000 homes a day runs a PAC providing personnel and research for candidates for the State Legislature and Congress and maintains a fulltime lobby in the Illinois capital of Springfield where it has been winning some grudging respect in the largely conservative Legislature On the national level IPAC belongs to Citizen Action a new federation claiming to speak for 3 million people in Massachusetts New Hampshire Connecticut Pennsylvania New Jersey Wisconsin Illinois Ohio Virginia Indiana Minnesota and Oregon This overarching organizations statement of purpose is to bring together low and middleincome citizens of every type  urban and rural women and men black Latino and white senior citizens union members and church members All of the organizations in the federation emphasize community organizing and grassroots leadership development as the key to social change All address the economic questions of greatest concern to their members as neighborhood residents consumers taxpayers and workers FOR THE MOST PART THIS BROAD MOVEMENTS top leaders show a surprising uniformity from group to group and state to state Most are in their 30s or early 40s and egalitarian in their attitudes preferring to stay in the background while pushing their local members up front In 1965 when the civilrights movement was at its peak and the antiVietnam protests were just beginning they were high school and college students Like thousands of their peers they took to the streets part of a great national ideological outpouring against what was perceived as racial oppression and an immoral war While the Stokely Carmichaels and Abbie Hoffmans grabbed headlines and went to court these followers quietly organized rallies marches and demonstrations When the movement faltered in the 1970s the current leaders did not splinter off into such radical and frequently violent groups as the Weathermen nor did they join the workaday middle class as most of the rank and file did Instead they turned their backs on the national scene and immmersed themselves in the neighborhoods becoming what Harry C Boyte in his book The Backyard Revolution called a new generation of organizers Heather Booth a softspoken woman in her late 30s is a movement theorist and organizer She grew up in Brooklyn was converted to directaction politics as a university student and led antiwar and womens protests before turning along with her husband Paul to neighborhood organizing In 1973 Mrs Booth a former schoolteacher founded Chicagos Midwest Academy which has trained an estimated 10000 organizers in organizing low and moderateincome people across the country Politics was in disarray says Mrs Booth recalling the mood of the early 1970s People of good faith were embroiled in factionalism They were bushed out and turning off or turning in on each other Watergate was just beginning to be exposed It was a pretty awful period We were trying to find a way to hold on to something positive What Mrs Booth and others achieved in various regions over the next few years was substantial but circumscribed They helped build organizations and institute techniques for assisting specific people to achieve such specific goals as stopping a freeway filling potholes and pushing City Hall the Legislature or Congress to enact certain consumer legislation Still the elective system the young activists had condemned as corrupt rolled on its own track with its consultants pollsters managers media experts and candidates unimpeded by the citizenactivist movement on the left Take em on as they come up was with rare exception the activist attitude toward elected Democrats Republicans liberals and conservatives alike The election of Ronald Reagan and especially the impact of the new right in 1980 changed that Those working under the umbrella of Citizen Action among others decided they could not survive under the new order unless they got into elective politics We were at the stage where we could no longer stay out says Ira Arlook executive director of the Cleveland based Citizen Action There were public officials with us on the issues whom the Republicans were making a special effort to knock off We could not simply say to them Good luck hope you win  To prepare for the 1982 Congressional elections and beyond Citizen Action set up the State and Local Leadership Project a nonpartisan training school for campaign workers based in Chicago and under Mrs Booths direction Assistance was provided by Paul Tully who had been with the George McGovern and Edward M Kennedy Presidential campaigns and now works for Walter F Mondale Statewide groups set up PACs selected Congressional and legislative districts where Reagan Republicans could be defeated and sent their workers door to door promoting first the issues and then the candidates who supported their positions Despite the fact that it was impossible in many instances to separate the effects of their efforts and those of the recession and a widespread reaction against the Reagan policies their record was impressive One of the movements more celebrated winners was Doreen Del Bianco a young activist elected to the Connecticut Legislature over a Republican incumbent Miss Del Bianco joined the Connecticut Citizen Action Group four years ago when she decided to sign a petition for lower utility rates I was just a housewife and blamed all my troubles on blacks Puerto Ricans and other victims she says reflecting on her political transformation Now I know its the corporations that are keeping people down int he workplace and in the community Miss Del Bianco eventually bacame one of the leaders of the group and when the organization decided last year to support candidates in elections she enthusiastically entered the race for state representative from a Waterbury district that had traditionally sent moderates of both parties to Hartford I entered the race because I was tired of talking to legislators who dont understand what it is to go from paycheck to paycheck who dont understand how hard it is to pay Northeast utility bills who dont get threatened when their property taxes go up she says Despite a cool reception fromt he Democratic Party in the district Miss Del Bianco got enough money from labor unions and help from grassroots activists to win by a margin of 137 votes out of 8200 cast As could be expected Miss Del Bianco has found herself at cross purposes with the Hartford corporate lobby which considered her and her organization radical and out of step with the current probusiness trend in the country For most of these groups the first steps into politics were tentative Next year though they plan a much more extensive effort IPAC perhaps the most politically advanced of all the groups is being watched as a bellwether for the movement elsewhere In Illinois as in other Midwestern states plant closings alyoffs fiscal deficits on all levels declining public services farm foreclosures and discoveries of new toxic wastes have become routine occurrences Some of the small industrial cities have unemployment rates above 20 percent Every day at 2 PM IPAC canvassers gather in scattered locations across the state In Rockford Neil Lancaster a veteran activist and a canvass supervisor is giving a pep talk on the issues to a dozen or so workers in a storefront office with the stark unkempt air of a union hall The workers in their 20s and 30s are black and white men and women and like Miss Lancaster casually dressed in jeans and jackets Utility rates have increased in the area and Miss Lancaster predicts more hikes if President Reagans bill to deregulate natural gas passes and the State Legislature fails to restrain prices There is no pretense of objectivity in these briefings in the Populist tradition the issue is black and white the people versus big business and government By the time Miss Lancaster ends the briefing the canvassers recruited from activist ranks are filled with enough indignation to get them through the evenig The canvass itself is a highly professional operation The workers pile into cars and spread out over suburbs of small workingclass houses whose occupants are more often than not frugal and conservative When the door opens Miss Lancaster carrying a clipboard with credentials and a statement of purpose showing prominently explains she is with IPAC a group fairly well known throughout the state working to keep utility rates down Her approach is soft but direct The resident a whitecollar man just home from work looks vexed but lets her in for a brief discussion of the issues She emerges five minutes later with a check for 15 from someone who may support the organization on other issues as well The man has bought a piece of whatever political impact IPAC can make and a subscription to its newspaper Illinois Action Others turn her away or decline to contribute but Miss Lancaster and other canvassers are often successful She says the canvassing operation is meticulously accounted for If a canvasser who is paid slightly over the minimum hourly wage cannot collect 80 an evening he or she is fired Canvassing is not conducted in areas where the population falls below a certain density because it takes too long to get to the next house The money canvassers bring in  IPAC expects to gross more than 1 million this year  along with names and addresses for the computer banks is the lifeblood of the organizations new initiatives Although canvassing is not a new technique these activists have so perfected it in the past year or two that many of them claim it has boosted their fortunes even more than the enormously successful directmail appeals have the new rights At state headquarters in Chicago IPAC director Creamer along with a governing board representing various disparate groups are reacing out in many new directions The group has set its sights and resources on Congressional districts outside of Chicago a city considered too encumbered by the old Democratic machine for IPAC to be effective Although the group did not endorse anyone int he recent Mayoral primary it did send out canvassers to work for Harold Washington int he general eleciton IPAC is seeking  sometimes over the opposition of county chairmen  to rebuild the state Democratic Party around Populist issues and from the precinct level up The attempt is to create the same kind of grassroots structure that existed for many years in the Minnesota Democratic FarmerLabor Party For 1984 IPAC has targeted five conservatives Congressmen for defeat The races will pit the techniques of the right against those of th left In Presidential politics IPAC is debating whether it should support a candidate in the Illinois Democratic primary next year but organization labor has become such an important element in the coalition that its members have decided its choice would have to coincide with that of the AFL  CIO which has announced it will break with tradition and endorse a candidate before th primaries IPAC leaders deny that they ahve become captives of the AFLCIO explaing that they simply do not want to risk fracturing their coalition at this point An IPAC endorsement would give any Democratic candidate a leg up in Illinois Creamer has recruited Michael McGann a deputy director of Senator Kennedys 1980 Illinois Presidential campaign from downstate Illinois to run the political operation IPACs finance director is Rahm Emmanuel a 23yearold wellconnected Chicagoan formerly with the Democratic National Committee who brings in contributions from the North Side rich as well as national political action committees Further adding to the diversity are leaders such as Vince Demuzio a Democrat and assistant majority leader of the Illinois Senate one of the spark plugs on the IPAC board and sponsor of much of its legislation He is an alumnus of Lyndon Johnsons War on Poverty having served as director of a federally funded smalltown antipoverty agency Their match converging on Springfield from Chicago Peoria and East St Louis last spring was designed to give visibility to the coalition of farmers urban blacks the elderly the unemployed the clergy working mothers and organized labor Out of all this comminging Creamer says the various groups are trying to form a longlasting progressive political movement that can redirect American politics in a humane democratic direction The process that is under way in Illinois Creamer says Is part of a larger national dialogue aimed at shaping an integrated progressive economic alternative  an alternative both to rightwing supplyside dogma and the traditional economic policies of the last 40 years Creamer and other leaders across the nation speak of laws and policies that would direct more capital into Productive areas such as manufacturing plants and equipment and less into speculation mergers and acquisitions Frequently their discussions trail off into economic theory but the groups policies are clearly directed toward more public regualtion and broader participation by the people at the lower end of the economic ladder They are seeking among other things larger public expenditures to clean up toxic waste more consumer progtection espeically against mortgage foreclosures and the cutoff of utilities more regulation of energy prices a shift away from sales and property tax to the graduated income tax strengthening of worksafety laws and higher funding of jobtraining and social programs  a platform hardly compatible with the Reagan philosophy or that of many modernday Democrats When asked how they are handling the emotional issues  abortion prayer in public schools and pornography among others  that helped give rise to the new right by appealing to workingclass people most movement leaders answer identically They ignore those issues thus avoiding divisiveness Michael Ansara staff director of Massachusetts Fair Share in Boston points out that a family could support the economic and environmental policies of his organization which boasts 130000 duespaying familiesa nd at the same time the social stance of the righttolife movement At the heart of the movement is an element of class struggle Our members say things used to work for them and they dont any more says Ansara Many have large families and grew up in the Catholic Church Look at the member who is 35 years old has worked hard married obeyed all the rules but is facing declining income and other troubles They see young professional couples who broke all the rules evaded the draft in the Vietnam War lived together unmarried have high salaries drive a Volvo and are coming in buying up and restoring the houses of working people that is the stereotype The leaders of Massachusetts Fair Share are considering whether to move into elective politics prior to the 1984 elections Groups across the country  in California New York Texas Florida Montana Colorado and other states  are in various stages of development Californias Campaign for Economic Democracy headed by Tom Hayden and ACORN a national neighborhood movement for low and moderateincome people based in Little Rock Ark have long been supporting candidates Most groups have not But this year the trend is the same everywhere  toward coalitions and greater involvement in elections Although the ascendancy of Reagan conservatism has encouraged a renaissance of the left many cite progressivisms new importance as evidence that the new left has simply come of age Lee Webb executive director of the Conference on Alternative State and Local Policies a privately funded Washingtonbased research group gives elected officials and some activists detailed technical assistance in pursuing laws and policies He provides policies  how to deal with such issues as housing plant closings tax reform economic development pension fund investment and others Webb a student of past progressive and politicalreform movements is seldom surprised when popular movements burst upon the national scene and find national officials poorly prepared to deal with them  as the nuclearfreeze movement did last Year Webb thinks the nation many of its citizens disillusioned with Washingtons solutions is reverting to a historic tradition of great movements beginning at the local and state levels and eventually bubbling up to the national scene Leaders of the activist left think they may be on the verge of making an impact on national elections Yet coalition politics have long been a shaky affair in this country Efforts to unite the poor across racial lines have failed more often than they have succeeded Paul Tully a former State and Local Leadership Project adviser views Citizen Action and other coalitions as a very serious operation but warns that such politics work best when a firebreathing dragon  as many in the movement view the Reagan Administration  offers a common threat If the national prospers over the next year or so the dragon may seem less threatening Many leaders feel there is dragon enough in the structural changes taking place in the American economy Ira Arlook of Citizen Action says that such issues as toxic waste are sufficient to keep the canvassers going for a long time Significantly the most wrenching social and economic changes are occurring not so much in marginal states as in those with large populations big Congressional delegations and many electoral votes  Illinois Michigan Pennsylvania and Ohio among others It seems doubtful that the new progressive movement can achieve basic changes in American political thought at this stage The radical change that it is seeking lies in putting segments of the economy  the banking institutions  under more democratic control to give randandfile Americans a larger voice in how and where dollars are invested But many of the issues including public control of utility rates and tax reform are quite traditional And the movement seems locked in to supporting a traditionalist Democrat such as Walter Mondale for President in 1984 Yet it is expected to have a major impact next year in the Congressional and state elections At a minimum the new stirrings among the activists on the left are likely to add a balance to the political scales that was abSent in 1980 when the new right inspired many religious fundamentalists and other conservatives

MEXICO PROPOSES MAJOR REVISION OF ITS PANEL CODE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/04/world/mexico-proposes-major-revision-of-its-panel-code.html,Mexicos Attorney General has proposed a major revision in the countrys penal code that is intended to add greater flexibility to the judicial system and give fairer treatment to defendants The proposal which would provide the first major revision of the Mexican penal code in 52 years would eliminate the longstanding presumption that a defendant acted with intent when committing a crime A statement from the Attorney Generals office said this was a source of injustice that often resulted in penalties harsher than deserved The proposal would also alter the punishment against certain crimes  increasing penalties for rape and child abuse for example and reducing those for adultery and abortion  to bring them more into line with what the Attorney Generals office described as the Mexican reality Accused Can Still Be Jailed The proposal would not change the current provisions that allow a person accused of a crime to be jailed before trial Reports of an earlier version of the proposal by the Attorney General Sergio Garcia Ramirez have already caused controversy because of liberalized provisions on abortion and adultery But a spokesman for the Attorney Generals office said these revisions did not differ greatly from the law as it was now applied and that the other proposed revisions would have much broader significance These were among the other major changes in the proposal  Monetary penalties would be based on a defendants income making fines onerous in equal proportion to the rich and the poor  Penalties for the use of some narcotics and dangerous drugs would be reduced but sanctions for sale and distribution would be increased to punish the true delinquents  An injured party would be permitted to include his claim for monetary damages in the criminal prosecution making possible restitution part of the Governments criminal proceeding  Mexican courts would for the first time have the option of placing convicted criminals in jail part time or under a system of probation and could order criminals to repay their debt to society by performing public service work  Penalties would be increased for rape and sexual abuse with the law expanded to protect both men and women and sanctions against kidnapping and serious incidents of child abuse would also be increased Proposal Still Under Revision The proposal was developed by the offices of the Federal Attorney General the District Attorney for the Federal District to which it would initially apply and the National Institute of Penal Sciences a Governmentsupported academic group The Attorney Generals office said the formal document was still under revision and would probably not be presented to the Mexican Congress for several weeks The proposal would recognize degrees of guilt such as a legal distinction between the intentional and unintentional commission of a crime  for example if one intended to injure another person with a blow but that blow accidentally resulted in the victims death The legal system currently lacks this type of flexibility In addition the proposal would allow greater latitude in dealing with people who because of error or ignorance did not know they were committing a crime The Attorney General said such a provision was particularly important in a country where there are ethnic groups not incorporated into the culture who do not know the language whose customs are different from those generally prevailing But in Mexico a heavily Roman Catholic country where the family still plays a dominant role the changes in the abortion and adultery laws have drawn the most comment and controversy Under current law abortion is permitted if the pregnancy endangers the life of the mother is caused by a rape or is the result of a womans imprudence The revision would permit abortions in the case of serious genetic defects or if the birth of the child would create grave economic hardship
No Headline,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/06/world/no-headline-145793.html,Irish to Vote Tomorrow on Antiabortion Measure DUBLIN Sept 5  After months of debate confusion and sectarian division Irish voters will decide on Wednesday whether to write a strong antiabortion amendment into the Constitution Never in our history have we seen a campaign that was so bitter and divisive as the present one Dick Spring a leader of the Irish Labor Party said over the weekend Neighbor has been turned against neighbor Eminent professional men have bitterly denounced each other in public The churches could hardly be farther apart Colleagues in the same political party have lunched personal attacks on each other Abortion is illegal in Ireland in all but the most extreme cases where a mothers life is threatened by a pregnancy But in the last two years antiabortion forces with the support of the Roman Catholic Church and the Irish Republics two main political parties have managed to put the constitutional change to the voters in a national referendum Concern About the Future Supporters of an amendment have argued that existing statutory laws against abortion could be overturned by liberal forces in the future or by new court interpretations of the law The Constitution itself they said had to specifically guarantee the right to life to keep abortion out of Ireland Those who have campaigned against the amendment countered that the additional safeguards were not necessary since there was no groundswell of popular opinion to liberalize the law in a land where divorce is not allowed and contraceptives are available only through medical prescription Most Irish women who want to terminate a pregnancy go to England where they can have an abortion on demand The constitutional change would not affect that reality Changing the Constitution to place the life of the unborn on equal footing with the life of the mother those who oppose the amendment said could contribute to the death of more Irish women than now occur Moreover they argued introducing the antiabortion language strongly favored by the the Catholic Church could undercut recent moves within the Irish Republic to promote discussions with Protestants in Northern Ireland to find a basis for reunification 5 of Country NonCatholic Protestant and Jewish leaders in Ireland have spoken out against the amendment saying that it would impose the moral teachings of the Roman Catholic Church on everyone in the country About 5 percent of the population is nonCatholic Over the weekend Prime Minister Garret FitzGerald urged rejection of the constitutional change adding that he regretted that he initially endorsed the measure when it came up during last years election campaign Despite much opposition in leadership circles the amendment is expected to be approved by a wide margin A poll published in The Irish Times today placed the likely margin at more than 2 to 1 What voters are being asked to approve for inclusion in the Constitution is this paragraph The State acknowledges the right to life of the unborn and with due regard to the equal right to life of the mother guarantees in its laws to respect and as far as practicable by its laws to defend and vindicate that right Even after months of debate the public continues to appear confused by the issue with many still convinced that if they fail to support the change abortion will somehow get a legal foothold in Ireland The Moral Backbone The Irish people are going to stand up and show theres one place in the world with the moral backbone to keep the abortionists out said Catherine OKeefe of Kilkenny a mother of three Roman Catholic leaders said the way people voted on this issue should be a matter of individual conscience but on Sunday parishes around the country rang with exhortations from bishops and priests urging parishioners to vote for the amendment Some priests reportedly suggested that a vote against the amendment would be tantamount to being an accessory to an abortion
POPE WARNS 25 U.S. BISHOPS ON SEX MORALS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/06/world/pope-warns-25-us-bishops-on-sex-morals.html,Pope John Paul II repeated Roman Catholic teaching against abortion divorce the ordination of women birth control premarital sex and homosexuality today in a speech to 25 visiting United States bishops Church sources suggested the Pope chose the Americans as his forum because he considers the United States a center of sexual liberalism and believes elements within the church in the United States to be sympathetic to such views The prelates were here to pay the visit to the Pope that is obligatory for bishops every five years In the meeting at his summer residence at Castel Gandolfo the Pope told the bishops that they must proclaim without fear and ambiguity the many controverted truths of our age and went on to list the Roman Catholic churchs teachings on sexuality The Pope reminded the bishops of the churchs doctrine of the indissolubility of marriage citing approvingly from a pastoral letter of the United States episcopate that said the covenant between a man and a woman in Christian marriage is as indissoluble and irrevocable as Gods love for his people and Christs love for his church Speech Appears Defensives The Pope condemned premarital sex and homosexual activity as incompatible with Gods plan for human love He urged the bishops not to be silent against the unpopular truth that artificial birth control is against Gods law He restated his rejection of abortion by citing the rights of the unborn the weak the handicapped the poor and the aged no matter how current popular opinion views these issuses Vatican sources noted in all the strictures a particulary defensive tone and an acknowledgment of the widespread unpopularity of the Roman Catholic doctrine which the Pope appears to believe is particularly unwelcome among Catholics in the United States The Pope restated his absolute exclusion of women from priestly functions He did so it was believed because it was in the United States that he was most openly confronted with opposition from within the church on this issue After declaring his support for the dignity of women and their right to every legitimate freedom that is consonant with their human nature and their womanhood he told the bishops to be firm in rejecting any claim that women could serve as priests Exclude Women Priests In this regard he must likewise endeavor to explain as cogently as he can that the churchs teaching on the exclusion of women from priestly ordination is extraneous to the issue of discrimination and that it is linked rather to Christs own design for his priesthood the Pope said The bishop must give proof of his pastoral ability and leadership by withdrawing all support from individuals or groups who in the name of progress justice or compassion or for any other alleged reason promote the ordination of women to the priesthood the Pope said In so doing such individuals or groups are in effect damaging the very dignity of women that they profess to promote and advance In Washington during his visit to the United States in October 1979 a nun turned an expected address of welcome into a demand for the admission of women to the ministry The nun Sister M Theresa Kane wearing street clothes despite the Popes express wish spoke of the intense suffering and pain of many women and urged John Paul to be open to and to respond to the voices coming from the women of this country who are desirous of serving in and through the church as fully participating members The Pope cautioned the bishops today to expect criticism of their defense of the churchs views Precisely because he cannot renounce the preaching of the cross the bishop will be called upon over and over again to accept criticism to sacrifice popularity and to admit failure in obtaining a consensus of doctrine acceptable to everyone John Paul said
HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/08/garden/hers.html,LATELY I have been observing a cruel almost combative hostility toward children that amounts to a new cult of toughness I first noticed it in 1979 when the United Nations International Year of the Child  a global campaign to end poverty and provide health and human rights to all children  was attacked by a number of groups including Americans Against Abortion which called it an intense propaganda campaign to liberate children from their parents The suggestion was that the millions of starving children were merely rebellious little brats who deserved no help at all In 1980 I watched delegates convened to address the problems of children and families turn the White House Conference on Families into a forum for parental vituperation Dozens of male delegates skipped over family economics housing violence and stress to rail against children who disobey their fathers and to predict consequent doom for all other authority figures in Western civilization A man who accused government job programs of coddling kids later acknowledged bitterly that he had been unemployed for 18 months Several people sidetracked discussions of child abuse with a defense of corporal punishment Why is spanking children so important I asked one man To teach them whos boss he answered The refrain became familiar too many kids talk back they get bigshot ideas from television and books they think the world owes them a living The common enemy was permissiveness the preferred cure discipline For years various religious and political fundamentalists have validated parents anger and offered relief in the form of authoritarian certainties The Indiana Moral Majority leader Greg Dixon for example engineered a weakening of his states childabuse laws in 1981 because the Bible instructs parents to whip their children with a rod The Rev Mr Dixon insists that welts and bruises are a sign that a parent is doing a good job of discipline More recently the new cult of toughness has found expression in books such as The Coming Parent Revolution Back in Control Toughlove Dare to Discipline and Spank Me if You Love Me Appealing to readers who are more interested in learning to  control  children than care for them these books tend to underplay childrens suffering and glorify parent power in the name of either God or the Family We can trace to the Puritans the idea that children are inherently bad and it is up to adults to cleanse them of their evil said Edward F Zigler professor of psychology at Yale and head of the psychology section of the Child Study Center there Those who argue against heavy disipline may be accused of being too tenderminded but today there is total consensus among behavioral scientists that hard disipline is counterproductive It only teaches children that people who are big and strong can do what they want Much of the gettough impulse seems to originate in adult insecurity and the American fixation with power hierarchies Whos in charge Whos on top Whos No 1 When grownups feel powerless one response is to take it out on children Most concrete kinds of violence come from adults who are themselves vulnerable in some way commented Dr Robert Coles the child psychiatrist who teaches at Harvard For instance when unemployment strikes children become objects for adult rage and frustration Among men especially violence toward children is connected to bitter feelings of worthlessness and powerlessness  Children have always been readily available scapegoats for female impotence and anger But now without animals to tame or frontiers to conquer with no control over economic conditions and world events with women in revolt and machines displacing workers men may look to children as the last subjects of male domination When gender class and racial supremacy fail who but children will anchor the bottom of the chain of command The truth is that many people who consider themselves childloving sentimentalists love only docile and respectful children They are not so fond of independent freethinking quirky or opinionated children who are critical of adults The defiant child magnifies adult impotence The vulnerable child reminds us of our human frailty The selfsufficient child proves us dispensable Believing that children are intrinsically bad frees adults to be cruel and punitive In many cases the psychological and political dynamics of power are intertwined Some people with heavy responsibilities can live with their envy of carefree youth only if adults have the ultimate control of childrens freedom these people oppose any advance in childrens rights for fear it will rob them of that edge Other people feel their educational or intellectual superiority threatened by precocious children who are too smart for their own good or by child advocates whom they accuse of trying to undermine parents authority Still others suffer the existential knowledge that each year added to a childs age is a year stolen from a parents youth Altogether these diffuse resentments can make children the most powerless people of all seem privileged  and give adults unconscious reasons to retaliate against them Moreover it is not just extremists who get tough on children and ignore their needs Millions of moderate citizens protest the cost of public education childcare centers infanthealth programs and food stamps and worry about their property values when juvenile facilities are planned for their neighborhoods In this supposed childloving country most of us quietly tolerate a situation in which one disabled child in five is not getting an education and 13 percent of our 17yearolds 47 percent of black youths are functionally illiterate The poorest people in the land are kids More babies die at birth in the United States than in 14 other countries One child in six gets no health care at all Eighteen million have never seen a dentist More than a million have serious drinking problems A quarter of a million youngsters try to commit suicide annually 10000 succeed and homicide has become one of the five leading causes of childrens deaths  with parents or stepparents responsible for a third of them On official levels mistreatment of children can mean cutting 28 percent of Federal nutrition programs or it can mean maintaining a public policy that answers real suffering with benign neglect We may be a youthoriented society Dr Coles commented but what we love is youth not children A few weeks ago during the Governors Conference 250 state officials from around the nation gathered in Portland Maine to consider state initiated solutions to childrens problems The wellchosen title of their threeday symposium was Americas Children Need Powerful Friends Given the obsession with adult power over children the idea of using adult power for children is refreshing Having powerful friends in high places is the only hope for those with neither the vote the voice nor the economic clout to fight for themselves The question is as the cult of toughness gains more converts where are childrens friends going to come from

ACADEMIC RESEARCH AND BIG BUSINESS: A DELICATE BALANCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/11/magazine/academic-research-and-big-business-a-delicate-balance.html,HOWARD M GOODMAN IS A brilliant molecular biologist and dedicated teacher And in this revolutionary era of corporate science he has also become an astute businessman Two and a half years ago Goodman made a singular proposal to the officers of the West German based Hoechst AG one of the worlds largest chemical companies Give me enough money to create a 100person department of molecular biology at an American university guarantee me 10 years of unrestricted basic research and in exchange Ill let you see what I do Hoechsts response was to offer Goodman nearly 70 million probably the largest single grant ever made in biology When it came to writing a contract Hoechst negotiated an important extra for itself If Goodman should turn up something potentially marketable Hoechst would have the exclusive option to license and develop it The company would not however have the right to suggest moneymaking directions the research might take Hoechst was happy in spite of its limited role and so was Howard Goodman Others were more skeptical Every institution that depends on the Federal Government for any or all of its financing is staring in the face of a 200 billion national deficit that continues to grow beyond the control of even a conservative Republican President and that paradoxically seems to leave less money for everyone The university is no exception Federal funding for basic scientific research increased at a healthy rate of 59 percent annually  after inflation  between 1976 and 1980 Then the rate of increase came to a virtual standstill and in fact declined slightly President Reagans fiscal 1984 budget request proposes an 85 percent increase for basic science  well above the projected inflation rate of about 5 percent But although the new figure sounds generous it is influenced somewhat by a 103 percent increase for Defense Department basic research Funds for basic research in the health sciences are slated to increase by only 3 percent And at the National Institutes of Health which finance 40 percent of all biomedical research in the country the proposed increase of 73 million for a total budget of 41 billion is only 18 percent The NIH pays for nearly twothirds of basic university science The irony is that new discoveries in the life sciences are proliferating at an unprecedented rate In molecular biology the possibilities that have emerged in the last four or five years seem to layman and specialist alike positively breathtaking Researchers in this field are synthesizing insulin and growth hormone as well as interferon and some vaccines that were previously rare expensive or unavailable New techniques for investigating cancer and other diseases as well as all sorts of genetic disorders are also within the realm of this research Applications of geneticengineering techniques to agriculture will result in equally revolutionary changes probably within the next two decades Scientists talk about genetically engineered bacteria that will eat up oil spills and pollutants about cloning livestock about developing pestresistant and selffertilizing strains of food crops The technology is there All that is lacking is money For the cost of this research is also burgeoning at the very moment when traditional sources of funding seem to be evaporating like liquid nitrogen in a chemistryclass experiment President Reagan would like to shift the burden for many Federal programs from the public to the private sector And in the sciences the private sector is more than willing to take on that burden for the potential profit to be reaped in these fields is enormous Industry which earlier predicted and profited from the commercial possibilities of electronics and chemistry is now investing its money in biotechnology Hoechsts 70 million has gone to Massachusetts General Hospital  the original and largest teaching hospital of Harvard Medical School and one of the most highly respected healthcare and teaching institutions in the country Mass General as it is widely known is not the only eminent institution to open the doors of its biomedical research labs to industry In recent months several companies have given huge sums of money in return for promises of patents or licenses that might derive from various lines of research E I du Pont de Nemours  Company gave Harvard Medical School 6 million to be used by its department of genetics The Celanese Corporation gave Yale 11 million for enzyme studies the BristolMyers Company gave Yale 3 million for the production of anticancer drugs W R Grace  Company gave MIT up to 85 million for commercial applications of microbi ology research Monsanto gave 235 million to Washington University for research in medical uses of proteins and peptides and 4 million to Rockefeller University for research in photosynthesis Monsanto also gave 23 million to Harvard in 1977 for cancer research Where industry hasnt nudged its way into the university it is luring scientists out So many academics have been hired as parttime consultants to industry that a year or two ago an investment company looking for an unaffiliated molecular biologist reportedly approached 20 researchers before it found one without a commercial tie Today scientists agree it would be difficult to find even that one among the top researchers so rapid and comprehensive has the entanglement with industry been Some scientists have quit academia altogether Among the most notable is Walter Gilbert a Nobel Prizewinning biochemist who gave up a tenured position at Harvard when he became chief executive officer of the multinational firm Biogen SA which he also helped to found Other academics have also established their own companies Genentech Inc formed by scientists from the University of California looked so promising that its stock jumped from 35 to 88 a share within hours of its first public offering in October 1980 Genentech soon leveled off and in late August was trading at about 43 a share Harvard not wanting to miss the biotechnology boom tried out another step in the universityindustry waltz That same October it announced that it was considering forming its own profitmaking biotechnology company of which it would be a minority stockholder The uproar over conflict of interest that greeted this plan made the front pages of newspapers around the country Three weeks later Harvard abandoned the plan Mark F Ptashne the Harvard biochemist who conceived the idea went on to found the independent Genetics Institute with another Harvard molecular biologist Thomas P Maniatis Both remain on the Harvard faculty Expectations for quick profits from biotechnology have moderated somewhat since then Geneticengineering research has turned out to be more expensive and more timeconsuming than was initially predicted and analysts have pushed the projection of big profits farther into the future But no one doubts that they are there When Biogen went public this spring the entire 575 million offering was sold out by the start of trading the day it was first publicly offered If the potential profits are enormous so are the potential problems that go with this shift in funding The university had long held profitmaking and collaboration with profitmakers at arms length Basic research  the scientific quest for knowledge that may or may not lead to anything practical and that underlies most subsequent applied uses of science  has been the scientists purest enterprise But basic research does not often yield measurable profits And if industry ever supplants the Federal Government as the primary supporter of basic research many fear that it may not tolerate possibly pointless meandering by scientists who could be zeroing in on needed and profitable products Is research conducted under profitmaking auspices an acceptable alternative to publicsponsored study Academia is struggling with this question and its no less difficult corollaries The motive force of industry is profit Lawrence G Crowley the president of the Stanford University Hospital recently told a Yale symposium and the mode is secrecy and proprietary control of information The motive force of the university is the pursuit of knowledge and the mode is open to an exchange of ideas and unrestricted publication The question is whether these two worlds can be bridged    Will faculty appointments come to be determined by the amount of money a researcher can bring in rather than the quality of his work Will the quality of teaching deteriorate as professors are increasingly distracted by moneymaking consulting deals or grants from industry Will applied research shoulder aside basic research as industry moves into the university And if it does who will do that essential work And where Can the scientist continue to fulfill his traditional obligations to society if his salary is being paid by industry The Hoechst contract provides an opportunity to look in detail at some of these issues MOLECULAR BIOLOGY IS A new field and the top molecular biologists like Howard Goodman are young capable and efficient The legendary absent minded professor would drown in the sea of grant proposals research papers and administrative and teaching duties that are an inescapable part of the modern scientists life Such demands notwithstanding one recent morning in Boston as Goodman and I were finishing a discussion during breakfast about the need for todays scientists to be organized he began patting his pockets and searching through his coat Then he announced sheepishly that he had locked his keys in the car Goodman has intense blue eyes sandy hair a red beard and the energetic encouraging manner of a college basketball coach He speaks the arcane language of molecular biology with the distinctive twang of Brooklyn where he was born and Long Island where he grew up After studying physics at Williams College in Massachusetts he received his PhD in biophysics from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology He did postgraduate work at the Medical Research Council in Cambridge England and in Geneva where he met Deborah Cohen whom he married in 1969 Their daughter Sylena was born six years later In 1970 he moved to the University of California at San Francisco There in 1977 a year after he was made a full professor he William J Rutter and other UCSF colleagues succeeded in transplanting the genetic instructions for making insulin from a rat cell to an E coli bacterium This was the first time scientists had transferred the genetic code for the manufacture of insulin or any other hormone and it was a crucial development in recombinant DNA technology At the age of 41 when Goodman approached Hoechst he was a major figure in the field of molecular biology He was also well known to Hoechst having served briefly as a Hoechst consultant in the late 1970s The chemical company wasted no time signing him on Seven months after Goodmans proposal the Hoechst department as the journal Science irreverently referred to it was a fait accompli  The only major change was in location Goodman had hoped to set up the department at San Francisco but the bureaucracy of a public university proved too much of an obstacle Massachusetts General was simultaneously wooing Goodman to head a proposed department of molecular biology And when Goodman decided to make the move he offered Mass General the unexpected dividend of Hoechsts 70 million A year and a half later Goodman was at work having assembled a preliminary staff of 50 which included Frederick Ausubel a plant physiologist from Harvard University Senior researchers like Ausubel are recommended by a search committee and appointed to the Harvard Medical School faculty after consultation with Hoechst which does not have the power to veto a candidate Ausubel was attracted by the opportunity to pursue research projects that he might have found difficult to fund elsewhere Postdoctoral fellows in Goodmans lab are the cream of the crop according to one staffer They are mostly graduates of the top PhD programs in biological sciences including those at MIT the University of Wisconsin and Harvard The doctoral candidates also are among the most promising graduates of Harvard Radcliffe and UCSF Staff members from Goodman to the technicians to the secretaries are paid according to NIH and Mass General standards Their salaries are not affected by the Hoechst contract Goodman prefers not to discuss his own salary Goodman occupies a tiny modern office in the departments provisional quarters at Mass Generals Jackson Tower A permanent laboratory almost three times the size of the two spacious floors already alloted to Goodmans staff is scheduled to open in the new Wellman Research Building next year The Jackson lab is open and bright with high Formica topped work tables jutting out from one wall like Manhattan piers in the Hudson River Refrigerators centrifuges and other equipment line the opposite wall The Wellman lab will be built on the same design but a larger scale Nearly 20 million of Goodmans funds from Hoechst will cover renovation construction and equipment for the two laboratories Despite the fact that Howard Goodman has a little more money to spend and less paperwork to do to get it the daytoday operations of his lab are pretty much standard procedure for a university environment The smoothness of his operation however was not achieved effortlessly Mass General Hoechst and Goodman spent months negotiating a contract that would insure this seemingly normal procedure Goodman wanted no restrictions on the kind of work he could do His own interest is principally in the control and regulation of a certain type of gene particularly genes that trigger the production of hormones He is continuing his longterm study of insulin and is also working with growth hormone As an incidental part of this work Goodman and his colleagues are trying to develop animal models for human genetic diseases A second general area of study in Goodmans lab is the process of tumor formation in plants afflicted with crown gall disease Ordinarily tumor formation is studied by injecting an animal virus into mice But in these afflicted plants tumors are formed naturally and the plant thus provides a unique opportunity for analyzing the process Frederick Ausubel is studying symbiotic nitrogen fixation Ausubels team and researchers elsewhere would like to figure out how to improve the nitrogenfixing capability of plants Ultimately they hope to make plants especially the major cereal crops able to fix nitrogen directly from the air This would have the most significant impact of any one thing in genetic engineering Ausubel says adding that it is far in the future The contract with Hoechst insures that Goodmans lab is free to pursue these interests as the scientists see fit In many cases of corporate funding for chemistry electronics and applied physics when industry has given money it has also assumed the right to dictate what should and should not be studied Mass General felt this would be an abrogation of one of the most basic of academic freedoms Arthur L Caplan an ethicist at the Hastings Center an organization that deals with ethical issues in the life sciences agrees He feels that most universities give up too much in this regard in exchange for corporate dollars When you take money from companies there are almost always strings attached he said recently in an interview in his office overlooking the institutes wellkept Westchester County grounds Its not that the Government doesnt tell its grantees what to do he continued There are restrictions about how fast research must proceed report data that has to be filed and so on But its a different way of dictating how research should be done from what a company says The amount of money the Government allots to different areas of research is an indirect form of Federal restriction he adds A cancer researcher for example has probably found it easier to be financed in the last two decades than someone working on a less targeted disease Companies funnel research in a different way Research is pushed in the direction of productivity  not toward what will lead to the greatest scientific knowledge or what will do the most good for those who have the greatest need said Caplan Since he is not an academic and is therefore removed from the fray Caplan can perhaps be somewhat Olympian in his observations He gloomily predicts an inevitable increase in missionoriented research in universities  applied as opposed to basic studies Companies rarely encourage fishing expeditions he said But it is through fishing expeditions that some of the greatest breakthroughs are made A 1976 study of the origins of 10 important clinical advances in the last 30 years found that basic research    pays off in terms of key discoveries almost twice as handsomely as other types of research and development combined So far Hoechst has not attempted to promote any one direction of research perhaps because the company feels that it has so little knowledge of molecular biology that anything Goodman discovers will be acceptable The only restriction is that research must be in the field of molecular biology says William H Griesar the New York attorney who represented Hoechst in the contract negotiations We dont want Goodman tinkering with combustion engines Goodmans response on hearing this was typically feisty He may not want us tinkering with combustion engines but we could I dont think the contract prohibits us from doing anything It just suggests that the general area of interest is molecular biology Hoechst entered into the contract in the first place Griesar says because it wanted to expand its pharmaceutical division and knew that it needed a sudden infusion of knowledge in the field of biotechnology That knowledge wasnt available in West Germany so Hoechst was delighted and interested when Goodman came forward with his proposal The German public was not so delighted when it heard about this exodus of German cash The Germans felt that theyd fallen behind And they had Griesar says Hoechst may or may not make money on what comes out of Goodmans lab An oftenquoted formula is that only one in 10 discoveries results in a patent one in 10 patents results in a license and one in 10 licenses yields more than 25000 a year Griesar asserts that at any rate patents are not the point Hoechst came into this with a student mentality he insists You could say it was like buying a library card for one of the better libraries in the world in genetic engineering At close to 70 million over a 10year period it is an expensive library card but still a minuscule portion of Hoechsts annual budget of 270 million for pharmaceutical research For Hoechst Griesar says the most important inducement was that Goodman would permit Hoechst scientists to observe firsthand what he was doing The contract stipulates that Hoechst may send up to four trainees at a time to work in the department provided only that they have acceptable academic qualifications Dr Hansgeorg Gareis the chief Hoechst negotiator and a biochemist by training seemed to feel that once his delegates were in the laboratory they could take what they had learned back to West Germany and develop patentable inventions there The agreement permits Hoechst to develop the expertise to produce moneymaking products while allowing Goodman to pursue basic research For Mass General this is a crucial aspect of the contract Research and development are inextricably linked in the corporate scientific world many university scientists make the transition from academy to corporation and back again without hesitation But both Goodman and the hospital felt that within the university environment basic and applied science must be kept separate or at least that the intention of developing products must be kept out It becomes a fine line Goodman admits I dont see it happening but I cant say that there wont be a case where the practical and the scientific are so close together that it wouldnt be worth doing that one more step But I think its better done in a directed way by a company that has a motive for doing it Other industryuniversity collaborations have not drawn such a clear distinction between basic and applied research Monsantos contract with Washington University signed in June 1982 is more typical It specifies that the researchers direct 30 percent of their work toward basic knowledge and 70 percent toward specific product development Nevertheless the Hoechst patent department wanted a guarantee that nobody else was going to make money on its investment It was therefore written into the contract that any inventions made by researchers funded exclusively by Hoechst would result in exclusive licenses to Hoechst with Mass General retaining the patent The contract guarantees the department 497 million between 1981 and 1990 for operating costs If in any one year Goodman should want to exceed its yearly budget he doesnt foresee doing it which averages out to 6 million a year beginning in 1984 the contract gives Hoechst firstrefusal rights to the funding of any additional research If the company declines to finance the proposed research Goodman or his colleagues may apply to the NIH or other Government sources or with written notice to Hoechst to another corporation Goodman and Mass General are satisfied that this is a more than adequate guarantee of the right to pursue any research projects they choose The potential for misuse of Government funds under that very guarantee however led to an investigation by Representative Albert Gore Jr Democrat of Tennessee and chairman of the subcommittee on investigations and oversight of the House Committee on Science and Technology Is a foreign chemical company skimming the cream produced by decades of taxpayerfunded work Gore asked at the start of a two day hearing in June 1981 Unsatisfied by the testimony of Dr Ronald LamontHavers the director of research at Mass General Gore requested a copy of the then confidential contract which he later submitted to the United States Comptroller General for scrutiny The Comptroller found no illegality in the contract  no misuse of the more than 30 million a year in NIH funding that Mass General receives At the same time however the Comptrollers report warned that care must be taken    that no Federal funds directly or indirectly support the research leading to an invention if MGH is to claim that the terms of a Government funding agreement do not apply A footnote adds that an invention funded by the NIH may be used as a building block for an invention funded exclusively by Hoechst In spite of assurances from the hospital that it was willing to comply and despite statements of confidence in this willingness by the NIH Representative Gore remains skeptical In a recent interview he expressed concern about a clause in the contract that says in the case of discoveries made with collaborative funding Hoechst shall pursue the most favorable license obtainable ideally an exclusive worldwide license That same clause however goes on to say that in any event a nonexclusive worldwide license would do Gore is also worried that Hoechstsponsored scientists may be sharing equipment bought with NIH funds or in other ways indirectly benefiting from taxpayer money For Goodman this turn of events is ironic I would have thought the hard thing would be to convince Hoechst to make this as open as it is and I was surprised that the Government came in and said in effect Look you better build a wall a fence around yourselves so you dont contaminate the Government things  The NIH itself is confident that it is getting its due Dr William F Raub the deputy director of extramural research and training at the NIH was the chairman of a committee that made an inspection visit to Boston in December 1981 What we found on our site visit he says was that Mass General had anticipated virtually every problem that any of us could think of and had made provisions  we thought to the very best of their ability  to insure that first and foremost the obligations of Mass General to US funding sources primarily the NIH would be honored In a way the fact that Hoechst is a foreign company is a red herring for the deeper issues  the issues that are causing responsible academics to search their scientific souls  are irrelevant to the companys country of origin Productoriented research isnt the only concern of those who question industrialacademic agreements Another is that scientists knowing there is potential profit at stake for them or their funder may become secretive about their work The MonsantoWashington University contract has a secrecy clause written in According to the contract technical developments may not be published without the agreement of Monsanto and until publication such developments must remain secret for a period of two years with a twoyear renewal option Even more unusual for university science but standard for industry is the clause in the same contract that says that under certain circumstances faculty may be required to sign personal commitments of confidentiality Goodman is sure there will be no such inhibitions in his lab The Mass General contract says that scientists will be free to collaborate with others Its such a free flowing thing says Goodman that anything is almost instantaneously communicated Moreover Goodman and the other senior researchers in the department will all be on the faculty of Harvard Medical School In addition to being chairman of the department of molecular biology Goodman is a professor in the genetics department and plans to work closely with Philip Leder that departments chairman Leders work is paid for in part by Du Pont Although Goodman is expected to give several lectures at the medical school his teaching duties will mostly take place in the lab Science is a collaborative pursuit Communication between scientists is essential One idea leads to another and a scientist these days rarely discovers anything all by himself The method of formal communication is the publication of papers The Hoechst agreement requires Mass General scientists to submit papers to Hoechst at least 30 days in advance of submission to a journal so the Hoechst patent lawyers can make sure that anything patentable is not made public before the rights have been secured Ordinarily a Mass General scientist submits a patent disclosure to the hospitals Office of Technology Administration set up in 1978 to monitor patenting and consulting arrangements when he first realizes he might have something patentable but before he is ready to publish his findings Under the Hoechst contract the scientist still submits that disclosure to the OTA but the administrator must immediately advise the company of the invention The researcher will also submit a draft of the final paper directly to Hoechst although the company cannot request a delay in publication The Washington University contract perhaps more typical because it is oriented toward developmental research gives Monsanto the right to request a delay in publication for a reasonably brief period In spite of this and other restrictions Dr David M Kipnis head of the department of internal medicine at Washington testified at a Gore committee hearing in June 1982 that he was confident that this arrangement will in no way hamper the free flow of scientific information Everyone involved in industrial financing of academic research professes allegiance to the principle of academic freedom but to critics the problem is exactly how this freedom is to be insured There have been several meetings recently to discuss these issues including one at Pajaro Dunes Calif in March 1982 and another in Philadelphia last December The results of these gatherings have been strong on principle but vague on particulars Last year in response to a request from Representative Gore the Association of American Universities put out a fivepage statement outlining suggestions for guidelines for corporateuniversity collaborations These included some broad general principles and announced the intention to set up a clearinghouse for future discussions Increasingly universities have been publishing their own guidelines for outside consulting work done by researchers Most universities restrict the amount of a faculty members consulting work Harvard Stanford Yale and MIT permit scientists to devote one day a week to consulting for industry How do you qualify a scientists time asks MITs Nobel Prizewinning microbiologist David Baltimore who like Goodman divides his day between science and administering a large well endowed department Are you in an administrative or research mode when you write a grant proposal And what about the showertime issue What do you think about when youre in the shower When youre not at the university Last December Yale announced that it would require annual disclosure by faculty members of consulting arrangements or substantial investment in a corporation The University of California recently required faculty members to disclose their holdings and as a result of those disclosures forced three professors to end or alter corporatesponsored research grants In one case the professor in charge of the university laboratory was also president and sole owner of the sponsoring company Harvard which published similar guidelines in May had earlier insisted that Walter Gilbert give up either his tenured chair or his executive position with Biogen Gilbert responded by giving up academe altogether Neither Harvard Medical School nor Mass General has made public its policies but Howard Goodman says that the hospital requires disclosure of financial interests to the department chairman who in turn reports to the Office of Technology Administration Most schools are muddling along on their own for now Massachusetts General hopes that its Hoechst contract will serve as a model John Robert Buchanan a physician whose smoothness contrasts with the gruff informality of preoccupied scientists like Goodman and Baltimore became general director of Mass General after the Hoechst agreement was signed Although the venture is not without risks he says he is glad they did it I think its one of our responsibilities he said This kind of institution is in place in part to do things that are innovative departures from the usual and customary We do it in all kinds of endeavors Thats our social role Nevertheless the full text of the Hoechst contract was not released until October 1981 five months after it was signed and four months after Representative Gore threatened to subpoena the material When asked about this Buchanan said that he was glad it had been made public and suggested that the hospital had been trying to avoid the controversy over detail that arises in such situations Buchanan  like others responsible for finding money to pay for research  sees private support as insurance I guess if you were to ask me if it were better to support basic research from multiple bases he says even mindful that some of these bases carry conditions to which we are not fully accustomed Id have to say yes that the potential good outweighs the risks even though the risks may be regarded as grave by some He does not believe that the Hoechst contract should be seen as a single base of support because he says support from other areas is not precluded Obviously Id like to see the agreement renewed he adds but over the time of that guaranteed support wise and prudent people would be seeking support through competitive mechanisms of the NIH and others And I believe that certain investigators coming into the laboratory will bring with them a certain amount o
 support which we wont ask them to give up Buchanan would also like to see Goodmans staff apply for Federal grants because this would keep them within the competitive process which includes a review of the proposal by a group of the scientistspeers chosen by the NIH One of the lessthanperfect aspects of even the best corporate arrangements is the loss of this peer review which is an intrinsic part of NIH funding The Hoechst agreement attempts to compensate for this by providing for regular meetings of a scientific advisory committee made up of two representatives from Mass General two from Hoechst and four from outside academic institutions chosen by the commit tee itself But Buchanan still prefers the NIH peer review It just isnt possible to get the same array of talent and energy to the process that the NIH can mount he says Scientists at other institutions agree David Baltimore is the director of the Whitehead Institute for Biomedical Research at MIT an administratively independent research facility set up with money given by the industrialist Edwin C Whitehead it also has seen its share of controversy With something like Hoechst says David Baltimore whose research projects are still financed primarily by the Federal Government young investigators arent able to establish a track record When they go out into the real world they may find it hard to get along Baltimore also feels that the NIH process makes a scientist accountable in a public way  scientifically accountable Some fear that researchers in this lucrative field will be corrupted by money once the purity of the university is breached Virginity is a word that constantly recurs in these discussions Derek C Bok the president of Harvard thinks not The quality of disinterestedness has never been universally achieved in practice he writes in his book Beyond the Ivory Tower Social Responsibilities of the Modern University Even Galileo tried to sell his inventions for money Modernday Galileos are motivated by competition the lure of prizes the snares of vanity and fame Still Harvards guidelines for outside consul tation include not just a time limitation but also a proscription on assuming an executive position in a corporation if there is a conflict of interest Many consultants are paid a flat fee for their work but sometimes corporations issue stock or stock options instead Some critics believe that this is when a potential conflict of interest arises since a consultant may own a substantial portion of a company and continue to work for the university The stock can be valuable When Collaborative Research Inc announced that it was going public in December 1981 it was reported that David Baltimore who had obviously been a valued consultant owned 316965 shares of stock estimated to be worth between 16 and 19 a share Walter Gilberts 460000 shares of Biogen make him a paper millionaire many times over as the stock traded at about 15 a share in late August Gilbert of course is no longer associated with Harvard As for Baltimore neither he nor MIT feels that his holdings pose a conflict From the point of view of taking advantage of the university research laboratory Baltimore said it doesnt matter if you have an equity interest in an outside company Its the time spent away from the university that could be significant But as long as you are conscious of the fact that your primary loyalty is to the university there should be no problem One point that everyone agrees on is that the funding of research must continue to be primarily the responsibility of the Federal Government The NIH must always be the major supporter of biomedical research in this country says Ronald LamontHavers of Mass General who also supports industrys role in the university He seems to enjoy discussing the ethical opposition to his position as he leans back precariously in his chair with his feet up on the desk Industry cant hope to cover the tremendous breadth of research in biomedical areas he admits pointing out that all sorts of discoveries might be lost if industry tried to take over No one can predict in what areas the great advances will come Further industry makes almost no contribution to the training of young scientists Dr Lamont Havers says The money goes to wellestablished figures That training of course is crucial Industry taking over the bulk of support would be disastrous But  and here critics of industrial support may part company with him  industrial support as a supplement provides an important element of stability In a sparsely furnished upstairs office at his home in Cambridge I talked with Sheldon Krimsky an associate professor of urban and environmental policy at Tufts University A former member along with Baltimore of the Federal recombinant DNA advisory committee Krimsky is worried Weve always had scientists who could blow the whistle when something seemed to be going amiss he says And now fewer and fewer of these people are available because of the industry ties We need someone who can ask where the technology is moving Earlier Art Caplan at the Hastings Center had expressed much the same sentiment I worry about scientists becoming what we in the ethics trade call double agents A classic example is when a physician works in industrial health Who is his master To illustrate his point Caplan mentioned the asbestos industry in which company doctors for years failed to reveal the dangers of working with the toxic mineral Representative Gore too sees a need for disinterested scientists Our public policy makers are going to be presented in the next few years with problems that will be just excruciating  that may resemble in difficulty the questions surrounding abortion decisions about trait selection cloning sex selection Still for Howard Goodman the Hoechst agreement is pretty close to ideal It should be since he wrote it His original fivepage proposal has been realized in almost every detail He believes that the major effects have been extremely positive We can take a chance on doing some more interesting science sometimes he explains Because Goodman and his colleagues arent constantly applying for grants they dont have to be constantly showing results Most private and public funding situations are highly pressured these days There just isnt enough money to go around If you have a grant for three years and youre not fairly productive well youre not going to get refunded Goodman says That pressure probably produces a lot of good science but you tend to see people doing the breadand butter problems the ones they know are going to work We have more flexibility We have some stability We can take on the more interesting but chancy kind of experiment So for all the controversy and in spite of the difficult questions of principle it raises for Howard Goodman the arrangement works The proof of the pudding is that we have great people and on all the floors on every bench at all hours of the day and night people are doing science he says By and large everybody is happy Massachusetts General Hospital is a powerful and prestigious institution That it was able to negotiate a contract favorable to its interests and which appeared to preserve academic freedom indicates that it may be possible for the university and industry to coexist But whether this kind of agreement turns out to be the rule or the exception remains to be seen Mass General was in a negotiating position that few institutions can equal Hoechst needed the kind of knowledge the medical center could provide Dr Goodman was an exceptional lure Other institutions may have a harder time preserving their independence against the interests of their benefactors,,
PRIVACY VS. COMPUTERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/12/opinion/privacy-vs-computers.html,Dramatic advances in information technology that allow computerized data banks to communicate with one another have far outpaced the development of legal controls that protect individual freedom Unless something is done we may be heading for a time when ones ability to exercise control over personal information about oneself is as a practical matter a thing of the past Obviously Government dossierbuilding long predates the computer And as the exploits of J Edgar Hoovers Federal Bureau of Investigation attest manually kept records containing factual data and the gossipy observations that defy computer coding can wreak havoc with individual lives and indeed with our political system Still the relative inefficiency of the manual systems was a safeguard of sorts The Federal Governments appetite for data about its citizens is insatiable It is estimated for example that the Government maintains an average of 15 files on each American And a study by New York States Committee on Open Government two years ago found that state agencies kept 1776 separate data systems containing 10799 categories of information about New Yorkers Each different system contained between two million and 10 million records What is this information that the Government finds so crucial It runs the gamut from tax and business records to certain medical prescriptions and records pertaining to abortions Only last June it was reported that New York drivers participating in the states drinking driver program had to complete a questionnaire about their sex lives as a condition for reinstating their licenses Once the data is gathered it usually remains on file whether it is needed or not v Add the capacity to link one data bank to another and the potential for social control multiplies About half of the information held by New York State agencies is regularly shared with other Federal and state agencies Computermatching programs in which one agency checks its records against anothers or those of a business have become common Thus information collected by one agency for a specific often routine and rather innocuous purpose can be used by another agency for a different end Consider the following examples  To facilitate an investigation of Spanishsurname households in order to locate illegal aliens the Federal Immigration and Naturalization Service sought  unsuccessfully  to gain access last year to the New York City Board of Educations computerized file of one million students  The Selective Service System crosschecks draft registration lists with Social Security and motor vehicle records to apprehend young men who have failed to register  The Internal Revenue Service has just announced that it will match life style data compiled by various business information services with its own files to trigger tax audits The list goes on and on Regardless of the use to which they are put these procedures raise a host of complicated and important issues including the right against selfincrimination the presumption of innocence and the right to personal privacy that have yet to be adequately addressed The legal protections so carefully worked out in the Federal Privacy Act of 1974 have been rendered largely ineffective and outmoded in the new computer age Moreover it remains to be seen whether computermatching programs are as costeffective as their proponents claim The concern over computermatching was the subject of Senate hearings last December and continues to be an object of Congressional scrutiny Closer to home New Yorks recently enacted Personal Privacy Protection Law follows the lead of nine other states in requiring written standards to govern the collection maintenance and dissemination of personal information Beginning in 1984 New Yorkers will have the right to see a copy of most of the records held on them by state agencies to challenge any inaccuracies and to see an account of disclosures from their files It is too early to tell the degree to which the act will restrict use of computermatching techniques Disappointingly the Committee on Open Government which is charged with implementing the new law is largely relegated to an advisory role and certain health and criminal justice records are exempted from the laws coverage Nonetheless Governor Cuomo and the Legislature deserve credit for these first important steps forward Without more such concerted efforts personal privacy may become another victim of the computer revolution like index cards alphabetized by last name and stored in metal file cabinets
"FOR KINSEY INSTITUTE, NEW RESEARCH EFFORTS",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/14/garden/for-kinsey-institute-new-research-efforts.html,THIRTY years ago today when universities could still court ridicule and political reprisals for sponsoring research about human sexuality the Alfred C Kinsey Institute of Indiana University published Sexual Behavior in the Human Female an 860page book that documented Americas changing views on sexual conduct and enhanced the effort to establish sex research as a legitimate field of scholarly inquiry The book like its 1948 predecessor Sexual Behavior in the Human Male quickly became a best seller and further established the Kinsey Institute whose headquarters is in Bloomington as a world leader in sex research a role that persists The response was tremendous said Dr Paul Gebhard an associate of the late Dr Kinsey in recalling the appearance of the book on women which far exceeded the reaction to the first volume Suddenly sex was no longer a taboo subject Everyone it seemed wanted to know more about womens attitudes toward sex and what had influenced those attitudes This was a far cry from the 1940s when we started researching the sexual practices of both men and women The public thought we were kooks then Now though hampered by continuing budgetary problems the institute is continuing the work Dr Kinsey pioneered At the same time under its new director Dr June Machover Reinsch it is trying to broaden its scope in related fields and to encourage other scholars to tap its resources Dr Kinsey a prominent zoologist who had spent most of his academic career studying wasps decided to concentrate on human sexual behavior after he took a marriagepreparation course designed for students In the late 1930s and 40s when he began his studies of sexuality he believed that it warranted objective scientific research so he and his small staff of anthropologists statisticians and psychologists began conducting intensive interviews of men and women When they undertook their project on women interviewing 5950 across the county they found that half their subjects were not virgins when they married and that a fourth of married women had engaged in extramarital relations Even more shocking to the public was the institutes finding that 77 percent of the married women who had engaged in premarital sex did not regret having done so From its beginning in 1947 the institute had financial problems Dr Kinsey funded his initial studies out of his pocket and then persuaded Indiana University the Rockefeller Foundation and the National Research Council a Federal agency to sponsor his investigations on a somewhat larger scale As it turned out the institute never received more than a few hundred thousand dollars from those sources The institutes 198384 budget is in excess of 550000 most of it from the Federal Government this time which is not always the case Although sex education and research have become more socially acceptable funds are more difficult to find because the Federal Government and foundations are reluctant to support basic research such as that of Dr Kinseys To appeal to more potential funding sources the institute in broadening its field is undertaking research in prenatal development menstrual disorders and other biomedical subjects once considered outside its sphere Its new name the Kinsey Institute for Research in Sex Gender and Reproduction reflects its new mission The money crunch has also caused it to abandon Dr Kinseys policy of having all his researchers concentrate on one or two vast projects It is supporting 10 smaller projects ranging from a historical analysis of how the rise of Nazism affected the development of sexology to a psychological study of how personality traits and personal attitudes relate to stress and amenorrhea the absence of menstruation The changes in format which began in 1981 when the university considered closing the institute but decided against it because of its wide reputation have caused concern among the staff and other leaders in the field who are worried about the direction of American sex research The Kinsey Institute has had to get into biomedical research because that is the only way it can survive today said Dr John Money professor of medical psychology and pediatrics at the Johns Hopkins Hospital and chairman of the institutes scientific advisory board Many good projects like the ones Dr Kinsey did cannot get funding today because the attitude is that sex research is frivolous and something that America can live without The institute is working with endocrinologists and professionals from other disciplines because of the shortage of sex researchers There are probably less than 100 professionals in the United States who devote more than 50 percent of their time to sex research said Dr Gebhard who took over the institute after Dr Kinseys death in 1956 and retired as director in 1982 Unlike the 60s people who might have gone into sex research are going into other fields because they can be assured of earning a living and getting promoted in academia Dr Wardell B Pomeroy a former Kinsey associate who is now academic dean of the Institute for Advanced Study of Human Sexuality in San Francisco believes that there is a backlash against sex researchThe efforts to rescind the abortion law and resistence to homosexuals makes it difficult for places like the Kinsey Institute to study controversial topics he explained Despite the risk the Kinsey Institute is continuing to support controversial research like that of Dr Joseph Harry a Northern Illinois University sociologist who is studying the differences between homosexuals and heterosexuals in suicide attempts According to many who work in the field much of the credit for the institutes new direction goes to Dr Reinsch a former New Yorker who became director in 1982 A pioneer in research on the effects of drugs on unborn children she got the institute involved in an investigation of the underlying causes of sexual behavior Her research at Rutgers University has shown that children exposed before birth to certain drugs are more likely than their unexposed siblings to respond aggressively when presented with hypothetical situations She is now studying the longterm effects hormones taken by pregnant women have on children Her grant of 204300 from the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development was one of two major awards received by the institute during the 198283 academic year Though her interest is in behavioral endocrinology and child development Dr Reinsch has made an effort to continue the more sociological and behavioral studies in the Kinsey pattern In October 16 highschool seniors from New York and other states will participate in a conference on adolescent life styles They will be asked how students in their white uppermiddleclass communities feel about sex education contraception and other matters The institute would like to expand the study to include black workingclass and other adolescents to get a more complete view We also are considering reinterviewing the men and women who participated in the original studies because that would give us a good idea of how attitudes toward sex change over a lifetime said Dr Reinsch Each year a few of them show up in Bloomington and tell us how much it meant to them to participate in those studies Unlike the reticent Dr Kinsey who jealously guarded the institutes library and research materials Dr Reinsch has opened them up to scholars and the public Lawyers have used the library to research cases on incest and historians have studied the institutes collection of erotica said to be the largest in the world Last year the small staff answered more than 1300 requests for information Im hoping that the more scholars and the public know us the more they will support us said Dr Reinsch who is no stranger to publicity having worked as a promoter for the musical group Sly and the Family Stone before she went to graduate school Dr William H Masters chairman of the board of the Masters and Johnson Institute in St Louis commented All of us working in the field owe a tremendous debt to Dr Kinsey and the institute If he had not had the determination to do his research and Indiana University had not had the courage to back him my work in the physiology of sex would never have been possible The institute will continue to play an important role in the field because it has set the standards for all of us
PLANNED PARENTHOOD DELETED FROM FEDERAL CHARITY DRIVE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/15/us/planned-parenthood-deleted-from-federal-charity-drive.html,The Federal Office of Personnel Management today ousted Planned Parenthood from its annual Federal employee charity drive handing antiabortion groups a major victory Donald Devine the offices director made the ruling after 10 days of hearings after a Federal judge ordered him to hasten his decision Mr Devine said that Planned Parenthood did not meet financial guidelines for the drive Planned Parenthood which may fight the ruling in Federal court had been a member of the Combined Federal Campaign for 14 years The campaign is the Governments version of the United Way it allows Federal workers to contribute to some 150 charities through one payroll deduction Fraction of Groups Budget Last year Planned Parenthood received about 500000 from the campaign The group has a 170 million budget Dr Richard Glasow director of the education fund for the antiabortion National Right to Life Committee praised the decision as an important step in challenging all Planned Parenthood fundraising Mr Devines decision essentially upheld a ruling by the campaign eligibility committee which ruled two weeks ago that Planned Parenthood did not meet financial guidelines Eligibility Standards Cited At the eligibility hearings Right to Life asserted that Planned Parenthood received more than 50 percent of its funds from the Government and less than 20 percent from the public Both were standards that could disallow participation in the employee campaign Mr Devine took the eligibility committee decision under advisement and held three more days of hearings on Planned Parenthoods application but did not make a decision This is an extremely important decision said Mr Glasow of Right to Life It shows Planned Parenthood does not live up to regulations It shows there are serious questions about their entire operation and that it represents to the Government things that are not true This will cloud all of their financial fundraising across the country Motivation Is Assailed WASHINGTON Sept 14 AP  Planned Parenthood today asserted that its removal from a Federal employee charity drive was motivated by hostility to its activities in regard to abortion Faye Wattleton the president of the Planned Parenthood Federation of America said that Mr Devine of the Federal employee charity office had based his decision not to list Planned Parenthood on his publicly stated opposition to abortion Mr Devine has made no secret of his hostility to the activities of Planned Parenthood she said It is this hostility and not any of the various so called technical issues that are at the root of his decision

"IF THIS IS WASHINGTON, IT MUST BE 'HISPANIC WEEK'",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/16/us/if-this-is-washington-it-must-be-hispanic-week.html,In proclaiming this as Hispanic Heritage Week President Reagan has cast forth a Republican dragnet for that important voting group and left few appeals untried from what lately might be termed his Casa Blanca command post The President beaming under Viva Reagan banners offered a few hesitant words of Spanish Wednesday night at the partys largest fundraising dinner ever with by Hispanic supporters as hosts and he hailed the group as preferring opportunity over welfare or handouts Across the Potomac a niche in the Pentagons corridor of war heroes had been propitiously devoted to Hispanic soldiers And down at the Department of Health and Human Services the first American Hispanic astronaut Franklin Ramon Chang Diaz was on hand for one of the halfdozen Hispanicoriented ceremonies the Administration staged this week We call it Hispanic Hysteria Week  said Bob Neuman of the Democratic National Committee He contended that the Administrations relentless twomonthold emphasis on the Hispanic vote was being viewed among Hispanic people as counterproductive pandering and had produced resentment But Administration strategists say it has already paid off in improved opinion poll ratings for the President Grand Stragety Denied These guys dont know what subtlety is Mr Neuman complained summarizing the point of Democrats and some independent Hispanic groups that the White House courting flies in the face of economic policies that have harmed Hispanic communities Mr Reagan himself rejected such complaints asserting at one event this week My concern is not something new or some grand campaign strategy At an earlier event the appointment of a Hispanic Republican Katherine D Ortega as Treasurer of the United States the President said Mrs Ortega had been named not just because she is Hispanic He thus affirmed that having some Spanish background does not hurt in Republican circles these days Party officials candidly say the President is attempting to build a Hispanic voting buffer to offset expected damage among female and black voters in his presumed reelection bid The Republicans chief Hispanic leader Tirso del Junco a surgeon who is former party chairman in California said that the first polling numbers on the Presidents Hispanic campaign showed Mr Reagans stock rebounding from recession lows back toward the 35 percent approval rating he is counting on He contended that the partys Hispanic drive could entirely neutralize damage from women and blacks in Florida and offset up to half of it in Texas and California Hes Hoping for More Its a question of where we have a better chance  in the black community where 80 percent of the people are against the death penalty where 75 percent are in favor of abortion he said explaining why the focus was on the Hispanic rather than the black vote I would hope the President does even more Dr del Junco said dismissing the charge of pandering by stressing that the Hispanic rise in both parties was long overdue Bettie Baca his rival strategist at the Democratic National Committee said she hoped Mr Reagan kept it up too because heightened Hispanic political interest usually helps the Democrats most Mrs Baca who is deputy vice chairman and director of Hispanic affairs for the Democrats said that Hispanic Americans have long been a part of her partys executive council and not merely the ethnic auxiliary she feels the Republicans are hurriedly constructing We dont feel the Hispanic community will buy into Reagans rhetoric Mrs Baca said Of course Hispanics are pro family  she continued citing one of the Presidents themes But they also want their families to have enough to eat Enchiladas to the Queen Arnold S Torres director of the League of United Latin American Citizens said that right now the President might be enjoying short lived publicity success But once the campaign was under way he said Hispanic voters will look beyond the endorsements of affluent Hispanic Republcians for issues and substance and become more aware of what Mr Torres summarized as a bad record of Aministration cuts in bilingual and other education programs of nutrition aid cutbacks of a weak and late starting record of Hispanic appointments and of attempting to remove the one Hispanic member of the United Statets Commission on Civil Rights as part of a general turnover of the panel Mr Reagans idea of a statement to the Hispanic community is to point out he served enchiladas to the Queen Mr Torres said referring to the luncheon that the Reagans gave at their ranch last summer for Queen Elizabeth II Enchiladas to the queen Come on Privately Republican strategists say even that line works well in the experienced hands of the President and within timeproven blandishments of ethnic politicking Much more important politically says Dr del Junco is the Presidents attention to Latin America as a major issue Democrats however say the reaction of the Miami Hispanic community which is largely antiCastro is one thing while that of Hispanic people along the Texas border who come from a different economic and political background is quite another In any case the White House is planning more Hispanic events and the President while

CARDINAL MEDEIROS OF BOSTON DIES AFTER CORONARY BYPASS OPERATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/obituaries/cardinal-medeiros-of-boston-dies-after-coronary-bypass-operation.html,Humberto Cardinal Medeiros spiritual leader of Bostons Roman Catholics died this morning a day after he underwent emergency heart surgery a church official said Cardinal Medeiros 67 years old died of coronary arrest at 746 AM at St Elizabeths Hospital said the Rev William Helmick the Cardinals secretary Bishop Thomas V Daily chancellor of the archdiocese said he had been elected to handle the daytoday affairs of the archdiocese until the Vatican named a new archbishop Bishop Daily said a funeral mass would be said Friday at Holy Cross Cathedral where the Cardinals body will lie in state A Champion of Workers In 1931 Humberto Medeiros a 16 yearold Portuguese immigrant who had not yet learned English took a job sweeping floors in a textile plant in Fall River Mass for 62 cents a day His experiences then were never forgotten and later as a Bishop in Brownsville Tex and as Archbishop of Boston he would be considered a champion of the immigrant worker the poor and minorities In religious life Cardinal Medeiros was considered an ecclesiastical conservative a fierce opponent of liberalized abortion laws slow to involve himself in Bostons racial problems and a staunch defender of Vatican policies Support for labor unions was to be a continuing concern of the prelates 37 year ministry When he was named Bishop of Brownsville in 1966 farm workers in the Rio Grande valley were threatening a strike and the new Bishop quickly supported the demands of the MexicanAmerican migrant workers At times he would travel with the migrant workers because I want to be with the people who need me For the four years he was head of the Brownsville diocese he spent Christmas and Easter in Texas jails visiting with prisoners and eating prison food Born in the Azores Humberto Sousa Medeiros was born Oct 6 1915 in the village of Arrifes on Sao Miguel Island in the Azores and came to the United States when he was 16 He learned English while working in the mill in Fall River and later attended BMC Rurfee High School By 1940 he was a naturalized citizen studying for the priesthood at Catholic University in Washington where he earned a masters degree and a licentiate in sacred theology After ordination in 1946 he was assistant pastor of parishes in Fall River New Bedford and Somerset Mass In 1949 he studied at the North American College in Rome a school noted for producing future leaders in the American church hierarchy Catholic University awarded him a doctorate in theology in 1952 when he became assistant chancellor of the diocese of Fall River He was later named chancellor chief administrator and vicar for religious in the diocese In 1960 he became pastor of St Michaels parish in Fall River a post he held until Pope Paul VI named him Bishop in 1966 and appointed him to the Brownsville diocese In Brownsville Bishop Medeiros added 18 parishes to the diocese and encouraged the church to sponsor housing projects for the needy He was also chairman of the American bishops committee on Latin America and a member of the bishops committee on farm labor Although a stern administrator he was comfortable with the people of his diocese When Brownsville was recovering from the effects of a hurricane in 1967 he opened the bishops mansion to 11 families and nearly as many dogs made homeless by the storm He was appointed Archbishop of Boston in 1970 to succeed Richard Cardinal Cushing as head of the nations second largest archdiocese The first person not of Irish heritage to lead Bostons two million Roman Catholics he took his post as many Spanishspeaking Catholics were immigrating to the area Although he was an unusually popular archbishop he never won over the archdiocese to the degree of Cardinal Cushing a situation that made it harder for him to exert political influence Despite his experience in dealing with social issues Archbishop Medeiros who was named a Cardinal in 1973 set off several controversies in his years in Boston When he called liberalized abortion the new barbarism Protestant clergymen were quick to protest Remark Angers Residents In one of several periods of racial tension over school busing Cardinal Medeiros said he would not go into the South Boston area where opposition to desegregation and busing was fervent because no one there is listening to me a remark that angered residents of that heavily Catholic area He said his remarks about Catholics there came out of fatigue and anger and he went to South Boston to hold several special masses He had previously been criticized for not becoming involved in efforts to alleviate racial tension but by 1979 Cardinal Medeiros organized an ecumenical coalition that drafted a covenant of justice equity and harmony for Bostonians to sign In 1980 Cardinal Medeiros had a pastoral letter read in the churches of the archdiocese in which he warned parishioners not to vote for candidates who favored liberalized abortion laws While he did not mention specific candidates by name church officials later acknowledged that the remarks were aimed at State Representative Barney Frank and to a lesser extent at United State Representative James M Shannon He opposed however the Catholic Bishops backing of a proposed constitutional amendment that would have allowed states to determine the abortion issues The basis of his opposition was that the amendment did not explicitly outlaw abortions
REAGAN'S CAMPAIGN ADVISERS SAY HE WOULD FACE TOUGH RACE IN '84,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/18/us/reagan-s-campaign-advisers-say-he-would-face-tough-race-in-84.html,A month before the planned formation of a committee to reelect President Reagan his advisers agree that if he decides to run he will face serious political problems winning a second term next year In interviews the advisers said they were troubled that the political coalition that elected Mr Reagan in a landslide in 1980 had greatly atrophied They said that despite the improvement in the Presidents popularity since last year they feared he was not getting enough credit for recent improvements in the economy The advisers said they believed instinctively that Mr Reagan would win if he decided to seek reelection but that he had his work cut out for him We can proceed safely only on one assumption  its going to be a tough race said Senator Paul Laxalt of Nevada general chairman of the Republican Party and the man who is expected to become chairman of Mr Reagans presumed reelection drive The only secure area we have is his Western Rocky Mountain base where his approval rating is in the 60s Senator Laxalt said In the South we only squeaked through last time in a number of states In the Midwest you look at the key states and you cant say theyre in the political sack In the industrial states weve got a lot of work to do Another person chosen to play a key role in the campaign said We put together a very tenuous coalition last time and its no longer there We no longer have Carter to run against And weve really been hurt among bluecollar workers in Ohio Michigan Wisconsin Illinois and Pennsylvania Senator Laxalt and other Republican aides plan to form a reelection committee Oct 15 They said they expected that by Nov 1 the President would signal his own decision to run perhaps by passing an affirmative word to aides perhaps by making a more explicit statement An official announcement however may not come until as late as next year The President has not told me that hes going to be a candidate and I dont think hes told anybody a White House official said But hes been briefed on everything were doing and he hasnt said dont do any of it Im certain hes running but theres always a little apprehension It is common for political aides to speak of the uphill campaigns they must wage and indeed Mr Reagan is expected to have many advantages if he runs Among these are expected to be winning nomination without serious challenge and running while the economy is on the mend Several Problems for Reagan In addition the President does not seem to have been hurt personally by any scandals and he is extremely adept at using the powers of an incumbent to define the issues and put others on the defensive Despite these assets however Mr Reagans aides say they are concerned about several problems For example they say the President must work even harder in the months ahead to improve his standing among workingclass ethnic groups Hispanic Americans and Jews In 1980 Mr Reagans ability to do much better among ethnic groups and Jews than Republicans generally do was essential to his victories in the industrial states and Florida and Hispanic voters appear critical to his chances in Florida and the Southwest in 1984 The fear expressed by aides today is that despite some improvements in his personal poll ratings Mr Reagan may be in a tougher position in 1984 to duplicate his performance of 1980 Although the economy may continue to improve for example unemployment could remain high in many areas Even if were below 9 percent unemployment nationally it could still be at 12 or 18 percent in the big cities said a key Reagan strategist Thats going to make it tough in the big states The nationwide jobless rate is now 94 percent Another factor feared by Reagan political advisers is the sizable registration drive Democrats expect to mount especially among blacks In the South a significant increase in black voters who are expected to vote overwhelmingly Democratic could erase Mr Reagans 1980 margins of victory A Reagan political strategist estimated that there would be perhaps 10 million more voters in 1984 than in 1980 most of them newly registered Those new voters are not necessarily Republicans he said 220 Southern Counties Selected The Democratic registration drive among blacks is expected to be greatly aided by the possible candidacy of the Rev Jesse Jackson the Chicagobased civil rights leader To counter it the Republicans have selected 220 counties in the South that include suburbs and condominium apartment complexes where socalled displaced Republicans from the North have moved There hasnt been a good Republican registration effort since the 1972 Nixon campaign a Reagan strategist said The only place weve really started is Texas so were way behind Weve got to go all through the South especially to those fundamentalist Christian groups that support the President In a lot of states they arent registered In 1980 Mr Reagan defeated President Carter the Democrat by an electoral vote margin of 489 to 49 Mr Reagan carried 44 states and received 507 percent of the popular vote as against 411 percent for Mr Carter John B Anderson a former Republican Representative running as an independent took most of the rest of the vote Several Reagan aides said they fervently hoped a liberal thirdparty candidate would run next year and siphon votes from the Democratic nominee as they believed Mr Anderson did in 1980 We need 270 electoral votes to win and I can go down state by state and tell you how we can get there a Reagan strategist said But theres no margin for error A lot of states that are very very crucial to us are also very very close There wont be any 44 state win At the White House and among many Republicans the general feeling is that the President would face a more difficult challenge from Senator John Glenn of Ohio than from former Vice President Walter F Mondale They reason that Mr Glenns status as the first American astronaut to orbit the earth and his centrist political approach would pose a greater threat to Mr Reagan But several strategists said Mr Mondale would be a formidable threat because of the enthusiastic support he could command among labor unions blacks teachers and organized groups in general Presidential aides say they do not foresee nearly as many difficulties if the nominee is any of the lesser known candidates but they acknowledge that attitude could change White House officials say they continue to be frustrated by their efforts to improve Mr Reagans standing among women A key strategist said he felt that the drop in support for the President among women was his most serious political problem Although the latest New York TimesCBS News Poll showed this week that the difference between womens and mens views of Mr Reagan had narrowed significantly since June that may be a short lived effect of women liking and men disliking his responses to the Soviet downing of a South Korean airliner Sept 1 over the island of Sakhalin Gender Gap Has Widened Moreover polls taken by Richard Wirthlin the Presidents pollster show that this gender gap has widened somewhat for Mr Reagan since 1980 It is not going well but it has never gone well said a key political adviser speaking of the effort to win the womens vote Another official said Mr Wirthlin had cited 22 separate reasons for the Presidents support among women being relatively low Some groups oppose Mr Reagan over his stands on abortion and the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution Others cite the economy and their fears about war and violence Still others dislike what they call Mr Reagans macho style Weve got to figure out which groups we can pick up said a Presidential strategist Still another difficulty for the President lies in his need to do well among bluecollar workers many of them Roman Catholic who defected from the Democrats in large numbers in 1980 Mr Wirthlins polls are said to show that contrary to earlier fears Mr Reagans strength among these voters remains the same at about 40 percent Wirthlins polls dont show it but my gut instinct tells me theres been some erosion said one highlevel strategist In other words I think a good Democratic effort can break some of it away Accordingly the Presidents aides are continuously vigilant on the perception that Mr Reagans budget cuts and glittering personal style make him a rich mans President In keeping with the practice of 1982 White House officials said Mr Reagan would keep blacktie events to a minimum and try as much as possible to return to the ranches ethnic festivals and neighborhood campaigning that was one of his 1980 hallmarks Theres general agreement that hes going to travel and that a Rose Garden strategy is not the right one for this President a White House official said referring to the practice of some incumbents in the past to campaign above the fray appearing in public only at the White House Rose Garden Yet Mr Reagan has not campaigned in a Northern industrial area since early April when an appearance in Pittsburgh led to more publicity for the 4000 antiReagan demonstrators than for the President One campaign strategist spoke of the frustration over his perception that Mr Reagan was not yet benefiting fully from an improved economy In 1982 the voters didnt generally blame Reagan for their difficulties when things were bad he said The problem is they dont seem to be giving him the political credit for the recovery Foreign Policy Voctory Needed A bright spot for the Reagan strategists is their view that the President has improved his standing among Hispanic voters with a series of appearances and events in the last month Although unemployment among MexicanAmericans remains high the White House hopes Mr Reagan can hold his own at 25 or 30 percent and not lose Texas and other states in the Southwest to the Democrats Several aides said Mr Reagans chances would be dramatically enhanced by some sort of a breakthrough on the international scene They predicted that any rise of support accruing from his handling of the Soviet downing of the South Korean airliner would be shortlived We need a win somewhere whether its Latin America the Middle East or with the Russians an adviser said If we had just one major foreign policy victory wed be in great shape Administration officials said the publicity this summer over briefing documents from the Carter White House obtained by the Reagan campaign in 1980 would not hurt Mr Reagan in 1984 But some officials worry that the continuing publicity may hurt some people such as James A Baker 3d the White House chief of staff One major worry expressed by White House aides relates to what the President will decide in his budget for the fiscal year 1985 The budget is due in January Will the President continue to cut food stamps school aid and other popular programs to close a projected 200 billion deficit Or will he submit a budget with few cuts and possibly even some election year goodies for some groups The issue White House aides say has not yet been addressed What has been addressed they say are Mr Reagans budget plans for his campaign The organizers expect to send out more than two million pieces of mail by November to raise money for the early part of the campaign The campaign expects to spend 21 million about half of it in matching funds from the Federal Government before the Republican convention next summer This means that while the Democratic candidates are attacking each other in the primaries next spring the President will probably have commercials of his own on the air even though he will have no significant primary opposition The campaign is expected to receive 40 million more in Federal funds to spend in the general election after the Republican convention Other funds are expected to be spent in behalf of Mr Reagan by the Republican National Committee Republican organizations in various states and various independent groups

HERS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/22/garden/hers.html,WHY do so many women who agree with feminist goals choose to disavow feminism For me the question became urgent a few weeks ago when I read concurrent disclaimers from three prominent strong women Christine Craft the television anchorwoman who sued her employer Representative Geraldine A Ferraro and the actress Estelle Parsons When I checked out each quotation my question elicited very different but equally revealing answers Chris Craft the outspoken TV anchor who sued the station that demoted her for being too old unattractive and not deferential to men said in an interview in The New York Times Im not a feminist Yet her case seemed to epitomize womens struggle against sexism Following the logic of the old punchline  if it looks like a feminist sounds like a feminist and acts like a feminist it is a feminist  I asked her if shed been misquoted No she said I hate being categorized Objectivity has always been my goal If I said Im a feminist Id never get another job as a reporter I mean no slap against feminism but this is my battle and mine alone I suspect she resists being categorized because despite more than a decade of womens movement activism on everything from child care to homemakers rights the category feminist still conjures for many an image of a narrow negative fringe group I can vouch for the power of those preconceptions at virtually all my lecture appearances believe it or not someone says I thought youd be bigger At 5 feet 4 inches I delight in being a decategorizing force Each of us who calls herself a feminist testifies that feminists come in all sizes races marital states and sexual persuasions Admission to our category is by commitment only  When Miss Craft cites her desire for objectivity as a reason to disavow feminism Im reminded of Gloria Steinems civil rights parody of the equal time rule OK weve heard from the black victims now lets get the attack dogs side of the story Its as absurd to expect objectivity on racial brutality as it is to suggest there are two sides to the denial of human rights to women Being a feminist  ie in favor of womens rights  should not stigmatize a woman reporter it should mark her as a person with rudimentary human concerns and female selfinterest Put another way would a black reporter be required to swear neutrality on the Voting Rights Act or apartheid before he or she could cover a story concerning such matters And if its true as Miss Craft maintains that a feminist could not get work as a reporter maybe she should challenge that situation in her next lawsuit Divideandconquer strategies get an assist when a public symbol like Miss Craft maintains that this is my battle and mine alone There was a time not long ago when youth beauty and obsequiousness were generally accepted standards for female worth But today  because of the moral and legal climate created by thousands of women before her  Miss Craft was able to argue the injustice of that standard and win 500000 for having been victimized by it Ignoring those who marched lobbied went to court took abuse and fought for every womans right to be treated as a person Miss Craft imagines that the battle originated at her news desk in Kansas City A few days laterThe Fire Island News quoted Representative Ferraro as saying she did not consider herself a feminist although she is in favor of the equal rights amendment and is prochoice on the abortion issue Miss Craft had been an unknown quantity but Miss Ferraros record matches nearly every item on anyones feminist political agenda Can she deny that shes a feminist She didnt I said that when I went to Congress in 1978 I did not run as a feminist or consider myself one But I became a strong feminist when I got here and learned what is happening to women in this country As Bella Abzug once tried to get across to President Carter Im trying to say that feminist issues are problems that affect women and they are very broad political and economic issues Most people support feminism when they understand it The third disclaimer appeared in a New York Times interview with Estelle Parsons star of Orgasmo Adulto Escapes From the Zoo eight one woman plays by Dario Fo and Franca Rame Miss Parsons told the reporter that the plays are about the condition of women  and how were all prisoners of the male organ That struck me as a fairly forthright even radical feminist summary Yet she was quoted as insisting that she was not interested in feminist messages I had seen her in Miss Reardon Drinks a Little Miss Margaridas Way and the remarkable Mert and Phil  three plays with profound messages about the condition of women I knew that she belongs to a networking group that helps women get jobs in the theater could Miss Parsons not be a feminist I didnt realize I was one when I did the interview she said on the telephone the other morning But these plays have led me into a lot of soulsearching about the patterns in my work and my life Until now I didnt dare say myself what these plays are saying I was afraid people would poke fun at me so I withdrew from everything controversial Ive been wrong not to stand up and answer for my own commitments Its not enough to just live your life You have to recognize what you represent to other women The women in the audience treat me as a feminist leader but it is they whove raised my consciousness While I was pondering all this Carol Kleiman associate financial editor of The Chicago Tribune told me that the opening comment by 90 percent of the businesswomen she interviews is Im not a feminist These women are not comfortable being womanidentified she explained so theyre trying to tell me they like men Refusing to make common cause with feminism is a doomed effort to distance themselves from their sisters by making an alliance with the men who still for the most part control their destinies Christine Craft continues to cultivate that alliance and disavow feminism no matter how she contradicts her own reality Geraldine Ferraro and Estelle Parsons understand that facing womens reality makes a woman a feminist They are in stellar company Dr Sally Ride a true first credits other women for her success and even for the fact that back in 1977 she applied for astronaut selection because of a notice posted in the Stanford University Womens Center If it wasnt for the womens movement says Dr Ride I wouldnt be where I am today Can any woman truthfully disavow that statement
PRESIDENTIAL DECISION NEARS FOR JESSE JACKSON,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/22/us/presidential-decision-nears-for-jesse-jackson.html,The Rev Jesse Louis Jackson just back from a European trip is preparing to make a decision that could have a profound impact on politics next year whether to run for President The civil rights advocate who founded Operation PUSH is pondering that question amid a mixture of enthusiasm from a great many blacks and severe criticism from others especially politicians Supporters see a Jackson race as generating renewed interest in electoral politics and helping the Democratic Party while others say he would divert attention from what they feel should be the main goal of blacks defeating Ronald Reagan Mr Jackson is perceived by many as a man of energy with a probing mind a silver tongue and a strong charisma not just an ability to sway crowds but also personal charm and persuasiveness in oneonone settings And he is given credit for drawing attention to the needs of blacks working to motivate schoolchildren and creating new business opportunities for black people But he is also seen as an egocentric power seeker who upstages other black leaders and pursues publicity for accomplishments that others achieve with less fanfare And Operation PUSH which he founded in Chicago 12 years ago is seen as poorly administered questions have been raised about its management of Federal money Nevertheless Mr Jacksons mere consideration of entering the race has put a lot of black political activity on hold preventing some politicians from openly supporting other candidates He has caused a split among blacks along class lines with charges that the masses are for him and the middle class is in opposition And he has caused white candidates to tread lightly among black voters and to defer to Mr Jackson out of fear of alienating him and his supporters This was the portrait that emerged from a series of interviews and travels with Mr Jackson as well as talks with a host of other people supporters and critics alike and from watching him deal with individuals and crowds The Poor Are Not Lazy In Cleveland early this month he stood tall and commanding before a crowd that grew and grew under a broiling sun The poor are not lazy he shouted as blacks from the tumbledown East Side drew toward him They sweat in these steel mills They clean other peoples houses and then have their own houses to clean The poor are not lazy We just want to get paid for what we do The crowd laughed chanted and applauded until Mr Jackson hushed them with a wave of his hands and asked everyone who was not registered to vote to come down the aisle As 200 to 300 people began streaming forward the crowd applauded steadily Registrars set up a table to sign up voters on the spot Lack of FollowThrough Seen But when he turned to leave for the airport someone had to call out to keep the wouldbe voters from drifting away Having lit the spark Mr Jackson said it was up to others to carry out the actual registration Some people see that attitude as symbolic of a flaw in Mr Jacksons leadership as a failure to follow through But Mr Jackson says the role he can best fulfill is one of a communicator a motivator Motivation of others is a main concern in Mr Jacksons consideration of a Presidential race He says his appeal to an often overlooked segment of society could get more disadvantaged people to register vote and take an active part in the political process thereby encouraging the enactment of more progressive policies and helping the Democrats beat Mr Reagan in 1984 Those are new voters he said of the scores in Cleveland who headed for the registrars The Democratic Party has not been able to inspire the people I have He Sees a Rainbow Coalition Mr Jackson sees himself as a voice for the poor and powerless of all races whom he would unite in a rainbow coalition If we increase the number of registered voters by registering blacks Hispanics and the young he says well expand the party not divide it Some Blacks Foresee Divisiveness But division is what some black leaders fear Though many support Mr Jackson believing that as blacks are winning local and state office in greater numbers a black candidate should step forward and seek the Presidency others feel his candidacy could drain support from liberal white candidates in the Democratic primaries giving the nomination to someone farther to the political right That could rob blacks of any influence over the eventual white Democratic nominee in the view of Georgia State Senator Julian Bond And most often heard is the concern that by focusing attention on his own candidacy Mr Jackson might divert blacks from the effort to remove Mr Reagan from the White House Mayor Andrew Young of Atlanta and John Lewis a City Councilman there have also expressed reservations about the effect of a campaign by Mr Jackson Efforts to Register Voters Mr Jackson has since embarked on a number of swings to register voters saying that black voters could and should elect far more blacks to all levels of public office as well as help defeat President Reagan in 1984 He exhorts blacks to run for office themselves saying If the leaders dont run the masses dont register Mr Jackson has criticized Federal enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and spoken out against such practices as runoff primaries dual registration in Mississippi gerrymandering of districts atlarge voting and other measures that he feels are designed to thwart black political participation Low registration isnt due to apathy  its due to oppression he contended Mr Lewis the Atlanta City Councilman was director of the Voter Education Project from 197077 when he said the organization helped register over four million blacks in the South He said Mr Jackson was exaggerating the situation Some Views Are Known Without question there are still existing problems Mr Lewis said But most of the problems we faced in the 60s are no longer there Now citizen education is needed to encourage people to vote the entire ballot not just President or governor but lower positions like city councilperson or sheriff In some of those positions theres a 60 percent dropoff While Mr Jackson has not yet said he will run he has been traveling the dwill run he has been traveling the ons but some are known including support both for stricter enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and for the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution which he feels would stabilize families and open up job opportunities for women He says he believes it is immoral for a woman to have an abortion except under medically extenuating circumstances but would not favor taking away her freedom of choice In the past he has been quoted as equating abortion with murder He Opposes Gunboat Diplomacy He also advocates a policy toward corporations that would require them to rebuild their industrial base in the United States or to retrain American workers in exchange for tax breaks a food policy that would put farmers back to work feeding the poor rather than allowing billions of dollars worth of food to lie in storage and education and health care programs for the very poor based on need not income In terms of foreign policy Mr Jackson said the nation should pursue a course that emphasizes human rights economic fair play and negotiations not gunboat diplomacy The United States should use its leverage to end apartheid in South Africa he said While recognizing Israels right to exist he also calls for the creation of a Palestinian homeland a position that has caused him problems with Jews Media Attention and Strong Emotions Though he has held no public office Mr Jackson through the force of his personality and from the platform of Operation PUSH has repeatedly focused attention on issues and managed to seize the spotlight Jesse understands the media well and has learned to use it well said Thomas Todd a Chicago lawyer who once served as executive vice president of Operation PUSH He combines everything the media wants He looks good he sounds good and he excites passion good and bad He has an uncompromising sense of personal distinction says Robert Tucker another Chicago lawyer who has known Mr Jackson for many years Jesse not only believes in God but he firmly believes God believes in him Its Jesse Its him one woman exclaims as Mr Jackson walks through an airport A waitress tells him she would not have finished high school if it had not been for him Black businessmen in Chicago and other cities say Mr Jacksons threats of boycotts and other actions have opened up new business opportunities for them in that city and around the country enabling them to hire and raise wages for more employees and in the case of black banks to help other minority businesses grow Many Remain Critical Yet criticism of Mr Jackson is vehement Jesse is not running for President says Vernon Jarrett a black columnist with The Chicago SunTimes who is one of Mr Jacksons more severe critics Hes running for the office of chief power broker for black people at the Democratic convention where he will be televised and portrayed as a black power broker His agenda is the promotion of Jesse Jackson as the king the emperor the most important black person of this century Now 41 years old Mr Jackson entered public life through the civil rights movement and by 1967 had worked his way to national director of Operation Breadbasket the economic arm of the Southern Christian Leadership Conference designed to bring pressure on employers to hire and promote blacks and invest in black companies and products He and the conference parted ways in 1971 and two weeks later Operation Breadbasket became Operation PUSH with Mr Jackson as its president Boycotts Used as a Tool When he started in Chicago in the late 1960s Mr Jackson organized boycotts at local grocery stores to pressure the owners to provide more shelf space for goods produced by black entrepreneurs and he fought to get AP to hire a black building contractor Since then he has branched out and in the past two years he has negotiated detailed trade agreements  he calls them covenants  with several corporations including CocaCola Seven Up Burger King Heublein and Southland the Dallas company that franchises 7Eleven While not legally binding the agreements generally commit the corporations to hiring more blacks including people at the top levels doing business with minorityowned concerns awarding franchises and distributorships to blacks making deposits in minorityowned banks advertising in minorityowned publications and giving money to black colleges and other organizations A Value Beyond Dollars Mr Jackson estimates the value of the agreements at some 15 billion and says tens of thousands of new jobs have been created although the precise economic impact is hard to pin down Those who have benefited from Mr Jacksons efforts say the dollar amounts are less important than the farreaching principle established by him and by other civil rights groups that undertake the same effort Jesse awakened the private sector said Alvin J Boutte chairman of the board of the Independence Bank of Chicago What he has done is more important than government involvement because it will last longer He added I dont know what this bank would be without Jesse Jackson Criticisms of Operation PUSH Mr Jackson said he does not generally suggest to corporations which minority vendors they should hire to fulfill the terms of the covenants But an affiliate of Operation PUSH called the International Trade Bureau does make recommendations to companies that wish to do business with minority concerns particularly those companies that have signed the trade agreements The trade bureau which has more than 500 members charges minority businesses 500 a year to join and that request for money has drawn heated criticism The St Louis Sentinel a black weekly newspaper reported that after signing a covenant with SevenUp last year Mr Jackson told black businessmen If you want to play you have to pay The newspaper accused Mr Jackson of having a milliondollar commitment to himself and of following a kickback approach Jackson Calls It Service Fee Lawyers for Mr Jackson and Operation PUSH an acronym for People United to Serve Humanity filed a 3 million libel suit But Operation PUSH asked to withdraw from the action after a Federal district judge ordered the organization to produce its financial records Mr Jackson has said he would make the financial records public at the appropriate time Mr Jackson believes the 500 fee is reasonable for a company trying to find new business Those who invest in the trade bureau earn service from the staff he says adding that a problem of the civil rights movement is that the people who have benefited from it feel no sense of obligation But Barbara Reynolds a black journalist who wrote a biography of Mr Jackson says he is running a silver rights movement not a civil rights movement Theres nothing wrong with helping black business Miss Reynolds says but hes saying hes helping the poor and disenfranchised and what would help blacks is jobs and training programs She says Mr Jackson is using his leverage with corporations to develop a personal patronage system among black businessmen Jackson Responds to Charges Mr Jackson answers The more you serve people the more they keep coming back to you That just means I know how to deliver He says he does not focus solely on jobs because full employment isnt enough We had full employment during slavery he says arguing that bolstering black businesses in turn helps black workers Other efforts by Mr Jackson have generated controversy When negotiating the trade agreements he often recommended the corporations use consulting concerns to find qualified minority vendors One of those consultants Green Herman  Associates is headed by Ernest G Green Assistant Secretary of Labor for Employment and Training in the Carter Administration who shortly before leaving office gave his routine approval to a 2 million grant to PUSHExcel Mr Jacksons program for schoolchildren Auditors Challenge Spending Mr Green said that he gave no special attention to the PUSHExcel grant and that there was no quid pro quo arrangement Companies that use Green Herman say they are pleased with the firms work In an unrelated incident Government auditors are challenging the way PUSHExcel spent 17 million in Federal grants The program received 65 million from various Federal agencies Auditors reviewing grants made under the Carter Administration have said 737000 was improperly spent and have officially questioned another 1 million for which they are seeking further documentation Mr Jackson dismisses the audits as a dispute between accountants complains he is the target of Government leaks and says no wrongdoing has been charged He said PUSHExcel of which he is board chairman will repay any money due at the end of the auditing process Motivation and Inspiration Through his PUSHExcel program Mr Jackson attempts to motivate students both by inspiring them directly and by getting parents local ministers and local businessmen to take a greater interest in their education He feels his own motivation to excel sprang partly from his determination to overcome the taunts and slights he was subjected to as a child in Greenville SC because he was born out of wedlock Id get great joy out of making the honor roll as an athlete because it defied stereotypes he recalls It was a challenge to me to be in class the morning after a game with my homework done Public ridicule will either crush you or challenge you it can take away your spirit or stimulate your adrenalin I chose the achievement route

Article 184750 -- No Title,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/23/us/article-184750-no-title.html,Democratic leaders succeeded today in winning House approval of 300 million more for education and job training The action came as the House passed a 965 billion measure to finance a broad range of social service programs The appropriation bill approved by a vote of 310 to 101 provides funds for the Departments of Health and Human Services Labor and Education as well as some other Federal programs The bill exceeds President Reagans requests by about 38 billion but it is about 4 billion below the budget ceiling set earlier by Congress The Democratic victory after some lively debate was the first part of a planned double assault on Mr Reagans efforts to cut spending for various domestic programs Plan Is for 450 Million More The second move will come within the next week or so when the Democrats seek another 450 million or more for education programs as part of a catchall resolution to finance Government agencies into the 1984 fiscal year which starts Oct 1 At the same time the Census Bureau reported today that changes in Federal aid programs made at Mr Reagans request had prevented an increase in the total number of households receiving food stamps Medicaid and other Federal aid last year despite an increase in poverty and unemployment Page B10 In choosing today to push for 300 million rather than the 750 million or more that they eventually hope to get Democratic leaders hoped to avoid a veto of the big appropriation bill that will finance operations of the Departments of Labor Education and Health and Human Services They noted that even with the additional 300 million the House bill is about at the same level as one approved by a Senate Appropriations subcommittee for those departments Senate Must Still Act The Senate is expected to act on a similar measure drafted by its Appropriations Committee and a HouseSenate conference committee would reconcile any differences The Democrats reasoned that President Reagan would be reluctant to veto the catchall resolution even one with an additional 450 million for fear of shutting down the various departments and agencies dependent on such stopgap financing to keep operating after Sept 30 But Representative Silvio O Conte of Massachusetts the ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee warned that the Democrats plan might well backfire In an emotional speech he suggested that the President might not hold still for the additional domestic spending Mr Conte had sought to head off any confrontation between the Congress and the Reagan Administration over the levels of domestic spending After consultations with White House officials Mr Conte said he felt that a Presidential veto could be avoided if the appropriation bill did not go any higher than 35 billion over the Presidents earlier request Todays action might cause a deal with the Administration to collapse Mr Conte said Prospects for passage of the catchall resolution were complicated by internal Democratic differences over an action Wednesday night by the House Appropriations Committee It approved language barring funds for American forces in Lebanon unless the President acknowledges to Congress within 60 days that he is bound by the War Powers Resolution ONeill Cites Meddling The Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr accused the Appropriations Committee of meddling with the rights of other committees notably the Foreign Affairs Committee which approved a compromise today invoking the War Powers Resolution The Speaker asked the Appropriations Committee to redraft its bill but committee members stood their ground and urged the Speaker to reconsider Generally the catchall appropriation resolution provides funds for those departments or agencies whose regular appropriations bills have not yet cleared Congress The resolution for the coming fiscal year would finance all agencies except those for which individual appropriations had been enacted At this point money bills have been signed for the Departments of Energy Transportation and Housing and Urban Development plus the legislative branch A Vehicle for Extra Money However an official in the office of the House parliamentarian said today that the resolution also can be used as a vehicle for appropriating additional funds for those agencies whose regular money bills have already cleared such as the additional 450 million for education sought by the Democrats The resolution as drafted in committee also would provide 425 million more for military assistance for Israel for a total of 26 billion and 65 million more for Egypt for a total of 21 billion While the centerpiece of todays floor action was the Democratic move to increase domestic spending the House also engaged in its annual debate over abortion by reaffirming its stand against the use of Federal funds for such a purpose Added to the appropriation bill by a vote of 231 to 184 was an outright ban on use of any Federal funds for abortions This is stronger than the present law which permits abortions when a mothers life is in danger Abortion Ban Called Unlikely However Representative Henry J Hyde an Illinois Republican who leads antiabortion forces in the House said he believed that the Senate would insist on allowing abortions when a mothers life is endangered and that the law as now written would remain unchanged The appropriation bill includes 627 billion for the Department of Health and Human Services 132 billion for the Department of Labor 124 billion for the Department of Education and a total of 82 billion for other programs including the Corporation for Public Broadcasting the National Labor Relations Board and the Federal Mediation and Conciliation Service The 300 million added to the bill under a proposal by the House Democratic leader Jim Wright of Texas includes 100 million more for grants to needy college students 100 million for job training 45 million for aid to the disadvantaged 25 million to the Head Start program for preschool children and a total of 30 million for various other education programs
CARDINAL MEDEIROS TRIBUTE SURPRISES BOSTON CATHOLICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/24/us/cardinal-medeiros-tribute-surprises-boston-catholics.html,More than 2000 people jammed the old brown stone Holy Cross Cathedral beside an elevated subway line in the citys South End today for a funeral mass for the Roman Catholic Archbishop of Boston Humberto Cardinal Medeiros The service marked the end of three days of crowded and emotional mourning for Cardinal Medeiros in which more than 50000 people filed past his bier and subway trains outside the cathedral were slowed to a crawl to reduce the disturbance The intensity of the tribute surprised Catholic leaders here While this heavily IrishAmerican city is predominantly Catholic and the archdiocese is the nations second largest after Chicagos Cardinal Medeiros was not always popular here The Cardinal a native of the Azores was regarded as something of an outsider among the largely IrishAmerican clergy and his support for court ordered busing to end public school segregation aroused deep resentment Higher Religious Sensibility Hence the homage for Cardinal Medeiros who died last week at the age of 67 was regarded by some Catholics as a reminder of how important the church remains for many people here My overwhelming impression is that there is a much higher religious sensibility in Boston than in other big cities said the Rev J Donald Monan president of Boston College a Jesuitrun school There is a bigger public awareness of religion and religious values added Father Monan who comes from Buffalo You can see it in a lot of little ways that I thought had disappeared from the life of America he said pointing to the city transportation systems decision to slow the subways and provide free bus service to the cathedral The funeral service he also noted was shown live for more than three hours by Bostons three major television stations an unusual honor 2 Million Catholics in Boston Area In part the tribute for Cardinal Medeiros may stem from the sheer size of the archdiocese which serves more than two million Catholics It includes 410 parishes and is responsible for 160 parochial schools eight colleges four nursing schools and 12 hospitals But the outpouring of feeling for the Cardinal also grows out of the distinctive history of the church in Boston The difference between the church in Boston and other American cities is the same as the difference in Bostons immigrants said Thomas H OConnor a professor of history at Boston College and author of Bibles Brahmins and Bosses A Short History of Boston Professor OConnor said that when the first big wave of Irish immigrants landed in Boston in the potato famine of the 1840s the immigrants arrived in a city that was already more than 200 years old with a proud and wellestablished ruling class Moreover the members of this Yankee elite were descendants of the Puritans who had fled England and an Anglican Church that they found too close in its ritual and hierarchy to Roman Catholicism To make matters worse Boston had little industry and few jobs for the boatloads of Irish many of whom were poor and illiterate A Militant Spirit of Alliance A result was that the Irish in Boston encountered more hostility than they did in most other American cities which were newer or more rapidly growing Professor OConnor said Given the Irish feeling that they were under fire from the Yankees they built up a militant spirit of alliance between the poor people and the clergy like that in Poland today between the church and the workers he said But this same sense of protracted struggle also made the church in Boston more defensive and isolated the professor continued especially in the first half of the 20th century when the church was dominated by William Cardinal OConnell and the city was run by Mayor James Michael Curley This insularity began to change in the 1960s under Richard Cardinal Cushing a revered native of South Boston who supported the ecumenical movement A Changing City and Church But it was Cardinal Medeiros appointed Archbishop in 1970 who was caught up in both a changing Boston and a changing church after the Second Vatican Council The Cardinal a quiet and humble man who was described by some priests as almost medieval in his faith managed to rid the diocese of 60 million in debt created by Cardinal Cushings ambitious building program But he was not prepared for what David OBrien a professor of history at Holy Cross University in Worcester called the conservative tribal Irish clerical culture of Boston Unwittingly Irish of all levels in Boston have tended to think that being Cardinal was one of their jobs like being Mayor and they were stunned when Medeiros was appointed said William V Shannon a professor at Boston University and author of several books on the Irish in America Cardinal Medeiros therefore lacked the personal rapport to help him guide the church through Bostons school busing crisis that was brought on as the citys small black community grew rapidly in the 1970s He pledged that the church would not contribute to racial bigotry when Bostons schools were desegragated in 1974 and ordered that Catholic schools not accept students trying to avoid busing But he didnt enforce it said James T Hannon an instructor at Regis College a womens Catholic school in suburban Weston A study done by Mr Hannon who was formerly head of the Justice and Peace Commission in the archdiocese found that 20 percent of Bostons white public school students transferred to parochial schools at the time Conservative Attitude Cited Mr Hannon who also has done a study comparing the church in Boston to that in Milwaukee termed Boston one of the most conservative dioceses in the country a situation he attributed to its Irish origins In the Middle West where there are more German and Polish Catholics the leaders have been more progressive he said Cardinal Medeiross interest in social issues focused largely on fighting abortion Mr Hannon said while church leaders in other cities became absorbed by problems of helping the poor or ending the arms race Some nuns in Boston also believed that the church under Cardinal Medeiros was not responding to their calls for a greater role for women Sister Frances Froehlich who used to be head of the Sisters Senate in Boston said she was disturbed when Cardinal Medeiros opposed the creation of a Womens Commission for the archdiocese I think women are being denied access to full participation she said and thats discrimination While recognizing that Pope John Paul II opposes women being ordained as priests Sister Frances contended that other cities had still managed to share more power with women who she said were doing most of the nittygritty of the churchs work There are no figures available to show whether the number of Catholics in the archdiocese is increasing but a study conducted by the archdiocese predicts a decline in the number of priests from 1031 in 1980 to 818 by the year 2000 Professor OBrien of Holy Cross said There has been a sense of drift and discouragement among priests in Boston over the past 10 or 15 years a lack of any sense that its exciting to be a Catholic in Boston He added The other side of that conservatism is the residual loyalty It doesnt take much of an invitation to get them back Consequently many here believe the Vactians choice of a new archbishop will have a crucial effect on the direction of the church in Boston Boston is coming out of a bad time with the racial crisis a former priest said adding The generosity of the spirit of the church has not been mobilized But it is sleeping giant that could wake up and do a lot of good
9TH DISTRICT: THE 'FAIR FIGHT' CAMPAIGN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/nyregion/9th-district-the-fair-fight-campaign.html,OSSINING AS the sun beat down on the Chilmark Shopping Center here Bill Crosbie assembled campaign literature last week under the raised trunk lid of Stan Kirwins Toyota Then Mr Crosbie a County Legislator set off with Mr Kirwin who is running for Ossining town justice and two local Republican candiates to knock on doors in Indian Village a section of small houses on neatly trimmed lawns in the eastern part of the village I dont know the district yet said Mr Crosbie a Republican Its always best to go with a local leader who can introduce you Down in Tarrytown Sandy Galef toted her yellow campaign shopping bags up to Joseph Goldfeder a 79 yearold retiree who was sunning himself on a bench outside Fascinating Foods on North Broadway A Democrat who is also a County Legislator Mrs Galef explained that she was running against Mr Crosbie You better get yourself known said Mr Goldfeder who lives in Tarrytown The need for increased recognition in new neighborhoods has become a fact of political life for both William R Crosbie 59 years old and Sandra R Galef 43 who are locked in the only fair fight race for a seat on the County Board of Legislators this fall They are both running in the Ninth District to which Mr Crosbie was appointed this year and into which Mrs Galef a Democrat was thrown by reapportionment Only one will survive Redistricting has meant the loss of the Second District for Mrs Galef who lives in Ossining and represented it for two years on the Board She must now campaign in the lessfamiliar Ninth District including Tarrytown which has been Mr Crosbies home for 28 years By contrast Mr Crosbie a Legislator in the early 1970s who was appointed to serve out the term of Richard L Brodsky  who was elected to the State Assembly in 1982  must learn about the voters in Ossining and Briarcliff Manor a Galef stronghold The Ninth lies along the Hudson River and includes Tarrytown and an unincorporated part of the town of Greenburgh on the south North Tarrytown part of the town of Mount Pleasant and the villages of Briarcliff Manor and Ossining on the north The Ninth District has lost the villages of Irvington and Elmsford and much of the rest of Greenburgh The district has become more formally Republican in its party enrollment according to County Board of Elections figures Before reapportionment there were 9943 Democrats and 8609 Republicans enrolled in the Ninth and 6201 voters who stated no party preference In the new Ninth the figures stand at 7328 Democrats 7643 Republicans and 6540 independents The only way I can win is to have the support of Republicans and independents said Mrs Galef last week Both she and Mr Crosbie acknowledge that Mrs Galef has retained somewhat more of her old districts population than Mr Crosbie has All Ive got to do is neutralize Ossining and Ill win said Mr Crosbie He declined to say how many votes he thought he would need By last Tuesday 1422 signed petitions collected by the Common Sense Independent Party on Mrs Galefs behalf had been filed with the Board of Elections Mrs Galef said She will need 837 valid signatures to gain an independent line on the Nov 8 ballot Mr Crosbie has the Conservative Party endorsement as well as the Republican line A RighttoLife Party candidate Kathleen A Yasinsac of Tarrytown is also on the ballot Mrs Yasinsac 41 a mother of four who for personal reasons does not plan to campaign actively said that to keep the party viable you have to have candidates on the ballot She added that more education was necessary for voters to realize that tax dollars are going for abortions A number of issues divide the two majorparty candidates including Ossining Sewer District taxes the Indian Point nuclear plants and how effective each can be as Board members To homeowners answering his ring last week Mr Crosbie emphasized that Mrs Galef had been responsible for a 220 percent increase this year in the tax rate for the Ossining Sanitary Sewer District The rate for Ossining rose from 449 per 1000 of assessed valuation last year to 1439 Mr Crosbie said that an artificially low 1982 rate had resulted from the return of 12 milllion in reserve funds for the district to taxpayers through lowered rates He asserted that the action was against county policy and that the money should have been gradually returned over a period of several years The funds were returned because the start of operations at the districts county sewagetreatment plant in Ossining had been delayed more than a year It began to treat waste in June last year Mrs Galef said last week that my perspective is that that the money belongs in the taxpayers pockets instead of in the countys reserves Mr Crosbie pointed out that in his 1983 budget message Alfred B DelBello then the County Executive had described the action as unfortunately contrary to county policy of using such reserves on a planned basis to ameliorate tax increases in future years Mrs Galef said that she had a letter approving the action signed by Mr DelBello and Edward J Brady the Boards Republican majority leader She said the letter had been written before the vote by which the Board of Legislators had approved the action Potentially the districts sewer rate may be reduced because of two new customers Under one of three plans being considered by the county for the International Business Machines Corporations Thomas J Watson Research Center in Yorktown it would join the sewer district Another likely customer is a new facility being built by the Catholic Foreign Mission Society of America  the Maryknoll Fathers  in the town of New Castle In both cases the county is negotiating the financial arrangements for using the sewertreatment plant which was built and is run by the county Of the nuclear facilities at Indian Point Mrs Galef said I still dont think we have a safe plant We should shut them down until we have an evacuation plan that everybody agrees is acceptable We have buses but no drivers We havent trained emergency workers Mrs Galef whose home lies within a 10mile radius of Indian Point said she was not against nuclear power as such but Im concerned because were in such a populated area Mr Crosbie a vice president of the Manufacturers Hanover Trust Company in New York said The plant is safe Close it and well raise the cost of power to Con Ed customers It might close General Motors The GM plant in North Tarrytown is a major employer in the county The evacuation plan has to be re formed but we dont want 2000 people to lose their jobs Mr Crosbie said referring to employment at the plants owned by Consolidated Edison and the New York State Power Authority Mrs Galef was critical of Mr Crosbies status as the only New York City commuter on the 17member Board of Legislators because his bank position takes him away from Board duties She is a homemaker and former teacher whose husband Steven A Galef is a New York lawyer Mr Crosbie said of the Board This is a parttime job Ive been at 90 percent of the Board

POPE AGAIN EXHORTS U.S. ON SEXUAL MORALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/world/pope-again-exhorts-us-on-sexual-morality.html,For the third time this month Pope John Paul II made a major statement today condemning those who disobey the Roman Catholic Churchs teaching on marriage and the family Significantly it was the second time this month that the Pope addressed such statements directly at the United States As he had on Sept 5 he chose a group of visiting American bishops to reiterate his opposition to what he is thought to view as a decline in morality in the United States The Pope attacked the suggestion that other types of relationships can replace marriage and the family He urged the 14 bishops to persuade Christian couples that there must be no cohabitation without the marriage sacraments This alone the Pope said possesses the qualities of unity permanence or indissolubility fidelity and truthfulness He linked conjugal love with procreation The spouses share with God the continuing work of creation the Pope said The church encourages couples to be generous and hopeful to realize that parenthood is a privilege he continued They must be encouraged to see the child as an enrichment of their marriage and a gift of God to themselves and to their children The Pope urged couples to decide thoughtfully and prayerfully about the spacing of births and the number of children they have He condemned any other form of family planning Couples must be urged to avoid any actions that threaten a life already conceived that denies or frustrates their procreative power or violates the integrity of the marriage act he said He told the bishops that natural family planning was an important part of their ministries to families The number of couples using it is constantly growing he said but much more concerted effort is needed Priests must see to it that natural methods are known to couples and those who experience difficulty in their practice receive competent instruction the Pope said He denounced what he called presentday trivialization or desecration of sexuality Sexual love is truly human only if it is an integral part of the love by which a man and a woman commit themselves totally to one another until death he said The Pope noted in passing the role the American church is playing on behalf of the poor for racial ethnic and cultural minorities as well as for the disadvantaged But he turned again to family issues in paying tribute also to the churchs activities in campaigning against abortion We simply cannot accept the contemporary pursuit of exaggerated convenience and comfort the Pope declared We must realize that in our struggle to overcome the negative influences of modern society we are identified with Christ the Lord
STAGE VIEW; EVEN MINIMAL SHEPARD IS FOOD FOR THOUGHT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/theater/stage-view-even-minimal-shepard-is-food-for-thought.html,REGEN Nightingale Tues AM Back in 1970 Sam Shepards Unseen Hand introduced us to the Sorcerers and Silent Ones of the High Commission of Nogoland reclusive but awesomely influential creatures with a special enthusiasm for mind warps time splits telepathic forcefields dimensional overlays and other brainsplintering voodoo Well 13 years later it looks rather as if Mr Shepard was writing coded prophecies about himself With True West nearly a year into its run at the Cherry Lane Fool for Love thriving at Circle Rep and Superstitions and The Sad Lament of Pecos Bill just arrived at La Mama it is clear that he has cast a much more than ordinary spell over the theatrical faithful no bad thing in my view and perhaps no surprising one either given the competition currently about There is nothing like hearing some other dramatists hold forth on American themes to make one appreciate Shepard even minor Shepard and even minimal Shepard such as the two fragments at La Mama Take Erik Broggers Basement Tapes at the Village Gate On the quaint assumption that something called the Reactionary Independent Party is about to be launched and at about 20 times the necessary length this purported satire asserts that Mr Nixon is tricky Mr Ford slowwitted and G Gordon Liddy a mewling neurotic posing as a Nietzschian superhero Could one conceive of the author of Operation Sidewinder producing a work so visually and verbally skimpy so relentlessly rectilinear in its attack on skullduggery in high places Or take Kathleen Tolans Weekend Near Madison at the Astor Place This won golden opinions at last Februarys Louisville Festival and one can see why It is deft affectionate and amusing in its depiction of respectively a Wisconsin psychiatrist and his wife trying to survive the botched abortion of their first child and two hardline feminists deciding how best one of them is to become pregnant But is it asks a small voice quite enough to be deft affectionate and amusing about subjects which if you think about them for more than a moment do have darkish fissures running beneath the surface Is it enough to end with a smile a shrug and the inference that these essentially wellmeaning folk will muddle on through It is a talented play no doubt of it but it suffers from one of the more crippling theatrical diseases chronic evasiveness edging into terminal harmlessness To borrow his own imagery Shepard is as evasive as a supercharged Packard and as harmless as a rattlesnake in a mailbox That curvilinear talent of his may express itself in oblique metaphorical ways but it customarily leaves you feeling youve been boxed up for two hours with someone with a conscientious zeal for confrontation danger He is not the man to let fissures of feeling remain unexplored or to wince away from ugly denouements Think of Tilden at the end of Buried Child lumbering onstage in his lobotomized way to present his wrangling chaotic family with the corpse of the baby they have destroyed Think of much of Fool for Love This plays reviewers have quite properly ransacked its text for meaning and quite rightly found several of Mr Shepards peculiar concerns there the preoccupation with a callous rejecting yet still cherished father the feeling that the family as a whole is a disaster zone the rueful recognition of the decay of the West the insistence on the unreliability of observation the elusiveness of truth But he has long proclaimed his indifference to ideas which speak only to the mind and I wonder if his critics have done enough justice to the sheer force of the piece the way it constantly caps one piece of testimony to the unruliness of love with another and yet another First and centrally theres the protagonists raging resentful passion for her halfbrother himself seemingly unable to live either with or without her Then out of the darkness comes a glare of lights a screech of brakes a sound of gunfire his abandoned mistress it seems making herself rather drastically felt And then we have one of the longest and most riveting of Mr Shepards celebrated monologues describing the bigamous loves of the couples father and his two wives abject and finally suicidal obsession with him Mr Shepard flirts perilously with melodrama given all the howling banging on walls and to quote a stage direction as well as to describe Kitty Whitton Bakers fulsome performance weeping of bodies but flirtation stays safely short of consummation Indeed there were times when it seemed to me we had an American Ph edre on our hands Or perhaps thats to overdo it Certainly a visit to the doublebill at La Mama should discourage anyone tempted to deify Mr Shepard because at least onehalf of it is too obvious and predictable to justify its belated premiere in New York Pecos Bill was actually his contribution to the Bicentennial and is just the sort of backhanded celebration one would expect of him a gaudy cantata in which the outlaw of the title arriving onstage on a wicker scorpion boasts of strangling tornadoes tearing down mountains and digging the Rio Grande by hand only to end in querulous bewilderment Why is we forsaken lost in shame forgotten Still the piece should provide the burgeoning Shepard industry with some useful footnotes Not only does it contrast the magnificence of the myth with the bleakness of contemporary reality it also reminds us of what was tawdry and squalid in that supposed magnificence This is surely the answer to those who accuse Mr Shepard of mindless nostalgia for the Old Frontier He dreams as many of us do of release liberty being at one with the wilderness but he knows what this often meant and means in practice The Morphan Brothers scratching a living from robbing trains in The Unseen Hand Crude aggressive Lee in True West gambling on his fighting dog in nohope hamlets Pecos Bill the swaggering blabbermouth killing his wife Superstitions is even less easy to categorize as drama consisting as it does of snippets from the scattered reverie Mr Shepard recently published as Motel Chronicles and incidentally omitting its most striking segment the tale of a friends brain operation Yet I must confess myself much more interested by the monologues nonchalantly put across by Mark Petrakis and by his occasional conversations with his costar Olan Shepard They offer glimpses of the unsettled furniture of Mr Shepards mind an American Primitive dresser here a baroque table there and everwhere chairs in which you and I too can sit if we fit The piece is about dreads and fixations and morbid predawn imaginings How the chainsaw will kick back and mutilate you How nuclear disaster will come and no one will warn you because you havent a radio or a working phone or even a good friend to ring you It is about compulsions and compulsive behavior How youll maybe win if you keep certain betting tickets in certain pockets How you can exorcise an unwanted admirer by walking in perscribed patterns in front of her door  not letting her see you of course or youll die It would be a rather literalminded scholarship that went on from here to draw attention to the many monomaniacs who stumble bugeyed through Mr Shepards oeuvre at the extreme point Henry Hackenbush alias Howard Hughes in Seduced a scrawny wizened pharoah given to plastering his naked body with Kleenex or Lanx and Wheeler in Angel City moguls hellbent on making a disaster movie capable of causing mass panic and mass suicide thus relieving urban pollution in Los Angeles It is what obsessional behavior means and represents that matters It is a foredoomed attempt to gain or regain lost identity understanding and control It is desperate magic born of disorder helplessness and desolation It is insecurity writ huge This brings us naturally enough to that legion of the lost which peoples Mr Shepards plays Their essential tragedy or at least the reason they are lost seems to me to be that they are simultaneously searching for things that are incompatible and possibly not attainable anyway excitement and security the exhilaration of selffulfillment and a sense of belonging freedom and roots What chance for the dedicated loner in a world increasingly given over to moneymen and real estate swindlers like those who entrap ruin and selectively slaughter the dilapidated family of Curse of the Starving Class What hope of genuine selfexpression for exemplary victims like those at the centers of Geography of a Horse Dreamer and Angel City  the one a shaman in the hands of profiteering mafiosi the other a writer in the grip of Hollywood a place eloquently if highhandedly evoked by green ooze and fanged men with green skin There is no escape and no retreat That would seem to be the glum conclusion of Mr Shepards family trilogy Starving Class Buried Child True West Out there in Norman Rockwell country the avocados are rotting on the trees father is drunkenly smashing in the door and one sibling is trying to strangle another The family is less a refuge than a trap which seduces grips then maims or kills and its roots and traditions are also its curse an inexorable handingover of loss from one generation to the next Hence the flamboyant and usually empty gestures to which Mr Shepards characters are prone Flailing about for personal and social significance they adopt masks images roles sometimes pretending to themselves they are really faces identities selves Pecos Bill would be a tiny example The best because it is Mr Shepards most extravagantly imaginative play would be Tooth of Crime a picture of a rock idol destroyed not merely by a younger rival but by the impossibility of sustaining the hard mean style he must affect in order to survive It aint me he yells and shoots himself Its said Mr Shepards plays are obscure Dont be intimidated they have become less quirky and more accessible in recent times while getting no less original complex and resonant Its also said that he is exclusively American in his subject matter and appeal a claim which ignores the interest taken in him in Britain in Scandinavia and elsewhere If you seek confirmation of his scope listen to this brief germane and farfromparochial piece of selfexplication I think were split in a much more devastating way than psychology can ever reveal Its not so cute Not some little thing we can get over Its something weve got to live with Those words could have come from David Storey or the late David Mercer British dramatists whose obsession with the loss of their workingclass roots has produced plays packed with the sense of fragmentation disintegration They could come from Samuel Beckett himself In fact they are Mr Shepards own observation on True West which is about a tame brother who partly yearns to be wild and a wild brother who partly yearns to be tame about the longings of the heart and the longings of the head and the impossibility of reconciling the two at least on planet Earth If Fool for Love is Mr Shepards motelroom Ph edre True West is his West Coast Endgame There is a level and not so far beneath the surface at which his brothers can claim kinship with Becketts Hamm and Clov ravenous body and troubled mind each incomplete in itself interdependent yet doomed to be hostile No Mr Shepard is not just American The truth rather is that he is a dramatist of international stature who brings a distinctively American idiom context and imagination to universal confusions
BURGER'S WARREN COURT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/25/opinion/burger-s-warren-court.html,Predictions of the death of the Warren Court have been considerably overstated Whether they have been only premature or will instead come to be viewed as false alarms is likely to be decided in the next nine months and on Election Day 1984 Thirty years ago Dwight D Eisenhower named Earl Warren Chief Justice of the United States On Oct 3 the Supreme Court opens its 15th term under his successor Warren E Burger Since 1969 Richard M Nixon Gerald R Ford and Ronald Reagan all highly critical of Warren era rulings have among them chosen six of the nine Justices Of the 1960s liberal majority only William J Brennan and Thurgood Marshall still sit A Democrat has not named a Justice in 16 years Thus we might reasonably have expected Warren Court cases protecting individual liberties to be more at home on a Smithsonian shelf than in a law library Yet nothing so grave has occurred Warren Court momentum has continued into the 1980s The Burger Court appears most conservative when seen in its predecessors shadow Some cases have retreated from or have refused to extend 1960s precedents Some have been dreadful for civil liberties Some would have been decided differently by the Warren bench But the Burger Court taken out from under the Warren shadow emerges as more responsive to individual rights than any other Supreme Court in our history Landmark cases restricting capital punishment assuring reproductive freedom protecting commercial speech upholding affirmative action to redress discrimination expanding constitutional remedies and protecting the rights of women aliens and children of unmarried parents have all been decided since 1970 Some of these cases were based on Warren Court precedents but were not required by them Why have three Republican Presidents with six appointments not succeeded in reversing the Courts liberal direction How is it that Mr Burger William H Rehnquist and Sandra Day OConnor the Justices most hostile to Warren Court rulings have not won majorities that take strong conservative positions or frequently majorities at all The answer partly lies in the difficulty a President has in predicting how a candidate will vote once tenured on the Court Also some Presidents select solely on merit and nominal party affiliation as President Ford has claimed in explaining his choice of John Paul Stevens Most important the Supreme Court is a collegial institution whose members must work together for years even decades So another explanation for the conservatives failure to build a strong working majority lies in the attributes of individual Justices It is increasingly clear that Mr Brennan seated in 1956 deserves much of the credit for fashioning the legal theories that support progressive decisions of the Warren and Burger eras The ideas he advanced in the 1960s have influenced the Courts direction in the 1970s and 1980s Among his opinions are such significant 1960s cases as Baker v Carr which held that Federal courts can review the apportionment of state legislative districts New York Times v Sullivan the first in a series of cases giving the news media and others a constitutional defense in libel actions by public officials and Shapiro v Thompson invalidating residency requirements for welfare applicants The list continues into the Burger era with such cases as Eisenstadt v Baird which recognized an unmarried persons right to birth control information and advanced the doctrinal basis for then pending abortion cases Plyler v Doe striking down a Texas law denying free public education to illegal alien children and a host of cases strengthening womens constitutional rights Moroever scholars have begun to identify Mr Brennans doctrinal contributions to opinions of other Justices and his facility for finding common ground that binds tentative majorities To be sure Mr Brennan lost many battles after the liberal majority faded Some positions  for example that the death penalty is unconstitutional  probably would have failed in both eras Others like his view that Congress may not deny Medicaid for elective abortions almost surely would have persuaded former colleagues Supreme Court majorities cohere around principles not personalities The liberal momentum has continued in large part because of Mr Brennans intellectual strength He is the Courts liberal theoretician but he has been able to forge majorities by advancing principles also acceptable to Court centrists  something the conservatives have failed to do as often as one might have expected Three dangers loom Mr Rehnquist could bid for doctrinal leadership when Mr Brennan leaves If he succeeded he might attract the centrists and give conservatives more victories Second Mr Brennan Mr Burger Mr Marshall Harry A Blackmun and Lewis F Powell Jr all well into their 70s are likely to retire before the 1988 Presidential election If Mr Reagan wins in 1984 he may get to pick a Court majority in a very brief time Mr Burger and Mr Powell might leave before next summer to assure that their successors are Republicans The third danger is different President Nixon tried to weaken the Court by nominating mediocre lawyers President Reagan who appears to have learned from that mistake is likely to nominate intellectually stellar conservatives able to challenge Mr Brennans doctrinal leadership while he sits and thereafter to dominate constitutional jurisprudence Virtually no nominee is likely to win Senate confirmation after the start of next summer Nominations late in a Presidential year are generally delayed pending election returns though an exception might be made for a person of national stature a Democrat or a respected Senator So the critical times for the Court and for the legacy of the 1960s are the next nine months and Election Day 1984 Not even the remarkable talents of a William J Brennan would be able to resist if those tides of history flowed to the right
"Charlotte Curtis Politics, Women and Money",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/27/arts/charlotte-curtis-politics-women-and-money.html,THE invitation on Democratic National Committee stationery was for a womens luncheon with Isabelle Leeds and Marife Hernandez as the hosts and it mentioned access to the decision making process and hinted at benefits accruing to those who contributed between 1000 and 10000 Fourteen women including Faith StewartGordon of the Russian Tea Room Betty Friedan and Mrs Joseph E Levine the movie moguls wife were sufficiently intrigued and they showed up at the 21 Club to see what was going on Mrs Leeds and Miss Hernandez in Adolfo suits with ties greeted guests Over cocktails Hamptons regulars compared notes with those whod contemplated democracy in the meadows of Aspen Colo Lynn Cutler Iowas first woman county supervisor who lost two Congressional bids before becoming the Democratic National Committees vice chairman began to put faces with names she was hearing mostly for the first time And after 45 minutes or so Miss Hernandez urged everyone to her assigned table Waiters were dishing up the gumbo when Mrs Leeds welcomed everyone to 21 which she called a home away from home for most of you She made no bones about why theyd met We always hear about the input men have in the party she said The question is how they got it Well they get it by paying to get into the game What were going to talk about is how we can get it and what the prices are Miss Hernandez reminded everyone how busy they were Were going to eat think and talk at the same time she said introducing Mrs Cutler When we moved into the DNC Mrs Cutler began there was broken furniture lying on its sides It looked like the fall of Saigon What she meant was the chaos that party headquarters become after it loses a Presidential election as in 1980 Instead of explaining she said the Democratic National Committee was dedicated to women running for office She was about to go on about women when three dressings French cheese and watercress for the chicken salad appeared While she paused to make her choice watercress Alice Heyman who described herself as a fallenaway Republican wanted an assessment of labors support for women in 1984 The unions will support women Mrs Cutler said sprinkling her salad with bacon bits But we must deal with the big issues the economy war and peace Mrs Friedan looked distressed If women are to be taken seriously she said we wouldnt be called here to give money but to give our ideas I worry that the Democratic leadership doesnt take us as seriously as they take labor and minorities If women work together ours is a greater power than labors Mrs Cutler gave up eating But Im here as the vice chair not head of the womens division she said Were counting on you to help with the issues and the dollars We want you in visible viable places in convention delegations Or you can get there through contributions She said she wanted the DNCs finance and business councils to be 50 percent women The council literature was in folders at each place but nobodyd gotten to it If they had theyd have found that it costs 1000 to join the womens group 5000 for the finance council and 10000 for the business council Besides a chance for commitment the councils offer a quid pro quo called benefits Finance members are promised quarterly meetings of a substantive and social nature where members are briefed by prominent Democrats issue dinners and breakfasts with party bigwigs and the opportunity to attend the national convention as honored guests with convention access That means youre invited allowed so many seats and invitations and pay all your own expenses Business council membership including senior officials of major corporations associations and allied professional groups promises the same quarterly meetings but with nationally known speakers leading panels and discussion groups That 10000 guarantees contact not only with other leaders of the American business community but with the political and intellectual leaders of America The council also provides the opportunity to attend the convention None of this came up at lunch Mrs Cutlers pitch was for womens equal participation and therefore equally expensive contributions to the national committee Guests who spoke up wanted the national committees support on womens issues first I thought we were going to hear about an emergency registration campaign for women Mrs Friedan said Robin Duke of the Abortion Rights Action League said women should be concerned with a wide range of national issues and not limit themselves to those specific to women Bess Myerson seemed to agree Barbaralee Diamondstein an arts writer wondered what the national committee had in mind for women who didnt have big money to contribute Mrs Cutler who had been standing so long that she had taken a shoe off assured her the party had work for them Before leaving Ellen Straus of radio station WMCA thanked the hosts Youve done well she said Before doing the next step come back and listen to us Mrs Straus had reservations about a registration campaign Do we really want to register all women or women who are with us she asked On that note the lunch adjourned Within days Miss Hernandez a former protocol chief for New York paid up becoming the first New York woman on the finance council Mrs Cutler wrote everyone talking more quid pro quo for contributions including 1000 tickets for the Democratic Gala in Washington tomorrow and invitations to private dinner parties at the homes of prominent Democrats where meaningful conversations might be held Clearly the Democratic National Committee was getting itself back in business again shoring up what may or may not be meaningful relationships with women

THE DOCTOR'S WORLD; PHYSICAN-PATIENT CONFIDENTIALITY SLIPS AWAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/27/science/the-doctor-s-world-physican-patient-confidentiality-slips-away.html,WHILE aboard an Amtrak train recently a young doctor was telling a woman traveling with him about his cases He spoke about how surgeons would soon probe into the brain of Mr Jones about the hormonal imbalances in Mrs Whites body and the clinical details of several other patients He was learning medicine this young doctor and he was excited about it He told his stories so enthusiastically that some passengers in the crowded train who could not help but overhear the conversation followed every word The doctor sounded compassionate and interested in the psychological welfare of his patients and families But caught up in his enthusiasm he apparently was referring to his patients by their real names In doing so the physician was betraying his patients by violating one of the fundamental tenets of medicine the mandate to maintain confidentiality In that betrayal the young doctor was not alone It has become increasingly apparent that patients can no longer assume that intimacies about their bodies or their private lives will be held in confidence by their physicians and those who work with those physicians This has the potential for real danger Total privacy may never have been possible and all of us were aware of that on some level But a patients assumption that the doctor could be trusted has always been a necessary condition of effective treatment Release of private information can after all be embarrassing and worse There is for instance the story of a restaurant owner who was admitted to a hospital for an infection when word got around about his illness his business was severely hurt The erosion of confidentiality is a troubling problem in medicine The problem has become so nettlesome that the Brigham and Womens Hospital in Boston which is a Harvard teaching hospital felt it had to post signs in its elevators recently saying Hospital staff are reminded that patient information should not be discussed in public areas James P King a hospital spokesman observed that In too many hospitals in the country rounds may be conducted in hallways or elevators which is not appropriate Part of the problem appears to be that some doctors  a small minority one assumes  no longer value confidentiality as highly as virtually all doctors once did One can only guess at the complicated reasons for this deterioration but it is clear that these doctors reveal an absence of training and discipline that never would have been tolerated years ago To some degree the loss of privacy is not the fault of the doctors so much as it is a natural outgrowth of the way medicine and society have evolved Even doctors who ardently wish they could maintain confidentiality can find themselves in doubt as to how to proceed In the beginning of course there was no doubt From the time of Hippocrates doctors have sworn to protect the confidentiality of the information given to them by patients in the belief that the privacy of the patientdoctor relationship is an integral part of the healing process That confidentiality has been viewed as a bond of trust that allows patients to confide in physicians all sorts of intimate details that they otherwise might not reveal to anyone else A physician can collect almost a complete profile of a persons life in the hour or so needed to take a detailed medical history In the process single women may tell of abortions married men about infidelities others about psychological fears and teenagers about using contraceptives The thorough physician takes all these factors into account because any such secret though it may not seem to be directly related to what brought the patient to the doctor may influence the treatment and thus the course of an illness Maintaining confidentiality was easier when there was a onetoone relationship between doctor and patient But that type of medical practice is vanishing Now patients rarely see just one physician The trend is for them to be cared for by a team of physicians or a series of them each a specialist in a different area The greater the number of people involved in a case the greater the chance for confidentiality to diminish For example some patients who belong to health maintenance organizations may never see the same doctor in all their visits Each time a new doctor treats them there is a need to read the chart That is particularly true in teaching hospitals affiliated with medical schools where young doctors like the one aboard the Amtrak train care for patients and learn from them at the same time The number of people involved in any case can go far beyond the team of doctors Many of the larger teams have nonphysician members And there are clerks who have access to operating room schedules which can be extraordinarily revealing Many of these people are pillars of discretion some are not In any case hospital officials often have much less control over the indiscretions of nonmedical employees than they do over physicians If you walk through hospital corridors or ride elevators in medical centers you are bound to overhear the health workers tell stories that would make good plots for television soap operas But in the hospitals the stories are told with real names Or ride a bus that picks up its passengers by a hospital Too often the hospital employees can be heard releasing their frustrations about difficult patients If you sit in a doctors waiting room you may hear secretaries blurting out peoples names as they book operations take telephone calls for appointments or discuss the personal finances of patients The insurance system alone has eliminated any remnant of confidentiality Dozens of people may see an individuals medical record or portions of it in checking on payments Nevertheless physicians themselves are sometimes the worst offenders particularly at parties The intellectual fascination associated with practicing medicine makes it natural for one physician meeting another to relate the intriguing details of a current case perhaps with actual names being used Often the attending physician relates such stories in the presence of nonmedical people too Furthermore some physicians brag about treating this celebrity or that prominent person Whatever remaining bond of confidentiality might still exist the patient is often the one to break it first Some patients simply dont care who knows what Others are so well aware of how little privacy there is that they have decided not to worry about it The desire for confidentiality varies from culture to culture too A committee of the British National Health Service noted last month in The Lancet that attitudes toward privacy differed just as attitudes towards nakedness vary In modern times total confidentiality probably never existed Eric W Springer a lawyer in Pittsburgh said at a law and medicine conference at the University of Alabama in 1981 We are the victims of our own myth making There never was absolute confidentiality in health information although many acted and pontificated as if this were the case The statutory protections afforded such privileged communications vary widely among the states Mr Springer said and because of changes in recent years no repository is safe from attack no piece of information is fully protected Mr Springer sees medicine going through an increasingly painful dilemma as the demands for confidentiality are met with growing demands for disclosure Laws have broadened a physicians obligations in disclosing information obtained in treating a patient Laws long have required physicians to tell health departments the names of patients who suffer from syphilis and some other sexually transmitted diseases so that epidemics can be thwarted Doctors have been required to tell the police that they have removed bullets from patients Newer compromises come from laws governing child abuse and occupational safety and health In some countries laws may compel doctors to name individuals who take drugs that could impair the ability to drive Doctors are well aware of the problem because there have been articles in medical journals calling confidentiality in medicine dead shot full of holes or a decrepit concept Moreover few doctors are required to take the Hippocratic Oath before they obtain their medical licenses and even when they do the oath has no power beyond its tradition What can be done Perhaps greater attention should be paid to the problem in medical schools and health centers as well as in the insurance industry Perhaps doctors could inform their patients as some have suggested about the limitations of confidentiality What can the patient do Not much beyond banishing selfdelusionThis discussion is certainly not meant as a suggestion that patients should be secretive in the doctors office A lie to a physician or an intentional omission of vital information could have results that are a much greater tragedy than the loss of a secret

STOPGAP FEDERAL MONEY BILL IS VOTED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/01/us/stopgap-federal-money-bill-is-voted.html,Congress approached the new fiscal year with unaccustomed discipline today swiftly approving a 40day stopgap spending bill needed to keep the Government operating after midnight The House gave final approval by a vote of 232 to 136 while the Senate approved the measure by voice vote The measure now goes to President Reagan who is expected to sign it Saturday despite earlier Administration objections Mr Reagans signature would avert a threatened shutdown of various Government agencies at the onset of the 1984 fiscal year Saturday Administration budget officials had complained that the measure was nearly 10 billion above the Presidents request on domestic spending But Representative Silvio O Conte of Massachusetts ranking Republican on the House Appropriations Committee told the House that he had received assurances from David A Stockman director of the Office of Management and Budget I just got a call from the young slasher and he informed me that he would recommend that the President sign Mr Conte said In another action House and Senate conferees postponed consideration of an extension of benefits for the longterm unemployed The Senate approved an 18month extension today 89 to 0 while the House version would extend the benefits 45 days The cost of the House version if extended over a year is estimated at 45 billion while the Senates version supported by the Reagan Adminstration would cost 37 billion over the 18 months The bill would finance the Federal program for those who have exhausted the basic 26 weeks of jobless benefits and the special 13 weeks of extended benefits available in some states The conferees are to resume discussions Monday Money for the checks to be mailed next week was appropriated in the current fiscal year so they will not be affected officials said Agreement in 80 Minutes Congress gave final approval to the stopgap spending measure after House and Senate conferees resolved their differences in an 80minute session that contrasted with allnight sessions of previous years To meet the midnight deadline senators and representatives refrained from adding specialinterest amendments after getting assurances that they would have ample opportunities to seek additional spending for their states and districts The bill provides money though Nov 10 as the Senate had proposed rather than Nov 15 which the House had wanted At that time a new resolution will be needed to provide continued funding for the agencies not covered by separate appropriation bills The earlier date was intended to enable President Reagan to sign the next continuing resolution before his scheduled twoweek trip to the Far East Compromise on the Military The measure provides military spending at the rate of 247 billion annually the amount approved by a House Appropriations subcommittee The House bill had proposed 228 billion and the Senate 253 billion Officials of the Office of Management and Budget said the measure if extended across the full year would provide 749 billion in domestic spending above the levels fixed by law for programs such as Social Security or food stamps This discretionary spending was 95 billion above the Presidents request but 28 billion less than the current spending level and 67

NORTH COUNTRY WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/02/books/north-country-women.html,UNION STREET   By Pat Barker 265 pp New York G P Putnams Sons 1395  UNION STREET Pat Barkers first novel is set in the early 1970s in an unnamed city in Englands industrial Northeast The impoverished grimy town has two basic industries the steelworks from which the men are frequently furloughed or prematurely retired and the cake factory where many of the women work or have worked Miss Barker skillfully employs the factory setting to touch on matters like automation race prejudice feeblemindedness and the sheer human hardship experienced by some of those trapped on the assembly line The author was born in the Northeast in Thornaby onTees and lives now in nearby Durham Union Street was well received when it appeared in England last year the highest accolade or subtlest put down being The New Statesmans comment that it was a long overdue workingclass masterpiece Miss Barker was also included in a list of the 20 best young under 40 British novelists a designation almost as bleak and constricting as the landscape she draws and one that as she was born in 1943 she will outgrow this year Her novel is divided into seven sections each named for a particular female It begins with a chapter on the cheeky prepubescent Kelly Brown who is brutally raped by a man who has been shadowing her truant wanderings since morning and ends with the nearoctogenarian Alice Bell who drags herself from home one wintry day to avoid the humiliation of the social welfare system and die in peace Between these two are five quite wonderful chapters called Joanne Wilson Lisa Goddard Muriel Scaife Iris King and Blonde Dinah Together the seven sections explore every permutation and nuance both within and outside the desperate social milieu that is this authors artistic capital of growing up growing old making do making a liv Ivan Gold is a novelist and reviewer living in Boston ing having babies raising children absorbing grief loving someone or hating where you are meant to love Scores of characters apart from the seven women named spring vibrantly to life their suitors parents siblings husbands children their doctors and nurses and neighbors as well as the denizens of the streets a cut above Union Street or a cut below The seven women move easily and resonantly in and out of one anothers lives and stories This is a hoary fictional technique John Dos Passos USA comes quickly to mind as does for an American equivalent to the grinding desperate poverty the fiction of Harriette Arnow Yet Miss Barker is equally capable of brilliantly bending the technical rules Having situated us more or less comfortably in the head of Muriel Scaife whose sickly young husband is about to die she veers with great effect into the inner life of 12yearold Richard Scaife who will soon be dealing with the loss of the father he never really had At the end of this story there is a scene in which Miss Barker manages to convey with stunning economy and skill the ineffable communion between bereaved wife and bereaved son Her gifts are equally in evidence in Lisa Goddard in which the harried mother of two young sons miserably awaits the birth of her third child unwanted and overdue while her redundant and boozing husband steals the money she has put aside for the new baby and beats her when she accuses him of the theft She can scarcely accept the purple howling dwarf she is finally delivered of If she had been an animal she would have rejected it would have sniffed at it and turned away at once and finally Here Miss Barkers magic lies in showing us how Lisa Goddard falls in love with her newborn daughter before they ever leave the hospital you have to read it to believe it Through many of the other chapters as well as through her very own moves the ample person of Iris King She is earth mother and comforter to many including Laura her own violently schizophrenic aunt or perhaps cousin  Iris is not entirely sure which  who has a history of setting senior citizens on fire because they are of no use and is forgiven even for bopping Iris on the head with a vase Iris is both bane and terror to others among them her own pregnant 16 yearold daughter Brenda Iris threatens and cajoles Brenda into undergoing an abortion at the hands of the slovenly Big Irene with horrific results At the end Iris who never entirely forfeits our sympathy is crooning to and stroking her socially acceptable grandson by her elder daughter An unforgettable minor character is dotty old Mrs Harrison whose spouse superannuated George Harrison takes up with the ancient hooker Blonde Dinah Miss Barkers pungent raunchy North Country dialogue and her exact use of obscure words and neologisms like a mans cheeks  juddering  while he sleeps or the  scrumpling  of a newspaper for a fire or an old womans  muculent  eyes alternate with passages of fine understated wit for example this paragraph on the late John Scaifes motherinlaw The old ladys conviction that her soninlaw had enjoyed excellent health though a little shaken by his death was by no means overcome All in all Pat Barker gives the sense of a writer who has enormous power that she has scarcely had to tap to write a firstrate first novel Im glad this book was published here and look forward to reading her next
"LOCAL STRUGGLE, LOCAL COMPROMISE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/02/books/local-struggle-local-compromise.html,1982  By Nathan Glazer 359 pp Cambridge Mass Harvard University Press 20  THE essays Nathan Glazer has written during the last 18 years constitute a model of social commentary  sustained committed detailed lively and eventempered With extraordinary energy Mr Glazer has not only kept up with but paid attention to all the unexpected turnings of ethnic relations and ethnic ideology in the United States and more recently in other countries Of course Mr Glazer who is a professor of sociology and education at Harvard University and coeditor of The Public Interest has written on other issues during this period and he has written more on ethnic issues than the pieces in this volume but this is his own selection to form he says a running commentary on and analysis of issues of racial and ethnic conflict The essays in Ethnic Dilemmas 19641982 are occasionally repetitive for Mr Glazers own convictions have not altered much over the years He remains as committed to integration today as he was and we all were at the beginning of the civil rights movement Michael Walzer  a professor in the School of Social Science at the Institute for Advanced Study at Princeton University is the author of Spheres of Justice A Defense of Pluralism and Equality But he doesnt wear his convictions like blinders to narrow his vision the collection as a whole is empirically rich full of information about courts schools families and jobs And Mr Glazer has somehow managed to give his convictions an air of tentativeness and to acknowledge that his opponents might sometimes have a point Indeed our ethnic dilemmas are so difficult that it would take a fool to write about them in a conclusive voice Again and again Mr Glazer poses the hardest question What kind of society do we want to live in He writes with a powerful urgency No one but us can decide the issue is not determined and the crucial choices are being made right now Contemporary arguments about cultural pluralism bilingualism and affirmative action are comparable to the arguments about immigration in the early 20th century We will live differently tomorrow with different opportunities in different groups under different legal arrangements depending on how we choose today The burden of Mr Glazers essays is a defense of what the American historian John Higham has called pluralistic integration a kind of limited Americanization with the Government upholding a common political culture and a universalist law but not directly challenging ethnic loyalties One can imagine Mr Glazer in a different mood under different conditions writing as Horace Kallen did in his social commentaries during the 1920s attacking assimilationist pressures But he is searching here for some middle ground between stateimposed uniformity and ethnic division and it is his clear sense that the greater danger now is division The danger is corporatism or to use a religious analogy establishmentarianism  that is the recognition of ethnic groups as legal bodies with rights and entitlements The United States is not threatened by the dominance of one such group but by a systematic division of professional and bureaucratic positions and social resources among a range of groups The bitterness and confusion that are likely to be engendered or have already been engendered by the process of defining the range and naming the groups is as much a part of the danger of such corporatism as is the likely outcome  a nation divided against itself Mr Glazer is not against division he is committed to the separation of ethnic groups and the state just as he is committed to the separation of church and state These are the walls that whether we love them or not make good neighbors His program is public neutrality and private freedom I should stress that public neutrality in his view bars legal provision for or enforcement of ethnicity but it is no bar to political activity on behalf of this or that ethnic group He does not object to bloc voting balanced tickets or political patronage Nor does he object to legislation that expresses the cultural or religious preferences of groups that are able to put together a coalition and temporarily get their way He would have preferred for example a statebystate resolution of the issue of abortion reflecting in each case the balance of ethnic and religious forces Local struggle and local compromise are the best ways of dealing with political questions that involve the opposing views of ethnic and religious groups Mr Glazer prefers compromise to principle politics to law legislatures to courts The right to organize politically to defend the material or ideal interests of ones group is a part of private freedom But what are we to do about groups whose members lack the resources skills or cohesiveness for this kind of collective selfdefense Americas ethnic dilemmas have their origin for the most part in the inability of black Americans to make their way on their own from slavery and systematic exclusion to anything like pluralistic integration It is the legal recognition of this inability and then the attempt to find legal remedies through affirmative action and the enforcement of quotas that has carried the country toward corporatism When private freedom doesnt work how can we maintain public neutrality THREE responses to that question three arguments against ethnic division are reiterated throughout these essays The first and least satisfactory is the claim that private freedom has indeed worked and is working in a rapid and satisfactory manner as Mr Glazer put it in 1978 I wonder if he would say that today While real progress has been made in building up the black middle class in 1983 we seem well on our way to the creation of a permanent and frighteningly large black underclass unemployed or only intermittently employed degraded and demoralized To be sure this underclass is not likely to be helped by affirmative action or by any quota system still Mr Glazer is not always alert enough I think to the sense of desperation that lies just behind such proposals His second argument is that legal remedies that are designed for blacks and more or less well adapted to their situation cannot be limited to them We live under the rule of the law and law must apply generally Hence from the very beginning affirmative action programs have included all those groups whose situation might plausibly be compared to that of blacks  native Americans Hispanics and Asian Americans But the last two of these turn out to be arbitrary composites including groups that have done very well Japanese and South Americans for example and hardly require help from the Government Once help is available however it will be sought out thus the demand of immigrants from India that they be included in the category AsianAmericans how can they be left out despite their relative success in this country And then what about white ethnics who lag behind many of the protected groups Ultimately quotas will have to be expanded there will be legal pressure for universality and political pressure for inclusion If some groups have rights then all groups have rights and since discrimination has been experienced by every successive wave of immigrants the prospects for corporatist interventions to protect group rights are virtually unlimited But Mr Glazer insists so are the costs of intervention For groups can have no enforceable rights unless they also have fixed memberships Until now it has been a feature of American life that we move freely across group boundaries emphasizing now one side now the other of our hyphenated identities or giving up such identities altogether and becoming simply Americans If such movement is curtailed we will find ourselves living more like French Canadians or Cypriots or even Lebanese than the way we live today Mr Glazers third argument is a call for the acceptance of the consequences of a free and easy pluralism If groups are real then we must accept differences among them The socioeconomic profile of each ethnic group differs from that of all the others because the groups themselves differ  in their internal culture family arrangements and institutional development among other things It makes no sense to defend cultural pluralism while denying its necessary consequences Governmental action to annul those consequences and to maintain fixed statistical norms for group achievement will be costly coercive and as long as the groups retain some independent vitality unsuccessful We must choose between socioeconomic uniformity and ethnic pluralism If uniformity is what strict justice requires then in Mr Glazers view we must give up strict justice and aim instead at a reasonable harmony of ethnic groups But he suggests that justice might require something else  that we live with the differences among groups even value them and try to mitigate the negative consequences that society imposes for such differences THAT last suggestion comes in an essay written in 1969 It isnt followed up or even mentioned again in the essays of the 70s and early 80s But it seems to me to make a crucial point Cultural differences that give rise to vast inequalities of wealth and power cannot be tolerated in a democratic society That doesnt mean however that we cant tolerate cultural differences What we cant tolerate are the vast inequalities  such as the extraordinary differences in black and white family incomes  that are called negative consequences of difference in a capitalist and bureaucratic society Under conditions of greater equality it would not matter if cultures differed nor would it matter if as a result of cultural differences patterns of education and employment differed If there were greater respect for each other among citizens and if political power were more widely shared and if disparities of wealth were limited and the connections of wealth with respect and power were cut cultural differences would be easier to live with than they are today and they might even be more interesting That may be a utopian hope but it lends itself also to practical proposals And it suggests that the resolution of our ethnic dilemmas may be tied to a larger egalitarianism Mr Glazer I suspect would prefer a different resolution  a gradual erosion under conditions of freedom of the different ethnic cultures the forging of a single society That would not indeed be a society of equals but rather a society where inequality was not aggravated by ethnicity There is much to be said however for a society of a different sort where ethnicity is not aggravated by inequality
6 DEMOCRATS APPEAL FOR BACKING AT NOW PARLEY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/03/us/6-democrats-appeal-for-backing-at-now-parley.html,Six Democratic contenders for the White House promised applauding feminists today that they would consider picking a woman as a VicePresidential nominee in 1984 But minutes after hundreds of women jumped to their feet to applaud him Senator John Glenn drew not whoops but catcalls He told the annual conference of the National Organization for Women Let me challenge you just a little bit on the ERA I think we all loafed on the ERA too much What many members of the the audience of 2000 delegates called out in disbelieving and angry tones Maybe you did buddy one woman shouted I think when it was put forward we were very complacent about it and we didnt work hard enough the Democratic Presidential candidate persisted as the chorus of criticism continued And I think the opposition those on the other side they outworked us they outhustled us in many respects Clarification Issued Senator Glenn later issued a clarification of his remarks about the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution and met hastily with the leaders of the organization which had struggled for years to win ratification of the measure Certainly the women in that hall worked blood sweat and tears Betty Friedan said She went to a reception given by the Senator afterward where she said she told the OhioanYou may not have worked hard enough for the ERA but we did She reported that Senator Glenn said he meant that the establishment and leaders of the Democratic Party had not worked hard enough for the measure Senator Glenn was one of six Presidential contenders who appeared today in a bid for the organizations support Former Vice President Walter F Mondale received the warmest reception In his written clarification Senator Glenn praised the tremendous sacrifice and hard work by NOW leaders and members and said he had meant to suggest that all those of us who hold national office our party and all supporters of the ERA must make every effort to see that this time we succeed While some officials said most delegates would forgive his words as a slip of the tongue NOWs president Judy Goldsmith said he may not have understood how many people in that room gave up time from their lives for the ERA She added that he should have clarified better what he meant by we Damage Control Assessed Greg Schneiders the Senators press secretary said only time will tell how effective were Senator Glenns efforts at damage control But he said he felt the Senator had straightened out the misimpression of criticism quickly enough that this will turn out to be a fairly minor thing His speech was so wellreceived and he was so wellreceived I think the day will turn out to be a plus But Senator Glenn won a standing ovation when he closed his prepared speech by citing these words of the 19thcentury suffragist Elizabeth Cady Stanton To men their rights and nothing more To women their rights and nothing less His stumble came in an answer to a question All the invited Democratic candidates appeared before the conference today all voiced support for NOW positions on the equal rights proposal and each said he would seriously consider picking a woman as a VicePresidential candidate Senator Gary Hart of Colorado said I would be proud to run with a woman on either end of the ticket Mr Mondale fresh from his victory in a Maine Democratic straw poll and having just received the endorsement of the AFLCIOs general board said he would not decide on his running mate before the Democratic nominating convention next July He promised to solicit NOWs recommendations and take them very very seriously He said he would not choose anyone who is not a feminist In response to the same question former Senator George McGovern said If there was ever anyone who has proved over the years that he needed help in the selection of a VicePresidential candidate I qualify He added that picking a woman is a very likely prospect NOW has been pushing to have a woman named to the Democratic ticket However Mrs Goldsmith said that a candidate would not have to promise to pick a woman as a VicePresidential candidate in order to be endorsed by the 250000member organtization She said NOWs directors will make its endorsement when the board meets in December or sooner NOWs chief priority will be to back a candidate who can defeat President Reagan she said If President Reagan picks a woman for his running mate as some have suggested Mrs Goldsmith said NOW will continue to work against him because she went on his policies harm women Women at the conference saw todays performances by former Vice President Mondale Mr McGovern and Senators Hart Glenn Alan Cranston and Ernest F Hollings as a tribute to their power Taking note of the candidates support of NOWs positions Mrs Friedan remarked They all got it right All of them have had such an education Theres light years of difference between the Presidential candidates last time and the time before and now They take women seriously Former Gov Reubin Askew of Florida the seventh contender was not invited to address the conference because he is not considered a supporter of freedom of choice on abortion The candidates who appeared before the meeting supported a womans right to an abortion and called for an end to inequities by sex in salaries Social Security and private pension benefits and backed action aagainst child abuse pornography and violence against women In their conference here women have been vociferous in their criticism of President Reagan charging him with being callous and lacking compassion toward the most vulnerable groups in society criticizing his budget cuts in social programs that affect poorer women and children and saying he has deliberately set out to reverse the progress of women toward equality of rights and opportunity Leaders and some of the delegates meeting here believe President Reagan is mobilizing women blacks labor and Hispanic Americans into a coalition through his actions and policies which they see as benefitting corporate America Were a powerful coalition and we have the same enemy said Michele Smith a delegate from New Orleans We need to unite and strengthen each other she added Were the majority Asked if he thought the Democratic Party might come to be viewed as the captive of specialized interests because groups like women and labor are making such strong claims on it Senator Mondale said he did not Im campaigning for the public interest he said

JUSTICES TO RULE ON TRANSIT WAGES AND HOURS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/04/us/justices-to-rule-on-transit-wages-and-hours.html,The Supreme Court in its latest effort to map the elusive boundary between Federal and state authority said today it would rule on whether publicly owned and operated mass transit systems must abide by Federal minimum wage and hour standards Opening their 198384 term the Justices accepted an appeal by the Federal Government from a decision by a Federal district court in Texas that public mass transit systems are immune from Federal wage and hour regulation The lower court ruled that the immunity was required by the Constitution as a matter of state sovereignty The case involves the San Antonio Metropolitan Transit Authority which sued in 1979 for a declaration that it was constitutionally immune from the minimum wage and overtime provisions of the Fair Labor Standards Act The Department of Labor filed a countersuit to require the transit authority to pay overtime to employees who worked more than 40 hours a week The Government is arguing in its appeal that the lower court extended unduly the concept of state sovereignty that the Supreme Court announced in 1976 in a landmark ruling that the Justices have been trying to explain without much success ever since Seeming Contradiction The latest case Donovan v San Antonio Metropolitan Transit No 82 1951 requires the Justices to reconcile two apparently contradictory decisions The first is the 1976 ruling National League of Cities v Usery in which the Court invoked the 10th Amendment to the Constitution to block Congress from extending the Federal minimum wage to state employees The 10th Amendment provides that the powers not delegated to the United States by the Constitution nor prohibited by it to the states are reserved to the states respectively or to the people That meant the Court said in 1976 that Federal regulation could not displace the states freedom to structure integral operations in areas of traditional governmental functions The opinion gave examples of some traditional governmental functions but did not mention transit Then two years ago the Court ruled that the publicly operated Long Island Rail Road had no 10th Amendment immunity from the Federal law that gives railroad workers the right to strike The operation of a commuter railroad the Court said is not a traditional government function In its appeal in the San Antonio case the Justice Department is telling the Court that mass transit like commuter railroads has not historically been one of the core state functions deserving of immunity from Federal regulation On the other side San Antonio and the American Public Transit Association are arguing that mass transit is now an integral government function like police fire and sanitation and that it is irrelevant for constitutional purposes that many transit systems have become public only in recent years The Court today accepted 15 new cases for argument and decision this term including five dealing with freedom of expression or information At the same time the Justices turned down some 700 appeals The Court was greeted today with the result of one of its freespeech rulings last term a decision that declared unconstitutional a Federal law that banned pickets from the public sidewalks surrounding the Supreme Court building A small group of antiabortion pickets stood on the sidewalk this morning as the Court convened Among other cases the Court added to its argument docket are these Loitering Law The Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of a New York law struck down earlier this year by the states highest court that makes it a crime for a person to loiter in a public place for the purpose of engaging or soliciting another person to engage in deviate sexual intercourse The case an appeal by the Erie County district attorney is procedurally puzzling The loitering law was a companion to a New York law prohibiting the act of sodomy itself between consenting adults The New York Court of Appeals declared that law unconstitutional in 1980 in a decision known as Onofre and the Supreme Court refused in 1981 to hear the states appeal When the New York Court of Appeals struck down the loitering law this year it did so in a threeparagraph opinion based entirely on its Onofre decision The court said it could not be a crime to loiter for the purpose of commiting an act that was itself not a crime Although the Onofre decision is technically not before the Supreme Court both sides in this case NY v Uplinger No 821724 told the Justices it would be pointless to consider the loitering issue without deciding whether there is a constitutional right to engage in consensual sodomy defined in the New York law as oral or anal sex between unmarried people The Court has repeatedly turned down opportunities to decide that question In accepting the case today the Justices did not indicate their intention this time Libel Order The Court agreed to decide the constitutionality of a state trial courts order forbidding newspaper defendants in a libel suit from publishing any information they obtained in the course of pretrial discovery Two Washington newspapers The Seattle Times and The Walla Walla UnionBulletin were sued by the leader of a spiritualistic church about whom they had published derogatory articles The plaintiff obtained a protective order prohibiting the papers from printing information about the church and its finances that they learned in the course of pretrial discovery The Washington Supreme Court upheld the order The newspapers are arguing in Seattle Times v Rhinehart No 821721 that under the First Amendments free press guarantee such a prior restraint can be justified only if the plaintiff can show that specific harm will result from publication Cable Television The Court agreed to rule on the constitutionality of an Oklahoma law that prohibits cable television stations from broadcasting liquor advertisements The ban was challenged by a group of Oklahoma cable systems which argued that because it is technically impossible to excise individual commercials from satellite signals the effect of the law would be to prevent the systems from retransmitting outof state signals to Oklahoma subscribers The United States Court of Appeals for the 10th Circuit said the ban did not violate the First Amendment The Federal Government is supporting the cable systems appeal Capital Cities Cable v Crisp No 821795 Sleeping Rights The Court accepted a Government appeal from a lower court ruling that demonstrators had a right to sleep in tents in Lafayette Park across the street from the White House as a way of dramatizing the plight of Washingtons homeless people A Federal regulation that prohibits camping in downtown Washington parks was interpreted by the National Park Service to prohibit sleeping in the tents But the Federal

PERSONAL HEALTH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/05/garden/personal-health-208926.html,ALTHOUGH many ways to prevent unwanted pregnancies are widely available more than half the six million American women and girls who become pregnant each year do not want to have a child either at the time or at all Most of the unintended pregnancies are a result of improper or inconsistent use of contraceptives or failure to use any birthcontrol measure About half are terminated by abortion a procedure decidedly safer for the pregnant woman than childbirth but often emotionally traumatic and certainly more problematic than the use of effective contraception According to a report issued last week by the Alan Guttmacher Institute an organization devoted to birth control policy and research a major reason for ineffective use of contraceptives is fear of the health risks associated with modern methods For example periodic reports linking birthcontrol pills to such risks as heart attack stroke blood clots infertility liver and gallbladder disease and even cancer have prompted many women never to use them and others to stop Reports associating intrauterine devices with pelvic infections and subsequent infertility have stifled growth in the use of those devices even by women who are unlikely to experience the complications And recent animal studies suggesting that vasectomy might increase a mans risk of heart disease have curbed enthusiasm for this popular method of contraception The institutes report Making Choices was issued to help people evaluate the risks and benefits of contraceptive methods compare them with the risks of not using contraception and ultimately to decide upon a safe and sensible contraceptive course for the three decades of life during which most women are fertile As the report notes the best contraceptive choice is likely to change several times during the course of a womans fertile and sexually active years What is best for you at 18 may be inappropriate at 28 and even dangerous at 38 Currently 36 million American women face the problem of how to avoid getting pregnant unintentionally and more than 90 percent of them are using some form of birth control Among women the pill is the most popular method especially for those under 30 But sterilization is the nations leading method  when figures for vasectomy and tubal sterilization are combined  and is especially popular among women over 30 The use of condoms the method ranking third in preference is almost double that of intrauterine devices which barely surpass the diaphragm in popularity Other techiques  spermicides withdrawal and the so called rhythm method  are considerably less popular together accounting for fewer people than those who use no contraception Many considerations other than safety must enter into a womans choice of contraceptives among them effectiveness convenience and cost For example for the first year of use the pill and the diaphragm are the most expensive reversible methods followed by the IUD Sterilization operations by far the most expensive involve only onetime costs they are five times more expensive for women than for men A vasectomy is only slightly more expensive than an early abortion A woman for whom both pregnancy and abortion are unacceptable options should probably consider only the most effective techniques sterilization the pill or the IUD in descending order of effectiveness If safety is the main concern a less effective but virtually harmless barrier method such as condoms or diaphragm backed up by abortion when such methods fail is less risky than say taking the pill or using an IUD Barrier methods are most effective among older women and all methods of contraception including the pill are used more effectively by women who definitely do not want to have more children In evaluating the health risks of contraception it is important to put them in a context of countervailing benefits and alternatives Three facts are clear there is no such thing as riskfree contraception in almost all cases every method of contraception is safer than getting pregnant and having a child there is no one best method for everyone or even for most people Here are some facts about risks and benefits to help guide your choice The Pill For women under 25 who do not smoke the pill is the safest method of contraception except for barrier methods backed up by abortion For sexually active teenagers the pill is the most effective and in most cases the safest method The pill is most dangerous for women over 35 90 percent of pillrelated deaths occur in this age group and for women of any age who smoke cigarettes Yet surveys show that 40 percent of pill users are smokers About 12 percent of pill users are still taking the more dangerous pills containing high doses of estrogen although equally effective lowdose alternatives are readily available Check the package insert or ask your physician or pharmacist and if your brand contains more than 50 micrograms of estrogen request your doctor to switch you to a lowdose pill Because of preexisting health problems some women should never take birthcontrol pills Among them are a history of phlebitis stroke heart disease liver tumors current liver disease or cancer of the breast or reproductive tract To reduce risks to future fertility the pill is best not taken by women who do not yet have an established menstrual pattern The potential health benefits should also be considered These include a reduced risk of developing such ailments as cancers of the ovary and uterus benign breast disease pelvic infections irondeficiency anemia rheumatoid arthritis and a variety of menstrual disorders among them painful periods and premenstrual tension syndrome There is no demonstrated health benefit associated with periodically stopping use of the pill nor should use be discontinued after five years unless other risk factors such as reaching age 35 make a cessation medically advisable Intrauterine Devices Three types of IUDs are available the Lippes loop which acts as a mechanical barrier and devices containing copper or releasing hormones both of which include a chemical contraceptive The main hazard is an increased risk of pelvic inflammatory disease which could lead to tubal damage and infertility women who have more than one sexual partner are at greatest risk of these infections Generally young women who want to have children in the future are not the best candidates for IUDs unless they and their partners are monogamous However age itself does not affect risk Should you become pregnant with an IUD in place the safest course is to have the device removed as soon as possible An ectopic pregnancy occurring outside the uterus should be suspected if an IUD user does not get her period and develops abdominal pain Such pregnancies require prompt surgical treatment IUDs are not suitable for women who have cancer or precancer of the uterus or cervix pelvic infection gonorrhea or abnormal uterine bleeding Sterilization The complication rate associated with female sterilization is higher than that for any other contraceptive method but the risks are limited to the time during and right after the procedure The serious hazards are death from anesthesia excessive bleeding necessitating a second operation and pelvic infection Complications are least likely to occur after the modern techniques of minilaparotomy and laparoscopy which are usually done under local anesthetic without overnight hospitalization As for vasectomy which is most often an office procedure it is significantly safer than the sterilization of women Despite a variety of frightening reports there is no documented long term health risk associated with the sterilization of either men or women Several studies have not documented the reports of increased risk of heart disease after vasectomy Barrier Methods Other than occasional irritation or allergic sensitivity no health concerns are directly associated with the use of condoms diaphragms and spermicides The main problem is the high rate of unwanted pregnancy which incurs its own risks far greater than birth control If a woman relies on a barrier method throughout her reproductive span and uses it regularly and properly she will face an average of two to three unwanted pregnancies Still if these pregnancies were terminated by early suction abortion she would face the lowest health risk of any contraceptive user The barrier methods appear to protect somewhat against a variety of sexually transmitted diseases including gonorrhea vaginal infections such as trichomoniasis and candidiasis and possibly also herpes The risk of developing pelvic infections and cervical cancer may also be reduced A copy of Making Choices can be obtained by sending 6 which includes postage and handling to the Alan Guttmacher Institute 360 Park

TERENCE CARDINAL COOKE: A CALM VOICE IN AN AGE OF UPHEAVAL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/07/obituaries/terence-cardinal-cooke-a-calm-voice-in-an-age-of-upheaval.html,Cardinal Terence Cooke rose to a great height in the Roman Catholic Church without losing the simplicity and soul of a village priest He was the seventh archbishop of New York named to that high ecclesiastical post in 1968 by Pope Paul VI A year later he was summoned to Rome to receive the red hat of a cardinal at the unusually young age of 48 As the successor to Francis Cardinal Spellman Cooke guided the archdiocese through upheavals touched off by shifting forces in both the church and the surrounding society Unlike his more commanding predecessor Cardinal Cooke exercised his authority with reserve and a distaste for public conflict Though handpicked by Spellman to take over one of the worlds most prominent Roman Catholic archdioceses he took a far less combative stance than his mentor shying from Spellmans bold exercise of personal and political power By comparison Cardinal Cooke was a mildmannered expertly managerial priest who worked largely through the machinery of the archdiocese to carry out church programs He has shown great awareness of the complexities of the archdiocese Monsignor James M Connolly head of the archdiocesan personnel board said in a recent interview He has been able to listen to all sides He has had no fear of listening On some subjects most notably his steadfast opposition to abortion Cooke was a national spokesman for the church He also fought for improved welfare benefits in his role as leader of New York states bishops But on most matters he was a somewhat peripheral figure within the National Conference of Catholic Bishops He was a genial pastor who exulted in mingling with his people He golfed with President Nixon presented debutantes and heard the tribulations of the dispossessed Aides say his spirit of hope and joy traits that resounded in his words and actions remained with him through the last difficult days of his life after he learned of his terminal illness During his leadership of 18 million Catholics Cooke was hailed as a superb administrator but was sometimes criticized for failing to state a broad vision for the archdiocese But he excelled at keeping the archdioceses 900 separate corporate entities on solid footing through some difficult times As he took the helm the changes of the Second Vatican Council were shaking the church the sexual revolution was challenging Catholic moral teaching and the city was about to plunge into a fiscal crisis The Cardinal responded with a series of steps that shored up archdiocesan finances and broke new ground Two of his initiatives became models for the church across the nation an innercity scholarship program to help poor minority students attend Catholic schools and an interparish finance project to shore up poorer parishes An uproar over the St Patricks Day parade this year placed the Cooke in the kind of highly visible sensitive position that he liked to avoid The crisis was precipitated by the parade committees selection of a backer of the Irish Republican Army as grand marshal The Cardinals loyalties were torn between his aversion to the violent tactics of the IRA and his love of the parades religious and folk tradition Characteristically he found a compromise refusing to offer the customary archbishops salute to the grand marshal from the steps of St Patricks Cathedral but later emerging on the steps to observe the parade Tireless Work With The Poor As a prelate whose heart was never far from his work with the needy he campaigned tirelessly for charitable causes related to health care social service and education His travels to meetings and his pastoral visits took him constantly across the 4717 square miles of the archdiocese an area stretching from Staten Island through Manhattan and the Bronx to seven upstate counties A major shift in Catholic population took place during his reign As the result of migration from the city of many middleclass Catholics the majority of Cookes constituents came to be located in the suburbs for the first time in the history of the archdiocese Priests serving the 412 parishes under his care often praised him for permitting a diversity of approaches to pastoral work He managed to provide a context within which a lot of viewpoints could be at home said the Rev Philip Murnion the archdiocesan parish researcher People could pursue a variety of interests Many who encountered the Cardinal were surprised by his height more than six feet and the ease with which he could effortlessly move through crowds bestowing greetings and blessings along the way His aides were astounded by his memory for names and fragments of church business He was in the tradition of the shepherd caring for his flock and his personal gifts aided that mission By temperment he was gentle and warm solicitous of others and not given to chiding or anger in the presence of those who disagreed with himHe had an understated quality of charm abetted by his extraordinary ability to listen carefully to those to whom he turned for advice My job first and foremost is to be a shepherd and servant of Gods people he once said I have no other desire or purpose in life In an age of ecumenism the Cooke followed more closely the older tradition of the archbishop as caretaker of his own domain Though open to some interfaith activities he was primarily parochial and felt at home in his own archdiocese tending to its business His participation on the national and international levels of the church were limited and generally had little impact But he loved New York and spent his whole life in the service of the archdiocese Marking the 175th anniversary of the founding of the archdiocesae in April he bouyantly told a noontime congregation in the states oldest parish St Peters It all began here so far as the church of New York is concerned Thank the Lord for all the blessings of these 175 years On the day of his installation in April 1968 he spoke of moderation and the need for reconciliation Let us improve the institutions and structures that have served us so well making them glow with a rekindled spirit of love he said Let us avoid that iconoclasm which would tear down the past before moving ahead in the present to build a future Turning to social stresses he continued In a spirit of love we must approach the problems of poverty and racial tension I pledge the spiritual and material resources of this archdiocese to uplift the poor especially the disadvantataged in our ghettos The problems he faced were monumental Church finances were strained to the breaking point because of the mounting costs of running a huge system of schools hospitals and welfare programs New York Citys fiscal collapse added to the crisis by slicing funds the city provided to help the church run these institutions No archbishop ever had to face external problems as great as Cardinal Cooke did said Msgr Eugene V Clark who served as the archdiocesan spokesman for several years He had to cope with 200 board meetings a year inflation was the enemy and the church couldnt move fast enough to catch up He had to face that kind of thing He spent a vast amount of time finding ways to keep afloat Those who looked to him for religious guidance found a leader of deep spirituality Others who stood outside religion often said they saw him as a living exemplar of the beliefs he preached He was elevated to the seat of the archdiocese at a portentous time for the Roman Catholic church in the United States The Second Vatican Council had completed its vast changes in church doctrine and practice in 1965 The difficult task of putting those changes into effect was at hand As Cooke took over the process of transition was already generating tension and confusion At the same time racial unrest and opposition to the Vietnam War were creating havoc on a national scale That message was brought home in dramatic fashion On April 4 1968 the day of Cookes installation as archbishop the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr was slain in Memphis touching off another wave of racial clashes The church became the setting for clashes between liberals and conservatives over both sets of issues Some priests and parishioners believed a strongly prophetic voice was needed at the helm of the archdiocese to push it in sharply new directions They were skeptical that Cooke could fill that role But others were impressed by his conciliatory manner which aimed at consensus and avoided collisions As he became engrossed in the myriad duties of running the archdiocese he won solid backing He grew in stature as a manager and a superior with a calming influence who listened to everyone carefully Although he rarely satisfied liberal demands for him to speak out in favor of social causes such as disarmament Cooke gave others broad leeway to do so On the other hand while some conservatives urged him to crack down harder on experiments with the liturgy he left much of the decision on such matters to the local parishes where conservatives could play a strong role Whether addressing cultural political or church issues Cooke was more an expediter of established church teaching than an innovator testing the boundaries of a dogma or a rule His inclination was to hold his own view in abeyance until an idea had won the approval of the highest authorities at the VaticanWhen Rome had denounced racism for example he felt free to call it a sickness and urge for an end to discrimination By contrast he was hesistant to condemn nuclear weapons wholeheartedly as some of his fellow bishops had largely because the pope had not gone that far himself A related factor was that Cooke as military vicar cared greatly for the welfare of Catholics in the armed forces Some priests remained unhappy with Cookes conservatismLast year a group of priests and nuns publicly criticized Cooke for stating that atomic weapons were tolerable for the purpose of deterrence and arguing that a limited nuclear war could be fought The Cardinal had made the statement in a letter to Catholic military chaplains In their protest the priests and nuns disassociated themselves from that view in favor of a more total renunciation of nuclear arms In the face of many obstacles Cooke helped reshape the archdiocese according to the dictates of Vatican II and the pressures under which the modern church must exist At the time of his installation parishes were still well attended and there were ample numbers of priests and nuns to serve them In many ways the church seemed to be at the height of its strength Much of the stability was illusory however Powerful forces that no archbishop could control were racking the church Priests and nuns unhappy with mandatory celibacy or the churchs stands on various social issues would resign in astonishing numbers Some lay people would balk at certain of the changes ordered by Vatican II Others would drop out in protest of the encyclical forbidding artificial birth control Furthermore the financial underpinnings of the archdiocese had become shaky requiring fast and effective remedies That was the situation faced by Cooke after his formal investiture at St Patricks Cathedral Cooke had been known as a longtime chancery official but his appointment to the top post stunned many church officials Most had expected the choice to be Archbishop John J Maguire or someone from the outside the archdiocese But from a practical standpoint the selection made eminent sense During the previous decade Cooke had been moved rapidly up the promotional ladder of the archdiocese by Spellman He began in 1957 as Spellmans personal secretary and quickly passed through a succession of chancery assignments culminating in his ordination as an auxiliary bishop with the title vicar general Cardinal Spellmen had taken interest in him both personally For many years the younger man lived in the Cardinals residence and the two dined and traveled together Cardinal Spellman had pressed Pope Paul VI to name the Auxiliary Bishop as his successor When the Pope followed this suggestion and made the appointmentthree months after the Cardinals death in December 1967  the new Archbishop was quick to express his indebtedness to his mentor Awesome Responsibility Here I am with this sudden awesome responsibility he said shortly after his appointment only too aware of my weaknesses struggling with my faults Referring to Spellman he said Ill need his vision and his judgment He recalled a particular piece of advice from his mentor You cant say yes to everything Spellman had said When you do say yes say it quickly But always take a half hour to say no so you can understand the other fellows side too In his conversations Cooke often remembered that counsel along with a maxim he had received from the other leading influence in forming his outlook his father Michael Cooke a devoutly spiritual man once told his son Whatever you do do it with all your heart A Journey From Obscurity His own lif in the church was a journey from obscurity to one of the churchs most visible and powerful seats He was born on March 1 1921 the son of Irish immigrants Michael and Margaret Gannon Cooke His father was a chauffeur who for a time whisked the actor John Barrymore about town and later worked in construction Mr and Mrs Cooke lived in a tenement on the Upper West Side Shortly after Terence was baptized the family moved to the Bronx and later to West Nyack His elementary schooling took place under the Benedictine order His mother died when he was 9 leaving his father with Terence an older brother Joseph and a younger sister Katherine Soon an aunt Mary Gannon moved into the Cooke home to assist with the childrearing Though the familys resources were meager the elder Cooke managed to eke out funds for violin lessons for his musically attuned son initiating him into a lifelong love During his years at Cathedral High School he decided to enter the priesthood He went on to Cathedral College and St Josephs Seminary later becoming the first graduate of the seminary to become archbishop Cardinal Spellman ordained him a priest on Dec 1 1945 and he took his first assignment as an assistant at St Athanasius parish in the South Bronx His twoyear stay there provided him with his only experience as a fulltime parish priest In 1947 he entered Catholic Univeristy in Washington to earn a Master of Social Work degree and did further graduate work at the University of Chicago He returned to New York in 1949 and for the next five years served as a youth worker for Catholic Charities At the same time he taught at the Fordham School of Social Work and assisted at St Jude Church in Manhattan While at Catholic charities he showed a skill at fundraising that caught the attention of Spellman The result was his assignment to St Josephs Seminary as bursar from 1954 to 1956 Thereafter beginning with his appointment as Spellmans secretary his star ascended swiftly He became vice chancellor and chancellor then auxiliary bishop and vicar general All the while he gained vast expertise in the workings of the archdiocese From 1958 he supervised all constructon in the archdiocese and as vicar general he personally supervised 175 parishes in Manhattan and the Bronx He built a reputation for efficiency extreme dedication and a genuine sense of likeableness Those who worked with him say that by nature he did not seek power or privilege and would have been content as a parish priest The Cardinals era saw a striking shift in the administration of the church Before Vatican II church structures were notably hierarhical in both organization and daytoday governance The Council however rewrote the underlying principles From that point on the church was to be run on a conciliar basis The whole people of God as the church was defined by Vatican II was to share in the authority Bishops were to consult with their flocks consider their views and grant them influence on decisions This was a style of church leadership that came much easier to Cooke than to his predecessor Although he shared much of Spellmans theological traditionalism Cooke was far more relaxed about opening the decisionmaking process and decentralizing power in the archdiocese He had been trained as a social worker to engage in group decisions and that background availed him well in the formidable effort to recast the archdiocese along somewhat more democratic lines Soon after he took over a group of priests challenged him to institute several changes including the establishment of a diocesan council and the issuing of yearly financial disclosures by the archdiocese These and many other requests were met as Cooke showed his willingness to comply fully with the spirit and the law of Vatican II Cooke reshaped much of the archdiocesan operation in accordance with the Councils intent Terms were set for pastors of parishes a personnel board was founded to help deploy the clergy and diocesanwide studies made recommendations on schools and parish financing Out of these studies came two markedly different programs One was an interparish financing arrangement whereby affluent parishes shared resources with struggling ones The other was a major scholarship program that helped increase enrollment of minority children in Catholic schools Diocesan officials proudly point to the fact that during Cookes tenure none of the seven Catholic schools in Harlem were closed At the height of the protests against the Vietnam War the difference between Cooke and his predecessor was vividly illustrated Spellman had called for the a victory by United States military forces Cooke pressed for a response called in 1972 for a speedy end to the war while praising American motives At a St Patricks ordination service for Jesuits in 1971 two candidates demanded that Cooke speak out against the war and resign as military vicar They refused to come forward to signify their obedience to the archbishop After one protester grabbed the microphone to voice these demands a Jesuit superior moved to banish the disruptors from the church But the Cooke interceded Moving to the microphone he explained that he worked for peace every day in quite different ways from those of the dissenters including his duties as Military Vicar He invited both men to come forward One did but the other still refused To the holdout Cooke said quietly Peace to you especially my friend Since the Cardinals installation the numbers of Catholics in the archdiocese declined from 2 million to 18 million largely because of the migration of many Catholics to New Jersey and Long Island But as the number of Irish and Italian Catholics fell the number of Hispanic Catholics rose At least a third of the Catholics in the archdiocese are now Hispanic and their need for pastoral care was very much in the forefront of the Cardinals thinking Cardinal Spellman had begun a program to train priests in Spanish to meet these needs Cardinal Cooke took over the project and expanded it In June after the Supreme Court struck down local legislative restrictions on abortion Cooke decried the decision When our most basic institutions condone such violent disregard for life and for family rights the value and nobility of every human life and every human family are dealt a lethal blow he said By custom the archbishop of New York is titular head of New York states bishops and by canon law he is military vicar The Cardinal took a somewhat guarded stand of opposition to the bishops pastoral letter on nuclear weapons which took three drafts and nearly three years to complete Personally aligned with a more conservative stance on defense he found some provisions of the letters strong rejection of nuclear war to his dislike Although he accepted the general outlines of the completed letter he also moved quickly to assure his military constituents that the bishops explicitly appreciated their service in the nations defense Your profession is peace he wrote to them in May Your ministry is peace As you respond to the challenge of peace you do so with the appreciation understanding support and prayers of your church Despite the many problems facing the church the Cardinal never showed signs that his boundless hopes for a better future had faltered He remained enthusiastic about the church and spoke confidently about its ability to renew itself to meet the challenges of the times
The Youngest Cardinal,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/07/opinion/the-youngest-cardinal.html,When Archbishop Terence Cooke became Cardinal Cooke in 1969 he was only 48 years old the youngest cardinal in the world That seemed to augur long service but his death at 62 concludes the shortest term of any cardinal ever to head the Archdiocese of New York For most of those years he lived nobly with the pain of cancer Nonetheless he realized his early promise Succeeding Francis Cardinal Spellman a potent political figure Cardinal Cooke devoted himself to managing his sprawling realm in a time of contention over the faith He preferred administrative ventures to the philosophical He was a harmonizer rather than a cutting political or social personage Cardinal Cooke demonstrated his masterly tact in meeting the symbolic challenge posed by this years St Patricks Day parade He was confronted by a parade marshal Michael Flannery who pro claimed the march to be a show of support for the Irish Republican Army The Cardinal the son of Irish immigrants declined to greet Mr Flannery in public but conferred privately acknowledging Irish Catholic grievances but never condoning the IRAs violence Cardinal Cooke used the influence of the worlds wealthiest archdiocese to advance the churchs opposition to abortion He spoke also for a wider constituency as when he focused his dioceses resources on poorer parishes and urged more American aid to poorer nations He applied the physical suffering of his last days to the churchs stand against mercy killing Only last week in a letter to his flock he spoke out against euthanasia Life is still beautiful he insisted and no less so because pain sometimes attends it Beautiful and in his case brave
CARDINAL COOKE DIES AT 62 AFTER FIGHT WITH LEUKEMIA,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/07/obituaries/cardinal-cooke-dies-at-62-after-fight-with-leukemia.html,Terence Cardinal Cooke the spiritual head of the Archdiocese of New York and the Military Vicar of the United States died at 445 AM yesterday at his residence behind St Patricks Cathedral Death came to the 62yearold Cardinal 41 days after the archdiocese told the public in a statement dictated by the Cardinal that he was critically ill with leukemia Three days ago it was announced that he was on the point of death The Rev Peter Finn a spokesman for the archdiocese formally announced at 1130 AM Terence Cardinal Cooke 10th Bishop 7th Archbishop 5th Cardinal of the See of New York and Vicar to military service Veterans Administration hospitals and Government service overseas completed his work on earth and was called home by Almighty God to heaven this morning at 445 AM A Stream of Worshipers At St Patricks the mood was solemn and hushed as a steady stream of saddened worshipers filed into the cathedral after hearing of the Cardinals death They prayed lighted candles and expressed their feelings of loss Many extolled him as a warmhearted man whose compassion had touched the city As a board of church leaders were choosing Bishop Joseph T OKeefe as interim administrator for the archdiocese tributes from religious and political leaders poured into the Roman Catholic chancery office Page B7 President Reagan who visted the Cardinal Sept 25 said All of America is saddened by the loss of Cardinal Cooke a saintly man and a great spiritual leader At the Vatican Pope John Paul II told the 220 prelates attending a Synod of Bishops session of the Cardinals death I thank God for his dedicated minis Cardinal Cookes 15 years as Archbishop were shaped by upheavals in both church and society Page B6 try and pray that the example of his devotion to the church may inspire the faithful for years to come the Pope said Mayor Koch ordered the citys flags lowered to halfstaff and Governor Cuomo broadened the order to include the entire state Firefighters rang the special 5555 alarm on historic fire engine bells to note the Cardinals death Normally the alarm rung on bells in all city firehouses is reserved for the death of a firefighter in the line of duty Fire Commissioner Joseph E Spinnato called the Cardinal a good friend of the department The bells sounded for the last time yesterday as the department phased out the old system for summoning firefighters When he died the Cardinal was attended by his physician Dr Kevin Cahill and two nurses Msgr Joseph Murphy the archdiocesan Chancellor was kneeling in prayer at his bedside Church officials said the body of the Cardinal would lie in state at St Patricks Cathedral through the weekend beginning tonight at 6 oclock The funeral was scheduled for Monday at 2 PM The Columbus Day parade which would have coincided with the funeral was canceled In accordance with church procedure the archdiocesan Board of Consultors the Archbishops highest advisory group met after the Cardinals death and chose Bishop OKeefe the archdiocesan vicar general to administer church affairs until Pope John Paul II appoints a successor Cardinals Chief Aide Bishop OKeefe a former archdiocesan school superintendent was the Cardinals principal aide during the final weeks of the his life The choice of the interim administrator is not regarded as an indication of the Popes selection of a successor Under church canon law Archbishop Pio Laghi the Apostolic Delegate to the United States will confer with prelates in the New York region and bishops from other parts of the nation to elicit names of suggested candidates The delegate will then forward a list of recommendations to the Pope The Pontiff is not required to choose a name from the list Bishop Cooke became Archbishop in 1968 and Cardinal in 1969 The 175yearold archdiocese one of the most prominent in the world stretches from Staten Island to Rockland and Dutchess Counties With 18 million Catholics it is the nations fourthlargest A Gentle Cheerful Man The Cardinal a gentle cheerful man was known as a superb administrator who kept the archdiocese in sound condition despite economic and religious challenges In his years as Archbishop he won great respect from Catholics and befriended a wide variety of nonCatholics His death opened up the second major vacancy in a month within the American church In September Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston died leaving the nations thirdlargest archdiocese without a head Within two years two of the other seven archdioceses in which a Cardinal normally presides will become open Timothy Cardinal Manning of Los Angeles and John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia are both due to step down at the mandatory retirement age of 75 The openings occur at a time when the future direction of the church in the United States appears to be a growing concern of Pope John Paul II Church leaders have become increasingly aware that the Pope views the nations Catholics somewhat warily On several issues regarding sexual morality and church discipline the Pope has repeatedly urged the Americans to strictly heed church law The urgency of the appeals has convinced many church leaders that the Pope believes that too many American Catholics disobey these standards In making key appointments church officials say the Pope may indicate the kind of leadership he wants The New York appointment is especially important because of the significance of the archdiocese and the added responsibility of the archbishop as military vicar The Ponfiff was lavish in his praise of Cardinal Cooke when illness confined the Cardinal to his residence In response Cardinal Cooke sent messages to the Pope including the text of a pastoral letter scheduled to be read in all parishes on Sunday in which he continued his role as leader of the churchs opposition to abortion It is tragic he wrote that in our time concepts which are disasterous to the wellbeing of Gods human family  abortion euthanasia and infanticide  are falsely presented as useful and even respectable solutions to human family and social problems From the depths of my being I urge you to reject this antilife antichild antihuman view of life and to oppose with all your strength the deadly technologies of life destruction which daily result in the planned death of the innocent and the helpless After the Cardinal was diagnosed as terminally ill in August he stressed the meaning of life even when burdened by suffering Gods Special Gift The gift of life Gods special gift is no less beautiful when it is accompanied by illness or weakness hunger or poverty mental of physical handicaps loneliness or old age the Cardinal wrote in his pastoral letter Cardinal Cooke gave strong allegiance to popes and took an orthodox stance toward church moral and theological teachings At the same time his concern for the poor sharpened by his training as a social worker inclined him toward advocating projects to help the disadvantaged He was thoroughly a New Yorker an unabashed booster of the city who never lost the traces of Irish speech mannerisms or his socially gregarious urban ways
CARDINAL COOKE REMEMBERED FOR KINDNESS IN LIFE AND COURAGE UNTIL DEATH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/08/nyregion/cardinal-cooke-remembered-for-kindness-in-life-and-courage-until-death.html,News Analysis The final weeks in the life of Terence Cardinal Cooke marked a departure in his service as Archbishop of New York Through comments and messages the Cardinal showed a personal side that had rarely been seen He did so associates said to highlight certain issues and to offer himself as an example of faith On Aug 25 the Cardinal in a statement he dictated to aides informed the public that he was terminally ill with leukemia The sudden announcement said the prognosis was that he would live a matter of weeks or months Until then aides had regularly asserted that the Cardinals health was good After the news of the illness aides supplied more details of various ailments that had afflicted him for many years They emphasized that the relative silence about the subject had been due to the Cardinals desire to deflect attention from himself A SelfEffacing Leader Cardinal Cooke was that kind of leader Those who knew him for many years said he naturally avoided becoming the subject of concern preferring to steer interest to his various concerns for the church and society His long career in the church had made him an extraordinary public figure but he was inclined to be selfeffacing After the Cardinal told the church he had only a short time to live his approach changed somewhat in the view of many associates He appeared to many Catholics to be acting somewhat out of character allowing his critical condition to become an opportunity to give witness to such matters as the meaning of suffering his deep opposition to abortion and his hopes for an end to the turmoil in Northern Ireland Circumstances of the Cardinals treatment became a significant factor in the ordeal He made it known that he would refuse chemotherapy in order to live out his days as alertly as possible That decision spoke as poignantly to many Catholics as did his attempts to provide moral instruction The Cardinals residence which he chose over a hospital room became the center of a vigorous endeavor to tie interest in his grave condition to the causes he most ardently espoused GraceFilled Moment Many Catholics were especially struck by his references to his suffering In several statements related by aides he spoke of this gracefilled moment in my life Many of his personal messages on the subject to friends and colleagues were made public As church officials noted the move disclosed the private character of the Cardinal to a striking degree One illustration of his willingness to explain his feelings was a Sept 6 letter to William Cardinal Baum the highest ranking American prelate at the Vatican My illness is an opportunity of grace as the Lord makes it possible for me to partake of his Passion and Death Cardinal Cooke wrote He continues to hold out to me at every moment the sure hope of Resurrection as daily He draws me close to His altar of sacrifice In other remarks relayed by aides the Cardinal stressed that he was offering his suffering for the church and as he explained on one occasion for all his brothers and sisters who have shared so much with me in faith and love and who are united with me in this moment of my life Near Jesus Through Suffering The Rev Peter Finn at a press conference last week noted that these references to suffering could strike nonCatholics and nonChristians as staged Father Finn said the truth was that the Cardinal was sincerely endeavoring to underscore the churchs traditional teaching that Jesus followers can be united to him through suffering Church officials followed similar reasoning in terms of the Cardinals description of his suffering as a sublime privilege They said the words were intended to reflect the Cardinals acceptance of suffering and did not connote an eagerness to embrace it A message from Pope John Paul II underscored a similar understanding of the spiritual blessings that the church teaches can emerge in suffering The Pope wrote I have spoken and written to him to thank him for what he has been in the Church of God  a living sign of Jesus Christ a faithful pastor and servant of his people living and willing to die for the church Many tributes from religious and government leaders focused on the Cardinal as an example of courage and a model of faith enduring hardship Abortion and Euthanasia The Cardinal addressed other matters with a similar candor The most forceful appeals came in relation to his long fight against abortion and euthanasia At every step aides said he was intensely aware of the widespread concern for his welfare and the opportunity that concern afforded him to testify to his moral and spiritual principles His final pastoral letter on the Gift of Life is scheduled to be read tomorrow in all parishes of the archdiocese It was read over Vatican Radio last Sunday As officials prepared for the Cardinals funeral on Monday they pointed to the letter as the Cardinals essential message in his final travail The letter argues for an end to abortion euthanasia and infanticide It is at times when life is threatened the Cardinal said in the letter such as times of serious illness  that the Lord gives us a special grace to appreciate the gift of life as an irreplaceable blessing
WE DON'T KNOW HOW TO CARE FOR OUR YOUNG,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/nyregion/we-dont-know-how-to-care-for-our-young.html,IN PHILADELPHIA homicide is  the leading cause of death among children and youths In New Jersey three preteen girls beat and rob a crippled old woman Across the nation children are addicted to alcohol and drugs Teenage boys rape rob and mug teenage girls unprotected from rape and incest and unprepared physically and emotionally bear babies Child pornography is big business Suicide is the thirdleading cause of death among teenagers The message in all of this is We dont know how to care for our young There almost seems to be an inverse ratio between our success with technology and our failure with our offspring We do not cherish and shield and educate them Yet we  with the astonishing brain that invented this technology  never would have evolved if our smallerbrained hominid ancestors had not cared for their babies so well that the biggerbrained ones could survive The whole direction of human evolution has been toward bigger and better brains which call for longer and better care Our species arrived with the largest brain on the planet proportionate to body size a brain so convoluted that we can use it far beyond the capacity of our fellow creatures to contemplate past future and infinity to create beauty and wreak horror and to behave nobly and despicably Sometimes we use it to glimpse dimensions of the mysterious universe that lies beyond time and space and the reach of Earths other children We have crossed a threshold but we have not severed ourselves from the millions of years of evolution that carried us to it We evolved for all but the last eyeblink of our history in gatheringhunting societies Within that matrix the hominid brain grew from the size of a chimpanzees four million years ago to more than double that two million years ago to more than three times that in Neanderthal man 200000 years ago and to ourselves 50000 years ago As the brain enlarged our babies needed more care and for millions of years our hominid and australopithecine ancestors took good care of their young A largebrained creature must be nurtured The larger the brain the more intensive and extensive must be the nurture Its simple logistics The birth canal can dilate only so far when the head is expelled the bony ring in the pelvis cannot dilate at all Since the skull cannot house at birth a brain that will quadruple in size growth and development take place after birth Each enlargement of the brain means that a moredependent infant emerges from the womb Other primate infants notably those of our closest cousins  the chimpanzees and gorillas  do not develop normally in isolation they must have mothering and interaction with the band Obviously babies and children in the line that led to us received increasing amounts of care over the eons Almost as obviously that care was administered lovingly or where did the instinctive loving reaction that babies evoke in normal adults come from Evidence from all directions confirms that love is a must As the neurologist James W Prescott wrote Studies suggest that during formative periods of brain growth certain kinds of sensory deprivation  such as lack of touching and rocking by the mother  result in incomplete or damaged development of the neuronal systems that control affection    The deprived infant may have difficulty controlling violent impulses as an adult The agricultural revolution which began about 10000 years ago and is still going on skewed our evolutionary course in ways that have yet to be assessed The changes have gone too rapidly accelerated too much for us to adapt We are the product not of a few millenniums of agriculture and technology but of several million years of gathering and hunting We are the product of life lived in small cohesive bands where everyone knew everyone and everyone was important Each member had to rely on all for survival especially in the harsh unpredictable environment of successive ice ages Somewhere along the way when speech brought the beginning of culture each band would have cemented its closeness with communal agreement on right and wrong and intensified its spiritual life through communal music dancing art and religion Such communities tightly knit and cooperative would have been far more conducive to the flowering of love trust and commitment than our own mobile noisy overcrowded agglomeration of anonymous masses Such communities would have cared for their offspring more carefully and consistently than we are able to Above all such communities living off the land would have had to limit the number of babies to what the land could support just as the few remaining foraginghunting groups do today The incalculably important consequence was that each infant could command his mothers almost undivided attention for three to four years This way of living does not encourage aggression True hominids learned to use weapons They hunted game with them perhaps occasionally they attacked other tribes But to project onto them our own pathological aggression is wholly unjustified by our accumulating discoveries about our ancestors We are today the only species that kills not only other species but also its own for the sheer delight of killing But this is not innate The trait began like the birth explosion and the degradation of women with agriculture The essential fact about us is that we are social and cultural organisms We learn to love  or not to love or to hate  with society Children cannot learn to love unless they are taught And are they today If not are we losing that capacity Erich Fromm for one thought so Real love he wrote is so rare today as to be outside the vision of most people Every student of human development has concluded that babies cannot function or grow without love For example the psychologist Selma Fraiberg warns that a baby without human partners is a baby in deadly peril robbed of his humanity and the biologist George Wald fears that we are no longer taking good care of our young that we have introduced them into a world that offers them little that they want and threatens their very existence In this context it is criminally irresponsible to insist that every fetus must be born but to keep a stony indifference to its fate thereafter Unless the future person that the fetus is to become is sacred why is the fetus sacred And if the developing human is sacred then caring for it is a sacred responsibility Those prolifers who would deny abortion to all American women because the millions of Americans who will die in the next war must be replaced are singularly illattuned to the real needs of real babies Must we return to hunting and gathering Of course not Technology is here to stay But if it is our master not our servant and if it has trapped us in a culture antagonistic to health and life and love we would do well to understand what is happening and figure out what to do about it We would do well to acknowledge the limits of technology It has not brought forth a machine that bathes a baby in constant joyous stimulating egostrengthening affection It has not produced one that copes with the twisted results of poor nurturing or none or one that deals with the havoc that we wreak on ourselves and society For 50000 years we have existed as homo sapiens man who knows man who is wise What is the Latin for man who neglects his babies   Betty McCollister lives in Haddonfield

SKILLFULLY MANGAING A HARD TRANSITION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/09/weekinreview/skillfully-mangaing-a-hard-transition.html,Terence Cardinal Cooke the Archbishop of New York who died of leukemia Thursday was one of a handful of leading prelates caught in a vast sea change within the Roman Catholic Church He was among those who were trained for service in a church that in many respects no longer existed when they rose to the hierarchy To the end of his life Cardinal Cooke seemed to belong to both the new order and the old The Second Vatican Council from 1962 to 1965 questioned the practices and beliefs of an ecclesiastical order largely shaped by the militant reactions of the CounterReformation To the shock of many older Catholics the Council declared that the church was no longer to be defined as the hierarchy but as the people of God Acting on that principle the church fathers replaced the older model of monarchical rule by bishops with a system of authority that stressed collegiality and consultation The implications were enormous for an archdiocese with the size wealth and prominence of New York Francis Cardinal Spellman who presided during the Council struggled for three years before his death to apply himself to the top tobottom reforms But his style marked by boldness and a heavyhanded exercise of power rendered him illsuited for the new agenda His ways exemplified the past And so it fell to his successor then Auxiliary Bishop Terence Cooke to broadly implement the Councils guidelines In 1968 Terence James Cooke replaced Cardinal Spellman under circumstances that generally boded well for the church The uplifting mood of the Council still lingered the archdiocesan structures were strong and the ethnic church of old had planted deep roots in American soil Large numbers of Catholics who had been shunted aside as a suspect minority were being integrated into the mainstream of the nations financial and social life Cardinal Cooke was tempermentally fit in many ways for the unfolding of a modernized church In contrast to his predecessor he was mildmannered comfortable about seeking the advice of clergy and laity and kept a relatively low profile He projected warmth and care for the poor befriended the powerful and maintained an image of a priest without guile At the same time he was a stickler for detail and expert at administration Under Cardinal Cooke the schools of the archdiocese were put on sound financial footing and a program for aiding poorer parishes was set in place A personnel board was established to smooth the placement of priests and a clergy senate was formed to provide the Cardinal with regular briefings on the concerns of those closest to the parishes The orderly transition to Vatican Council reforms was overseen by an Archbishop who felt most comfortable with household matters Catholics often sensed that he lacked enthusiasm for many of the changes such as those regarding some of the sacraments but he supervised them without complaint He followed the letter of the law even though many believed his heart was not always in it Many of the Cardinals actions showed a preference for the past Decades ago bishops were chiefly lords of their own domains given great prerogatives by canon law and protected from most forms of outside interference The Council shifted thinking in this area by underscoring the importance of regional conferences and interdiocesan cooperation Cardinal Cooke took part in the sessions of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops but he remained a marginal figure in forging policies He rarely spoke on an issue that fell outside his immediate field of responsibility His long fight against abortion was his most sustained and vocal contribution Moral issues that involved challenges to American military and social policy often left the Cardinal in a troubled position He retained much of the reflexive patriotism that characterized earlier generations of immigrants His role as military vicar reinforced this penchant He went along with the bishops recent pastoral letter condemning nuclear arms but somewhat reluctantly combining his endorsement with assurances to his two million Catholic military flock that their efforts were appreciated Likewise he could campaign hard for positions such as aid to Catholic schools or abortion but backed away from taking strong stands on issues defined less explicitly by church thinking Counseling Presidents The lofty reputation of the archdiocese kept it visible When Presidents of the United States wanted to touch base with American Catholicism they more often turned to the Archbishop of New York than to the president of the Bishops Conference But many church officials saw the archdiocese losing its past glory and attributed that decline in some degree to the cardinals failure to provide strong national leadership on many crucial issues Within the diocese the criticism was heard that the Cardinal had also done little to articulate the churchs mission and purpose in New York On one hand critics acknowledged the Cardinal allowed priests and lay people great latitude to write their own scripts But on the other hand they viewed the lack of a strong central influence as a factor in causing malaise and confusion As the archdiocese looks ahead to a successor many Catholics voice awe at the magnitude of the job The easy assurance of a bright future present at Cardinal Cookes installation has given way to tough realities The priest shortage worsens More parishes struggle to maintain budgets Attendance at mass has fallen The churchs political clout has diminished as a secular mood deepens Still Cardinal Cooke felt the confidence and stability of his boyhood church as sturdy as a fortress even as he led the archdiocese into an uncertain future

WASHINGTON VOTERS CHOOSE NOMINEES FOR SENATE TODAY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/11/us/washington-voters-choose-nominees-for-senate-today.html,Washingtons voters will select two of 33 candidates Tuesday as major party nominees to fill the seat vacated by the death of Senator Henry M Jackson The primary is being followed nationally because its outcome will affect the chances of the Republican Party in retaining the seat Republicans now hold a 55to45 majority in the Senate but more Republicans than Democrats face challenges in the 1984 elections bolstering Democratic hopes The races have narrowed to two candidates in each party who are well enough known to be serious contenders Senator Daniel J Evans 57 years old is seen by all the others as the candidate to be defeated A Republican and former Governor who left office voluntarily in 1977 after three terms he was appointed to the Senate seat Sept 8 a week after Mr Jacksons death by Gov John Spellman also a Republican Democratic Race Called Close Lloyd Cooney 60 a broadcasting executive is Senator Evanss major Republican opponent Mr Cooney who ran a credible race in losing the Senate Republican nomination in 1980 describes himself as the only political conservative among the four leading contenders The race for the Democratic nomination has tightened noticeably since early September when Mayor Charles Royer of Seattle 44 was believed to have a substantial lead over the other strong Democratic contender Representative Michael E Lowry 44 also of Seattle Political writers who have followed the campaigns say they expect Senator Evans to win the Republican nomination but feel uncertain in predicting the RoyerLowry race Mr Cooney has campaigned hard against Senator Evans Mr Cooney has been aided in his campaign for the Republican nomination by Dixy Lee Ray a Democrat and former Governor When she was Governor she was critical of the actions of her predecessor Mr Evans Labor Group Endorses Lowry Mr Evans has spent 300000 and Mr Cooney 140000 according to their campaign finance reports to state agencies Mr Cooney opposes the right to abortion and supports socalled rightto work legislation the opposite of Mr Evanss views Both Republicans support deployment of the cruise and Pershing 2 missiles in Europe and the MX missile program both the Democrats oppose Representative Lowry who likes to call himself a Democrats Democrat and Mayor Royer have avoided campaigning against each other while focusing their attacks on Senator Evans Mr Lowry won endorsement of the Washington State Labor Council a branch of the AFLCIO that rejected the recommendation of its Committee on Political Education for a co endorsement of both Mr Lowry and Mr Royer A Continuing Campaign In spending Mr Lowry is ahead by 185000 to the Mr Royers 125000 In part this is because the Congressman could put into his Senate race 40000 he was holding for next years reelection campaign Mr Lowry has campaigned for office at twoyear intervals since 1973 losing but once and has a continuing campaign structure that merely goes into neutral between elections Mr Royer depends heavily on alliances he made during the past two years as he explored the possibility of running for Governor next year The Democrats positions seem close but Mayor Royer tends to state his views in softer focus than does Representative Lowry whose answers tend to be flat yes or no For example both support monetary reparations to Japanese relocated in 1942 and support the right to abortion Both would cut military spending in favor of welfare programs Mr Lowry supports school busing for racial balance Mr Royer says it has been a failure Democrats Demanded a Vote Only the question of Republican and Democatic Party nominations will be on the ballot The problem of electing a successor to fill out Senator Jacksons term to January 1987 became a crisis because of the timing of his death State law requires the office to be filled at the next general election which means Nov 8 this year But the filing date for the regular primary Sept 20 had passed The interim appointment would have given Senator Evans an advantage in a winnertakeall election Nov 8 so the Democrats clamored for a special primary Governor Spellman called a special legislative session and the once only primary date was set This caused the White House to retreat from the warm endorsement President Reagan had given the Evans appointment the President does not as a rule endorse one Republican over others in a primary Turnout Could Be Important A low turnout Tuesday could benefit a candidate with a dedicated following For the primary Sept 20 when local officials and tax questions were at issue just 25 percent of the 21 million registered voters turned outAlso Washington primaries are open so a voter is not restricted by party The two nominees will be on the ballot Nov 8 coincidental with the regular offyear Washington municipal elections Dean Peoples a striking shipyard worker was nominated by convention of the Socialist Workers Party and will also be on the ballot in that election

TWO ENTER RUNOFF FOR BOSTON MAYOR,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/12/us/two-enter-runoff-for-boston-mayor.html,Melvin H King a black former State Representative and Raymond L Flynn a member of the City Council won the mayoral primary today marking a historic shift in Boston politics They will meet in the November general election With 60 percent of the 252 precincts counted their major challenger David I Finnegan a former School Committee president conceded defeat Mr King had 32595 votes or 34 percent Mr Flynn had 24441 or 25 percent and Mr Finnegan had 20256 or 21 percent Mr Kings success in the nonpartisan primary marked the first time in Bostons 350year history that a black had won a spot in the mayoral runoff It also represented a striking departure from Bostons recent legacy of racial strife set off by courtordered busing to achieve school desegregation in 1974 Rainbow Coalition Cited In a victory speech tonight Mr King made reference to his support among black Hispanic and white voters a group he dubbed the rainbow coalition We started out saying we may have come on different ships but we are all in the same boat now Mr King said We are here tonight to say the boat is changing its course Welcome to the rainbow coalition  Mayor Kevin H White who decided not to run this fall after 16 years in office said Mr Kings triumph was also a victory for Boston It meant Mayor White said that a large number of white voters had cast their ballots without regard to race If I had to leave being Mayor man am I glad to see that along with the tall skyscrapers Mr White said in a television interview this evening He was referring to what is generally regarded as his most important contribution to Boston the redevelopment of the downtown business district Major Registration Effort Mr Kings aides said tonight that he had won up to 88 percent of the vote among black and Hispanic people two groups that historically have not voted heavily here Black community leaders encouraged by the succees of black candidates elswhere in the country this year like Mayor Harold Washington of Chicago had organized a registration drive that added 20 percent to the voter rolls The citys Election Department said it would not have final figures on the turnout until Wednesday morning But a source close to City Hall said the figure was about 65 percent or 160000 people a record for a nonPresidential election in recent years Mr Flynns victory also represented a major change in Boston politics Although he is of Irish Catholic ancestry in a city dominated by Irish politicians for the past century Mr Flynn put together a coalition that included both liberals and conservatives Disparate Group of Backers His supporters included conservative friends and relatives from his home section of South Boston where Mr Flynn was a leader in opposing school busing and abortion But he was also backed by leftist activists labor unions and organizations of tenants and the elderly

SIGNS OF CHANGE APPEARING IN BOSTON'S ELECTORATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/13/us/signs-of-change-appearing-in-boston-s-electorate.html,The virtual tie in the mayoral primary Tuesday between Melvin H King a black neighborhood organizer and Raymond L Flynn a selfstyled populist reflects the emergence of a more liberal electorate in Boston after a century of domination by conservative and Irish politicians You are now looking at a city that is much more moderate remarked John Marttila one of the citys most respected political analysts who is a former campaign manager for Mayor Kevin H White He added that the election had helped put Boston in great spiritual shape Kenneth R Rossano the chairman of the Chamber of Commerce and senior vice president of the Bank of Boston generally agreed describing the outcome of the election as an extremely healthy one He added One of the encouraging things is that all that racial divisiveness is over and done with Their sentiments were echoed today by many though hardly all Bostonians in a series of interviews The oncevocal opponents of court ordered busing to achieve school integration and those who encouraged racial confrontation have become muted after a decade of divisiveness and so far they have not campaigned against Mr King Though many people thought he would fail Mr King became the first black in Bostons 350year history to make it to the mayoral runoff To do so he relied on what he called a rainbow coalition of black Hispanic and white people The 54yearold Mr King in some ways is an unlikely person to become the first black mayoral finalist Long known as a militant he offended even many blacks by continuing to wear a dashiki until earlier this year Unlikely Coalitions Won But he has clearly won support among some workingclass whites liberals and womens and homosexual activist groups Mr Flynns victory was equally remarkable He put together an improbable coalition of what he termed the disenfranchised including leftist activists labor union leaders advocates for the elderly and the poor and working class residents of Mr Flynns home district in traditionally conservative South Boston Mr Flynn a former AllAmerican basketball star and son of a longshoreman is like many populists liberal on economic issues but conservative on others Hence while he favors tighter rent control and requiring real estate developers to contribute to rebuilding housing in the neighborhoods he has opposed abortion as well as busing for school desegregation Nearly Identical Statements Moreover Mr King and Mr Flynn preached almost identical messages In victory statements last night they both pledged to move beyond the divisive strains of racism and concentrate on rebuilding the citys decaying neighborhoods by improving jobs schools and housing Both had argued throughout the campaign that Mayor White who was not running after 16 years in office had neglected the neighborhoods in favor of developing Bostons prosperous business district At a personal level too both men were almost the reverse of Mayor White suggesting that voters wanted a change Where he is glib their speech was slow where he has become almost imperious they seemed humble The result was a virtual tie in the final results with Mr Flynn winning one more vote than Mr King 47432 to 47431 according to the City Election Commission That gave them each a 29 percent share compared with 41308 votes or 25 percent for their closest competitor David I Finnegan The top two vote getters in the nonpartisan election face each other in November Many New Voters Found More than 63 percent of the citys registered voters turned out the highest vote in a preliminary election in more than two decades Both candidates were encouraged by the large number of new voters this year including members of minority groups and young professionals who have recently moved into Boston Surveys of people leaving polling places showed new voters made up almost 20 percent of those voting An analysis of the returns showed that Mr King a former State Representative had rolled up enormous margins in predominantly black wards up to 95 percent in one ward in Dorchester for example Many blacks were galvanized by the success of black politicians elsewhere in the country this year like the election of Mayor Harold Washington in Chicago But Mr King also won in the liberal white Back Bay area and in the district around Boston University Although no precise figures were available on how many votes he received from whites Mr King won half of the citys 22 wards and some exit polls suggested he took 10 to 15 percent of the white vote Kings Time Has Come At Mr Kings victory party last night in the Parker House long a headquarters for IrishAmerican politicians Donald P Batchelder a white carpenter exclaimed Mel King is more than a person He is an idea and hes an idea whose time has come The major question now is whether Mr King can continue to expand his appeal to whites who make up roughly 70 percent of the citys 260000 voters Mr Marttila estimated that Mr King will have to win 35 to 40 percent of the white vote to triumph in the general election on Nov 15 That he suggested will be difficult because there is generally a ceiling on the amount of white votes a firsttime black candidate can achieve The highest in a mayoral race so far was 19 percent won by Ernest N Dutch Morial in New Orleans he said So Mel King is really contending with American history as much as the city of Boston Mr Marttila said Most See a Flynn Victory Most analysts therefore believe Mr Flynn will triumph Its hard to see how Ray will lose it said Robert R Kiley who was one of the nine candidates before dropping out three weeks ago and being nominated for the chairmanship of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority in New York Mr Kiley and others believe most supporters of Tuesdays losing candidates will turn to Mr Flynn providing him with a comfortable margin Indeed a campaign adviser to Mr Flynn said today that his phone had not stopped ringing with calls from businessmen and members of Mayor Whites oncepowerful political organization offering their help
BRITISH CABINET MEMBER RESIGNS IN SCANDAL OVER HIS EX-SECRETARY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/15/world/british-cabinet-member-resigns-in-scandal-over-his-ex-secretary.html,Cecil Parkinson who managed Prime Minister Margaret Thatchers reelection campaign last summer resigned in a scandal today from his senior post in her Government Mr Parkinson stepped down as Minister for Trade and Industry less than 12 hours after his former secretary Sara Keays who is expecting their baby in January issued a statement saying he had twice asked her to marry him and had twice changed his mind She said the most recent proposal was on June 9 election day when he already knew she was pregnant By resigning Mr Parkinson spared his mentor and leader further embarrassment but Conservative members of Parliament said tonight that Mrs Thatchers judgment in keeping him on for three months after learning about the impending birth was questionable In her statement Miss Keays reacted angrily to an editorial last Monday in The Daily Telegraph It asserted that the moral logic is that a quiet abortion is greatly to be preferred to a scandal 2 Choices Rejected What the paper meant Miss Keays said was that I should have sacrificed my babys life for Mr Parkinsons career and the Governments reputation She said she had never considered having an abortion nor she added was she willing to declare on the babys birth certificate father unknown so casting further doubt on my reputation and denying the child his fundamental right to know the identity of his father Mr Parkinson announced eight days ago that he had had a long affair with Miss Keays and said he was the father of the child she was expecting He said he intended to continue as a Cabinet member and Mrs Thatcher firmly backed him But the scandal overshadowed this weeks Conservative Party conference here and threatened to continue for weeks if not for months Late Thursday night after Mr Parkinson had made a successful speech to the conference and had won its plaudits Miss Keays handed her statement to reporters for The Times of London at her fathers home near Bath She denied that she had tried to trap Mr Parkinson into marriage and asserted that the baby was conceived in a longstanding loving relationship He first proposed marriage to her she said in 1979 and reneged on their most recent wedding plans after returning from vacation on Sept 1 She said she pressed him to make a statement last week after Private Eye a satirical magazine printed what she said was a garbled account of the affair Resignation Comes Quickly Mrs Thatcher heard of her statement about 2 AM today and immediately summoned Mr Parkinson to her suite at the Imperial Hotel in this faded resort town on the Irish Sea At 8 AM he resigned and at 945 the Prime Ministers office announced tersely that the resignation had been accepted with regret Mr Parkinson who is 51 years old was the Prime Ministers protege and had been mentioned as a successor She plucked him from obscurity to make him the chairman of the Tory party then involved him deeply in the conduct of the Falkland war She had planned to make him Foreign Secretary after the election but apparently decided when he told her of the affair on election day that he would be too much of a liability in that post Instead in an effort to limit the damage Mrs Thatcher named him Minister for Trade and Industry After a discreet interval she replaced him as party chairman with John Selwyn Gummer But when the scandal broke last week she stood by him and said resignation was not an issue By keeping Mr Parkinson on and apparently rejecting an earlier resignation offer Mrs Thatcher earned credit in the party for loyalty But some senior politicians and nearly all commentators said today that the episode had robbed her Government of credibility at the start of her second term It obviously hasnt helped Transportation Minister Tom King said For the moment Paul Channon Mr Parkinsons deputy will oversee his ministry Mrs Thatcher Alludes to Him When she delivered the traditional closing speech to the conference this afternoon Mrs Thatcher thanked all who had helped the party to victory last summer She added We do not forget today the man who so brilliantly organized the campaign She did not mention his name as if hoping to bury the scandal that blighted this conference Her speech was greeted with an eightminute standing ovation Mr Parkinson returned during the day to his home north of London which was besieged by journalists He made no comment except to complain that some people  presumably meaning Miss Keays  had gone back on an agreement to say nothing His political career is widely believed to be ruined with no prospect of his ever returning to the Cabinet Although he made no move to resign as a member of Parliament many of his colleagues expect him to do so soon Had Miss Keays said nothing Mr Parkinson might have hung on Cabinet ministers said at least until the birth of the baby He clearly had the backing of the conference which cheered and applauded his appearance on the platform on Thursday At the beginning of his speech he thanked his wife Ann who was sitting behind him for her help during the campaign Tears gleamed in her eyes
GRASSROOTS ARE BECOMING A TRICKY POLITICAL THICKET,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/weekinreview/grassroots-are-becoming-a-tricky-political-thicket.html,Every four years as part of the Presidential campaign ritual political candidates and reporters begin scouring grassroots America that land of part myth and part reality part clover and part briarpatch for those issues that boil up from the people More often than not public opinion polls show that when asked to name their major concerns about the future grassrooters tick off most of the issues on the Washington agenda  the nuclear arms race the staying power of the economic recovery the prospect of military entanglement in Central America and unemployment But underlying these broad concerns are issues some local or regional that have direct effects on the lives of many voters Toxic waste is no small matter in dioxinscared Missouri In New England and other affected areas acid rain is a major concern The expected increase in local telephone bills the result of the Federal Governments breakup of ATT has upset city dwellers and farmers alike Workers in the steel and automobile industries are demanding protectionist trade policies to preserve jobs Education is caught up in Presidential politics but there are signs that this issue may be defined more by teachers and parents than by the candidates These are the kind of issues that rarely determine the outcome of a Presidential election and it is too early to say how they may figure in the political chemistry of 1984 But they do tend to influence the basic political outlook and disposition of voters and it usually takes a Presidential campaign to relate them to the policies and philosophy dominating Washington Deregulation for example was mostly an abstraction in the 1980 Presidential campaign but in 1984 it will have taken on real meaning for those who believe their lives have been affected for better or worse by the Reagan Administrations deregulation efforts Unemployed and threatened airline workers are being told their troubles stem in large measure from the economic havoc wreaked on the industry by deregulation For many other Americans the deregulation of the communications industry which has been sped along by the Federal Communications Commission and by Congressional legislation means higher local telephone bills Congress which was eager to strip Ma Bell of her regulated monoply advantages and force her into the marketplace now has a bad case of political jitters A number of bills are pending to block the FCCs decision to slap a monthy access fee 2 for residential customers and 6 for business on telephone bills This can be will be and is a political issue says Jerry Kovach staff director of the Senate Commerce Science and Transportation Committee The ramifications of not doing anything would be widespread for voters are going to be lashing out at candidates at every level Shrinking Big Government and shifting power back to the states and local communities is the kind of political rhetoric that sounds good to many voters But if shrinkage in Washington translates as it often does into higher local and state taxes reductions in services and other hardships that issue can cut a different way politically There also is growing anxiety about the adequacy of health care programs Thirty states took some action last year to reduce Medicaid benefits limit eligibility or cut payments to the providers of health services Hospital costs are going to emerge as a grassroots political issue said Bernie Aronson who monitors issues for the Democratic National Committee because Medicaid and Medicare are the next big bankruptcy questions facing the Federal Government Unpredictable Voters One problem for candidates is to keep their pursuit of grassroots issues from becoming perceived as specialinterest politics Patrick Caddell who was President Carters polltaker is one of those who believe the grassroots are dimly seen The trouble is he says that Washington tends to view that part of the country beyond the Capital Beltway as a land of predictable voting groups The perception of Moral Majority a political spinoff of the Rev Jerry Falwells evangelical movement is an example Moral Majority people are not just a bunch of rightwing nut groups as some people in Washington think Mr Caddell said I believe they are closer to the mainstream than they are given credit for You cant have such a large percentage of the American people in favor of a nuclear freeze and not have some bornagain Christians in that category Mr Caddells theory is supported by the results of a recent poll of fundamentalist Christians paid for by The Free Congress Research  Education Foundation a Washingtonbased conservative group headed by Paul W Weyrich Last week Mr Weyrich held a news conference to warn President Reagan that the poll results show that he cannot take this voting group for granted in 1984 The poll conducted by Lance Tarrance Jr of Houston shows that in a national sample of 1000 registered voters who identified themselves as evangelical and fundamentalist Christians Mr Reagan held a narrow lead 41 to 37 over Democratic Senator John Glenn of Ohio Mr Reagn led Walter F Mondale 47 to 34 The same poll seems to undercut the notion that this voting group is of like mind on many of the issues on the agenda of the religious right It found for example that while 53 percent of the polls respondents favored tuition tax credits 37 percent opposed them On military spending 39 percent supported an increase but 33 percent thought the military budget could be reduced Even on the question of abortion the poll found a significant division of opinion Asked if abortion should be legally available to any adult woman who desired it 39 percent said yes 53 percent said no Perhaps this helps explain the surprisingly friendly welcome Senator Edward M Kennedy received recently in Lynchburg Va from Mr Falwell and his Moral Majority followers The Massachusetts Democrats speech on political and religious tolerance was interrupted 16 times by applause for points including his praise of Dr Martin Luther King Jr and his support of the nuclear freeze movement
A FIRM VOICE IN ITALIAN POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/style/a-firm-voice-in-italian-politics.html,In the early 1970s Susanna Agnelli Suni to her friends lived in New York leading the kind of glamorous fast paced life that one might associate with a very wealthy woman who is a granddaughter of the founder of Fiat Miss Agnelli now 61 years old was in New York again recently but this time her visit was an official one She is now an Italian Senator who on Aug 13 was named Under Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs A tall strongfaced nononsense woman she is the divorced mother of six and grandmother of nine She is also the Mayor of Monte Argentario a coastal resort region north of Rome a job she has held since 1974 a past member of the European Parliament and the author of a popular weekly advice column in the magazine Oggi In the Italian national election last June she was also elected to the Chamber of Deputies where she has sat since 1976 by three constituencies but she now sits only in the Senate No It Is Not I All this has helped to make her what many people describe as the bestknown female politician in Italy Such a suggestion makes her shake her head and say in her blunt style No it is not I It is Mme Iotti She was referring to Leonilde Iotti a Communist Party member who is President of the Chamber of Deputies Then she certainly must be the second bestknown female politician in Italy She replied softly I would say I am yes Miss Agnelli who uses her maiden name  she was divorced in 1971 from a lawyer Count Urbano Rattazzi  was sitting in an office of the Italian Consulate General at 690 Park Avenue She was wearing a red silk dress a strand of knotted pearls and a Bulgari watch and strapped to her left wrist was a small leather case that looked as if it could hold a pack of cigarettes and that has become one of her trademarks Everybody asks what it is she said in flawless English I carry my spectacles in it so I know Ill always have them with me In Italy people think it is an antikidnapping device that can beep the police or something She is security conscious in a country that has seen much terrorism directed against officials She said she employed a bodyguard and traveled in an armored Fiat As Under Secretary Miss Agnelli has been assigned responsibilty for two areas relations with North and South America and cultural affairs She is the first in the post to be given this dual responsibility she said Affiliated with the small centrist Republican Party she is one of 10 female members in the 315seat Senate there are 40 among the 630 deputies According to Miss Agnelli more Italian women would be elected to office if they were not so aggressive I think people tend to get a bit frightened by an aggressive woman she explained I think the best way of asserting personal opinions is to be unobtrusive Speak very little and possibly in a low voice and people will listen to you more Does she consider herself a feminist No she replied I think feminists always have an aggressive attitude and never have a balanced vision of things They always get furious at things like President Reagans comment about how men would still be living in caves if it werent for women I think that was probably a compliment on Reagans part It was no reason to get furious You should get furious when people are demeaning or saying nasty things Still Miss Agnelli believes that many highranking men in Italian politics view her as something of a joke I sometimes get the feeling that they think Why the hell have they sent this woman here to discuss this important business  she said In my own party they like me to run for office because I get a lot of votes But when it comes time for something important like making an important political speech theyre not about to let a woman do it But she thinks that men in Italy especially the younger ones are becoming much less macho There is evidence of this she said in a number of new movies in which young men ask their female lovers if they have been faithful to them and the women tell them no Italian men know they have to be careful today she said with a smile I think its good that they understand the suffering that women have always felt when vice versa happens Discussing the status of Italian women Miss Agnelli a Roman Catholic said she thought that legalized abortion would not be overturned She also predicted that Pope John Paul II would not change his conservative stands on womens issues and that women would never become priests The idea of a career in national politics came to Miss Agnelli after Marion Javits wife of former Senator Jacob K Javits suggested it a number of times while she was living in New York Suni never really was a part of fashionable New York Mrs Javits said the other day She entertained it but she never really felt it Once I got to know her I felt she had layers of depths and understanding about life and people and their needs that should be used intelligently Somewhere deep down she felt she needed to serve Miss Agnelli was reluctant to talk about her motivations for going into politics She would say only that her first involvement came in 1970 after she had complained to the City Council in Monte Argentario about illegal housing construction that she considered ugly besides She said she was told that instead of grumbling she should run for office She did and was elected to the Council At the time she was considered something of a controversial figure in Italy because of a magazine article she wrote in 1969 predicting that the United States would lose the war in Vietnam A one time medical and nursing student she had visited Vietnam on a nursing mission for the Red Cross Things Still to Be Done Mayoral business is conducted in Monte Argentario on Saturdays Sundays and Mondays and Miss Agnelli has no plans to give up the post now that she is an Under Secretary I would not want to leave now she said because there are number of important questions Ive been working on They include curbing those ugly illegal houses building a new sewage system and trying to persuade women to send their children to a new kindergarten rather than to the old dilapidated one Asked about her relationship with her brother Gianni who heads Fiat she smiled and said We are great friends and always have been She said that he had supported her in all of her political endeavors and that when she was elected to the Senate he said he was very proud Miss Agnelli wrote about him and her five other brothers and sisters in her 1975 autobiography We Always Wore Sailor Suits a best seller in Italy In her spare time she raises bonsai trees and visits her children who range in age from 27 to 37 and her grandchildren One daughter Priscilla is a photographer in New York Miss Agnelli has no plans to marry again she said because marriage is a very very difficult thing something you do only once in life
SPAIN'S SOCIALISTS BEGIN FEELING THE NUDGES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/weekinreview/spain-s-socialists-begin-feeling-the-nudges.html,Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez has been in office 10 months and for the most part Spains love affair with its handsome young Socialist leader continues unabated But there are signs the honeymoon may soon be over Mr Gonzalez has run into difficulty in recent weeks in dealing with three important power centers  the unions the military and the Roman Catholic Church None of the problems appear insurmountable but they chip away at the remarkable consensus he has enjoyed so far and serve as a reminder that Spain can be a hard country to govern Last week the Government and unions opened bargaining sessions that will affect contracts for 1984 and beyond It will be a critical round because the Government wants to hold wage increases to 65 percent one and a half points below its projected figure for inflation next year The talks are haunted by the prospect of widespread layoffs a particularly sensitive issue for the Socialists who came into power partly on a promise to bring down unemployment Spains jobless rate is 165 percent one of the highest in Europe An effort is under way to streamline staterun industries that have grown fat lazy unproductive and debt ridden under decades of protectionism The overhauling is essential if Spanish industries are to become competitive enough to survive when Spain enters the European Economic Community in a few years But with the prospect of a loss of perhaps 60000 jobs according to officials the overhaul could be political dynamite as a recent dispute over plans to cut back the operations of a stateowned steel mill showed Rebellious workers refused to abandon part of the plant and were dismissed They were reinstated when they ended their protest The Government is also contemplating legislation to make it easier for private companies to hire and fire Laws dating to the rule of Francisco Franco and intended to discourage independent unions provide for hefty severence payments and many businesses think twice before letting a worker go Flexibility the employers argue would help them respond to market conditions The unions see this as a ploy likely to mean further layoffs The Workers Commissions the Communistled labor force opposes the measure So does the General Union of Workers the other principal labor grouping which is Socialist and has cooperated with the Government Military Also a Worry While the dispute with the unions was brewing the armed forces also got into the headlines The Government last month dismissed a topranking officer Lieut Gen Fernando Soteras Casamayor the commander of one of the countrys nine military regions after he made statements in a magazine interview praising the imprisoned ringleaders of the failed coup attempt of February 1981 when Parliament was seized General Soteras upset the Government and other wellwishers of Spanish democracy by referring to the coupmakers as gentlemen and by laying out a rationale for army intervention  in cases he said where there is a vacuum of leadership by elected civilians He sought to justify such takeovers by citing an article of the Constitution that describes the armed forces as the defenders of Spains territorial integrity and the upholders of constitutional order Against the background of two and possibly three coup attempts since the death of Franco in 1975 such views resurrected fears that the 250000member army  conservative and isolated from much of society imbued with a sense of mission to guard against internal enemies and deployed in brigades encircling the main cities  was still a power with questionable loyalties to parliamentary rule Articles appeared attributing the unrest in the military partly to continuing terrorist violence in the Basque region where 27 people have died this year and to separatist demonstrators burning the Spanish flag The inevitable conclusion is that the military problem remains with us and it does not at all help to silence or minimize the threat this implies to the constitutional system the respected daily El Pais warned No one thought another coup attempt was imminent and the calm with which the army received General Soterass dismissal bolstered this view But the incident made clear that the military hierarchy remains a powerful presence It can exert pressure even without stirring from the barracks The Roman Catholic Church is a third power center and it too was dueling with the Government The issues were abortion and state control over private religious schools that receive Government subsidies Both issues arose in new legislation that went before Parliament One bill legalized abortions in restricted cases such as for pregnancies resulting from rape or in which the fetus is malformed Another set a variety of standards in administering the private schools which teach almost a third of all Spanish pupils Both bills are strongly opposed by the church and are being challenged in the courts on constitutional grounds by the rightist opposition During a twoday trip to Rome last week Mr Gonzalez met with Pope John Paul II It was described as a courtesy visit but most observers believed the mission was to repair relations strained over the past few weeks The Socialists in power for the first time since the 19361939 civil war have a comfortable working majority in Parliament  202 out of 350 seats But recent events have shown that pressures from power centers outside Parliament can be intense The Socialists selfconfidence does not appear to have been diminished nor their popularity undermined but the lesson has been an important one
IRELAND DOESN'T WONT THE ULSTER PROBLEM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/16/opinion/l-ireland-doesn-t-wont-the-ulster-problem-233803.html,To the Editor Wherever does Jon Nordheimer or the editors of Week in Review Politics in Ulster Oct 2 get the idea that there is any progress toward the reunification of Ireland through peaceful and constitutional means which the IRASinn Fein might have to spend any effort in crippling The majority of those electors in the Irish Republic who bothered to turn out last month decided to amend their constitution to elevate the merely legal ban on abortion into a Constitutional prohibition Divorce is already proscribed in the Republics Constitution Does this sound like an electorate which is ready to accommodate a British Protestant population that would be 20 percent or more of an allIreland state and that is geographically concentrated in one corner of the island that these two nationalities share When are you going to put someone in Ireland long enough to realize that public opinion in the Republic at elite or mass levels does not want the responsibility of the Ulster problem not militarily economically or culturally The reunification of Ireland is no more likely than the reunification of Iberia or Scandinavia London may eventually sicken of the Ulster morass and withdraw its responsibility but that will lead to a Lebanon scenario  not at all like the limited violence so far  in which Dublin might be forced to annex the border districts to prevent the establishment of an IRA ministate like Syria and Israel in Lebanon but that would not of itself bring substantive Irish unity one step closer ROBERT STCYR Greenlawn LI Oct 2 1983
FETAL DEFECTS DISCOVERED EARLY BY NEW METHOD,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/18/science/fetal-defects-discovered-early-by-new-method.html,DETECTION of many fetal defects as early as the 10th week of pregnancy may soon become practicle because of a new technique that some experts expect to replace most uses of amniocentesis currently the standard test for such conditions within the next several years The new method is called chorionic villus biopsy Unlike amniocentesis which relies on fetal cells found in samples of amniotic fluid taken with a needle through the abdominal wall chorionic villus biopsy samples fetal tissue directly through the cervix It is now being tested at several medical centers in the United States and Europe almost a decade after a primitive version of the technique was first tried in China A small group of experts will meet today at the National Institute of Child Health and Human Development in Bethesda Md to discuss the technique Experts have high hopes for it but the method has not yet been used widely enough for its safety and efficacy to be evaluated thoroughly Dr George G Rhoads of the institute said the group would discuss optimum ways of answering these questions Chorionic villus biopsy can provide a larger sample of fetal tissues than amniocentesis gives results faster and can be done much earlier in a pregnancy specialists say Coupled with new techniques for analyzing the human genetic material through recombinant DNA methods chorionic villus biopsy may someday make it possible to detect early in pregnancy almost any of 3800 different genetic disorders for which a faulty gene is known to exist In the relatively near future some scientists say such biopsies in conjunction with DNA probes may become standard screening procedures for most pregnant women providing tests for several important disorders at the same time Coupled with use of DNA probes to analyze the tissue samples said Dr Laird G Jackson of Thomas Jefferson University the method may come into extremely broad use for fetal diagnosis Dr Jackson is one of the leaders in applying the technique in this country He said he expected the technique to largely replace amniocentesis before the end of this decade Other specialists called that prediction conservative As an example of the future possibilities said Dr George H Sack Jr of Johns Hopkins University there might someday be a panel of simultaneous tests for cystic fibrosis phenylketonuria and galactosemia three of the most important genetic disorders among white Americans Sickle cell anemia and the various forms of the blood disease thalassemia might be added for appropriate population groups Sickle cell anemia is common among blacks while various forms of thalassemia sometimes called Cooleys anemia are common in people of Mediterranean ancestry The possibility of doing such multiple tests from the same tissue sample is a realistic goal today because of the sweeping advances that are being made in understanding the messages of the human genes encoded in the DNA deoxyribonucleic acid the genetic material of all living things The genetic message of any gene is embodied in the specific sequence of subunits in a piece of DNA A disease causing mutation may be only a single erroneous subunit among thousands that will make up a gene Artificially constructed pieces of DNA that are only about 19 subunits long are being produced to serve as probes for the detection of such so called point mutations The pieces of DNA are called oligonucleotide probes It is probes of this kind that could be used in a battery of tests of fetal cells collected through chorionic villus biopsy A biopsy is the removal of a small sample of tissue for testing Chorionic villi are protrusions shaped somewhat like tiny fronds of coral that protrude from portions of a membrane called the chorion which surrounds the developing fetus and becomes part of the placenta Although the chorion is never an anatomical part of the fetus itself it is fetal rather than maternal in origin Thus the material in a sample of chorionic villous tissue is actually fetal tissue and can be used to test for genetic disorders in the fetus Procedure Used in Biopsy The sample is taken by inserting a thin hollow tube called a catheter through the vagina and cervix into the uterus under direct observation with the aid of high resolution ultrasound The use of sophisticated ultrasound which can give remarkably detailed views of the fetus and its surroundings without invasion of the body or use of radiation is considered indispensable to the chorion biopsy technique The tissue is taken either by snipping off a sample of villous tissue or simply by suction The method has already been used successfully to test for a particular enzyme that is missing in the tragic genetic disorder TaySachs disease Biopsies of chorionic villi have also been used to test for thalassemia sicklecell anemia and the chromosome abnormalities characteristic of Downs syndrome as well as other even more severe forms of physical and mental impairment The risk of having a baby afflicted with such a chromosomal disorder is highest among women in the older childbearing years Eugene Pergament of Michael Reese Hospital in Chicago said about half the women on whom his group had used the new technique were tested because of their age The group totals 34 patients to date he said making it one of the largest series of patients ever tested with the technique Almost all of their fetuses were shown to be free of the defects for which they were tested Dr Pergament said and the pregnancies have progressed without problem The prenatal diagnostic test used most widely and successfully today is amniocentesis in which fetal cells from the amniotic fluid surrounding the fetus are sampled through a needle that pierces the mothers abdomen and uterus Amniocentesis is commonly done after the 16th week of pregnancy Earlier than that there is not enough amniotic fluid to test safely The cells taken from the fluid usually have to be grown for three to four weeks in laboratory tissue cultures to provide enough material for testing The results of the tests are therefore often not known until after the 20th week Because it comes so late in pregnancy the timing of such tests can often present serious psychological as well as medical problems for the pregnant woman whose baby is shown to have a serious genetic disorder By then the fetus has grown to a relatively large size and and may be making detectable movements Chorion villus biopsies on the other hand can be performed between the eighth and 12th weeks with the optimum time being the 10th week when the fetus is only about the size of an apricot This allows detection of genetic disorders and abortion if the woman chooses within the first three months of pregnancy This would not only allow very much safer methods for termination but would also be far more acceptable to mothers at risk of having severely handicapped children and to the community said a report in The Lancet a British medical journal by a group led by Dr Robert Williamson and Dr B M Modell both of London A Traumatic Situation Several experts in this country echoed that statement noting that the need to make a decision on abortion late in a pregnancy can be psychologically traumatic for the woman involved Dr Jackson said chorion villus biopsy had been considered many years ago in the Scandinavian countries but was eclipsed by the early successes of amniocentesis Chorionic villus biopsy was again tried in China in the middle 1970s A report in 1975 in an Englishlanguage Chinese medical journal said it had been used successfully to determine the sex of fetuses The biopsies were done blind however without the use of ultrasound to guide the catheters The method was next taken up in the Soviet Union and in the last few years in Europe and the United States The early efforts attempting to demonstrate both the safety and the efficacy of the method were done on fetuses already scheduled for abortion Among the earliest to demonstrate that useful tissue samples could be obtained by such biopsies was Dr R H T Ward a gynecological surgeon at University College in London In a recent issue of the British Medical Journal his group described the use of the technique to obtain tissue samples from the fetuses of 47 pregnant women American specialists expect that the method will prove safe because the tissues taken are not part of the fetus itself and are destined to disappear naturally as the placenta matures But no one can be certain of the safety without considerable experience A few cases of fetal death after the chorionic villus tests have been reported but in general those fetuses were found to have had serious disorders such as chromosome aberrations which were probably responsible for the outcome rather than anything related to the biopsy itself At present the main reasons for doing diagnostic tests of fetuses are to assure that no genetic disorder is present or to permit an abortion if such a defect is found But doctors doing clinical research on the new technique see another and more hopeful prospect for the future The earlier a genetic problem is found in a fetus the greater the possibility that it might someday be corrected by some form of treatment in the womb For example phenylketonuria which carries serious danger of mental retardation is now treated by a drastically restricted diet from infancy onward Specialists say it is a logical possibility that starting such a diet early in pregnancy by having the pregnant woman follow it might improve the babys chances for a normal life A substantial number of other genetic disorders work their damage through the babys lack of some enzyme or other important substance or through the abnormal accumulation of something else Early warning that a fetus faces such a problem might in the future be followed by treatment in the womb that could compensate for the dangerous excess or deficiency

NATIVITY SCENE BEGETS A CONSTITIUTIONAL DEBATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/23/weekinreview/nativity-scene-begets-a-constitiutional-debate.html,Among the items on the Reagan Administrations social issues agenda only one the effort to promote religion in American life has made headway at the Supreme Court The Court has been cool to the Administrations views on civil rights and abortion but more receptive to arguments for lowering the constitutional barriers between church and state In decisions last term it agreed with Government lawyers that neither Nebraskas salaried legislative chaplain nor Minnesotas tuition tax deductions which benefit mainly parochial schools violated the First Amendments prohibition against the establishment of religion Now the Administration has asked the Justices to take a giant step across the line dividing church and state and let Pawtucket R I continue its 40yearold practice of including a nativity scene in an official Christmas display That the Justice Department decided to join a local dispute which the High Court heard earlier this month and apparently hopes to decide before Christmas is a measure of this Governments determination to restore a religious fiber to American life Last year the Administration pushed cases involving religious observance of a general nature Nebraskas chaplain for example offered nondenominational prayers that avoided references to Christ This time the Administration is asking the Court to endorse the governmental display of a fundamental symbol of a particular religion Christianity In his argument Solicitor General Rex E Lee did not rely on the analysis put forward by Pawtuckets lawyer  that Christmas nowadays is a secular folk festival so removed from its religious roots as to barely raise a constitutional question Rather Mr Lee told the Justices that Christmas is rooted in religion as a matter of undeniable historical fact and that to read the Constitution as requiring the exclusion of that fact from our national consciousness is nothing less than intellectual and historical dishonesty It would be he said cultural censorship That view is not shared by the National Council of Churches the one mainstream Christian organization to file a friend of the court brief The council contended that government sponsorship degrades and secularizes a sacred symbol of Christianity The Administration went to some length to put its position before the Court since the rules require every friend of the court to identify its interest in a case and the Governments stake in Pawtuckets cr eche was not obvious Thus the Administrations brief opened with an essay about how the Government from the earliest days of the Republic to the present has felt free to recognize that religion is a part of our heritage and should continue to be an element in our public life and public occasions The ThreePart Test The issue then goes beyond the content of a Christmas display It is the Reagan challenge to the way the Supreme Court has analyzed the First Amendments prohibition against the establishment of religion Beginning with Lemon v Kurtzman a 1971 opinion by Chief Justice Warren E Burger striking down a state parochial aid plan the Court has applied a threepart test to laws challenged under the establishment clause A law will be upheld only if it 1 reflects a clearly secular legislative purpose 2 neither advances nor inhibits religion as its primary effect and 3 avoids excessive governmental entanglement with religion In the Pawtucket case which was brought by the American Civil Liberties Union both the Federal District Court and the United States Court of Appeals for the First Circuit ruled that the cr eche lacked a secular purpose and so failed the test On appeal the Government is arguing that the test imparts a kind of artificial objectivity to establishment clause inquiries of this sort Solicitor General Lee asked the Court to set aside the test in this case and take a fresh look at the cr eche as one of many symbols of a recognized national holiday That approach may be welcomed by Justices who are restive with the threepart test They applied it only halfheartedly in upholding Minnesotas tuition tax deduction and not at all in upholding the Nebraska legislative chaplain In that case the Court ruled that since the same Congress that adopted the First Amendment also hired a chaplain the Founding Fathers could not possibly have meant to prohibit legislative prayer No such historical escape hatch is available this time as Justice Sandra Day OConnor found when she pressed the citys lawyer William F McMahon for evidence that official nativity scenes date back to the early days of the Republic He could offer none If a majority agrees the test has outlived its usefulness the cr eche dispute gives the Court the chance to announce a new approach It will not be the only chance Alabama will soon appeal a Federal appeals court decision that struck down a state law permitting public school teachers to lead their classes in prayer The law is obviously unconstitutional as long as the Court adheres to its school prayer decisions of the early 1960s The Solicitor General is now deciding whether the Reagan Administration should join Alabamas appeal
BATTLE FOR 'BABY DOE',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/25/nyregion/battle-for-baby-doe.html,News Analysis Tomorrow the New York State Court of Appeals will consider a question that should be at least on its surface more the province of doctors than lawyers the adequacy of the treatment being administered to a 2weekold Long Island girl with an array of crippling birth defects The case of Baby Jane Doe as the unidentified child has been dubbed goes far beyond the issue of proper treatment however Involved as well are questions of parental autonomy the obligations of the state the legal rights of handicapped infants and the value of even the most debilitated form of human life The baby was born Oct 11 with a variety of disorders including spina bifida  a failure of the spinal column to close properly  and excess fluid in the brain Without surgery doctors say she will die within two years with it she could survive into her 20s but would be severely retarded and bedridden After talks with doctors and clergy the babys parents said they would not agree to any corrective operation Last Friday an appellate court in Brooklyn upheld their decision ruling that it was well within accepted medical standards Few Cases Reach Courts With theologians doctors and philosophers unable to agree on fundamental questions of the quality of life it is not surprising that the legal rights of children with debilitating birth defects remain unsettled Though such lifeanddeath decisions may be commonplace to doctors few have reached the courts and those that have often become moot before they are decided This is a subject however in which personal predilection and passion seem to rule as much as precedent Some legal scholars say with absolute conviction that even the most badly impaired children are entitled to the full panoply of constitutional rights Others argue with equal intensity that the parents fundamental rights to privacy should prevail Where there is no consensus on whether even after an operation there is a life worth living its a problem for parents to resolve themselves said Joseph Goldstein a professor at the Yale Law School Were safest as individuals and as a society if we let individuals rather than the state make these judgments The conflicting rights of parents and child were alluded to by William E Weber the babys courtappointed guardian who will argue the case tomorrow before the Court of Appeals the states highest court Parents Rights Called Limited Parents do have a constitutional right to familial privacy tending to the care and custody of their children he wrote in court papers But that right is not so broad that it gives them the freedom to bring about their childrens death by deliberate medical neglect Parents may not rely on the Constitution to inflict serious harm on their children In upholding the rights of the parents of Baby Doe the Appellate Division of the State Supreme Court in Brooklyn cited the 1978 opinion in Matter of Hofbauer In that case the State Court of Appeals ruled that when parents elected to forgo conventional chemotherapy for their 8yearold son who suffered from Hodgkins disease treating him with laetrile and a special diet instead the courts would not interefere Mr Weber Baby Does guardian has disputed the applicability of the Hofbauer case in part because Baby Does treatment he claimed amounted to changing bandages cleansing the spinal sack and hoping for the worst  death At the same time he has argued that whatever her handicaps the baby is protected by the 14th Amendment to the United States Constitution which guarantees the due process and equal protection of the law Traditional Adversaries Join They are arguments often raised in civilliberties cases and indeed the right of the physically impaired is an issue that brings together such traditional adversaries as righttolife advocates and some civillibertarians To some scholars like Prof Victor G Rosenblum of Northwestern University Law School the rights of deformed children are absolute and unwavering and require that all measures should be taken to save lives under all circumstances I know of nothing in the law that authorizes a quality of life minimum as a prerequisite for constitutional protection he said Our legal protections are tied to personhood and unlike the abortion cases theres no question when personhood begins Professor Rosenblum  an officer in Americans United for Life an organization opposed to abortion  is among those seeking to convince the United States Supreme Court to overturn a decision issued last year by the Indiana Supreme Court That case upheld the right of parents to withold corrective surgery food or water from their infant son The boy who had both a malformed esophogus and Downs syndrome eventually died A Useful Fulfilling Life How is one to determine at birth whether or not you have a Helen Keller Mr Rosenblum said Mr Weber has taken a lessabsolute position conceding that in some cases life is so full of pain and suffering that continued life is not in a patients interest But he argues that Baby Doe could lead a useful fulfilling life and cites two cases to suggest that at least in New York the courts have accorded broad protections to those in equally difficult straits In the first the 1979 case of In re Cicero Justice Martin B Stecher of State Supreme Court in the Bronx overruled the parents wish to let God decide the fate of their infant daughter who also had spina bifida and ordered corrective surgery More recently in a case called Matter of Storar the State Court of Appeals ordered blood transfusions for a profoundly retarded 52year old man with terminal bladder cancer A court should not allow an incompetent patient to bleed to death because someone even someone as close as a parent or sibling feels that this is best for one with an incurable disease Judge Sol MWachtler wrote in the case Could Recognize People Mr Weber argues that while Baby Doe is likely to be both incontinent and unable to walk she would not need to be institutionalized and could come to recognize friends and relatives Baby Jane Doe has a prognosis equal to if not greater than John Storar he said The Storar decision according to John A Robertson a professor at the University of Texas Law School may be the best clue to how the Court of Appeals will handle the Baby Doe case In light of the courts attitude toward the severely retarded adult I would think that it would be very protective toward a defective newborn said Professor

WAS LIFE BETTER BEFORE MAO'S REVOLUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/books/was-life-better-before-mao-s-revolution.html,BROKEN EARTH The Rural Chinese By Steven W Mosher317 pp New York The Free PressMacmillan 1795 IN a famous study of the Chinese economy Land and Labor in China published in 1932 R H Tawney likened the rural Chinese to a man standing up to his neck in water and leading a life so precarious that even a single ripple is sufficient to drown him In recent years few foreigners have had Tawneys opportunity to observe rural China personally at any length Steven W Mosher a Sinologist and anthropologist fluent in two dialects of Chinese is one of the rare ones In Broken Earth a toughminded account of rural China the result of more than a year of field research in southern Guangdong Province Mr Mosher portrays a peasantry hardly better off than that described by Tawney Mr Moshers book belongs to a growing body of literature on contemporary China that reversing favorable portrayals written in the early and mid 1970s places the Peoples Republic squarely in the 20thcentury totalitarian mainstream But while others have stressed urban life the havoc of such mass campaigns as the cultural revolution and the absence of political freedoms in Maoist and postMaoist China Mr Moshers emphasis is on the hardness and brutality of everyday life In describing the countryside he is more critical of the effects of the Communist revolution than other recent writers He concludes that for the Chinese peasantry  at least the 400 million peasants in the southern part of the country where he did his studies  life was better during periods before the revolution of 1949 than after the countrys new rulers began to overhaul ageold patterns of everyday life That conclusion is striking if only because as Mr Mosher observes it is the paramount myth of the Chinese revolution that Communist rule whatever it has done in other areas of life has produced great strides in the countryside where 80 percent of Chinas one billion people live Mr Mosher writes that well into his stay in China he too believed in this paramount myth On his second night in the village where he stayed he was visited by Lao Baixing an elderly village official who enumerated the elements in the alleged transformation of rural life by the revolution station guaranteed rice rations elimination of the exploiting landlord class among other things Toward the end of his time in China after he had interviewed dozens of peasants and seen numerous villages and observed the life and work habits of the people Mr Mosher developed a more complex picture of the putatively scourgeridden past and he had an appreciation for the hardships of the present The lives Richard Bernstein  the United Nations correspondent of The New York Times is the author of From the Center of the Earth The Search for Truth About China of the peasants are more controlled by party leaders now than they were by the landholders in the past goods are scarcer and more shoddy locally grown products such as silk are taken away by the state to satisfy the current national plan Mr Mosher cites an article in Chinas official press reporting that only recently has per capita grain consumption equaled the levels of the years just after the revolution In the end Mr Moshers challenge to the conventional assumption that rural life in China has greatly improved since 1949 is not definitive there is no systematic weighing of the factors that make up the quality of life Nonetheless Mr Mosher provides a good deal of persuasive evidence that the vast Chinese peasantry has fared far worse than was commonly believed Mr Moshers activities in China and possibly the information he gathered there have put him at the center of a controversy involving the Government in Peking and Americans responsible for academic exchanges with the Peoples Republic Chinese officials some time after Mr Mosher left China in 1981 charged him with having committed various offenses during his stay in the country including bribing local officials dealing in contraband and acquiring secret data Stanford University where Mr Mosher was a candidate for a PhD launched its own investigation of the charges The investigation resulted in a 47page report that has not been made public but Stanford did announce that Mr Mosher had engaged in illegal and seriously unethical acts The anthropology department at the university unanimously voted to terminate his candidacy for the PhD and when Mr Mosher appealed that decision it was upheld by a special threemember committee appointed by Stanfords president last spring to review the case Since the records of the investigation have not been made public some people still suspect that whether Mr Mosher violated the professional ethics of anthropology or not part of his trouble sprang from the fact that he was simply a dogged and resourceful researcher who earned the animosity of the Chinese authorities by uncovering material they preferred to keep secret After Mr Mosher left China he went to Taiwan for further academic research there he published an article complete with dramatic photographs describing abuses in Chinas ambitious population control program including the forced abortions of women in advanced stages of pregnancy What he has to say about the birth control program in Broken Earth is indicated by the title of his chapter on it Birth Control A Grim Game of Numbers Mr Mosher describes Chinas Malthusian dilemma In the Sandhead Production Brigade where he lived there had been a population increase of 130 percent in 27 years and the land under cultivation amounted to only onesixth of an acre per person Yet the population control program as it was implemented there seemed to contain many of the excesses and abuses of earlier mass campaigns in China Zealous local leaders eager to show success to their superiors bludgeoned local resistance out of existence Mr Mosher describes a visit he made to an abortion clinic during one of the high tides during which women who have become pregnant in defiance of state plans are encouraged to have abortions The women in the clinic Mr Mosher says were in physical and mental anguish He reports on a meeting between pregnant women and party leaders who cajoling and threatening told the women that they really have no choice about having an abortion THE Chinese countryside described by Mr Mosher is dominated by surviving traditions  bride prices rural superstitions and ancestor worship  along with the plain hardships of rural life He recounts a typical day of a peasant woman Gin Sau describing in vivid detail how particularly for women collectivism has increased rather than decreased the amount of labor that needs to be performed Gin Sau who also takes part in collective labor has to run out to forage for grass for fuel while her husband takes a noonday nap She gathers mulberry leaves to feed the collectives silkworms she washes sews and mends the familys clothes and she cooks three meals a day in a conveniencefree econ omy where as Mr Mosher puts it all food preparation starts from a gastronomical ground zero She bathes the children cares for the familys private chickens and hauls water from the village well  all in a traditional rural society that contrary to Chinas propaganda claims about equality for women really has little esteem for what it clearly regards as the second sex One of the most dramatic moments in this account of rural life comes when Mr Mosher describes a husband brutally beating his wife while villagers looked on for having quarreled with his mother When it was over not a single person moved to console the woman Mr Mosher writes She was left sobbing alone as they murmured approval of the mans actions THESE penetrating glimpses into real life are among the most vivid in the literature on contemporary China Yet Mr Moshers account valuable as it is is marred by a relative scarcity of concrete description and a surplus of generality It is not that his generalities are erroneous Mr Mosher is well informed about such subjects as the Chinese bureaucracy corruption and the social costs of mass campaigns But these matters have been well covered in other recent books and they divert our attention from what he is trying to write about And Mr Mosher surprisingly seems to miss numerous opportunities to bring the rural Chinese to life for his readers There is not even a good physical description of the village where he lived His own life as a foreigner in China is mentioned only tangentially Characters from the village appear briefly and then pass from sight so that no rural personalities take on shape or substance Mr Mosher tells us of the persistence of tradition but except for one good account of a reburial ceremony in which the bones of a departed ancestor are disinterred and placed in an urn very little of this tradition materializes Indeed he whets the appetite for sights sounds smells and anecdotes but he does not often satisfy it At the end of the book Mr Mosher says that as he was concluding his stay in China the village official Lao Baixing who had proclaimed to Mr Mosher early in his stay the progress made under the Communists in Chinas countryside returned to visit him This time Lao Baixing which is a Chinese term for the common people and thus seems to be a pseudonym admitted he had been instructed to make that first visit Now he tells Mr Mosher the truth Life in the old days really wasnt bad compared to the present when there are shortages of everything and the party cadres have more arbitrary power than the old landlords used to Perhaps Lao Baixing exaggerates Yet the story illustrates just how elusive the truth is like rice it is rationed carefully by the political authorities Mr Mosher found out a good deal about the real situation and his book considerably advances our understanding of what Chinas 34 years of revolution have wrought in the countrys vast hinterland
A BITTER PEACE LIFE IN VIETNAM,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/30/magazine/a-bitter-peace-life-in-vietnam.html,Craig R Whitney an assistant managing editor of The New York Times was a foreign correspondent from 1971 to 1980 stationed in Saigon Bonn and Moscow He was in Vietnam from 1971 to 1973 S OUR THAI AIRWAYS jet came in for a landing at Hanoi skimming bomb craters that had become circular rice paddies I felt again the cold fear that had been a fairly constant companion during my two years as a war correspondent in Vietnam Now it was not so much fear of danger as fear of the unknown of what I might learn about the fate of the people since American troops left after the defeat of South Vietnam almost 10 years ago and the country was reunified under Communist rule This was my first trip to Hanoi and I had no idea how I would be received My discomfort rose at the airports passportcontrol booth where uniformed guards eyed my American passport with what seemed to be special suspicion and hostility But I was wrong I was just another foreigner And as I was vividly reminded a few days later during a tour of the military museum in Hanoi the Vietnamese are wary of foreigners The museums display begins with ancient Vietnamese insurrections against China  the Trung sisters rebellion in the first century AD is not even the earliest  and continues through several rooms filled with pictures of French colonizers and the battles that defeated them in 1954 through the struggles with Ngo Dinh Diem and Lyndon Johnson and a succession of American generals in charge of the American war effort up to one of the museums most popular photos  a massive American pilot being taken prisoner by a tiny Vietnamese militiawoman But the museum display does not end with the diorama showing the evacuation of the American Embassy on the last day of April 1975 An entire hall is devoted to the attacks by Pol Pots forces along the Cambodian border with Vietnam in late l978 the subsequent invasion of Cambodia by Vietnam that resulted in the overthrow of Pol Pot followed by the invasion of Vietnam by the Chinese in 1979 which was intended to punish the Vietnamese for their invasion of Cambodia Here was graphic evidence that the American war the defeat we are now finally examining in an outpouring of books and television documentaries reexperiencing in movies novels and memoirs is an interlude in Vietnamese history an epic tragic interlude that cost more than a million Vietnamese lives and 58000 American ones but an interlude nonetheless The Vietnam War is over for us it continues for the Vietnamese with China My fear of being singled out was thus unfounded and I encountered not hostility but wary curiosity in Hanoi as well as in the cities and battlefields I had lived in and covered during the war  Quang Tri Hue Dong Ha Da Nang Saigon now Ho Chi Minh City What I found was a country with all the trappings and restrictive laws of a Communist police state but without its ruthless efficiency Vietnam is a backward contradictory impoverished country that is 30 years behind the economic boom and the traffic jams of Hong Kong and Bangkok exhausted not so much by the war as by the problems caused by peace Its leaders seem overwhelmed by problems of feeding 54 million people without the wars great infusions of foreign aid and sup Page 26 plies problems of developing a peacetime economy when the per capita income is only 150 a year problems of dealing with social and political gaps that had grown up between North and South during more than 20 years of partition from 1954 to 1976 problems of continuing dependence on foreigners  now the Russians According to Western diplomats in Hanoi there are about 6000 Russians scattered around the country supervising projects and advising on an estimated 1 billion in aid I was often mistaken for a Russian in the north where this usually meant a reserved smile and a salutation this mistake was made less often in the south where being misidentified as a Russian sometimes meant being spat upon Whatever nationality I was taken for however I was officially offlimits for the Vietnamese The people are forbidden to talk to any foreigner and so I could not visit personal friends as I had hoped to do  indeed as I had hoped beyond all else to do when I first applied to the Vietnamese Foreign Ministry to make the trip in April When my visa was finally granted toward the end of August it was understood that I would put myself in the hands of the Communist authorities who would provide drivers and a translator for my twoweek stay I could ask to see war veterans village chiefs hospitals schools churches and temples I could ask to see ordinary people scholars and highranking officials Prime Minister Pham Van Dong Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach the Defense Minister Van Tien Dung of these only Mr Thach acceded to my wish promising to see me in New York when he came for the United Nations General Assembly I could ask how the people who had suffered from the American bombing felt about us now I could ask people who had been on the losing side how they were being treated by the Communists now and hope to know whether they were telling me the truth I Page 27 could ask to visit one of the reeducation camps where some 10000 former South Vietnamese officials are still held a request not granted and one of the new economic zones created to provide jobs in the countryside And I could ask to talk to people who were trying to leave the country in order to find out why so many had already left or wanted to I could try in other words to answer those questions which had gnawed at me since Vietnam was lost to us in 1975 to see what had become of the country and the people I had come to know so well but lost touch with as all Americans had HE ROAD TO HANOI FROM THE AIRport crosses the Red River on what the French called the Paul Doumer Bridge  a bottleneck rail and road span whose black iron girders cast in Paris between 1899 and 1902 kept supplies coming in from China through all the years of the war despite countless American bomb attacks The bridge became a kind of monument to Vietnamese persistence against all odds It is now so overwhelmed by traffic that it lists to one side and trucks are permitted to use it only at night when it is less traveled The rest of Hanoi looks as listless as the bridge as if the city had been in a time capsule since the French left in 1954  a sleepy backward colonial town of low yellow stucco buildings narrow streets overarched by the lacy green leaves of tamarind trees Water buffaloes plod slowly along the streets pulling carts of night soil through silent crowds of cyclists Only a few automobiles  Russian Volgas and Zhigulis  honk their way through the bicycles The bar at the Thong Nhat hotel frequented mainly by foreigners stocks Vietnamese vodka apparently for the benefit of the Russian diplomats and advisers who appear on the streets mostly on Sundays looking flushed and uncomfortable in synthetic clothes not designed for the summer heat and humidity I got occasional hints of uneasiness about these benefactors from the Vietnamese I talked to Some people think the longer we receive aid from the Soviet Union the more difficult it will be to preserve our independence said DoXuan Oanh a songwriter in his 50s who said he learned English by listening to the Voice of America and now heads the VietnameseAmerican Friendship Society an organization whose sole function is to receive the few Americans who turn up in Hanoi A highranking official who said he could speak more freely if I agreed not to use his name argued that Vietnam had nowhere else to turn except to the Russians for its most basic needs but he said the leaders would not refuse an opening from a Western country if one materialized He said that up to now Vietnam had not granted the Soviet Union any permanent military bases on its territory but he added if a Soviet base constituted a necessity for our independence then we would not refuse The Soviets do use the port facilities at Cam Ranh Bay to stock and fuel their Far Eastern Fleet Though three years of military service is compulsory for all Vietnamese men from age 18 to 35 uniforms do not proliferate in the streets of Hanoi today The army probably has its hands full with several hundred thousand troops fending off attacks from the remaining Pol Pot forces in Cambodia and occasionally exchanging fire with the Chinese along the northern border A few steps from the Governmentrun Thong Nhat hotel where the amenities in my dingy room included a small Russian airconditioner and a Chinese thermos bottle was the state bank of Vietnam The foreignexchange department was in an annex where I was the only customer While I waited for my 300 to be converted into dong I counted 18 people involved in the transaction writing down serial numbers filling out forms examining my passport and counting and recounting both the dollars and the dong The official conversion rate was 9954 dong to the dollar Outside on the black market that flourishes in cafes and small shops the dollar brings 16 times as much The Government obliquely recognizes that the currency is overvalued Even the hotels it runs convert dong at a rate five or six times the banks In the shops quite unlike the Soviet Union where there are no private stores anymore people were selling jewelry Ming and Ching treasures sold off by ethnic Chinese and others who fled the country during the worst years of economic deprivation in 1978 and 1979 clothing cigarettes and lottery tickets for private profit There were a few cafes where young people gathered to drink coffee talk and listen to Western rock music There didnt seem to be much else to do the movie theaters advertised old films from Rumania and the Soviet Union but were as dark as the streets much of the time because of power cuts Some people seemed to be living on the sidewalks begging for food as streams of pedestrians dressed in drab cotton pants and jackets passed by I wondered how this could be the same country that had sent with iron discipline hundreds of thousands of its sons and daughters in their rubber sandals down the Ho Chi Minh Trail to their deaths And in a sense it wasnt Ho had inspired the people to those sacrifices while he lived but now all that remained of that inspiration were slogans on banners and posters The objective was to reunite the country With that accomplished Hos successors seem to be unable to ignite enthusiasm for any other goal They were faced immediately with the problem of feeding the country and they failed After a series of droughts and typhoons in the late l970s and after the failure of a drive to collectivize the rice farmers of the Mekong Delta the country came close to famine in 1978 and 1979 At the end of that year socialism had been undone to the extent of encouraging small privatesector businesses and letting peasants grow crops for their own use and sale even on Governmentowned land an accommodation unthinkable in the Soviet Union Thanks to this concession to economic reality last year the country was able to do without imported rice for the first time since the war ended We can feed ourselves now but at a level you in the West would consider only the bare minimum for subsistence the highranking official told me We hope that in 15 years we may be able to reach a minimally adequate level Because of the shortage rice and other foods are rationed and this being a MarxistLeninist state apportioned according to need as defined by the Communist authorities Laborers in the fields or in the coal mines of northern Vietnam get rice rations of 26 kilograms a month office workers in the Government bureaucracies in Hanoi get 12 kilograms The mandates of the class struggle also determine who gets an education If your grandfather was a mandarin or an official of the French colonial administration you dont get ahead One young man a 24yearold Vietnam 1st JUMP Page 54  56 said the Government wouldnt let him study foreign languages apparently a soughtafter field because it provides an opportunity to go abroad if only to other Communist countries taught himself rudimentary French and with it pleaded with me to take a letter out to an uncle he thought was living in the United States I am always hungry he said The Government gives students an allowance of 36 dong a month The iced coffee we drank cost 25 a kilogram 22 pounds of pork costs 110 The average civil servant I was told makes 200 dong a month Le Mai a Foreign Ministry official warned me that I would not find much in the stores for people to buy even if they had money You will see we are selling goods of very poor quality but we are trying to produce all basic commodities by ourselves and you have to start somewhere he said The main department store in Hanoi offered a pathetic collection of sprockets chains nuts and bolts for bicycles A few garishly colored plastic sandals were displayed on unfinished wooden shelves they cost 180 dong or nearly 20 Tin cooking pots cost 350 dong more than a months salary DoXuan Oanh told me that because of the continuing pressure from the Chinese it may take a century for us to restore our economy I do not share the view that life is only meaningful if it is accompanied by pain and hardship He made it sound like a dissenting view Though I was surprised by how little evidence of damage there was from the American bombing in the city of Hanoi itself I asked to meet Vietnamese who had been through the Christmas 1972 bombing the heaviest of the war which President Nixon had ordered to force Hanoi to accept the terms of a cease fire I was taken to Kham Thien Street close to the railroad station and all but destroyed in a B52 raid apparently targeted on the station at 1030 the night of Dec 26 The raid killed 283 people and wounded 266 There is a monument to the victims of the Christmas bombing on the site of a ruined house A statue of a woman holding a dead child it bears the inscription Indignation at the American aggressors Page 56 Nguyen Van The a 46yearold veteran of the North Vietnamese campaigns around Quang Tri in the South in 1972 was now the Communist Party ward committee chairman for Kham Thien He told me how the neighborhood had been rebuilt despite the unexploded bombs still beneath the rubble He took me to meet Nguyen Thi Mao widow of a militiaman she said was killed by the American bombs She had taken her three children out of the city to safety Now tears came to her eyes as she talked but she said the war is receding into the past Because my husband was a war hero the Government gave me food I could feed my children and they got a good education As we talked on a low wooden bench behind the bright cotton shirts and dresses she sold to help make a living I asked her how she felt about having an American visit her in her home You look very kind she said I was once very angry at the Americans but now I hope they do not launch any more wars against us When my Foreign Ministry interpreter and I flew from Hanoi to Da Nang in what had been South Vietnam it was almost like crossing into a foreign country with border guards examining my passport and the interpreters identity papers at both airports We were to go in a Volga sedan up the coast to Hue and stay overnight before continuing north the next morning I wanted to go back to Quang Tri City which I had last seen on the day of the ceasefire of Jan 28 1973 Then it was a ruined expanse of bomb craters shattered bricks and pieces of metal and dead bodies Ten years later riding up the beautiful coastal highway from Da Nang I wondered what if anything would be left of the most devastated city in the south On the surface the reconstruction and rehabilitation in the port city of Da Nang and in the fishing hamlets along the way to the former Imperial capital at Hue had been impressive Peasants were planting and harvesting rice in fields irrigated by newly built canals The narrowgauge railroad had been rebuilt and was now transporting passengers and freight behind Czechbuilt diesel locomotives a sight I had never seen during the war New homes even new Buddhist temples had been built along the road Only stones were left where American bases had stood  Camp Eagle home of the 101st Airborne Division the military airfield at Phu Bai just south of Hue the former Marine and Army base outside Quang Tri We turned down a dirt road that led to Quang Tri City Somehow that bleak moonscape of rubble had been resettled and rebuilt with cement and brick houses A theater was under construction as well as a district bank Only a small area was empty where there were still too many unexploded bombs in the ground to make habitation possible the officials said It was hardly grand but it was life in a place from which I thought human beings had been driven forever After the decay and paralysis of Hanoi this reconstruction was amazing We crossed a new bridge to the other side of the river where I had watched the North Vietnamese raise their flags on the ceasefire day a decade ago and continued north to the village of Dong Ha My first visit to Dong Ha was in 1968 I was in the Navy writing press releases about coastal bombardment by the ships of the Seventh Fleet then including the battleship USS New Jersey whose 16inch guns fired 2700pound projectiles The Marine base I had visited in my Navy days was gone but there was a brandnew railroad depot and a comfortable Government guest house where I was received by Duong Tu Anh like me a 40yearold veteran of the war Mr Anh remembered the Seventh Fleet with horror I saw that bombardment with my own eyes he said and that was the worst year I decided to keep quiet After the Americans were gone the Vietnam 2nd Jump North Vietnamese swept south and seized Dong Ha in 1972 and they held it despite attacks from B52s at least as severe as those at Quang Tri The South Vietnamese generals said the land was 200 percent destroyed Mr Anh said on top and underground Mr Anh said that more than 2000 people had been injured or killed by buried bombs in his district since 1975 For all of the surrounding province which has a population of 18 million there had been 5000 such casualties according to the authorities I was later taken to a pepper farm established in the mountains to the west of Dong Ha on the site of an American artillery position known as Hill 241 It was a collective like most of the rice and vegetable farms set up in central Vietnam since reunification the people here were less resistant to the idea of collectivization than the farmers farther south in the Mekong Delta where even today only 20 percent belong to collectives according to officials in Hanoi On this pepper farm one woman carrying fertilizer to the plants asked my interpreter where I came from and laughed when she found out VC she exclaimed pointing to herself Other members of the collective were former South Vietnamese Army soldiers The enterprise sells peppercorns to a stateowned export firm to earn foreign currency The vice director of the farm showed me around and in response to my question said yes someone had recently been killed by a mine in the ground  the 4yearold son of the chairman who on the way to a swimming hole had tripped over a stone and detonated an antipersonnel mine And there is more death in the ground Defoliants including Agent Orange whose contaminants include dioxin which is dangerous even in trace amounts were sprayed over the entire country from 1962 to 1971 According to Pentagon figures the total amount of dioxin dumped on Vietnam may have been at least 375 pounds An international conference in Ho Chi Minh City last January which included Western doctors agreed on this figure despite some feeling among the Vietnamese that it should have been much higher The A Luoi Valley which begins at Dong Ha and extends into the mountain ranges to the southwest was reduced from triplecanopy jungle to grassland by the spraying It is one of the sites where the Vietnamese suspect dioxin and other chemical poisons to be the cause of an increase in birth deformities in children of people exposed to the chemicals In one sprayed village in the Mekong Delta Vietnamese researchers have determined that among exposed subjects the number of pregnancies ending in spontaneous abortions was 4703 percent of the total There are many deformed children here Mr Anh said but I cannot say how many Returning to Hue that afternoon I talked to Nguyen Van Luong the highest official of Binh Tri Thien province and one of the rare Southern guerrillas in a position of authority I was to meet during my brief stay most of the others were North Vietnamese He had been the chairman of the Vietcong organization in the Dong Ha district in the early 1960s During the war he said I took the name Le Viet Huong I understand the Americans promised the people of Dong Ha a fivemillionpiaster reward for my head when I was there I lived underground in a shelter Sometimes I would hear noises above during the day And at night when I came out I would ask my friends who had been up there Green Berets they said They used long sticks to probe the shelter but they never found me The Phoenix program run under American auspices during the war specifically targeted Vietcong leaders for assassination Luong waxed nostalgic about the war years though he was wounded three times When I was in the jungle I used to go fishing and wed have picnics I had all my belongings in a backpack I could go anywhere When the Americans launched sweeps to find us wed just withdraw and return after theyd gone The Americans who were against the war in Vietnam share in our victory he went on We have suffered the worst war in modern history from 1941 to 1975 Now we are at peace despite the war on our northern border with China Let the Americans know We defeated the Mongols We defeated the French We defeated the Chinese reactionaries supported by the Americans But we know how to distinguish between the Chinese people and the Chinese leaders between the American people and the American authorities As we drove back to Da Nang I was struck by how quiet the countryside was now There was not much traffic and the pavement was being used by the local farmers to dry manioc and cassava and even to thresh rice Military patrols controlled the entrances to the Hai Van pass apparently to guard against an invasion from the sea by the Chinese who hold the Paracel Islands offshore In Da Nang itself the air bases formerly used by the Americans are now used by the Vietnamese Air Force I saw a battery of surfaceto air missiles in an emplacement near the base I had remembered as Marble Mountain Foreign Minister Nguyen Co Thach told me later that they were there primarily to repel any possible Chinese air attack Three Communist journalists I was taken to meet in Da Nang told me there were 110000 former South Vietnamese soldiers and their families living among them  like equals they claimed no grudges held no scores settled no secondclass status On my last day in Da Nang one of my escorts took me aside and revealed that he had been in the South Vietnamese Army and that he would leave the country and move to the United States if he could His background limited him to a lowpaying job here and would as long as he lived Not enough to eat here he said We flew to Ho Chi Minh City  Saigon  on a Sovietbuilt Antonov turboprop plane If Hanoi had been untouched for 30 or 40 years Ho Chi Minh City looked precisely the way it had in 1973 when I was last there except that the streets were far less congested The Majestic Hotel on the riverfront had the same fly specked 1950svintage Pan American World Airways pictures on its walls though the hotel was now called the Cuu Long and was state owned Many of the restaurants I had remembered from the past were still functioning Givrals the French patisserie was still baking croissants The bars that had lined the downtown streets when the Americans were there had been shut or converted into antique shops On Dong Khoi General Uprising Street Tu Do to the Americans Rue Catinat to the French beggar urchins were selling peanuts and yelling Hey you just as they used to when the Americans were there But now these were not Vietnamese beggars I saw with stunned sorrow that many of them had strikingly American faces  the young Amerasians whose situation in the country is so desperate I was surprised in Ho Chi Minh City as I had been in Hanoi by what the authorities allowed to go on under their noses The first few times I left the hotel alone and tried to make my way up the street I was attacked by money changers offering 170 180 dong to the dollar about 20 times the official rate and the Amerasian children followed me all the way to the cathedral asking for handouts Other days the sidewalk was completely clear the street people eyeing me nervously from across the road apparently after a police sweep a few hours later the parasites and black marketeers were back at their usual positions Only once was I made aware of being followed by a plainclothes policeman He gave a dirty look to a small Amerasian boy who had been pestering me to buy him a shirt the kid then whispered to me CID the American GIs code for Military Police narcotics detectives I felt and was warned that the only possible purpose he could have in following me was to report on any Vietnamese I spoke with Vietnam 3rd JUMP I tried to challenge this prohibition twice The first man I visited a person with relatives in the United States who had applied for permission to leave Vietnam to join them welcomed me to his house in a rainstorm but nervously looked out the door and after 10 minutes asked me to please leave before the police came Apparently he feared a search and interrogation about my presence I went next door to a restaurant and two plainclothes agents were pointed out to me When I left at the nervous urging of the restaurant owner they did not follow me and I assumed my host was getting the questioning he feared He wrote later to his family through the censored mail that he was grateful for my visit The second time visiting a widow whose husband had been the night watchman in The Timess office my presence caused such a sensation among the hordes of excited children in the neighborhood that I left her after only a few minutes hoping to avoid the arrival of the police She too hoped somehow to emigrate to the United States Ho Chi Minh City I felt at moments like this was still an occupied city occupied by the Communist Northerners who run the country and still dont trust the Southern Vietnamese for collaborating with us But according to Nguyen Co Thach the Foreign Minister there was no bloodbath We had 15 million people in reeducation camps and 10000 of them are still there now But not one of them was killed in capital punishment Thats no good Perhaps he and Pham Van Dong and Vo Nguyen Giap the North Vietnamese commander who won the war and the others had seen enough blood and death to reject the idea of a purge Stalin would have known how to reeducate these people and no one would ever have come back He would have known how to stop the black market and how to get the jobless off the streets of Ho Chi Minh City too Pol Pot in Cambodia and not Ho Chi Minhs successors in Vietnam had turned out to be the last true Stalinist in Asia contrary to all American expectations during the war True the bloodbath never came But another kind of death  of any hope of a decent life here under the new regime  does drive many of the Vietnamese to try to leave When or whether those who apply will get exit visas is hard to tell Through the Orderly Departure Program set up under the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees in 1979 Vietnamese who can get permission from their Government to leave and from some other country to let them in are allowed to leave Mr Tuyen told me that so far the Vietnamese had granted 18000 exit visas to people wanting to go to the United States under the program but up to the time I talked to him in September only 12200 according to American officials had been given permission to enter the country Mr Tuyen acknowledged that his office had received 32500 applications from Ho Chi Minh City alone  equal to the total number of people who have been allowed out under the program since it began There has been a gradual and steady decline in illegal departures which have totaled about one million since 1975 apparently because refugees have been refused entry in many places For example boat people arriving in Hong Kong now must choose between moving on to another port or spending the rest of their lives in a closed refugee camp The Communists explain that these people want to leave because they grew accustomed to artificially high living standards during the American occupation But I suspect the real reason is that in Vietnam they simply have no future Take the case of a young man who had been studying medicine in Saigon when he was drafted into the South Vietnamese Army in the early 1970s After the defeat he was no longer eligible to continue his medical studies because he had been drafted into the wrong army His mother was killed in the war with the French in 195l his father was killed in fighting with the United States Marines in 1967 but for being in the wrong place at the wrong time he was now consigned to a life as a tourbus driver at 130 dong a month Ly Cong Chanh a former official of the Provisional Revolutionary Government who is now vice chairman of the Ho Chi Minh City Peoples Committee told me that there were still more than 200000 people without jobs I met one foreign resident of the city who thought the real figure was much higher as much as 60 percent of the work force Mr Chanh sounded resigned More than 700000 people left the city for new economic zones or for their native villages after liberation he said but about 10000 of them couldnt survive in the zones and came back We tell them that if they stay here theyll get no house and no job but we dont move them out to the countryside by force If we did theyd just come back again Its no use he said I asked to see one of the new economic zones and was taken to a sugarcane farm called Nhi Xuan not far from Ho Chi Minh City in what used to be an artillery free fire zone during the war It was obviously meant to be a showcase the guest book showed a parade of foreign dignitaries including a number of predictably enthusiastic Russians Still it was very poor a line of tinroofed wooden shacks along an irrigation canal packed earth floors no electricity or potable water except rainwater from earthenware cisterns The people grew their own food and collected rations  a pound of meat and a pound of fish per month per family some people raised chickens or geese This was a model zone built by youth volunteers who dug the canals turned the sod and built the houses for the refugees who came later I gathered from various conversations that many of these volunteers were renegades or former soldiers or drug addicts given a chance to atone for their misdeeds and find a better life after two or three years of hard work The families who came to live and work on the farm I was told got their houses free and an allowance of 20000 dong to get started Mr Chanh talking to me later in the ornate 19thcentury city hall in Ho Chi Minh City told me the authorities hoped gradually to solve the problem of unemployment there by putting people to work on the few nearby industrial development projects  a rubber plantation a hydroelectric dam the oil exploration project being worked on with Russian help at the former beach resort of Vung Tau But for the most part the economy of Ho Chi Minh City is still based on small scale trading and commerce a service economy built up during the boom years whe
500000 GIs were there  200000 households in Saigon still earn their living this way today according to official Vietnamese statistics Were trying to reduce them little by little and transform them from trading to production Mr Chanh said We have to do this step by step Fits and starts might be a more accurate description of Vietnamese economic policy since 1975 At first pledging a gradual transition to socialism the new Communist rulers left the farmers and merchants of the South alone Then in March 1978 the bigger trading firms many owned by Chinese businessmen from Cholon were closed and nationalized The course was partly reversed again in late 1979 to avert a complete economic collapse The latest measures instituted last May penalize small businesses with heavy taxes We have had a lot of experience in war Mr Chanh said but not in administering the affairs of a big city like this We have made many mistakes I am 59 and Mai Chi Tho the chairman of the city committee is 60 We have to train our successors so they wont make the mistakes we made The mistakes have alienated many South Vietnamese who welcomed the Communist victory in 1975 A few like Ngo Ba Thanh a professor educated in Paris and New York who spent years in jail during the rule of President Nguyen Van Thieu try to bridge the gaps in understanding Most of the mistakes that have been made are the result of trying to move too fast she said speaking in a rush of fluent English And there are great differences between the North and the South I tell the people in the party that the revolution would not have been won with the party alone The people played a great role and must be allowed to continue to play a great role The party authorities sometimes claim that they can do anything they want even if it violates the laws on the books because in our system the party plays the leading role But its more complicated than that Pham Van Dong told me that I had to be very patient she said He pointed out to me this Cabinet minister who was a rice farmer 40 years ago and that one who had been illiterate and said I should give these people a chance should be tolerant of their mistakes She also said she did not agree with many of her friends in the South who complained about not having a big enough role in the Government We in the South have lots of experience in overthrowing governments she said with a laugh not in making them run better Other people in the South Vietnamese educated class arent as optimistic as Mrs Thanh or as well treated and many who hated the Thieu regime now say they were wrong to think that nothing could be worse than the corruption and repression of that period The Thieu Government collapsed because its leaders were unworthy of the name a former student told me But now many people who were glad to see it go feel that the new Government isnt so gay either Theyve lost their illusions They dont like having to apply to the ward committee and pay a bribe even to get permission to go visit their relatives in the Mekong Delta for a week But they still delude themselves A lot of them talk about how the Americans are going to land with helicopters and sweep the Communists away The Americans  imagine I asked if people blamed the United States for the defeat  as some Americans blame themselves for not providing Thieu with enough military aid to fight off the Communist advances I dont blame the Americans at all he said They gave plenty of money and help and it wasnt their fault that our generals and leaders couldnt put it to proper use It is our country It was ours to defend  we should have defended it ourselves That is precisely why the Communists won I said  they really believed it He shrugged Its true he said Ho Chi Minhs saying There is nothing more precious than independence and freedom now stands above nearly every door in Vietnam Many people in the South put it there in the last days of April 1975 hoping to show the Communists their hearts were in the right place Even with all the help they have from the Russians I concluded the Vietnamese have independence but freedom no not now Many of the Communist war veterans I had met in my twoweek trip had emotionally expressed their wishes for peace for their children my children all our children together We were veterans of the same war and we felt strange as it may seem a sense of shared responsibility for what we had done to each other Perhaps eventually passions will cool and we will like the French before us extend the hand of aid and conciliation to this fiercely independent xenophobic people The only flight out of Saigon to the West is an Air France jumbo jet that arrives practically empty from Paris via Bangkok every Thursday and goes back full of refugees For the first time in my experience in Communist countries my Vietnamese hosts let me take pictures in the airport as I interviewed those who were leaving Finally when the shuttle bus pulled out their relatives shrieked their names desperately from the observation platform There was nervous tension among these people as we went through yet another ticket check on the gangway they would not believe they were really leaving until the plane started rolling down the runway But as the doors were sealed and the engines began turning I looked back into the cabin and saw that it would be impossible to continue interviewing them Their native land was rushing past the windows and tears were streaming down their faces and so there was no need to ask any more questions,,

POPE TELLS U.S. BISHOPS: FIGHT DISSENT ON SEXUALITY,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/10/31/world/pope-tells-us-bishops-fight-dissent-on-sexuality.html,Pope John Paul II has been talking to a steady stream of Roman Catholic bishops from the United States since late summer and his principal message has been unmistakable The bishops must more effectively proclaim church teachings on sexuality that American Catholics have increasingly rejected The bishops paying their periodic calls at the Vatican have met with the Pope in groups over meals in the papal apartments and in private audiences Much of what they have heard from John Paul is about instilling greater loyalty to Catholic moral doctrine While some bishops welcomed the reminder others are chafing at it Most bishops regard the experience along with other recent moves to examine sections of the American church as indicating heightened strain between the Vatican and a vigorous American Catholicism that has shown growing signs of dissent These impressions are gained from interviews with more than a dozen key bishops in the last month They are among the approximately 300 American bishops almost all of whom are expected to visit the Pope this year John Paul like some popes before him has worried about the impact of a democratic society on a church that claims hierarchical authority Issues Seen as Testing Ground In many respects American Catholics attitudes on issues related to sexuality have become the testing ground for a struggle by the Pope to keep the countrys 50 million laymen and laywomen firmly in the fold The alternative seen by many Vatican officials is that American Catholicism will attain even more of a character of its own becoming semiautonomous The Pope has addressed several groups of bishops on their duty as teachers to clearly expound the churchs opposition to artificial birth control abortion divorce and remarriage and premarital sex He has also emphatically told them not to encourage advocates of ordaining women The Vatican decreed in 1976 that women could never be priests American Catholics have expressed rising disagreement regarding every subject on that list Polls show consistently that an overwhelming majority of Catholics approve of artificial contraception They increasingly divorce and remarry outside the church and believe in large numbers that abortion should be left to personal decision Archbishop John R Roach of Minneapolis president of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops reads the Popes message as a helpful challenge It is wrong to think that rambunctious American bishops are getting slapped down by a stern Pope Archbishop Roach said during the World Synod of Bishops which ended Saturday He is saying that there are issues he deeply cares about and he wants to work with us on them Many bishops believe that the Pope especially wants the American church to become a model of fidelity to authority because of its strategic position within an international superpower and its financial strength Ample evidence indicates that John Paul believes the American branch of the church has failed to set a proper example In his visit to the United States in 1979 a year after he became Pope he was already expressing deep misgivings about the moral freedom fostered by American affluence and permissiveness Calling for a return to moral discipline the Pope took material from the bishops own statements to buttress his appeal Orders Inquiry Into Seminaries In addition to repeating these themes to the bishops visiting him here the Pope has recently approved other actions that many American Catholics regard as corrective and possibly punitive This year the Vatican announced that American seminaries and religious orders would be examined to determine their soundness Some seminary officials believe the study is aimed partly at excluding the growing number of women among seminary teachers and students Many nuns reacted with similar anxiety to the directive to investigate religious orders The Pope has indicated he is dissatisfied with some of the liberalization in womens orders Most bishops have tried to assuage these fears by saying the Vatican is only trying to be helpful But many bishops themselves are uneasy over the Popes insistence on orthodoxy Stoking that anxiety was the news last week that the Pope had sent Archbishop James A Hickey of Washington DC to look into criticism of Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen of Seattle an outspoken opponent of nuclear arms who has withheld part of his income tax in protest Sending one bishop to report on another is unusual and for some bishops chilling 2 Archbishoprics Vacant The extent of the Popes disapproval of what he considers liberal tendencies in the American hierarchy could be indicated in his coming appointments to key posts The deaths of Humberto Cardinal Medeiros of Boston and Terence Cardinal Cooke of New York leave vacancies in powerful archdioceses In addition John Cardinal Krol of Philadelphia and Timothy Cardinal Manning of Los Angeles are expected to retire within the next year or two American bishops often find themselves caught between their flocks which exhibit vibrant if unconventional ways of adapting Catholicism to American experience and a Pope whose demands for conformity grow out of his years in a besieged Polish church that relied on a united front Many bishops say the Vatican does not understand their problems or their responses to them Most of the problems are regarded as resulting from basic demographic and social changes among American Roman Catholics A few decades ago American Catholicism was largely an immigrant church dependent on the Vatican and highly disposed to do its bidding Since then Catholics in America have entered the mainstream of economic and social life acquiring more of American pluralism and freedom of thought The Rev Carl Peter the head of the Department of Religious Studies at Catholic University in Washington says these changes have brought about an awkward period right now on both sides of the Atlantic He says Catholic leaders are in that difficult position of trying to bring as much unity as they can not compromising Catholic doctrine but taking a pastoral attitude of taking people where they are Avoiding Antagonism Stressed Many priests faced with parishioners who disregard some of the churchs moral stands have avoided further antagonism by playing these issues down or trying to present them in a more palatable manner Some bishops have taken the Popes recent counsel as an incentive to try harder to underscore Catholic morality without generating hostility He is saying basically that we must fulfill our roles with integrity said Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago In the most credible way we can we must try to elicit assent not dissent Has he lost confidence in us Cardinal Bernardin asks I think not Rather he has taken a real interest in us because of the importance of the church in the United States Archbishop Roach said Weve got to face the fact that we are at a new point in history  good but painful It is one in which the Holy Father is literally testing the collegiality of our episcopal conference Hes saying Youre a big powerful church and you have influence far beyond the point you realize He is calling us to the high road to be the best kind of bishops we can be in our time The present stress between the Pope and the Americans stems in part from new definitions of church power introduced by the Second Vatican Council held from 1962 to 1965 From the council emerged the concept of regional conferences of bishops that would meet regularly and make pronouncements on problems within their jurisdiction As the conferences have grown they have inevitably weakened the Vaticans strength somewhat Letter on Atom Arms Cited In the United States the National Conference of Catholic Bishops has become a sounding board for the aspirations and strains of the church in America Its most farreaching venture was the drafting of a pastoral letter on war and peace that condemned nuclear arms but accepted the concept of a limited nuclear deterrent The Vatican raised questions about drafts of the letter and the bishops responded satisfactorily But the letter was clearly the creation of the bishops and according to Archbishop Roach raised their confidence in their ability to handle delicate issues In their visits to Rome the Pope has indicated his approval of the final letter one sign that his criticism is limited The Popes challenge on other issues has presented the Americans with either an opportunity or a threat depending on the particular viewpoint of the bishops and students of American Catholicism We are in the United States a very distinct truly Roman Catholic Church not like any other because our country is unique Father Peter said We are distinctive just as the US experience is distinctive How Much Special Character The exchanges with the bishops are a key element in testing how much special character the Pope can accept in the American church Cardinal Bernardin is among those who think both sides stand to gain from a frank discussion of the differences Some bishops said their visits with the Pope were like talks at a retreat and a real shot in the arm as Archbishop Patrick F Flores of San Antonio put it Others voiced frustration One bishop who asked that he not be identified recalled a visit that he and some colleagues made to Silvio Cardinal Oddi prefect for the Sacred Congregation of Clergy One of the bishops raised the issue of a ban against the use of altar girls explaining that it was painful for him to tell a 9yearold girl that she could not serve while a boy the same age could The bishop said this was an agonizing situation faced by many pastors Cardinal Oddi reached behind his chair for a book of canon law Pointing to the appropriate article he replied Just show them that its impossible
SOCIAL SPENDING BILL IS SIGNED,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/01/us/social-spending-bill-is-signed.html,President Reagan signed a huge money bill today for social programs that exceeds his requests by more than 9 billion The President invited key members of Congress to witness his signing of a 1044 billion appropriations bill that is a landmark not so much for what it does but because it passed Its passage 11 days ago marked the first time in five years that Congress has been able to send the President a formal appropriations bill for the Departments of Health and Human Services Education and Labor The measure provides an increase of 4779 million in overall program financing from the fiscal year 1983 which ended Sept 30 Previous efforts to pass an appropriations measure have been frustrated by fights such as over Federal financing of abortions for women on welfare Programs covered by the bill have operated under temporary stopgap financing bills since 1978 Among the newest provisions of the bill is the addition of 41 million for research on acquired immune deficiency syndrome the disease known as AIDS The measure contains what has become an accepted ban on the use of Federal money to pay for abortions except where a womans life is in danger The bill also prohibits the withholding of any Federal funds for use in the courtordered desegregation of Chicagos public schools and bars the use of Federal money to block school prayer or periods of meditation
Economic Scene; Silly Season Is Longer Now,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/02/business/economic-scene-silly-season-is-longer-now.html,THESE are days when great financial institutions developing countries the International Monetary Fund and even the United States Treasury are digging deep into their pockets and coming up with nothing much besides a few paper clips and old subway tokens The Treasury which still has a little real money hidden away in pots and under the carpet is desperately waiting for Congress to raise the ceiling on the national debt to 1614 billion so that it can borrow a lot more money The House of Representatives has passed the debtlimit bill but the Senate is in no particular hurry Some Senators are holding the debtlimit bill for ransom by attaching amendments on everything from national defense to abortion while others are delaying action to remind the country of the depth of President Reagans deficits The Government has just run a record deficit of 195 billion in the fiscal year 1983 and is likely to run another of 200 billion in the fiscal year 1984 As military expenditures rise faster than expected and Congress fails to enact tax increases in line with its own budget resolution  with President Reagan holding out for no tax increases at all  deficits in excess of 200 billion loom for 1985 and 1986 That Congress has essentially gone along with the Presidents spending and tax programs making the deficits inevitable does not deter those legislators who are balking at raising the debt ceiling as an exercise in antiAdministration propaganda But this is rather expensive propaganda Treasury Secretary Donald T Regan told Congress yesterday that trying to discipline the Administration this way was a bad idea because it was forcing the Government to live on a handto mouth basis To stay within the current debt ceiling of 1389 billion Secretary Regan has already suspended sales of United States Savings Bonds put off sales of special nonmarketable Treasury securities invested only 4 billion of a scheduled 13 billion of Social Security trust funds postponed issuance of threeyear Treasury notes rescheduled 52week Treasury bills and is getting ready to cancel or delay other debt flotations until he runs out of strategems and money Once the disarray created by a failure of Congress to raise the debt ceiling would have been over in a matter of hours For until last May there was a socalled permanent debt ceiling of 400 billion and every temporary increase above that had an expiration date after which the ceiling reverted to the permanent level Thus at the end of the fiscal year 1981 when the gross Federal debt reached 1004 billion if Congress had not raised the debt ceiling it would have reverted to 400 billion and the United States Government would have had to default almost immediately on more than 600 billion of its debt Since Congress obviously could not let that happen it would promptly after a small number of excoriating speeches vote an increase in the debt limit before the Government went broke But now the Government can refinance outstanding debt as it comes due up to the current limit of 1389 billion And with some 25 billion in cash still lying around the house  despite the huge projected fiscal year 1984 deficit  the Treasury can keep paying the bills for GIs in Grenada or Social Security benefits and other things for another couple of weeks or so before it bumps up against the debt limit That creates the opportunity to keep the securities markets in a state of utter confusion for at least two weeks longer Secretary Regan would like to end the confusion now Yesterday in addition to telling Congress that the Government was living on a handto mouth basis he scolded the legislators for creating uncertainty in the financial markets He said those who thought refusing to raise the debt limit would contribute to fiscal responsibility were not solving a problem but creating one Indeed the uncertainty is driving down prices of Government securities and driving up interest rates This not only increases the cost of financing the deficit and the deficit itself  interest on the debt already exceeds 100 billion a year  but by pushing up interest rates may slow the recovery in the United States increase the value of the dollar hurt exports and aggravate the economic and debtrepayment problems of countries abroad Meanwhile Congress is still holding up the 84 billion authorization for the International Monetary Fund intensifying the problems of the developing countries and the banks President Reagan has written a letter praising the Democrats for supporting his IMF legislation  appeasing them for a Republican attack on 20 Democrats as friends of Communism  and a compromise appears to be in the works on a housing and community development bill demanded by some Democrats to clear the way for the IMF bill But this too will pass The silly season just seems to be lasting longer than it used to It could well last until November 1984

KEEPING UP WITH THE GENETIC REVOLUTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/magazine/keeping-up-with-the-genetic-revolution.html,THE LOS ALAMOS NATIONAL Laboratory in New Mexico biophysicist Walter Goad punches a few keys on a computer terminal Moments later glowing green type illuminates the monitor in front of him ATGGCTACAGGTAAG     begins the message which goes on and on for almost 2000 repetitions of A T C and G Dr Goad director of the Governmentsponsored Genetic Sequence Data Bank known as GenBank can read the cryptic language easily It is an example of the genetic code this particular procession of characters being the recipe for making a specific protein the hormone that controls human growth It will probably take more than three billion characters to encode in this way all the chemicals in the body One day Dr Goad hopes the complete recipe for a human being will be revealed Mans entire hereditary code should fit on 30 high density magnetic tapes taking up less than a fourfoot bookshelf Equipped with the tools of molecular biology scientists like Dr Goad are participating in an intense study of the genetic basis of human life racing to unscramble the detailed structure and position of all the genes on mans 46 chromosomes The major aims are to uncover how these genes are switched on and off to promote normal development and to learn just what goes wrong when disease ensues In one experiment for example researchers are trying to understand the functions of human genes by implanting them in the nucleus of a mouse embryo See the photograph on the cover By studying how these genes alter the characteristics of the newborn animal they hope to unravel the fundamental mechanisms of genetic control OF THE ESTIMATED 100000 GENES found tucked up inside a human cell some 800 have now been tracked to their chromosomal locations with new genes being mapped at a rate of 200 per year According to Dr Frank Ruddle professor of biology and human genetics at Yale University this rate will accelerate exponentially over the next few years so that by the turn of the century the major outline of the human gene map should be known It will probably take several decades more before Walter Goads genetic bookshelf is realized but already the molecular cartography of animal and human genes heralds startling advances in health care Vaccines Last month scientists of the New York State Health Department announced they had used the manipulation of genetic material  genetic engineering as it is commonly called  to develop vaccines that protect rabbits against hepatitis and mice against a type of herpes They held out hope that tests could begin in three years or so on similar vaccines that might protect humans from the same afflictions In the same week a New York City team announced it had isolated the gene for a substance that may cause toxic shock syndrome A vaccine to guard against that condition too might possibly result Early warning for adult diseases In the brief interim since the genetic origins of many cancers first came to light scientists have succeeded in isolating specific snippets of genetic material that may predispose individuals to heart disease and emphysema Medical sleuths are now hot on the trail of genes that have emerged as likely culprits in diabetes allergies peptic ulcers and other common diseases of midlife a trend that may shift the central thrust of medicine from treatment to prevention Understanding the basis of inherited diseases The blood disorders sicklecell anemia and beta thalassemia and over a dozen other hereditary diseases have now been traced to specific spelling errors in the genetic code shedding new light on the underlying causes of hereditary afflictions Prenatal screening Old limitations of prenatal diagnosis are being overcome by new techniques that enable clinicians to analyze directly the genetic makeup of developing fetuses By the late l980s experts predict these methods will permit fetuses to be screened early in pregnancy for such lethal hereditary diseases as cystic fibrosis muscular dystrophy and Huntingtons chorea Therapy Within the last year doctors at the National Institutes of Health in Washington reported using a revolutionary gene therapy to ease the effects of two hereditary blood disorders a historical first that suggests that the power to alter our biological destinies may be fast approaching Natural drugs Genetic formulas are being used increasingly by the pharmaceutical industry to prepare potent natuPage 45 ral medicines never before available for routine clinical use Along with the anticipated benefits however has come a barrage of worries and uncertainties including the familiar questions about just where all the groundbreaking research is leading Of all the ethical dilemmas raised by genetic science none is more pervasive than the publics fear that we may soon be tempted to play God Last June a group of 64 religious leaders and several prominent scientists asked Congress to ban experiments that could alter mans inheritable traits The question of when or if it is morally acceptable to modify human genes is certain to remain the focus of debate well into the next century Within medical circles meanwhile there is concern that people may come to expect too much too soon Specialists point out that the age of genetic discovery is still in its infancy major obstacles will have to be overcome before our newfound knowledge is translated into treatments and other useful applications Others observe that advances in genetic science may tend to confirm belief in mans fate and lack of free will THE CENTER OF ALL THESE advances and concerns is of course the long chainlike molecule known as deoxyribonucleic acid DNA found bundled up inside each cells chromosomes The DNA chain is made up of chemical subunits groups of atoms known as nucleotide bases See illustration on page 42 A string of thousands or more of these comprises a gene What matters about these nucleotide bases it turns out is their exact sequence along the backbone of the DNA molecule The chemicals arrangement can be likened to a genetic Morse code that uses four nucleotide bases  denoted by the letters A adenine T thymine C cytosine and G guanine  in place of dots and dashes This simple alphabet spells out all the instructions the body needs for manufacturing proteins the key administrators of the processes of life Genes by providing a blueprint for protein production ultimately determine why a man is unlike a mouse or a moose or any other species on earth  and why an individual man or woman is unlike any other man or woman on earth Not long ago the messages encoded in DNA were considered inscrutable But the picture changed drastically when genetic engineering provided the instruments to dissect mans DNA Using chemical catalysts known as enzymes to break molecular bonds and thereby cut the DNA into gene sized segments molecular biologists could begin to ascertain the order of the As Ts Cs and Gs  a process known as sequencing And once deciphered the formulas could be used to reconstruct genes synthetically in the laboratory from organic chemicals From GenBank and other DNA repositories around the globe researchers can now call up the recipes for dozens of vital body proteins Then by manufacturing the genes synthetically and splicing them into fastgrowing bacteria cells the scientists can induce the cells to churn out prodigious amounts of human chemicals The first genetically engineered protein or natural drug to reach the marketplace was Eli Lillys human insulin Humulin introduced earlier this year It will soon be followed by Genentechs human growth hormone for the treatment of hypopituitary dwarfism In the next two years still other drug manufacturers plan to market a bloodclotting factor for the treatment of hemophilia and the antiviral compound interferon which may also be applied to certain cancers Data banks also list the genetic codes for many other intriguing body and animal substances that may soon be targeted for commercial production These include a dozen variants of interferon encephalins the brains natural painkillers key components of the bodys immune system and protein components of microorganisms that may be used in the manufacture of vaccines against hepatitis B genital herpes toxic shock syndrome and other microbial infections But as Dr Goad likes to point out todays computerized catalogues offer only a glimpse of what is to come Of the 50000 proteins exclusive of antibodies synthesized by the body less than 2 percent have been identified As the sequencing of human genes progresses it should be possible to grow many more rare proteins outside of the body and for the first time obtain large enough quantities to test their medical properties DNA SEQUENCING IS ALSO HELPING TO UNCOVER the underlying causes of many disorders including diseases not normally thought of as hereditary because of their late onset In this way genetic data can enable doctors to identify individuals who are most likely to succumb to specific ailments For example a team at the Baylor College of Medicine in Houston recently uncovered a mutation that can dramatically increase susceptibility to emphysema in adults What prompted their search was an earlier epidemiological study that showed that people who develop emphysema often have insufficient amounts of a lungprotecting protein Using radioactive probes they were able to extract some of this protein from a patients cell at a stage when it was still attached to the gene that controlled its production Once the key gene was isolated the sequence of its nucleotide bases could be determined and surprisingly the patients gene was found to differ from a normal one by only a single changed letter in the hereditary code This abnormality known as a point mutation turns out to be most prevalent among people of Northern European ancestry In this population it is estimated that one out of every 2000 persons will be afflicted with emphysema often dying within a few years after the first symptoms appear An individual who knows he has the genetic abnormality can be extra cautious The Baylor team leader Savio Woo says The onset of emphysema can be delayed by as much as 30 years if the persons condition is not irritated by cigarette smoke or polluted air More recently Dr Michael S Brown and Dr Joseph L Goldstein geneticists at the University of Texas Health Science Center in Dallas used a similar approach to pinpoint several mutations that underlie one of the leading killers in the United States  hardening of the arteries also known as arteriosclerosis Its an insidious disease that begins in the teenage years says Dr Brown but usually causes no symptoms until middle age when heart attacks begin to occur The faulty gene present in one out of every 500 people interferes with the normal cellular function of absorbing and breaking down excess cholesterol In affected individuals this substance builds up clogging arteries and leading to premature death When scientists learn how various mutations cause the malfunction Dr Brown is confident that much better treatments for arteriosclerosis will follow In fact he says a drug is already being clinically tested Armed with geneticengineering technology medical researchers are also gaining insights into the deeprooted causes of cancer The kernels of the disease appear to lurk within us all and normal cellular genes can quickly be changed into cancercausing agents known as oncogenes from the Greek word onkos  meaning mass At least 18 oncogenes have already been discovered but experts estimate that as many as 50 may underlie all the different forms of cancer Oncogenes are the result of alterations in DNA caused by radiation chemicals certain viruses and other poorly understood factors British and American studies published in the last few months suggest that at least two distinct oncogenes must become activated if cancer is to occur Dr Robert A Weinberg at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology speculates that one oncogene stimulates a cell to grow indefinitely A second acts to allow growth even though the cells normal growth stimulus is lacking Exposure to chemicals or radiation is not however the whole story of cancerproducing genetic change Dr Jorge J Yunis a geneticist at the University of Minnesota Medical School in Minneapolis who has introduced innovative techniques for studying the detailed structure of chromosomes reports that some individuals are born with brittle DNA The molecules contain regions that are unstable and prone to breakage If the fragile site is in the neighborhood of an oncogene the persons risk of contracting cancer is probably heightened Dr Yunis has positively linked at least eight leukemias and non Hodgkins lymphomas to brittle DNA In all likelihood he says a combination of internal and external factors sets the stage for tumor formation For example the chemicals in tobacco frequently do damage to the short arm of chromosome number 3 so anyone with an inborn weakness in this area should stay away from cigarettes if they dont want to get lung cancer Along with academic institutions many pharmaceutical companies and biotechnology firms are launching major research projects to pursue these findings A common aim is to silence oncogenes by drugs or other means or at least to deactivate the genes protein products Although no one expects to find any cures in the near future there is widespread optimism that these quantum jumps in understanding the disease will speed progress toward the goal The discovery of oncogenes declares Frank J Rauscher Jr senior vice president for research at the American Cancer Society is unquestionably the single greatest breakthrough in all our years of cancer research There is another group of genes that can bode ill Found on chromosome number 6 these genes determine the precise configuration of the human leukocyte antigen HLA system  a chemical fingerprint etched on the outside of all the cells in the body This molecular monogram permits the immune system to distinguish self from all foreign matter and was initially of greatest interest to transplant surgeons seeking to match the tissues of an organ donor with a recipient But in recent years immunologists have begun to discern a statistical correlation between genes in the HLA system and certain illnesses For reasons that are still not entirely clear the genes can sometimes be prognosticators of disease Take for example the HLA gene referred to as B27 It is present in 95 percent of all people with ankylosing spondylitis a chronic arthritis of the lower spine common in adult men Roughly one in every four males with B27 eventually develops back problems ranging from minor aches and pains to full blown symptoms of arthritis Or consider the HLA D7 gene While it is represented in 15 percent of the normal population it is found in almost 75 percent of the victims of multiple sclerosis In addition HLA genes have been more loosely associated with some 75 other disorders including hay fever lupus juvenile onset diabetes and chronic active hepatitis Researchers stress that most of these correlations are too low to be of much predictive value But as HLA data is added to our increasing knowledge of oncogenes brittle DNA and other genetic abnormalities sciences ability to forecast the future may be greatly enhanced It is likely that many more diseases will be detected earlier  or before they even arise In fact there no longer seem to be any insurmountable obstacles to screening fetuses for predilections of diseases that strike in early adulthood or even later in life The ability to spot health risks far in advance of symptoms represents the latest advance in genetic screening a practice that got its biggest boost in the early 1970s with the introduction of amniocentesis This technique usually carried out in the fifth month of pregnancy entails inserting a syringe into the mothers womb to withdraw fetal cells that have been shed into the amniotic fluid These are then subjected to a battery of tests Today amniocentesis is frequently done in conjunction with ultrasonagraphy  a method of acquiring a description of the developing embryo by using sound waves Together these two approaches permit the detection of more than 190 chromosomal aberrations and hereditary disorders within the first 20 weeks of life As impressive as these advances have been countless mutations continue to go undiagnosed in fetuses because they can be revealed only through a careful analysis of the finer structure of genes In these cases it is not enough to run tests on the biochemical products manufactured by human cells or to examine their chromosomes under a microscope  the standard procedures for detecting trouble The majority of defects in fact are difficult or impossible to uncover unless the DNA itself is analyzed directly It is in this area that recombinant DNA technology promises to make its greatest contribution to genetic screening At the City of Hope National Medical Center in Duarte Calif a research team is creating radioactive probes made of synthetic DNA These can bind themselves in a complementary fashion to DNA extracted from a donors cells If there is a point mutation in the donors DNA point mutations are those instances when only one letter of the genetic code has been altered the radioactive probe will indicate an area of instability at that location The researchers can then be certain that the mutation exists See the illustration on page 43 Some halfdozen probes are now being applied in the prenatal diagnosis of sicklecell anemia a blood disorder that affects many blacks and other inherited blood diseases but this number is expected to double over the coming year As new genes are sequenced says Dr Brenda Conner one of the scientists heading the hospitals new clinical program we can plug the information right in and use it to develop new screening tests Not surprisingly the investigators have recently made oncogenes the target of their probes Will it soon become commonplace to run everyone through a battery of these genetic tests No says Dr Conner Because only a small percentage of the population is at risk for any given disease it just wouldnt be a costeffective form of preventive medicine But if familial history suggests that the illness could occur then it is certainly worth the time and expense The tests are currently available on an experimental basis The price is about 1050 or 300 on top of the 750 usually charged for amniocentesis Still other researchers are working on an alternative method of screening in families with a history of hereditary problems When enzymes cut DNA into pieces fragments called variants are often produced These have been found to indicate the proximity of a defective gene and can be thought of as red flags markers that signify trouble nearby Within three to five years authorities predict they may be able to test for these markers and make prenatal diagnoses of Duchennes muscular dystrophy a wasting disease that afflicts thousands of American males cystic fibrosis the most common lethal hereditary disease Huntingtons chorea a debilitating neurological syndrome and hemophilia the hereditary bloodclotting disorder To detect every genetic disease known to mankind says Dr Arno G Motulsky director of the Center for Inherited Diseases at the University of Washington in Seattle it has been estimated that you would need around 400 variants randomly distributed throughout our chromosomes The beauty of this strategy is that you dont have to know the nucleotide sequence of the defective gene Once a marker is identified in an affected family you should theoretically be able to diagnose the genetic disease regardless of whether or not you understand whats gone awry in the hereditary code Thats a big leap forward Dr Motulsky and others stress that research in this area is still at a preliminary stage no one is about to go into a doctors office for a complete genetic physical Nonetheless a Presidential ethics commission concluded last February that genetic screening and counseling are certain to become major components in both public health and individual medical care by the end of the century In its report the commission noted that a time can already be envisioned when all information about an individuals genetic constitution would be readily accessible The report also urged the medical profession to get ready for a huge demand for screening tests to determine the future health of unborn children and to identify adults who are susceptible to disease or whose offspring may be Dr Motulsky says Diabetes high blood pressure allergies peptic ulcers  these and many other diseases of middle life are now being found to have genetic determinants By finding out what these are we can begin to identify populations at much higher risk for various disorders and then direct preventive measures at these people in a more concentrated way Progress is inevitably accompanied by growing pains  and the development of genetic science is no exception Because of our new found ability to spot disease susceptibilities screening has entered a murky realm governed by statistical probabilities Not surprisingly genetic counselors worry that their warnings of possible future diseases could be misconstrued as inevitable outcomes If so couples might perceive relatively minor risks to the fetus as grounds for abortion Similarly dietary changes exercise and other preventive measures might be abandoned on the assumption that it is futile to fight what is in the genetic cards so to speak The very latest scientific advances could be used to revive the ancient idea of inexorable human destiny Even more troublesome is the potential for outsiders to misuse genetic data It is not inconceivable that insurance companies could demand such information in fixing a customers premium rate Likewise prospective employers could use genetic screening as one means of selecting job applicants According to a survey conducted in 1982 by the Governments Office of Technology Assessment OTA halfadozen major corporations in the United States employ genetic testing to spot employees who are likely to react adversely to toxic substances in the work environment In addition another 59 companies report that they are considering adopting such a policy within the next five years Although this practice is still very limited it has already engendered enormous controversy on two main battlefronts First the validity of the tests has been disputed and in fact none evaluated by the OTA meet established scientific criteria for routine use Secondly labor unions have voiced concern that industry in the name of protecting the worker will only succeed in creating a group of genetically unemployed They fear that corporations rather than cleaning up the work place will be able to shift the burden of blame and responsibility onto the worker by labeling him or her unfit Bluecollar laborers are not the only group who could find themselves denied work as a result of screening technology The upandcoming executive in a highpressure business could be passed over for promotion if identified as someone likely to fall prey to coronary attacks at a young age Because genes are unevenly distributed among people of different sex and ethnic origin there is the additional worry that genetic testing could be used to discriminate against minorities Although it appears that companies have so far tried to offer alternative work to those deemed at risk there have been a few documented cases of women and blacks being refused jobs because of current thinking about hypersusceptibility Unless applied with great care and sensitivity genetic screening could be perceived as a threat to the egalitarian ideals we cherish in a democracy cautions Dr Thomas H Murray of the Hastings Center Institute of Society Ethics and the Life Sciences Until now it has been widely assumed that ability effort and ambition are the three key ingredients for getting ahead in this country So its threatening to think that jobs and other rewards in society might depend on ones genetic fitness After all the one thing we cant alter about ourselves is our genes If youre overweight you can diet If youre a slow reader you can go to Evelyn Wood But if youre genetically unqualified effort cant make up the difference Genetic screening types you in a way that is utterly outside your control For that reason alone it would be wise to proceed cautiously in this area At Yale University Dr Ruddle underscores still another reason to proceed with care Right now he notes our diagnostic ability is outpacing our capacity to treat a whole range of conditions So what good does it do to tell someone that theyre susceptible to a serious disease that can neither be prevented nor cured One might even argue that you were doing that individual more harm than good Of course this line of research should eventually lead to improved therapy but until such time theres apt to be an uncomfortable hiatus Ironically the much more futuristic technology of gene therapy poses by comparison only minor ethical dilemmas Banner headlines notwithstanding the first attempts at transplanting healthy genes to impaired human cells do not represent a radical departure from other therapeutic modalities As Dr Motulsky in Seattle points out So long as the patients sex cells  eggs and sperm  are not modified gene therapy is conceptually no different from other forms of medical intervention such as surgery or drugs where the aim is simply to repair an abnormality Only the individual being treated is actually affected by the manipulation  the genetic alteration will not be passed on to the next generation To date corrective measures have been directed only at hereditary disorders that result from a defect in a single gene This is as far as technical skills have progressed and even in this limited realm immense obstacles remain to be hurdled The first clinical trials were undertaken in the summer of 1980 by Dr Martin J Cline then head of the hematology and oncology division of the department of medicine at the University of California School of Medicine in Los Angeles This early research was a failure on two counts The patients showed no signs of improvement and Dr Cline was heavily censured for failing to get proper authorization for the experiment Dr Clines general research strategy however illustrates one approach to gene therapy that many scientists believe could eventually come into use In Israel Dr Cline attempted to replace the defective genes carried by two victims of beta thalassemia a painful and deforming hereditary blood disorder that usually kills its victims by early adulthood Because red blood cells are manufactured in the bone marrow his strategy was to remove this tissue from the patients thighbones and treat the marrow cells in such a way as to induce them to incorporate copies of the normal gene for hemoglobin This step completed he reimplanted the marrow into the thighbones where he hoped the healthy cells would replicate and replenish the blood supply By the following autumn when the research was heavily publicized it was clear that neither patient had been helped by the operation Investigating the matter both Dr Clines home institution and the National Institutes of Health NIH the major funding body for biomedical research deemed the trial premature in light of insufficient animal studies Dr Clines punishment for his offense was severe He remained at UCLA but lost his chairmanship and close to 200000 in Federal research funding Even if Dr Clines approach eventually becomes successful it will only be applicable to tissues that normally regenerate themselves  such as skin blood and the lining of the intestinal tract Otherwise the genetically engineered cell will not be able to multiply within the body to supplant defective cells with healthy ones The brain for example does not grow after birth so this method offers little hope for victims of such neurological syndromes as TaySachs disease and Huntingtons chorea Ever since Dr Cline was formally censured no other medical researchers have attempted human experiments that pick up where he left off But that is not to imply that gene therapy has come to a standstill In one recent clinical trial a brandnew approach to the treatment of blood disorders yielded exciting results demonstrating that genetic engineering has reached the bedside This latest effort marks a major divergence from treatments based on gene replacement The strategy was inspired by the observation that the body carries a gene that triggers the production of fetal hemoglobin The gene becomes dormant slightly before birth when a second gene for the adult form of hemoglobin takes over its function If the adult hemoglobin gene is faulty it was reasoned perhaps the fetal gene could be reactivated In the last few years research has hinted that a drug called 5azacytidine might be the secret to reawakening the longdormant gene The compound seems to keep DNA free of certain chemical groups that bind to the genetic material and prohibit gene expression At NIH a team of researchers led by Timothy J Ley and Arthur W Nienhuis decided to put the compound to the test selecting three people with beta thalassemia and two with sicklecell anemia for the first trial The result The blood of all five patients showed a striking improvement over the course of the oneweek therapy with the beneficial effects sometimes lasting for up to a month By stirring the fetal hemoglobin genes into action redbloodcell formation was enhanced and anemia reduced It is still too soon to say whether this simple straightforward technique of gene manipulation will live up to its initial promise Although none of the patients developed adverse side effects from the chemotherapy researchers fear that prolonged treatment might heighten the risk of contracting cancer While the ultimate value of this approach can only be ascertained with further tests the preliminary results have been enthusiastically received by the medical profession Almost everyone agrees that genetic surgery remains a distant prospect Yet to a large number of clerical leaders and a handful of scientists the possibility looms large enough on the horizon to pose a serious threat Their fears about the present direction in which gene therapy is headed prompted them to endorse a recent resolution that calls upon Congress to prohibit changes in reproductive cells that control inheritance The rationale behind this action stems from the belief that gene therapy will ultimately lead to gene enhancement if the Government ever tolerates the modification of human eggs sperm or embryos The distinction between the correction and perfection of genetic traits can sometimes blur Seeking the humane goal of eliminating disease and suffering the argument goes we nevertheless may soon find ourselves embarking on a eugenics program and irreversibly altering the human germline for generations to come Moreover the outcome of all this tinkering could be the transformation of man into an entirely new species which may be  to quote the theological letter accompanying the resolution  as different from Homo sapiens as we are to the higher apes Truth to tell the rudimentary state of human gene therapy today could scarcely have inspired such a frightening scenario A much more likely impetus behind the current movement for restrictive legislation is a series of trailblazing animal experiments Late last year in one of the most spectacular demonstrations to date scientists succeeded in creating a group of giant animals The Mighty Mouse experiment as it was dubbed by the media involved the injection of multiple copies of a rat growthhormone gene into mouse embryos Six of the resulting animals eventually grew into extreme
y large adults  some close to twice the size of a normal mouse Furthermore many of their descendants also grew into giants showing that the foreign genes had been passed on At about the same time another breakthrough was announced By introducing new genetic information into insect embryos a mutant population of adult fruit flies achieved the status of normality within a single generation In this case their eye color changed from abnormal brown to healthy red It is worth observing that the scientists who carried out these experiments were not attempting to lay the groundwork for gene therapy in man Rather they were interested in studying basic problems in biology To the public however these genetic engineering feats are perceived as transferable to the human germline If scientists can manufacture Mighty Mouse today then why not Super Man tomorrow According to Yales Dr Ruddle whose laboratory remains at the vanguard of genetransfer research the modification of animal embryos is far from a refined carefully modulated process Mice for example normally manufacture growth hormone in their pituitary gland But in the genetically altered strain the liver became the chief production site for the chemical In addition the gene implants are only successful in about one in every 20 embryos treated the rest usually do not survive the microinjection I cant see gene therapy being administered to human germ cells in the foreseeable future says Dr Ruddle For one thing youd have to select diseases which are sufficiently serious to warrant that kind of intervention And probably the best way of handling those conditions would be to screen for the defect at the fetal stage and allow for elective abortion So prenatal diagnosis will probably be the solution to those types of problems especially when we have no guarantee that genetic therapy would actually succeed in correcting the abnormality As for going beyond gene therapy to the remodeling of man most of the characteristics likely to be targeted for improvement  health intelligence longevity  are not controlled by a single gene They result from the cumulative effect of dozens hundreds or even thousands of genes interacting with the outside environment The manipulation of such complex and poorly understood systems has yet to be broached in animal research and may not be unraveled for many years to come Will we ever reach that level of technical expertise And if so will we seek to apply the technology to man It is already clear that with every new insight into how we came to be the skills for predicting and even altering certain aspects of our futures are likely to follow As to the second question that is more difficult to foresee But as Dr Ruddle and other scientists acknowledge Morality changes as the times change What we deem unacceptable today could be embraced by generations in the future,,

WOMEN AND THE CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/06/magazine/women-and-the-church.html,Kenneth A Briggs is the religion editor of The New York Times GNES MARY MANSOUR LISTENED intently as the Vaticans ultimatum was read to her at the Sisters of Mercy provincial house in Detroit resign her post as director of social services for the State of Michigan or become subject to a canonical process that would lead to an imposed dismissal from the religious order she had been a member of for 30 years At issue was her position on abortion Although she had personally disavowed the practice before her appointment she had indicated that she would tolerate the use of Federal funds for abortion in the performance of her secular duties Such an action she said would be a vote for the poor rather than a vote for abortions The demand to make a choice was delivered by an emissary from the Pope Bishop Anthony J Bevilacqua of Brooklyn an expert in canon law The 52yearold nun who was permitted to have two members of her order present as auditors at the late afternoon meeting was told she had until that evening to decide Dispiritedly she asked Bishop Bevilacqua for dispensation from her vows That confrontation last May 9 sent shock waves among American Roman Catholics and put advocates of womens rights in the church on the alert Quite apart from the morality of abortion or the soundness of Agnes Mary Mansours position about which protesters themselves disagreed was the question of whether she had been allowed due process according to the spirit of the Second Vatican Council The Sisters of Mercy charged that the Vatican had not properly utilized the appropriate channels including the order itself Several American bishops agreed that the matter had been decided highhandedly INCE THEN TENSIONS OVER A cluster of related issues  from complaints by Pope John Paul II that American nuns had become too lax in their conformity to conventional vows to local church squabbles over the question of altar girls  signal that Roman Catholicism in the United States is on the threshold of a historic period of controversy and confrontation over the role of women in the church Its the issue of our time says Bishop Matthew H Clark of Rochester NY one of several prelates who have written pastoral letters on the subject and it wont go away We have to explore it as much as possible Discussion of the status of religious and lay women spurred by feminism and a critical look at centuries of tradition is now a frontburner issue in the American branch of the church Next weekend in Washington the subject is expected to reach a new level of public debate when American bishops sit down with lay Catholic women and those from religious communities for a frank and direct exchange of views In advance of these discussions women in religious communities who had been set far apart from their secular sisters are now reaching across once wide gaps to join forces with them in an assault on the allmale ruling ethos of the church Religious communities are also becoming open to lay associate members and large national organizations once reserved to nuns have opened their membership to lay women Catholic women in the thousands are being educated in professionalschools of theology many of them going on to crack the previously allmale staffs of parish councils For some the clearcut goal is womens ordination Others aim at a totaly new mentality in Catholicism that topples what they see as the damaging effects of patriarchy As bishops run low on available male priests some of them are calling on women to serve as parish administrators pastors in all but name though somewhat limited in function Despite strict rules on these matters women are breaking new ground on their own often inadvertently as they strive to minister in new ways Some church analysts believe that the alarming shortage of priests more than any single issue will advance the role of women But there are real fears that a papal crackdown will result from a study of American religious communities recently ordered by Pope John Paul II A special committee of prelates has planned a landmark session on women and the church for the two days prior to the opening of the annual American bishops meeting on Nov 14 in Washington Though the workshop designed to be the first official colloquy of its kind on the subject is optional about 50 of the 285 bishops have signified they will attend A number of national Catholic womens USE THIS ONE 1st after 121 groups have been invited to send delegates to speak on their behalf Surrounding the workshop agenda are a host of issues that challenge present church practices Has the church violated its scriptural basis by denying to women certain practices such as service as permanent deacons and preaching at the mass Have culturally bound male patterns of dominance distorted the innate message of the Gospels regarding women Has the church through the centuries defined itself in such a way that the spiritual gifts and experiences of women were ignored Things once understood as fixed since the time of Christ actually developed later in the tradition of the church says Auxiliary Bishop Amedee W Proulx of Portland Me As we study history I believe well see more clearly the impact of patriarchy on the lives of women In the view of many Catholics the results could sharply alter the churchs understanding of its mission For that reason some conservatives fear the implications as an attack on valid tradition The bishops committee headed by Bishop Joseph L Imesch of Joliet Ill decided to proceed with the workshop despite an ominous message from the Pope in September to a group of American bishops at the Vatican While women must be granted dignity and freedom from discrimination the question of womens ordination does not fit that category of justice While ordination is a powerful symbol of injustice to many women for most it is but one of a long list of grievances Far more pervasive are matters that relate to equal treatment and readiness to accept the contributions women have been making to the reformulation of the postVatican II church Among the aims are a larger voice in key decisions regarding the wider range of the lay ministries they are fulfilling participation in parish programs and financial decisions and broader recognition of and respect for their ability to adapt practices to local conditions Women involved in these endeavors accuse pastors and hierarchy of too frequently taking their ideas and experiences lightly and keeping them far from the centers of power The church is afraid of sexuality and afraid of women says Sidney Callahan a psychology professor at Mercy College in Dobbs Ferry NY She says she knows of many of her generation who have left the church Many were driven away she says by crass antifeminism Sister Lillanna Audrey Kopp president of the National Coalition of American Nuns predicts there will be a mass exodus from established orders if there is an attempt to force nuns back into their traditional roles as nurses or teachers and require them to wear the habits many of them discarded following the liberalizing tone of Vatican II We are going to go the route of Agnes Mary Mansour says Sister Kopp who is a member of the Sisters for a Christian Community one of a growing number of religious groups that do not seek formal status as an order sanctioned by canon law The goal she says is to gain secular power so as to aid the impoverished and oppressed and they are determined to do it whether within or outside the framework of Catholic institutions The storm swirling about the church has altered the lives of many women among them Dianna Trebbi who until 1978 was a Sister of the Holy Child Years of wrestling with womens role in the church brought her to a moment of decision she says It was when I realized my spiritual path wouldnt change whether or not I was in a religious community Ive had nothing but peace ever since In many respects she has written off the institutional church but another part of her aching for a better day keeps a close watch on the Catholic Church Ruefully she awaits a time when women will be treated like firstclass citizens Barbara Ann Budde who has a masters degree in theology has faced her own difficulties as a lay woman employed on the staff of St Thomas Aquinas University parish in Boulder Colo Her title on a staff which includes two priests a nun and herself is that of pastoral associate and parish liturgist Out of necessity she has acquired some duties once reserved only for male clerics In her normal routine she is responsible for parish liturgy the training of parents preparing children for receiving the sacraments coordinating parish music and holding liturgy conferences But she says she faces problems of credibility as a lay woman There is no expectation that my ministerial commitment to the church has the same weight as that of a priest or a religious woman she declares Asked what problem most troubles women like herself who are breaking the mold and experimenting with new roles she unhesitatingly replies The male hierarchy of the church The maleness of the church is overpowering in general As women increasingly become professionals this grinds away at their sense of ministry and their sense of themselves As a lay woman working as a pastoral associate at a church in an East Coast innercity parish Carol Anne not her real name because she agreed to speak only on condition that she remain anonymous says she lives in continual limbo As the number of priests on the staff has steadily dropped from four to one Carol Anne has by talent and default assumed more and more duties Having learned Spanish she moves easily among her parishioners most of them Hispanics struggling to eke out an existence organizing community groups counseling young people and paying pastoral visits to apartments hospitals and oldage homes The rewards from serving people are often fulfilling but she says there is a void inside because she does not know where she belongs in the dioceses scheme of things There is just no recognition given a person like me she says We need to know we matter that the church acknowledges us as valid ministers Priests get that kind of recognition and nuns do to a certain extent but lay women do not Sister Madonna Kolbenschlag a Sister of the Humility of Mary and a senior fellow on the staff of Woodstock Theological Center at Georgetown University in Washington says that nuns are no longer content to be treated arbitrarily by pastors of parishes who may or may not appreciate their special talents Of women who find themselves suddenly dismissed by pastors she says Ten years ago they would have packed their bags and left quietly Now the response is that we are not going to allow any sister to be demeaned or tyrannized by this sort of thing In a growing number of cases women have left religious communities to enter new lives as active Catholic feminists Some who have believe they can help forge the alliance between sisters and lay women because they better understand the problems of each group Roddy ONeil Cleary was a member of the Religious of the Sacred Heart of Mary until 1969 Since then she has married given birth to two children and fostered two others and is now an interfaith campus minister at the University of Vermont In terms of her relation to the Catholic Church Mrs Cleary is divided regarding herself very much a Catholic but for the most part steering around the church On a recent Sunday morning for example she preached in the universitys Presbyterian church While I was standing there in the pulpit she says I realized painfully that I could not go next door to the Newman Center chapel and preach there USE THIS ONE 2nd after 121 The attitudes of altar girls and collegeage women in the church have not been studied but impressions come from a variety of sources The general picture points to a high level of indifference to the church as it now exists Mature women say their daughters keep a tangential relationship with the church and attribute much of the trend to dissatisfaction growing out of sexism Those who stay can reasonably expect a church influenced by women to a much greater extent But a bulwark of tradition stands very much against it When the Second Vatican Council rewrote the basic definition of the Roman Catholic Church from primary emphasis on the hierarchy to the concept of the people of God nuns took that as a cue to strive for forms that would reflect that reality The democratization of womens religious communities contrasts sharply with the traditional topdown style of the Roman church It also provides the most striking illustration of American Catholicism absorbing the egalitarian ethos embedded in the founding documents of the United States For decades the Vatican has viewed such a progression warily repeatedly insisting that the church is not a democracy But American political and social values have left their mark nowhere more deeply and in some respects surpisingly than among nuns We took the Vatican Council seriously says Sister Catherine Pinkerton president of the Leadership Conference of Women Religious We found in our governance of religious congregations a great movement toward interdependence and collaboration more shared than linear authority Each of us changed our style of leadership to reflect that At the same time nuns began taking an expanded interest in social justice involving themselves in projects relating to the impoverished A recent study conducted by Sister Marie Augusta Neal a sociology professor at Emmanuel College in Boston showed a 27 percent decline in the number of American nuns working in classrooms Politics has become a primary outlet for women in religious orders who feel frustrated by the limits placed upon them by the church With the permission of their bishops nuns have increasingly sought political office Hundreds of them like Sister Mary Madonna Ashton the Minnesota Commissioner of Health and Sister Ardeth Platte a city councilwoman in Saginaw Mich now serve in elected and appointed positions in state and local governments Momentum in such directions has not slowed but both nuns and lay women have been shaken by events of the past months It strikes me says Sister Mary Collins director of liturgical studies at Catholic University that there is a strong attempt by the Pope to control the place of women in the church Something has triggered a lot of fear of women and the direction they are taking I think this will be a critical pastoral challenge for bishops she continues On the one hand they are trying to maintain equilibrium with Rome On the other hand they have a pastoral responsibility to women in their dioceses and they cannot avoid this as an issue A month after the action taken against Agnes Mary Mansour another bolt of lightning struck The Vatican announced a study to review the reforms implemented by religious orders and to determine causes of the steep drop off in candidates for religious life An accompanying document concentrated heavily on obedience to authority and recommended religious garb a statement that brought a storm of adverse reaction Though the study is directed to both mens and womens communities the Pope clearly implied that the womens orders were his main concern Archbishop John R Quinn of San Francisco has indicated that fears of a crackdown are not necessarily justified but the disclaimer has apparently done little to assuage suspicions The more optimistic among women religious believe the study aimed only at America can provide an opportunity to educate clergy hierarchy and laity about their enlightened findings Were operating out of one model the hierarchical church out of another says Sister Nancy Sylvester of the Immaculate Heart of Mary national coordinator of Network a Washingtonbased Catholic socialjustice lobby Often were just not respected or appreciated for what we have done she says Those most concerned about reforming the church acknowledge they are a minority of the more than 25 million Catholic women in the United States But as in other movements the more activist elements among them are setting the tone and themes of the longer tougher campaign to come Among advocates of change there are a wide variety of perspectives and goals Because the lives of nuns are most intimately linked with the institutional church they have often taken the lead But increasingly their lay sisters offer support from the sidelines In the past nuns vows to their communities have set them apart from lay women who have been inclined to regard them as a privileged group But in the postVatican II church these differences have been fading Over the last decade lay women have been welcomed as co or associate members of dozens of womens religious communities Under such arrangements they often take part in much of the communitys activity and deliberations without taking vows of communal life In some cases single and divorced women live in communities on such a basis for varying lengths of time For lay women the relationship affords an opportunity to be part of a larger ministry without having to permanently leave their families or completely sever themselves from their professions The religious communities say they benefit by the emotional support and creative thinking they receive from the outside Similarly important is the trend by large Catholic womens organizations to pull together around some shared aspirations Of these groups the National Assembly of Religious Women and the National Coalition of American Nuns take the most activist and liberal stance the Leadership Conference of Women Religious comprising the heads of religious communities represents a more midstream position and the National Council of Catholic Women by far the largest with 8000 separate lay groups from altar societies to the Daughters of Isabella has been relatively conservative USE THIS ONE 3rd after 121 A recent positon paper by the National Council of Catholic Women calls for a means of giving formal status to ministries for women suggesting that women could be commissioned for such work in a public manner In addition the lay group has joined the call for a study into the possibility that women could be ordained as permanent deacons In many parishes women function as lectors who read portions of Scripture during the mass and serve as extraordinary ministers of the eucharist distributing communion in its wafer and bread and wine forms Many hold seats on parish councils and participate on diocesanwide pastoral councils Increasingly women are serving with priests on pastoral teams responsible for an area of parish ministry such as education or visitation of the sick Furthermore some bishops have begun appointing members of womens religious communities as parish administrators where priests are not available These women function as priests in all respects except two They may not consecrate the bread and wine in the eucharist or hear confessions Otherwise they lead liturgical services baptize babies bury the dead and umpire at the parish softball games Striking as these shifts may be to many of the 51 million American Catholics many women activists mix modest hopes with a large dose of wariness Centuries of male control still militate against women they say and that legacy dies hard Jacqueline Grennan Wexler president of the National Conference of Christians and Jews who was formerly a nun and president of Catholicrun Webster College in St Louis calls herself skeptical and reverent Among the sources of distrust she says is that a male celibate clergy promulgated the rules on sexual morality including birth control without consulting women People who knew the most were simply not involved in discussions or deliberations The conventional male image of God likewise prompts objections As a substantial body of feminist theology has built up the criticism of the traditional modes of talking about God has grown louder We had grown up with a male image a judgmental powerful God says Mrs ONeil Cleary who holds a Doctor of Ministry degree The feminine side of God is not always in control Pain and suffering is a dilemma that finds God not in control But God is connected to this all by being allnurturing all caring Prof Rosemary Ruether one of the most widely read Catholic theologians thinks feminist theology is gaining much greater acceptance People come up to me and say they heard me speak on these matters 10 years ago and that Id scared them to death Now it seems reasonable to them says Professor Ruether who teaches at the Garrett Theological Seminary in Evanston Ill Evidence of this widening acceptance of feminist theology and deepening sympathy for womens causes within the church could set the stage for further assaults against liberalism by the Vatican and bring bishops to loggerheads with officials of the sacred congregations which handle the business of the church Many of the American bishops who have carried on discussions with Catholic women on various points though their special committee say that in the process they have undergone a conversion I learned a lot about the patriarchy of the church says Bishop Michael F McAuliffe of Jefferson City Mo The dominance of the male in society and all the affects that has had were the patterns the church adopted In terms of womens gifts and the ways in which we have used them we have wronged women terribly by not allowing them to use their ministry in the church Like some other prelates Bishop McAuliffe sees the Vatican as the source of much of the present difficulty There is some misunderstanding on the part of the Vatican about things that happen in the United States he says The Mansour case is an example It should have been handled in the United States not by the Vatican In their ad limina routine visits to the Pope this autumn several bishops registered their concerns and spoke on behalf of American women Bishop Imesch who will lead next weekends workshop said he asked the Pope about allowing altar girls a subject of some confusion and much debate among Catholics inasmuch as the revised code of canon law due to be implemented at the end of this month has no precise directions The Pontiff did not reply Bishop Imesch says but in my interpretation of his facial expression I wouldnt say I got a No or a frown or a shake of the head Id say he either accepts it or is indifferent Did the response surprise him It was very interesting to me Bishop Imesch says I expected to get blown away In the near future the Catholic bishops of the United States are expected to begin writing a pastoral letter on womens role in the church The process toward reaching agreement could likely be as rigorous and heated as the prolonged and anguished debate that preceded the issuance earlier this year of their pastoral letter on nuclear arms Already under way is a look at the possibility that women could be ordained to the permanent diaconate For more than 10 years the church has been ordaining men to this office a role that had been neglected for centuries Roman Catholic deacons who may be married do not generally go on to become priests but their work as parish assistants has become invaluable in many situations They are entitled to perform all the work of priests except the sacrament of penance and the celebration of mass Proponents of women deacons believe that there is a precedent for the role in the annals of early church history But others such as Bishop Bevilacqua now Bishop of Pittsburgh think the search for such authentic examples is likely to prove fruitless The idea of opening the office to them has been greeted with mixed responses from women Some believe such a step would be a foot in the door to the eventual ordination of women as priests while others view the move as a sop to placate womens demands for a greater place in the ecclesiastical order Hundreds of Catholic women are already theologically prepared to step into any clerical role A recent survey of 27 Catholic seminaries by the Womens Ordination Conference found that 634 women were studying for Master of Theology degrees the general equivalent of a male seminarians preparation in theology but far more than expected of men preparing to be permanent deacons Women are not allowed to pursue these studies in the Master of Divinity program required of seminarians at Catholic institutions but hundreds of them are acquiring Master of Divinity degrees at nonCatholic theological schools Many voice hurt and defiance but none of those interviewed suggested that women are about to renounce what they have achieved Sister Madonna Kolbenschlag reflects this determination when she asserts that the church cannot put the toothpaste back in the tube or make us caterpillars after we have become butterflies Mrs Wexler underscores the same point in a more impassioned manner Theyll never own our souls again Well make up our own minds
STUDENTS' VIEWS ON CHEATING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/style/students-views-on-cheating.html,A survey of 2000 teenage achievers has found that nearly a third of them said that at times they cheated in school A majority said parents teachers and religious leaders should share the responsibility for teaching children not to cheat Thirtytwo percent of the 2000 students surveyed said they cheated But almost as many 28 percent said they had never done so while 38 percent said they had cheated but no longer made a practice of it The recently released survey the 14th in annual succession involved student leaders listed in the new edition of Whos Who Among American High School Students and was conducted last summer by the books publisher Educational Communications of Lake Forest which made the results public Seventythree percent of the students said that teenagers are not as bad as adults think they are and that adults tend to pay attention to troublemakers Threefourths of the respondents reported that they never have had sexual intercourse Fifty percent of those who said they had engaged in sexual relations acknowledged that they did not use birth control every time and 26 percent said they took no precautions Half the girls surveyed said they would want to get married if they became pregnant while 33 percent said they would not because they were too young Thirtythree percent said they would have the baby and raise it alone if necessary 25 percent said they would have an abortion More than 90 percent of the students said they had never tried cocaine angel dust PCP and other hallucinogenic drugs amphetamines or barbiturates Eightythree percent said the same about marijuana while 12 percent had tried it but said they no longer used it Thirtyfour percent said they occasionally drank hard liquor and 32 percent had an occasional beer a third said they had never drunk liquor and 22 percent said they had never tasted it The survey included these results  Fiftyfive percent of those polled said they knew how to use computers  Sixtynine percent think mathematics and science education should be upgraded  Thirtynine percent think the Federal Government should set high school graduation requirements  Eightytwo percent said the reason some teenagers graduated from high school without basic skills was that they could choose easy courses  A majority said they thought President Reagan was doing a good job politically and in economic and domestic policy but 47 percent said they thought he was not doing as well in foreign affairs
CLERIC'S TEACHING ON MEDICINE IS CITED IN 57 INDIANA DEATHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/us/cleric-s-teaching-on-medicine-is-cited-in-57-indiana-deaths.html,The founder and leader of a religious group with members so faithful to his teachings that they allow spouses and children to die rather than seek medical help preaches that medicine is evil and doctors are little better than magicians The clergyman is 63yearold Hobart Freeman the head of the Faith Assembly which has been in the limelight in recent months because of reports that dozens of followers have died from untreated illnesses Yet John J Davis a seminary professor describes Mr Freeman as brilliant and a good theologian Mr Freeman does not grant interviews and has not spoken to the press since the deaths among members of the Faith Assembly which have been put at 57 by The Fort Wayne NewsSentinel came into the news But Mr Davis a former student of Mr Freeman at Grace Theological Seminary in Winona Lake Ind persuaded Mr Freeman to talk with him Mr Davis shared his insights in an interview and in recent articles in The Warsaw TimesUnion Grace Seminary is associated with the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches a fundamentalist Protestant group that had a national membership of 41000 in 1982 He Became More Withdrawn The image of Mr Freeman that emerged through Mr Davis is one of a man who has grown more withdrawn and more narrow in his beliefs Mr Freeman earned degrees in divinity and theology at the Southern Baptist Theological Seminary in Louisville Ky He later broke with the Baptist Church charging among other things that Christmas and Easter were pagan celebrations By 1959 he had switched to the Brethren Church and earned his doctorate at Grace Seminary Again however he began to criticize his church Four years later he was excommunicated and dismissed from his teaching post at Grace Mr Freeman who had polio as a child and has had several heart attacks teaches that supernatural healing based on faith is the only acceptable treatment for illness and injury Mr Davis said Mr Freeman underwent kidney surgery before founding the Faith Assembly according to Mr Davis Mr Davis noted that the application of Mr Freemans doctrine on the historic connection between witchcraft and medicine resulted in a distortion of ones sense of reality which allowed parents and spouses to ignore the suffering of their loved ones Theres an incredible intensity of dedication Mr Davis said of the Faith Assembly members It is a faith with no compromises and that seclusion coupled with very dogmatic demands have resulted in personal tragedy for several people The Appearance of Faith Mr Davis said members of the Faith Assembly based in the tiny northern Indiana community of Wilmot shun smoking drinking drugs abortion and the theater Mr Davis said he saw people remove their eyeglasses before entering the church and then squint at their Bibles rather than be labeled faithless for wearing corrective lenses Other demands by Mr Freeman that were listed by Mr Davis included giving up insurance policies refusing immunizations and medication of any kind removing seat belts from cars destroying credit cards and never borrowing money The idea is that God will protect Mr Davis said
"SPAIN GROWS LESS PRUDISH, BUT NOT YET LIBERTINE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/07/world/spain-grows-less-prudish-but-not-yet-libertine.html,A bent elderly woman dressed entirely in black from her stockings to her head scarf was moving slowly down the street when she came upon a piece of paper on the sidewalk It was a page from a popular magazine a photo of a naked couple in amorous embrace The woman looked around slowly stooped to pick it up and stared at it Then she marched to a wastebasket ripped the picture about eight times and dropped it in In this brief encounter the two Spains met One oldfashioned churchgoing morally upright The other modern hedonistic and so it seems increasingly assertive The Changes Come Fast Back in the Franco years Spain was the Victorian spinster of Europe Now this has changed Spain is not exactly a Babylon but it has caught up with the rest of the Continent and the changes in moral behavior and permissiveness seem doubly striking because they have occurred so fast When I was my daughters age my father wouldnt let me go out of the house without a chaperon said Teresa Gonzalez a Madrid hairdresser Even so I had to be in by 11 oclock My daughter goes out to some place  The Joy Esclava  and Im lucky if she comes back by dawn The Joy Esclava is a discoth eque one of dozens with elaborate lighting displays and hightech sound systems that have made Madrids night life suddenly famous among young Europeans After all where else these days are the streets crowded at 2 in the morning In Paris the cops are all over you said a young Englishwoman her hair dyed blue and red puffing on a marijuana joint at a recent concert of Police the rock group Londons too expensive and you never see the sun Rome well its OK but a lot of crime Spains the place to be No Kissing in Public In the old days the power of the Roman Catholic Church and the states antiCommunist crusade drew the limits Crime was low but widely defined It was illegal for a boy and girl to be seen kissing in public Spanish jails were filled with wouldbe drug smugglers trying to bring hashish from Morocco to the lucrative market of northern Europe Movies were so heavily censored for sex and politics that the plot sometimes ended up on the cutting room floor A famous example was the film Mogambo wanting to avoid any suggestion of adultery between Clark Gable and Ava Gardner the censor transformed them into brother and sister thereby arousing Spanish audiences with the spicy theme of incest Now hardcore pornography plays in movie houses and softcore sells at newsstands Prostitutes are commonplace and visible  American tourists eating at McDonalds on the Gran Via can watch them solicit across a small square  and one member of Parliament suggested setting up an official red light district to control the trade Transvestites are featured attractions in the floor shows of expensive nightclubs lending a certain prewar Berlin atmosphere of decadence to the place and they also tend to congregate on a particular corner of the central Castellana Boulevard past midnight If a car stops one is liable to get in Beaches Are Now Topless In contrast to the rigorous dress codes enforced decades ago Spanish beaches are now topless and some are bottomless as well which often shocks American bathers Exceptions still exist in conservative areas such as Galicia in the northwest Foreigners held a demonstration in the town of Puerto del Son there this summer to agitate for a nudist beach braving the anger of local women who dressed in black turned out with sticks and threatened to burn them Some of the changes have been ushered in by the Socialist Government of Prime Minister Filipe Gonzalez voted into office a year ago Convinced that Spains moral code was anachronistic in imposing heavy penalties for crimes not recognized as crimes elsewhere the Government has passed legislation to liberalize the penal code The liberalization began with an earlier regime which legalized divorce But the Socialists speeded up the process considerably Among other things Parliament has enacted bills to legalize sex changes permit sterilization and most significantly to legalize abortion in therapeutic cases Most striking of all was a bill approved last April that legalized the possession of drugs even hard drugs including heroin as long as they were held in small quantities and for personal consumption In effect Spain went in a single stroke from having one of the harshest drug laws in Europe to one of the most liberal Trafficking Still a Crime Penalties remain for people trafficking in drugs  up to six months for soft drugs and from six years to 12 years for hard drugs But some international drug experts believe these will not prove a sufficient deterrent to major dealers They predict a shift in the pattern of European drug traffic with Spain replacing the Netherlands as a prime distribution center In addition changes in the criminal justice laws aimed at reducing extremely long delays for people awaiting trial have led to the release of thousands of prisoners This has combined with a widespread perception that crime is on the rise to make safety in the streets something of a potential issue for the rightwing opposition The issue dovetails with that of morality since the right views this as its special preserve and believes that the moral fiber of the country is disintegrating The Socialists answer that they are not sponsoring a change in the moral standards of the country but simply recognizing that one has already occurred I myself am not in favor of abortion said a Cabinet minister speaking privately But in the 20th century people are going to go out and get abortions and its absurb to send them to jail for doing so Fame for The Foxes The morality issue culminated six months ago in a fuss that arose when a female punk rock group called the Foxes appearing on a television show watched by young people sang a pornographic song titled I Want to Be a Whore A tape of the show was played for legislators the state prosecutor began an investigation and the Foxes became famous all over the country But the controversy died down and recently Spaniards seem to have adjusted to a lower threshold of moral respectability Recently for example many were puzzled over the scandal in Britain in which a married Cabinet minister Cecil Parkinson was forced to resign because of disclosures that his secretary and mistress had become pregnant A similiar experience happened to the Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Alfonso Guerra who is also married The episode was publicized in the papers but did not really set tongues wagging and in no way diminished his effectiveness as a public figure The woman shortly after giving birth won a state scholarship to Rome
HOUSE AGAIN GETS SPENDING MEASURE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/10/us/house-again-gets-spending-measure.html,After a startling defeat Tuesday night House Democrats scrambled today to salvage a stopgap appropriation bill that would keep sizable segments of the Government running after their spending authority runs out Thursday night Party leaders said they would bring the legislation back to the floor on Thursday and they predicted its passage Meanwhile Senator Bob Dole acknowledged today that time was running out on his attempt to fashion a package of deficitreducing measures before Congress adjourns The Kansas Republican said that while he was still trying to work something out this year he might wait until Congress reconvened in January before bringing the bill to the Senate floor In the House many of the freshman Democrats who voted against the stop gap bill Tuesday night as a way of protesting Congressional inaction on budget deficits said they would now reverse themselves and support the appropriations measure Yesterdays vote was intended to call attention to Reagans budget deficits Representative Barbara Boxer a California Democrat told the Rules Committee today Many members feel theyve made their point and would like to have another chance Senate Considers Bill Meanwhile the Senate took up the temporary spending bill officially known as a continuing resolution and quickly bogged down When the lawmakers failed to kill an amendment by Senator Jeremiah Denton Republican of Alabama which would ban the use of Federal funds to finance virtually all abortions Senator Bob Packwood an Oregon Republican started to filibuster Senate leaders then pulled the bill off the floor Despite the protest vote by firstyear House Democrats chances seemed to be fading today that Congress would make a major effort to reduce budget deficits before the lawmakers quit work for the year perhaps at the end of next week Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr severely criticized the deficit reduction package worth about 150 billion now being drawn up by Senator Dole who heads the Finance Committee No way is the Dole bill going through the House said Mr ONeill a Massachusetts Democrat The Democratic leader was particularly critical of suggestions that the Dole package would reduce costofliving increases for Social Security recipients and explained Thats not the Democratic philosophy Senator William V Roth Jr a Delaware Republican who opposes the Dole proposal said I think its dead Senator Dole said in an interview that a new version of his proposal would try to cool down some of the hot buttons such as Social Security reductions Freshmen Defend Action In the House the 26 freshmen who helped scuttle the temporary spending bill Tuesday night defended their action as an act of frustration and principle Many had campaigned last year against rising budget deficits and they feel that Congressional leaders are not taking the problem seriously enough Referring to Speaker ONeill Representative Jim Bates Democrat of California said He listens but hes not doing anything I want a tax bill added Mr Bates a leader of the freshman rebellion If we spend money we should pay for it But many fellow Democrats excoriated the freshmen for what they felt was an act of folly in the words of Representative Jim Wright of Texas the majority leader They meant well Mr Wright said but often one can be so clever that hes downright stupid Most Democratic leaders in the House believe that it is political suicide for them to vote for the sort of major tax increase favored by the freshmen or Senator Dole unless President Reagan backs it first If the President does not support the tax increase they say he will turn the issue against the Democrats in next years campaign I dont see any reason to get our head cut off again on that said one senior Democrat Appropriation Bills Remain The stopgap spending bill is necessary because Congress has passed only eight of the 13 appropriation bills that annually allot money to different parts of the Federal Government Theoretically the five other sectors will run out of money Thursday night and have to shut down unless new spending authority is adopted Realistically the disruption caused by a failure to meet the deadline is not very great particularly inasmuch as Friday Veterans Day is a Federal holiday But Congress still feels an urgency to pass a bill When the legislation reaches the House floor on Thursday Democratic leaders will offer one grabbag amendment that would increase education spending by almost 1 billion and increase foreign aid by almost 400 million mostly for Israel and Egypt The House leaders believe that the Senate version will include funds for the International Monetary Fund which are ardently desired by the President Accordingly they hope to arrange a trade Democrats would approve the money for the International Monetary Fund which has been stalled for months and Republicans would accept the increased spending for domestic programs and foreign aid Their hope is that Mr Reagan will find that to be a package he cannot refuse

SENATE JOINS ANTIABORTION MOVE IN LATE NIGHT ON MONEY BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/11/us/senate-joins-antiabortion-move-in-late-night-on-money-bill.html,The Senate struggled beyond a midnight deadline this morning in efforts to complete action on a stopgap spending measure that in addition to financing a sizable part of the Government would broaden the ban on the use of Federal funds for abortion The House of Representatives which rejected the emergency money bill Tuesday reversed itself Thursday and sent the bill to the Senate by a 224to189 vote after a group of freshman Democrats who had voted against the measure angering their partys leadership switched positions The Senate in its consideration of the House bill narrowly approved the antiabortion provision which would prevent Federal employees from using their medical benefits to pay for abortions except to save the life of the mother But senators stripped the bill of a Democraticsponsored 1 billion increase in money for education and health services A number of amendments were still to be considered by the Senate this morning and after final action in that chamber a conference committee will have to resolve differences in the two versions before final passage Little Impact on Holiday The delay technically left a number of Government agencies without the authority to spend money but since today is a Federal holiday Veterans Day the expiration of funds was expected to have little effect other than to disrupt legislators plans for a long weekend The stopgap action is necessary because though the fiscal year began Oct 1 Congress has not yet passed individual appropriation bills allocating funds for foreign aid the Postal Service the Treasury and the Departments of Defense Agriculture Commerce Justice and State Absent such a stopgap measure the agencies without appropriations are no longer authorized to spend money In the past however agencies have continued to operate for more than a week after the expiration of spending deadlines Since the fiscal year began those programs have been financed by a similar stopgap measure which expired at midnight The spending resolution now under consideration would continue funds for the affected programs at the current level until Feb 29 As separate funding bills are adopted they will supersede the stopgap measure Reversal on Abortion The provision removing abortions from Federal employees health coverage long sought by antiabortion forces has passed the House frequently in the past three years but it had always been rejected in the Senate Opponents of the measure argue that Federal employees should be able to use their medical benefits as they wish Thursday night however the Senate voted 44 to 43 to keep the antiabortion language in the spending bill The House approved the ban by voice vote Oct 27 in an appropriation bill for the Treasury and Postal Service and that bill still pending in the Senate was incorporated into the stopgap measure Current law restricts the use of Federal funds such as Medicaid for abortions but does not forbid the Government to offer Federal employees health insurance plans that cover abortions The Reagan Administration has favored the broader restrictions on abortions The Governmentsubsidized health insurance plans cover 10 million Government employees retirees and their dependents The Office of Personnel Management has reported that 17000 abortions were financed last year through the Federal Employees Health Benefits Plan Freshmen Sent a Message The House approved the spending resolution after firstterm Democrats who voted against the identical measure Tuesday night reversed themselves explaining that they had merely intended to send a message to the leadership and the White House We voted against passage to make a single statement that the budget deficit has got to be addresseed and addressed soon said Representative Jim Moody Democrat of Wisconsin The freshman Democrats were assailed by Republican leaders including Representative Trent Lott of Mississippi the minority whip who wondered aloud how the freshmen would explain their vote switch Are they going to switch around and say We were worried about deficits two days ago but were not worried about deficits now he asked Tax Bill Held Unlikely Despite fears in both chambers about a deficit approaching 200 billion a deficitreduction program was interred at least temporarily by both Senate and House tax writers Thursday The chairmen of the two taxwriting committees acknowledged that it was unlikely that any tax bill even a modest one would be approved this year The House approved the 1 billion increase in funds for education child nutrition programs and other social programs by 235 to 181 over Republican objections Representative Silvio O Conte Republican of Massachusetts said the Democrats education proposal was nothing but a blatant political issue The true intent is to give the Democrats an issue in November to provoke a veto so they can say we tried  Mr Conte said But Representative Jim Wright the Texas Democrat who is majority leader countered We do not seek a confrontation with the President but to give him an opportunity to balance his priorities a bit more fairly Democracy in Inaction Representative Robert H Michel of Illinois the Republican leader called the proceedings democracy in inaction While the majority rails against deficits he said they intend to add to them Mr Wright replied that the Democrats wanted to reduce deficits by reducing programs that aided the rich not the poor The amendment which the Senate rejected later by a vote of 53 to 36 would have allocated funds for 15 social and education programs including vocational education adult education community service block grants lowincome energy assistance education for the handicapped and emergency shelters for the homeless
HOUSE AND SENATE AGREE ON SPENDING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/12/us/house-and-senate-agree-on-spending.html,House and Senate negotiators agreed today on a catchall spending bill that is needed to keep parts of the Federal Government operating through Sept 30 The compromise bill included an additional 100 million for education programs promoted by House Democrats far below their original proposal of almost 1 billion The White House had threatened to veto the bill if it included sizable amounts for extra domestic spending but Senator Mark O Hatfield the Oregon Republican who is chairman of the Appropriations Committee expressed confidence today that President Reagan would sign the bill The compromise clears away one of the major obstacles Congress must overcome as it tries to meet its goal of adjourning next Friday However the Senate remains snarled in a bitter dispute over a bill raising the national debt ceiling and a resolution of that issue is still far away In the other major conflict resolved today the negotiators agreed to spend 115 billion on foreign aid 170 million less than the Reagan Administration had requested One provision of the bill would bar El Salvador from using 30 percent of its 648 million aid package until verdicts are returned in connection with the killing of four American churchwomen there Officially several major areas of the Government lost their authority to spend money this morning when an earlier temporary spending bill expired But since today was a national holiday the cutoff had little meaning and both houses of Congress are expected to approve the compromise with little dissent on Saturday Todays bill is necessary because Congress though the fiscal year began Oct 1 has passed 8 of the 13 appropriation bills that are annually needed to finance the Government Temporary catchall measures like this one generally continue funds at previous or tentatively approved levels until individual spending bills are adopted replacing the continuing resolution as the spending guideline for the covered departments Agreement between the two houses came relatively quickly as lawmakers in both parties seemed exhausted and eager to finish their work The House passed its version of the bill Thursday evening but a marathon Senate session did not end until 340 this morning The main reason for the lengthy session was a proposal to prohibit Federal workers from using their health benefits to finance abortions except when the life of the mother is in danger This provision has long been sought by opponents of abortion and resisted by those who favor a womans right to choose abortion Opponents of abortion won a series of test votes in the Senate over the last several days and eventually the abortion rights forces gave in rather than delay passage of the entire bill As a result this is the first major Federal spending bill to contain such a ban For several years recipients of Medicaid have not been allowed to use their benefits to pay for abortions and there now seems a clear decision in Congress to eliminate all cases in which Federal funds are used to finance the procedure But Congress has rejected all attempts to restrict the right of women to choose privately financed operations Compromise on Education House Democrats had promoted their 1 billion education package as a way of dramatizing their differences with the Reagan Administration and forcing the Republicans to make a potentially damaging vote against a popular set of programs Early today the Democrats proposed to trim their package to 250 million but that was rejected by Senate and House Republicans who argued that the Administration had threatened flat out to veto even that amount The standoff stood for several hours but nobody had the stomach for a prolonged battle The House has made its point said Representative William R Ratchford Democrat of Connecticut Eventually said Representative W G Hefner a North Carolina Democrat We have to face up to what we can get through here Eventually the Democrats did face up to that reality and offered their scaleddown package which included 25 million to educate the handicapped 10 million for vocational education 30 million for the teaching of immigrant children and a variety of smaller amounts The Republicans realizing that the Democrats needed something to save face went along On foreign aid Senator Bob Kasten Republican of Wisconsin called the agreement a true compromise One problem was the military assistance program which aids such countries as Turkey and Portugal The final total of 510 million was about halfway between the House figure and a higher Senate figure The compromise also included sizable aid increases for Israel and Egypt as part of efforts to reward countries that aid in American Middle East peacekeeping efforts The sectors of Government included in todays legislation include the military which should have its own appropriation by the end of next week foreign aid the Treasury the Postal Service and the Departments of Agriculture State Justice and Commerce Only foreign aid and perhaps Treasury and post office are expected to spend the entire fiscal year under the bill
"STAMPS;
NEW ISSUES STIR A NATIONWIDE CONTROVERSY",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/arts/stamps-new-issues-stir-a-nationwide-controversy.html,Is religion increasingly making its  way onto the stamps of this nation which was founded on the separation of church and state Is this a marked break with the past  and if so does anyone really care These questions arise as a result of the controversy that has accompanied the newlyissued Martin Luther commemorative It was preceded by last years commemorative for St Francis of Assisi There is no doubt that the Luther stamp pleased millions of Lutherans and the stamp for St Francis pleased not only Catholics but also many others because he seems to be in our day the one saint most nonCatholics also admire  The political climate has been right for the stamps The record of the Reagan Administration on support for school prayers for Bob Jones Universitys racial policies on antiabortion and a score of other issues in which religion is a factor is well known The Moral Majority is closely allied with the President There was even an implied White House endorsement of the Luther stamp through the support of Edwin Meese the Presidents Councilor and a Lutheran There are some Americans however who raise the question of whether a secular state should honor any sectarian figure They maintain that an agency of the United States government has no business paying tribute to religious figures on its stamps As the Postal Service well knows stamps inform educate and influence Maybe not the regular issues which tend to go unnoticed but the commemoratives do get attention It has put out stamps urging people to register and vote to support youth for law and order and a variety of other causes the government endorses The stamp becomes a medium of endorsement This year the Postal Service has put out stamps for causes dear to the heart of President Reagan for volunteerism and for physical fitness These stamps are obviously intended to make an impression on the user President Reagan recently is reported to have asked the Postmaster General for a commemorative for HispanicAmerican servicemen Soon from the White House came indications such a commemorative would be issued in 1984 Another concern was voiced at the time of the St Francis stamp by Edd Doerr director of Americans United for Separation of Church and State He said St Francis was known primarily as a religious figure If he is honored by the Postal Service then there will surely be floods of demands that we honor other religious figures in the Protestant Catholic Muslim Mormon and other religious denominations It is a trend in the wrong direction and certainly violates the spirit if not the letter of the First Amendment Then there are some philatelic strict constructionists who maintain it is right for the Germans to honor a native son and the Latins predominantly Catholic rather than secular nations to honor St Francis But they note that neither has direct links to the United States except in the stream of religious thought and philosophy So they ask why not Buddha Confucius Plato Aristotle and many others The pattern of buildup for the issuance of the two stamps is similar and could serve as a blueprint for similar new commemoratives now being worked on A petition for the issuance of the stamp for St Francis from Rep Peter W Rodino of New Jersey bore more than 100000 signatures including 40 Senators 71 Representatives and 45 governors In addition to obvious Roman Catholic backing there was support from such Protestant groups as the United Churches of Christ the United Presbyterian Church and the American Lutheran Church Rep William Dannemeyer of California a Lutheran led the political endorsement campaign for the Martin Luther stamp Again it was backed by Senators and Representatives in Congress as well as national state and local leaders many of them Lutherans Again there were enough nonLutheran endorsements to indicate broader support In both instances the patterns of political pressure on the Postal Service were identical  and effective There was one important difference in the two stamps The stamp for St Francis had the endorsement of the Citizens Stamp Advisory Committee This is a panel of distinguished collectors artists and other persons of note that examines subjects for forthcoming stamps and later the designs for them and makes recommendations to the Postmaster General Its role is advisory But the panel on at least two occasions balked at recommending the Luther stamp a decision that in a sense points up the controversial nature of the issue The final decision has always been the Postmaster Generals Using this authority the Postmaster General authorized the Luther stamp The Postal Service a veteran of the religious wars has been careful to protect its flanks in both issues There is no identification of either figure not even a St with Francis In brief announcements Luther was an advocate of universal education Francis a humanitarian It appears that the Postal Service had better be prepared to do more walking on eggs because the floodgates appear to have been opened The United Methodist Church is reported to be seeking a 1984 commemorative for the 200th anniversary of Methodism in America Followers of another religious leader Emanuel Swedenborg are working for a commemorative in 1988 The gates have been opened and the waters are beginning to pour in In the present climate the Postal Service may even welcome the waters but there is always the story of the Sorcerers Apprentice who was unable to stem the rising waters In fact the opposition to the two stamps for St Francis and Luther also wants a commemorative as explained in an editorial in Church and State the publication of the organization mentioned above It says in part Soon the Postal Service will have an opportunity to demonstrate that it is sensitive to the principle of church state separation It will have an opportunity to approve the issuance of a commemorative in honor of the 200th anniversary of one of the greatest documents in the history of the American republic the Virginia Statute for Religious Freedom Written by Thomas Jefferson in 1777 the statute became the pattern for the First Amendment Without it America would not be the free nation it is today    By issuing a stamp in 1986 precisely 200 years after the Virginia legislature endorsed the statute the Postal Service would not only commemorate a great piece of legislation it would remind Americans of one of the nations enduring principles particularly at a time when that principle is taken for granted by some and denied by others The Postal Services earlier religious wars began in 1962 when the United States put out its first Christmas stamp a wreath with candles followed in 1963 by the National Christmas Tree at the White House and in 1964 by a block of four with holly mistletoe poinsettia and a sprig of conifer In response to those who wanted to put Christ into Christmas the next two years brought stamps with religious symbolism and touched off a counter reaction The compromise of 1979 brought a truce to the battle users were offered a choice of a religious issue or a secular issue The compromise was reinforced in the 1980s when the Postal Service began referring to its religious stamps as art masterpiece issues This years Madonna and Child by Raphael is called a traditional issue In addition Seasons Greetings has replaced Christmas on the secular stamp also known as the contemporary Christmas issue The problem of religion and stamps is not simple for the foundations of American history are rooted in religion The Pilgrims are on American stamps they were a religious group Roger Williams another stamp subject founded Rhode Island in pursuit of religious freedom Father Jacques Marquette who explored the Mississippi appears on two issues  but sans the word Father and with emphasis on his explorations Washington at prayer at Valley Forge on a Christmas stamp Washington taking the oath of office with his hand on a Bible or in other circumstances with a suggestion of religion disturb no one The circumstances are true and the emphasis is not on religion More recently in 1979 the Rev Martin Luther King Jr appeared on a commemorative To be sure the Rev is omitted though he appears in a ministers robe but more important he appears as a civil rights leader who helped bring great changes in America There has been a commemorative for the historic Touro Synagogue in Rhode Island that goes back to Colonial days There have been various churches in the Architecture Series The Mormon Temple in Salt Lake City has appeared on a postal card in the Historic Preservation Series Anyone who views these landmarks as religious has to be straining All these stamps and others deal with American history and the American heritage Is this true of St Francis and Luther The Postal Service seems to be going farther afield on a course that could be increasingly controversial The United States noted that it was in the good company of West Germany which has put out a commemorative for a native son that shows Luther pointing to a passage in the Bible More surprising is that it is in the company of Communist East Germany which after many years of badmouthing has decided that Luther had many qualities that make him worthy of commemoration Another Communist nation Czechoslovakia has also issued a portrait commemorative for him So has Communist Hungary which places him against a background of church spires France has issued a vertical showing Luther in his priestly robes Brazil has also put a vertical that shows Luther clasping the Bible It also shows the familys coat of arms the socalled Lutheran rose carved in a stone wall of the house where Luther lived and still distinctly visible even today A stamp from the Netherlands shows a torn sheet symbolizing the break with the Roman Catholic Church and Luthers signature
WMCA IS A RADIO STATION ATTUNED TO MAKING A DIFFERENCE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/arts/wmca-is-a-radio-station-attuned-to-making-a-difference.html,Tomorrow morning people who listen to WMCA will hear this voice recorded in the upstate New York womens prison known as the Bedford Hills Correctional Facility There are a lot of strangers in here Thats one thing I had to learn when I came in I was sure everyone knew one another except me I was the one outsider And of course were all strangers in here It is the voice of Jean S Harris convicted of the March 1980 fatal shooting of Dr Herman Tarnower the socalled Scarsdale Diet doctor and serving a 15yearstolife sentence It seems so unfair Jean Harriss voice goes on I see women in here and I think if you had lived or gone to the schools my children went to theres no way in the world youd be in prison today Which really isnt very fair is it It will be the first of five days of extended interviews with Mrs Harris conducted by Ellen Sulzberger Straus president of WMCA as part of a series Women Behind Bars to be broadcast every morning this week by the station from 8 to 10 AM In addition to the Harris interviews the series will focus on other women in prison on corrections officers prison officials and volunteer workers But it is the Harris interviews arranged by Mrs Straus with Mrs Harriss attorney Michael Kennedy that have already caused a bit of a stir Unlike the practice prevalent elsewhere of paying for exclusive interviews WMCA did not pay for these interviews Its controversial Were hearing that shes up there for murder and why are we putting her on the air Theres lots of antagonism says Mrs Straus Our view is that Jean Harris is an amazing educator that she is contributing to the process of education in prison She is working in a nursery Her contribution is 10 hours a day educating because she is worried about children Since all prisoners come out sometime and because theres a possibility of rehabilitation reeducation what she has to say is valuable According to R Peter Straus her husband and chairman of Straus Communications Inc which owns WMCA it just isnt enough for a radio station to simply play music send out news broadcasts respond to listeners or even to be benignly relevant You have to take a stand he says And for 40 years WMCA an independent station that bills itself both as Good Guy Radio and because of its callin format The Conversation Station has been taking stands The only non publicly owned family radio station in the country it looks for different ways to do things inserts itself with some force into the citys fabric from time to time makes waves We like to think occasionally we give voice to the voiceless says Mr Straus who is not only chairman of WMCA but also of WFTRWIXVFM in Front Royal Va We want to be broadcasters but we want to make a difference adds Mrs Straus Nor would the Straus family at WMCA which now includes Jeanne the youngest of the couples three daughters as vice president and programming director and their son Eric as local sales manager have it any other way Over the years WMCA was the first station in the country to editorialize on political and civic issues the first to endorse a national Presidential candidate when it announced support for John F Kennedy in 1960 the first radio station to throw cigarette advertising off the air and that was before the Congressional mandate according to Mr Straus the first to take socalled issue advertising from proabortion groups and the Patrolmens Benevolent Association for example and the first station in the city to accept advertisements for contraceptives Lest it be thought the Strauses have been giving all of their time to the Jean Harris tapes it should be noted that the station has been about other business as well business that for broadcasters is quite novel Less than a month ago the station began a series of Conversations With    which places two prominent people together in free discussion The first participants were David Rockefeller and Benjamin L Hooks executive director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People That two public figures conversed is not notable What makes Conversations With    different is that it is not for broadcast Instead the Strauses invite a group of people they usually refer to as community leaders to listen to the conversation then ask members of that group to comment on the conversation to argue differ take stands What were trying to do is bring together leaders of groups in the city who do not ordinarily see each other says Mrs Straus What were doing is focusing on groupings within the city because there is not as much interaction as there once was adds Mr Straus This bodes ill for the city Its nice to see ourselves as a group of villages but we cant be a Lebanon The broadcasts that arise out of these conversations  arranged by Isabelle Leeds the stations director of public affairs  are called My Point of View and are being used as inserts throughout WMCAs broadcasting day WMCAs current format is talk  talk from its ontheair people and feed back from its listeners  and it is successful In the morning two network veterans Bill Ryan formerly one of NBCs star anchors and Ralph Howard a former CBS reporter sit in a studio cluttered with newspapers books scribbled notes halfempty coffee containers their headphones draped over their ears talking about the news interviewing people in the news commenting reading commercials giving the weather skewering the Jets and Giants in collaboration with the stations sportscaster Bill Daughtry all the while seemingly having a good spontaneous time with each other Other regulars include a resident psychologist Dr Elise Goldstein a family finance counselor John Scheuer interviewers Sally Jessy Raphael Barry Farber and Bruce Williams Danny Meenan one of the best street reporters in radio Robert Lowe who has made a neat switch from lawyer and city official to food commentator the quite abrasive yet quite popular Bob Grant and the man who seems to evoke either admiration or active dislike Barry Gray who has been broadcasting on WMCA for more than 30 years These days Mr Gray has sort of returned in time to conversing with guests in restaurants much as he did years ago with daily broadcasts from Chandlers These days it is Tuesdays at Elaines WMCA was not always talk When it was bought by Mr Strauss father Nathan Straus Jr in 1943 it was a middleoftheroad station with music news and features among them a live 30piece symphony orchestra broadcasts from Lindys and each night Five Star Final dramatic recreations of the days news R Peter Straus joined the family business in 1946 after a tour of duty in the Air Force just as the station changed to a popularmusic format From 1950 the year the Strauses were married until 1958 Mr Straus served with the International Labor Organization in Geneva rising to director of the U S office there The couple returned to the station in 1958 he as president of the broadcasting group she as director of public affairs The station was a popular music station throughout the 1960s but changed to talk radio in the next decade the course it has followed since During that period Mr Straus served as assistant administrator for Africa for the Agency for International Development and then from 1977 to 1980 as director of the Voice of America Mrs Straus was an editor and columnist at McCalls during that period in 1977 when Mr Straus became chairman of WMCA and the broadcasting group she was appointed president and manager of WMCA The station has grown to include 75 employees and reaches an estimated audience of one million people a week The Strauses have initiated Call for Action an ontheair ombudsman service that has become a national organization and Crime Stoppers a cooperative effort with police departments that is designed to help solve cases still considered open It too has become a national program Just recently the station became even more of a family affair when daughter Jeanne 26 a Darmouth graduate who had worked for the Associated Press and the White House News Agency joined the station as vice president and programming director followed soon after by her brother Eric 24 who after graduating from Yale and working in sales at other stations became WMCAs local sales manager The Strauss two older daughters Diane Straus Tucker 32 a caterer helps do station parties and Katherine 30 director of special projects for Boston University constantly helps us with special events says Mr Straus Jeanne Straus says she finds it difficult to call her bosses Ellen and Peter because I keep slipping into Mom and Dad  but that is the only bother in a job she enjoys She brainstorms with the producers over who we should be putting on the air who we should be interviewing and rarely does a day go by when the four of us Mom and Dad and Eric all of us dont end up in one office chatting perhaps discussing what we should do as a station to resolve some of the citys problems Adds Ellen Straus When we cant resolve them we editorialize Eric says that his job at the family station is very much a question of proving yourself If they think or I think Im getting bored they throw me an assignment Here its always a challenge youre always working up to even beyond what you think is your capacity

INITIATOR OF 'BABY DOE' CASE UNSHAKEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/nyregion/initiator-of-baby-doe-case-unshaken.html,Lawrence Washburn Jr the lawyer who began the court fight to force surgery on a severely deformed Long Island infant says that despite legal setbacks he still believes that the parents of the baby girl do not have the right to block the operations Mr Washburn a 48yearold municipalbonds lawyer by profession has for the past 13 years pressed right to life lawsuits in many states on behalf of unborn fetuses handicapped minors and severely ill patients Despite a ruling by the New York States highest court upholding the right of the parents to withhold the surgery for Baby Jane Doe as she is known in court papers Mr Washburn says of his effort that he would of course do it again In an interview from Vermont where he lives Mr Washburn said Strictly speaking the parents dont have the right to refuse lifepreserving surgery What the Court of Appeals said was that this is not lifepreserving surgery I think they are wrong on the facts Child Now a Month Old Mr Washburn has never seen the child now a month old and under care at University Hospital at Stony Brook Nor has he met her parents The child suffers from spina bifida an opening in the spine hydrocephaly a buildup of fluid in the skull and microcephaly an abnormally small head Her parents say physicians have told them that part of her cerebral cortex is missing a condition that cannot be corrected Without surgery the infant may live from six weeks to two years With it she may survive until she is 20 but her doctors say she will be severely retarded epileptic bedridden and paralyzed from her waist down Three days after the birth of Baby Jane Doe on Oct 11 Mr Washburn said he received a confidential tip that she was being denied life preserving surgery He sued and a State Supreme Court justice ordered the surgery The ruling was overturned by the Appellate Division in Brooklyn Distressing and Offensive The case reached the states highest court the Court of Appeals in two weeks and on Oct 28 the court said the young couple had the right to withhold surgery In a unanimous opinion the court called the suit distressing and offensive The court said the parents should not have been subjected to the stress and expense of litigating the case particularly since Mr Washburn had no disclosed relationship with the child her parents her family or those treating her illnesses The court chastised both Mr Washburn and the State Supreme Court justice Melvyn Tannenbaum of Suffolk County for failing to call in the states Department of Social Services which has jurisdiction over childneglect cases I accept their criticism Mr Washburn said in the interview I used a procedure I thought they had accepted in the past I have to do some soulsearching now I could have handled it differently with a bit more compassion for the parents Religion Basis for Beliefs A Roman Catholic Mr Washburn said his religious beliefs had a strong bearing on his decision in 1970 to challenge a New York abortion law This was the socalled friend of the fetus case the first suit in which Mr Washburn brought a suit on behalf of an unborn child Since that time Mr Washburn whose father Arthur Lawrence Washburn Sr was a wellknown New York City physician has been a dogged anti abortionist lawyer tracking cases across the country For three years he led the fight along with the America United for Life Legal Defense Fund to defend the Hyde Amendment which limited Federal funds for abortion for poor women Mr Washburn knows well the argument that he is without authority or standing to enter a case in which he suffers no direct harm In the Baby Jane Doe case he faced that issue and agreed to withdraw once a guardian was appointed to represent the infants interests he said Court Fight Succeeds In the Hyde Amendment case he represented a physician who said she was seeking to protect all the unborn in the nation The Supreme Court upheld the Hyde Amendment in 1980 Mr Washburn maintains that the decision by the parents of Baby Jane Doe to choose a conservative course of medical treatment is not valid Along with Dr C Everett Koop the Surgeon General of the United States who was instrumental in bringing a pending Federal suit for the infants medical records he says he believes that every life is sacred and that Baby Jane Doe should be saved He said the risk in these types of cases is that parents will refuse surgery to corrct a physical defect because they do not want to raise a mentally retarded child The parents of the infant who are also Roman Catholic said in an interview that Mr Washburn was entitled to his views but to push those views upon ourselves the father said was unacceptable The Best Professional Help We had the best professional help sitting in with us the father continued The parents said their daughter will not have any awareness of life As for profoundly retarded children Mr Washburn said well they are here to protect they are also lenfants bon Dieu the children of the good God they are given to us because it is our call to heroism to greatness to have a child like this Mr Washburn is affiliated with general practice law firms in Albany and on Long Island He is also associated with a prolife public interest law firm in Huntington LI Mostly he said he volunteers his services for cases involving individual children In the big cases he said the Americans United for Life Legal Defense Fund in Chicago absorbs much of the cost Meanwhile the parents have run up 6000 in legal fees The father said yesterday that this fee was only for state court costs And it continues to grow he said referring to the suit filed by the Federal Justice Department to get the infants medical records That suit is now on the trial level but could go higher said the father a building contractor who described himself as lowermiddle class David D Siegel professor of law at Albany Law School and an expert in New York practice and procedure said there is nothing clearly applicable in New York law that would allow the couple to recover legal fees in the state case What parents in this situation need is some legislative help he said Mr Washburn said the Federal case is taking too long I lost a baby once because I stopped to type papers he said I am concerned that the law is not able to respond to lifethreatening situations such as this Consequently he said he might be forced to enter the Long Island case again I am considering an approach to the US Supreme Court he said
DEVOTED AND MISERABLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/books/devoted-and-miserable.html,THE LETTERS OF JOHN MIDDLETON MURRY TO KATHERINE MANSFIELD   Selected and Edited by C A Hankin 394 pp New York Franklin Watts 1895   THESE are letters never before published that the critic and editor John Middleton Murry wrote to Katherine Mansfield during his 11 years with her as lover and husband Though he wrote nearly every day during their long separations in her search for health this collection includes a little more than half the letters partly because of repetitiveness partly because their relations were at times so unbearably strained that Mansfield may have destroyed the evidence After her death in 1923 along with her stories and journal Murry published her letters in two volumes from which he removed some as too painful for publication He wrote a confessional autobiography Between Two Worlds to perfect her image and improve his own gave public lectures about her and in general bared his soul to the extent that he was accused of exploiting his dead wife He came to be known as the besthated man of letters in the country at one time or another mocked by almost everybody  Bertrand Russell who found him beastly D H Lawrence who called him a coward an obscene bug and a mudworm Virginia Woolf who thought him a posturing Byronic little man an egoist bleating his confessions to absolve himself of blame One wonders whether these letters appearing 60 years after Katherine Mansfields death can in any way alter the concept of Murry as the villain of the piece It seems to me they go far to do so to even things out between two miserable people badly mated destined to hurt each other through a profound difference in their natures one of them desperately fighting for her life and making a frantic cry for the help the other couldnt give The fact that their love remained constant gives their helplessness the more poignancy Five months before she died Mansfield wrote in a letter to be read after her death In spite of everything  how happy we have been I feel no other lovers have walked the earth together more joyfully  in spite of all When they first met in December 1911 Murry was a small nervous shy Oxford undergraduate of 22 the editor of a shortlived periodical Rhythm for which he had accepted one of her early stories Mansfield 10 months older filled Murry with awe at her obvious sophistication beauty and caustic wit She was already married to George Bowden whom she had left after their wedding night she had had several love affairs a miscarriage and an abortion and she was suffering from the tuberculosis that eventually killed her By his fifth respectful letter Murry had begun the apologies typical of him Sorry I was so boring  cant be helped At her urging he moved to London to share her flat at 69 Clovelly Mansions where after a few weeks she always the aggressor asked Why Helen Bevingtons most recent book is The Journey Is Everything A Journal of the Seventies dont you make me your mistress to which waving his legs in the air Murry replied I feel it would spoil  everything When he did become her lover an inept one and the landlord discovering they werent married evicted them they moved from one squalid flat to another to Buckinghamshire even to Paris to escape their creditors It was always the same an odd insecure teetering relationship from which neither could withdraw In February 1915 Mansfield decided to leave Murry to join a new lover Murrys Parisian poet friend Francis Carco in the war zone in France and Murry saw her off at the boat train Im not sad or miserable darling  only just vaguely uncomfortable he wrote that night adding he was coming down with a cold When she returned 10 days later disillusioned by the adventure Murry was busy buying furniture for a flat and putting up shelves in the kitchen Oh Tiggle he wrote we are the lovers of the world We are the lovers that were dreamed by God MANSFIELDS fatal illness not diagnosed till December 1917 marked the real start of the nightmare It lasted with little respite for either of them for the next five years keeping them apart while she sought a cure away from England and grew steadily worse more lonely more terrified more demanding of his love The happy times were spent when he was able to join her briefly in the south of France Italy Switzerland After George Bowden finally divorced her in 1918 Mansfield returned to London seriously ill where on May 3 she and Murry were married though as she wrote from Cornwall to which she fled six weeks later it was only part of the nightmare after all You never once held me in your arms and called me your wife Murry replied My soul was struck dumb with terror at your illness In her devouring need of him she bitterly resented his ability to live without her his passivity his unwillingness to touch her She accused him of wanting to be rid of her He could only protest When I see you sick  ailing I die Close to nervous collapse himself he wrote Im a mean little sneak but it cant be helped Early in 1919 Murry became editor of the literary review The Athenaeum and prospered in his work while Mansfield went to stay on the Italian Riviera not alone but accompanied by her faithful companion Ida Baker His letters enraged her by their hurried tone obtuseness self absorption selfpity She wrote of spitting blood and he wrote of being terribly constipated  No figs thats what it is He sent her a spoon for her porridge called her old girl issued daily bulletins about their cats Yet at the same time he was hunting for a dream house to buy for her finding one in Sussex where he promised they might some day settle down in peace and love and have babies They never lived there AFTER reunions and separations and as her new husband death beckoned and Murrys anguish mounted with a sense of guilt at having failed her in October 1922 Mansfield suddenly went to the Gurdjieff Institute at Fontainebleau and wired her farewell to Murry She sought now the spiritual salvation offered by the mystic George Gurdjieff a step that Murry couldnt understand or condone Communication nearly ceased between them When Mansfield sent for him on Jan 5 1923 I hope you will decide to come my dearest Murry overjoyed to be asked arrived four days later at Fontainebleau They spent a happy afternoon about which Murry recorded She told me she had felt that her love for me had had to die    but now at last she said My love for you has all come back to me greater than ever  At 10 oclock that night while climbing the stairs with him to her room she had a violent hemmorrhage and died Murrys letters in this volume beautifully edited by C A Hankin must be read entirely for what the reader sees in them either to deplore or condone Placed beside hers they become an eloquent presentation of his side of the story By their admissions they portray a weak man indecisive and afraid who might have given more of himself might possibly have prolonged Mansfields doomed life by staying at her side But he wasnt like that In his way he was loyal and persistently loving with an unfailing belief in her as a writer of genius encouraging her till she cried Do not overpraise me After the six troubled often tormented years as her lover he chose to marry her when had he been the coward he was called he might have refused Mansfield for her part chose him again and again the only one and always for love
JOHN GLENN: THE HERO AS CANDIDATE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/13/magazine/john-glenn-the-hero-as-candidate.html,Howell Raines is national political correspondent in The Timess Washington bureau IN SMALL TOWNS ROUNDBELLIED legionnaires snap to attention salute and rush to tell Senator John Glenn the name of the atoll they helped defend in World War II Babies are thrust at him He is asked to autograph 20 bills or shirt cuffs or at a country airport in Iowa the cover of a 1962 issue of Life magazine that bears his photograph over the worshipful caption The Making of a Brave Man At a meeting in Washington the state and local officials of the AFLCIO industrial unions dutifully applaud former Vice President Walter F Mondale the 100 percent union man they will later endorse But when John Glenn comes in they line up with their cameras to snap his picture Thats what happens when celebrity achieved outside the political arena is introduced into an election contest Star appeal worked well for Ronald Reagan in 1980 and it has enabled John Glenn to move from a backofthepack post in the Democratic Presidential sweepstakes to challenge Mondale for the lead The latest New York TimesCBS News Poll shows Democratic voters narrowly split between the two leading candidates with 49 percent for Mondale and 41 percent for Glenn The newly released film The Right Stuff with its portrayal of Glenn as an astronaut hero has given his campaign a publicity sendoff unlike any in the annals of Presidential politics And he is ideally positioned to take advantage of the kind of pratfalls to which frontrunners like Mondale are historically susceptible Yet Glenn has a long way to go He is still struggling to fashion a political persona and a cogent platform of ideas upon which to campaign And for all his nine years in Washington the Senator is still better known as an icon of the Space Age than as a compelling leader whose speeches and legislation shape public and Congressional opinion In fact many Democratic leaders insist that unless Glenn can lift himself to that higher plane occupied by such masterful campaigners as John F Kennedy and Ronald Reagan he will be unable to convert his celebrity into enough votes to win the nomination Moreover in a twoman contest with Mondale Glenn gives away huge advantages in money organization and endorsements from powerful constituency groups and political leaders Even Glenns own strategists maintain that they do not expect him to finish the primary season with a majority of the delegates Indeed they say that if he cannot knock the wheels off the Mondale bandwagon on March 13  the date of the Super Tuesday primaries  Glenn may be out of the running Victories in the South on Super Tuesday however could start him on a roll Such a result would have an impact far beyond the nomination battle itself For one thing it might resolve the identity crisis within the Democratic Party torn today between loyalty to the ideas and political coalitions of the New Deal and the need for fresh policies and a broader appeal to mainstream voters A Glenn nomination could also influence how Americans will select their Presidential candidates in the years ahead The role of party leaders in that process already weakened by the rise of Jimmy Carter in 1976 and Ronald Reagan in 1980 may never be the same if John Glenn takes the nomination For some time political experts assumed that President Reagan would probably win reelection But his economic and social policies have shredded the grassroots electoral coalition he built in 1980 and in the past few months Reagan has become entangled in foreign crises The death of more than 200 Marines in Beirut and the commitment of American troops to the invasion of the tiny Caribbean nation of Grenada have led Democrats to revive the old charges that Reagan is reckless and warlike The Presidents potential vulnerability could strengthen the hand of John Glenn whom the polls identify as Reagans strongest Democratic adversary But first Glenn must get the nomination He has only a few months in which to sell his proposition that he is the most electable candidate of a party that is not yet sure what to make of him T WAS EARLY MORNING AND THE candidate had settled back for the flight to Mississippi He would have preferred to be in the pilots seat of this small jet instead of in the passenger section just as he would have preferred to be reading a flight plan rather than the blackbound briefing book that his secretary Mary Jane Veno had dropped into his lap As he read he also kept an eye out for unusual cloud formations to point out to Annie his wife of 40 years The man who has spent thousands of hours squinting into the sky cannot resist watching it Everyone who knows John Glenn well talks about him as a natural aviator Not even his most worshipful aides call him a natural politician For Glenn elective politics is an addon interest that came fairly late in life and not an original ruling passion But if this sturdy man who looks younger than his 62 years is not a natural he is nonetheless a raw political talent of great potential He is also facing in Mondale one of the most deeply experienced bestorganized and well financed candidates to seek the Presidency in this era What is being tested is whether John Glenns raw talent can be brought to a state of refinement equal to the task before him In fact the learnasyougo Presidential candidate has changed in the last year Two illuminating points in that process A midsummer visit to central Mississippi and a fall forum in New York City On the runway apron in Meridian on that sleepy July morning a welcoming committee pressed forward to meet the Glenn plane as it rolled to a stop Annie get your fanny out there said the candidate as he scrambled out of the jet A tall ruddyfaced stranger approached Glenn and introduced himself He was Maurice Dantin the man in charge of the Glenn campaign in Mississippi Im your state chairman here he said Nice to have you It was a telling scene Mondale knows the Maurice Dantins of America  in many cases he knows their wives and law partners and staff aides  on a firstname basis John Glenn had to spend the first half of 1983 meeting such people for the first time He does better with crowds such as the hundreds of families at the Neshoba County Fair down the road in Philadelphia Miss In a dusty treeshaded campground Glenn was virtually mobbed by autograph seekers This John Glenn  in shirt sleeves sweat beaded on his balding pate  was in his element He is one of the rare politicians who makes firm eye contact and asks peoples names as he works a crowd Other celebrity politicians hand out printed signature cards Glenn still signs autographs Even in such hectic scenes Glenn who was known in the space program for his preternaturally slow pulse beat seems unhurried and accessible But then it was time for him to speak As usual Glenns oratory failed to sustain the excitement created by his arrival His voice skewed upward toward a pipsqueaky tenor on his punch lines His main gesture was the stiff doublehanded chop of a man trying to show how long a fish he had caught Glenns basic speech  outlined on a stack of intricately notated index cards  was a blend of prairie populism and civicsbook patriotism Everywhere that Americans spread off the Eastern seaboard heading west across this country they put up the schoolhouse first hired a schoolteacher and put all the kids in school Glenn said That was something new in our society new in the whole history of the world that all the kids would be in school that education was not just for the wealthy and just for what would have been the kids from the castle in Europe As Glenn plowed ahead it became clear that the speech was a battle map for claiming the broad central terrain between Reagan and Mondale He depicted the President as a cranky ideologue who wanted to roll us back to days of yore He warmly recalled the New Deal social reforms but by adding a chastening word about programs that went too far distanced himself from Mondale When Glenn departed from his notecards however he ran into trouble The Neshoba County Fair has the strongest segregationist identity of any major political event in the South Glenn emphasized his strong record on civil rights but he played to the white crowd by omitting his usual detailed criticism of Reagan for failing to enforce the civilrights laws that are already on the books Later in television interviews that reached Mississippis powerful black constituency he compounded his political error by endorsing the old values the old traditions that are epitomized by the fair Glenn advisers later confirmed that the Neshoba example illustrated the candidates problems with political sensitivity Glenn did not realize that for many Americans the phrase traditional values means segregation or religious discrimination or denial of womens rights Early in the campaign an adviser commented that Glenn was simply not prepared for 90 percent of the groups he goes before  women blacks Democratic regulars By October Glenns campaign skills had improved The problems of political sensitivity still lingered  witness his suggestion at the annual convention of the National Organization for Women that proponents of the equal rights amendment had not worked hard enough for its passage But there were incremental gains in his speaking ability He just got tired of hearing he was a lousy speaker said Robert J Keefe a Washington lobbyist who serves as a senior consultant to the Glenn campaign and exerted his competitive nature against it And the most striking development was the increase in Glenns confidence level There was a general assumption among his opponents that Glenn would be a pushover when it came time for debates with other candidates In fact in a series of joint appearances with the other candidates Glenn held his own demonstrating a welldeveloped ability as a rhetorical counterpuncher The first time all seven candidates appeared together was at Town Hall in New York on Oct 6 Glenn arrived eager to settle a score Several days earlier Governor Cuomo had been quoted as calling Glenn a celluloid candidate Glenn who had been courting the Governor in hopes of an endorsement was angered at what he saw as an implied connection between President Reagans film career and The Right Stuff David Sawyer Glenns media consultant and Greg Schneiders his press secretary urged him to answer the charge at the forum and offered to prepare a response Both men recall that Glenn waved them off No dont bother the candidate said I know what Ill say on that one What Glenn said won him what might have been the biggest ovation of the night As far as the celluloid charge he said I wasnt doing Hellcats of the Navy on a movie lot when I went through 149 missions When I sat atop that booster it wasnt Star Trek or Star Wars  It was an important moment in the political development of John Glenn The way in which he seized a chance to make his point showed some growth in his confidence as a speaker The candidate who had stumbled in Mississippi when he strayed from his note cards could rise to an occasion Whats more he went on that night to confound the predictions of Mondale aides that he would falter when the candidates started mixing it up At the end of the program he challenged Mondale suggesting that his campaign was a captive of special interests  any group with a letterhead and a mailing list In the following weeks Mondale and the newly combative Glenn went at each other and Glenn gave about as good as he got He made some tactical errors  for example attacking Carter Administration programs he himself had supported  but on balance Glenn profited from the exchanges in several ways Mondale and the press had started treating him as Mondales equal in what was now clearly perceived to be a twoman race for the nomination Glenn had cast doubt on Mondales boast that he would be the automatic winner in the series of campaign debates scheduled to start early next year In general the learnasyougo candidate had showed that he was educable But his speaking ability was still far from dazzling and the question of whether he could become a galvanizing television presence was still unanswered The job of converting fame into political power was proving hard Glenn was trying to accomplish on his first time out what had taken Ronald Reagan three tries  and Reagan was a natural Sometimes Glenn seemed to yearn for those simpler days when it did not matter what a man said so much as what he did So last summer as John Glenns campaign plane drifted across the moonlit Gulf from Mississippi to Florida where the next day he would face a union audience that was not particularly eager to hear him his thoughts turned to the things that truly stir him And he spoke longingly of airplanes and rocket ships of Gforces and of the unmatchable feeling of hanging in the straps as his body floated free from the gravity  and cares  of the world OHN HERSCHEL GLENN JR IS A man with three birthdays The private citizen World War II combat flier and career Marine officer was born on July 18 1921 John Glenn astronaut and national hero was born on Feb 20 1962 when he became the first American to orbit the earth And John Glenn the politician was born one night in December 1962 when Attorney General Robert F Kennedy invited John and Annie Glenn to dinner at Hickory Hill the Kennedy estate in McLean Va Kennedy suggested that Glenn run for political office The proposal Glenn recalls did not come as a complete surprise Psychologists at the National Aeronautics and Space Administration had early on decided that among the seven original astronauts chosen in 1959 Glenn was the most eager and the best able to handle public life In the period of wild adulation that followed his 81000mile space journey in Friendship 7 the sandyhaired Ohioan had rubbed shoulders with plenty of politicians including President Kennedy and he had formed some definite impressions For one thing he told friends he was not interested in the House of Representatives The publicityhungry Congressmen always shoving to get into a picture with the hero of the hour had repelled him But the Senate that citadel of power and respectability appealed to Glenn And the Senate was what Bobby Kennedy had in mind The Attorney General confided that his brother believed that Senator Stephen Young of Ohio would be a liability in the 1964 election when Kennedy would be running for a second term Robert Kennedy proposed that Glenn with White House political support and it was hinted with financial and technical help from the powerful Kennedy campaign machine return to his home state and run against Young in the Democratic primary But Glenn held back in part because of a feeling of loyalty to the space program President Kennedys assassination in 1963 prompted a period of reappraisal Glenn began to think more seriously about the Ohio Senate race But he worried about exposing himself and his family to the dealmaking and tradeoffs that he characterized to friends as the ugly side of politics The question Dr Robert Voas a former NASA psychologist recalls was whether Glenn could become comfortable with the kind of compromises that are the lifeblood of politics Finally while on a family vacation at Big Bear Lake in California Glenn reached a compromise with himself He would enter politics with the goal of reforming its ethical structure rather than allowing politics to reshape his own idea of integrity Such was the origin of one of the leitmotifs of Glenns political career the search for opportunities to stand up to political authority figures and to reject the politically expedient course as a means of proving to himself that he had not sold out The roots of Glenns rigid moral code lay in New Concord Ohio and his parents example of Presbyterian rectitude Glenns applepie boyhood and his 23 years of military life also helped form the cluster of related characteristics that Glenn brought to politics Ambition  quiet ambition masked by Middle Western heartiness and chastened by a genuinely devout religious faith but strong nonetheless  is one such trait A kind of determination that lay on the border between fanatical and comical is another For example Tom Miller a retired Marine Corps general Glenns close friend since they were rookie pilots together in World War II and a nextdoor neighbor for many years recalls that Glenn even applied weight to his head to compress his height down to the 5foot11inch maximum for astronauts He wasnt going to miss a trick said Miller Hed be sitting down reading with a big bunch of books sitting on his head In some cases hed put a belt kind of around his chin and hold them or if he was sitting real still reading he could balance them up and read The Miller and Glenn children delighted in teasing the future astronaut about his heightreduction regimen recalled Miller Mine would come back over here and say Uncle Johnnys over there with all them damn books on his head again  Glenn who has a finely tuned sense of personal dignity and is touchy about his public image denies the scene so vividly described by Miller But the anecdote is in keeping with the nothingistoomuch approach he took to the punishing physical regimen required for selection as an astronaut Linked to this determination is a competitiveness and perfectionist drive that makes any defeat or setback almost unbearable The little known private side to Glenns sunny public personality is a tendency toward sulkiness and hurt feelings in the face of criticism or rejection Miller recalled the funk that descended on Glenn when NASA selected Alan Shepard and Gus Grissom for the first suborbital test flights John was pretty hard to live with around here Miller recalled I jumped him one day out in the front yard I said Youre making everybody miserable because your damn pride is so high He wouldnt go anywhere or anything I kept telling him I know theyre saving you for the orbit  The determination Glenn exhibited as an astronaut candidate came into play when Glenns first two Senate campaigns ended badly A serious head injury suffered in a bathroom fall forced him to withdraw in 1964 In 1970 Glenn ran a campaign that relied on his celebrity and patriotic image to draw crowds to his stump speeches He lost the Democratic nomination to Howard M Metzenbaum who mounted a polished expensive television campaign that made Glenns effort look amateurish The most important formative experience of John Glenns political career according to his close associates came in 1974 Metzenbaum who had lost the 1970 general election had been appointed by Gov John J Gilligan to fill a vacant Senate seat As another Senate election approached the Governor wanted to avoid a divisive rematch between Glenn and Metzenbaum and decided that Glenn ought to run for Lieutenant Governor For Gilligan who had national aspirations the plan had the extra benefit of boxing Glenn a potential rival into a secondary position When Glenn balked Gilligan lined up the major county chairmen to pressure him to run for Lieutenant Governor He also arranged a private meeting where 33 members of the state AFLCIO executive council told Glenn face to face that they backed Gilligans plan He was going to manage the state party against me and labor would be against me and everybody would be against me Glenn recalls Then push came to shove and I shoved back Glenns shove was a tellitall public speech to the state Democratic Committee executive meeting in September He described Gilligans plan for him including the private session with the labor chiefs Then he went on to announce his candidacy to oppose Metzenbaum saying he would go over the heads of the labor and party leaders to the people For about a week it really played big in the press David attacks Goliath says William R White Glenns campaign treasurer then and his campaign manager now And it was a good move It helped him raise money It was perhaps the beginning of the building of his financial base with the business community But more important the experience provided a powerful learning experience that reinforced Glenns deepest needs and instincts The Gilligan pressure play provided an opportunity for him to publicly stand for principle over political expedience proving to himself and the world that he had not been coopted His eventual victory over Metzenbaum aided by pollsters professional consultants and television commercials demonstrated that he could not rely totally on the astronaut appeal He also became convinced in a campaign that would provide the model for his current Presidential effort that he could run without the party professionals and labor and still win a Democratic primary And Glenn got one more thing in 1974  a divorce from his original political sponsors He had campaigned for Bobby Kennedy in 1968 been with him in Los Angeles when he was shot and later had broken the news of their fathers death to some of the Kennedy children But in 1974 Kennedys widow Ethel refused to campaign for Glenn Glenn was wounded because he felt that her brotherinlaw Senator Edward M Kennedy had told her that it would be awkward for her to enter a Democratic primary contest against Metzenbaum a Senate colleague The breach between the Glenns and Ethel Kennedy was permanent The incident also caused a chill between Glenn and Ted Kennedy that still exists But in the end it was fortunate politically The voters have not been receptive to the kind of adopted Kennedys that Glenn started out to be Now he could be seen as a new independent Senator rather than part of that sad nostalgiaravaged band trying to raise a patchwork new Camelot from the wreckage of the old hold this space After winning the election in 1974 Glenn came to Washington for a new Senators obligatory round of courtesy calls When a friend asked about his visit with Robert Taft Jr the Republican senior Senator from Ohio Glenn said he had no plans to call on his new colleague Informed that it was the expected thing to do under the unwritten rules of senatorial courtesy Glenn replied incredulously But he campaigned against me It was a prophetic remark Glenn the competitor did not understand that senators do not let electionyear battles disrupt the clubby chumminess that prevails the rest of the time As a member he inhabited the borderland between loner and independent His friendships  with younger Democratic Senators like Sam Nunn of Georgia and David L Boren of Oklahoma or party old timers like Edmund S Muskie of Maine or the late Henry M Jackson of Washington  were firm but not close Over the years Glenn earned the respect of his colleagues as an upright and candid man But he never joined any of the informal caucuses that coalesce around key issues or individuals in the Senate and Glenn never bid for leadership of such groups himself For one thing his celebrity status set him apart Rarely does a freshman Senator show up on the VicePresidential short list as Glenn did in 1976 after less than two years in Washington Also instead of settling into the fellowship of the Senate Glenn used it as a theater where he could act out his independent impulses Ive seen him in several situations where he was frank and candid at his own peril said Senator Nunn He had an option of remaining silent in a couple of places and not making anybody mad when he came forth pretty strongly Glenns behavior followed the familiar pattern in which he seemed to be asserting his prickly sense of integrity as a means of proving that while John Glenn was now in politics he was not of it Glenn also became known for his slowmoving approach to decisions  Glenns staff preferred the term deliberative to describe his exhaustive and to some colleagues and staff agonizingly slow review of all the facts Then once he had taken a stand he was almost impossible to budge In the Senate the defining incident in this side of Glenns character was his feud with President Carter in 1979 over the SALT II armscontrol treaty with the Soviet Union With the revolution in Iran the United States had lost key observation posts that would have enabled Washington to verify Soviet compliance with the treaty The Carter Administration assured doubtful senators that they would soon have observation bases in other countries and an enhanced ability to monitor the Soviet Union by satellite Even such hawkish Senators as Nunn accepted these assurances on the verification issue as adequate but Glenn could not be swayed Hours of study of classified information in the highsecurity cage of the Foreign Relations Committee convinced him that Carters promises were empty because Glenn said the capabilities of the new bases and the satellites would not be known until they were in operation Carter partisans suggested that Glenn had a rifleshot mind that made it impossible for him to judge the treaty in its entirety once he became expert on the narrower issue of verification This criticism that he gets bogged down in details and cannot see the big picture has haunted him ever since I guess the idea was that I should be reasonable and just go along with this hope that we could get something worked out I wasnt willing to do that Glenn says I wanted to know whether we had monitoring capability so we would know what they were doing Fine then Ill be for SALT It was very simple Finally Carter having seen an advance copy of a Glenn speech attacking the treaty called the Glenns home just as the Senator was leaving to give his speech Fifteen seconds later and it wouldnt have happened recalls a Glenn aide What happened despite what Glenn calls his near reverence for the Presidency was a very heated exchange It wasnt a yelling match on the telephone Glenn insists but it was the sternest talk Ive ever had with a President in both directions me to him and him to me both of us At Carters insistence Glenn agreed to drop a couple of paragraphs about SALT II from his speech but he refused to drop his opposition to the treaty Meanwhile the text with the offending paragraphs had already been released to the press and when reporters asked about them Glenn said he left them out of his speech at the Presidents urging Glenn came off looking responsible and candid It was the old formula used a few years before against Gilligan Stand your ground under pressure and then play the situation for maximum publicity On other issues Glenn by following his instinct for independence has created a Senate record that presents real difficulties when it comes to winning the support of Democratic Party constituencies and to presenting himself as a man of Presidential depth and range on the issues No one questions that Glenn has a quick factcrunching intellect but doubts about the breadth and formulative power of his intelligence persist His boosters argue that centrist pragmatic and nonideological candidates are always subject to the criticism that they are fuzzy on the issues But those same advocates acknowledge that Glenns big task as a Presidential candidate is to project an overarching grasp of policy that is not apparent in his Senate record Economic policy has been a particularly troubling area for Glenn His general approach to fiscal policy is moderate but on a key issue the Republicans supplyside economic initiative he has had trouble settling on a position In 1981 for example he voted for President Reagans plan to cut income taxes by 25 percent over three years Now as a candidate he is calling for tax increases saying the Reagan tax cut for which he voted was a windfall for the rich and contributed to intolerably high deficits In a recent interview in his office Glenn settled into an easy chair and talked about his situational economics While other Senators burrow into rooms where the paneled walls are hung with Presidential portraits Glenns office is furnished in the eclectic style of a suburban den He has surrounded himself with model airplanes space artifacts and atop a bookshelf a cast of Durers Praying Hands Asked to explain his support of the Reagan tax cut the most critical economic vote of his legislative career Glenn chuckled Oh he said I defend it just by what happened at that time His vote was a speculative one he explained made after the Democrats failed to muster the votes for a more moderate tax reduction We couldnt do what we wanted and there was always the chance the Reagan program might work as he claimed it would He added So I voted for it with the idea that if it did not work if it did not work as advertised then we would try to change it to tailor it to whatever was happening On defense Glenns record is more consistent and accessible He says he would now vote for the SALT II treaty because verfication is now adequate Although he warns against promiscuous weapons buying he is generally counted a friend of the Pentagon He helped win approval for the B1 bomber and recently voted in favor of a Reagan proposal to spend 130 million on a new type of nerve gas On a number of issues such as education abortion rights for women energy and environment Glenns record has been that of a solidly progressive Democrat But in other cases Glenn has refused to go along with other mainstream Democrats on key policy questions and he has paid a political price Threequarters of the time for example Glenn voted with organized labor but the AFLCIO has never forgiven his single vote against a common situs picketing bill that would broaden the rights of construction unions to put up picket lines Also whereas Glenn presented himself as rigorously proIsrael he offended Jewish leaders by voting to sell F15 aircraft to Saudi Arabia by criticizing the Israeli raid on an Iraqi nuclear reactor and by speaking favorably of negotiations with the Palestine Liberation Organization Whatever the merits or flaws of Glenns Senate record it has earned him no dependable base among the Democratic Partys constituent groups or its political professionals As Glenns advisers prepared to mount a Presidential campaign they searched for a way of presenting John Glenn to the voters that would make a virtue of his independence of mind his lack of party credentials his generally centrist but politically flawed voting record and his refusal to tie himself to labor or other interest groups Bill White the loyal administrative assistant who guided the exploratory effort kept in mind the wellremembered lesson of the disastrous 1970 primary campaign in Ohio People would turn out to see John Glenn the astronaut but they would not vote for him in the absence of a political theme that made sense So throughout 1982 and into early 1983 the fledgling Glenn campaign was a campaign in search of a context for its candidate hold this space As the incident is depicted in the movie The Right Stuff John Glenn whose space flight has just been scrubbed because of bad weather is called to the telephone at Cape Canaveral At the other end of the line is his wife Annie back home in Virginia She is afflicted with a stammer so severe that she considers telephones an instrument of the devil On this day her stammer has turned into vocal gridlock because she is frightened Vice President Lyndon B Johnson is demanding to be admitted to her home so the network news crews can film him comforting the wife of the astronaut over the cancellation of the flight Officials of the National Aeronautics and Space Administration tell Glenn he must order his wife to admit Johnson to the Glenn home Rebelliously Glenn portrayed by actor Ed Harris seizes the telephone and orders his mute and terror stricken wife to keep the door locked Johnson is not to set so much as one toe in the Glenn home Today 21 years later Glenn sa
s the depiction was substantially correct There were threats made back and forth he recalls They said word had been passed that it would be possible that I could be replaced on the flight and that really teed me off I said If you want to call a press conference and announce that Ive been scrubbed off this flight because of this you call your press conference and Ill call mine right afterward and well see who comes out the best  It was a pivotal moment for Glenn and the space program Through such experiences according to the movie Glenn and the other astronauts realized that their fame had become such that they could defy politicians and shape NASA policy For Glenn the incident also provided the tactical model for his later showdowns with Gilligan and Carter Annie Glenn and The Right Stuff are the two wild cards in this campaign Everyone who has been exposed to this remarkable woman and this unusual film agrees that they could have a strong impact on the 1984 campaign But no one is precisely sure how to calibrate that impact For months Glenn fretted privately about the film His staff sternly rejected invitations for him to attend the premiere in Washington on Oct 16 They feared that he would be satirized or ridiculed as the zealous moralizer depicted in Tom Wolfes book of the same title When the first reviews made it clear that the movie depicted Glenn as more heroic than puritanical however Glenns advisers immediately abandoned their strategy of downplaying the films importance Yes it can have an impact said William R Hamilton Glenns pollster But he added analysts are uncertain what it will be For one thing the film has gotten off to a slow start Whats more the audience of most films today is mainly among 18to 24yearolds whose attendance at the polls is light Yet many young people who do vote and upscale white professionals  already identified as key swing constituencies by Mondale strategists  may also get to see the film In any case the movie gave Glenn a burst of favorable publicity at a time when Mondale was piling up a series of union endorsements and strawpoll victories The film also reaffirms the linkage between Glenn and President Kennedy who according to Hamiltons polls is the most positively remembered former President even in conservative states such as Alabama where Kennedy was very unpopular at the time of his death The film may also make Annie Glenn who is already a popular figure in Washington and a revered one among Glenn campaign workers a celebrity in her own right As the movie brutally but accurately shows for the first 50 years of her life while she was raising their two children Carolyn and David Annie Glenn was the virtual prisoner of a stammer so severe that people sometimes thought her retarded But in 1972 she was one of the first patients in a pioneering speech therapy program at Hollins College in Virginia Today she still remembers the surprise telephone call that she placed to her husband and children from Hollins as one of the triumphant moments of her life I could talk Mrs Glenn exclaimed in an interview And on the other end of the line she recalled John cried So in a way the mute and timorous woman portrayed by the actress Mary Jo Deschanel in The Right Stuff no longer exists After a regimen of continued therapy and daily practice Mrs Glenn speaks with a sporadic stammer that is little inhibition to normal conversation It becomes more noticeable when she is tense or speaking without notes but she is capable of wordperfect recitations from a prepared text It is one of the rules of the Glenn campaign that whenever possible this small attractive woman with salt andpepper hair travels with the candidate At all times she radiates the joy of someone who has achieved a new life By doing that she has transformed herself from a ghost presence on the fringes of her husbands life into as one aide puts it the warmth the heartbeat of the campaign She is also being presented as a political asset in the Glenn campaigns first halfhour television program Broadcast recently in Iowa the program shows Mrs Glenn speaking more haltingly than she does when the camera is not on her as she describes her husbands qualities of leadership Finally she says she knows he cares for handicapped people because I am one Annie Glenns presence in the campaign suggests a depth to Glenns personality that is otherwise hard to detect in a man whose history and conversation betray a strict zerodefects mentality Even close friends speak of the humanizing mystery that Glenn would marry someone with so obvious a handicap One of the reasons I like him so much is his relationship with Annie says a longtime family friend Here is this macho guy a test pilot his whole life was devoted to perfection and sure Annie was gorgeous  but she stuttered It just wasnt important to him He simply loved her Some associates of John Glenn see another advantage that they are reluctant to discuss publicly In a general election contest with Reagan Annie Glenns image as a plucky helpmate may be a much more comfortable fit with Middle America than Nancy Reagans Rodeo Drive image of queenly indifference hold this space Greg Schneiders had just arrived at his cluttered office in the Hart Senate Office Building when the telephone rang Glenn was calling from his condominium in Vail Colo The Senator had earlier told an armscontrol group in Iowa that if the Russians dropped a warning bomb in a remote area of the United States he would not respond in kind Then a couple of weeks later Glenn reversed himself Now he was calling Schneiders to ask how the newspapers were playing his change of position Its not great but its no big problem Schneiders told him fingering a clipping Whenever you have to make a decision on the spot like that he added gently youre probably better off using language that supports or amplifies the original statement rather than saying I shouldnt have said it  It was given John Glenns history a startling conversation Throughout his public career he had never admitted a press secretary to his confidence Yet since hiring Schneiders a sharptongued 36yearold with an erect strutting walk Glenn had come increasingly to rely on his advice Regretfully Mondale strategists concede that Schneiders has greatly reduced the chances that Glenn will pull a Romney  that is destroy his candidacy with a blunder such as George Romneys admission that he had been brainwashed into supporting the Vietnam War But in Greg Schneiders Glenn had acquired more than a skilled press aide In 1976 Schneiders had joined the Carter campaign in short order became the candidates traveling companion and close adviser and stayed on to join the Carter White House He brought badly needed national political experience to Glenns noviceladen staff Like Glenn Schneiders was a man of conservative instinct Life in the Carter White House had left him with a deep distaste for the way in which organized labor and other interest groups tried to pressure elected officials into catering to them To no small degree he blamed the Democratic factions for crippling the Carter Presidency So in February 1983 shortly after he joined Glenns staff Schneiders wrote a lengthy memo arguing that Glenn could win the Democratic nomination by defying the conventional wisdom of the party Instead of appealing to the various party constituencies and interest groups with a somethingforeveryone approach Schneiders argued Glenn should pitch his campaign to the broader Democratic electorate to the rankandfile voters who make up a group Schneiders called the constituency of the whole In his memo Schneiders wrote that it was a false premise of conventional political analysis that leaders could deliver the votes of their members For example most polls found that almost half of the AFLCIOs members voted for Reagan Further Schneiders contended a majority of interest group members were more concerned with the general welfare of the nation than with the agenda of their specific group In short order Schneiderss constituency of the whole idea became the guiding gospel of the Glenn Presidential campaign Of course the idea of pitching a campaign toward the broad mass of voters with television as the main vehicle of communication is a conventional generalelection strategy But rarely if ever has a major candidate begun his primary campaign by adopting this approach The phrase and the political theory it entailed fit perfectly with Glenns own deepest inclinations It made a virtue of Glenns lack of rapport with Democratic professionals activists and interestgroup leaders  most of whom were already preempted in any case by Walter Mondale It provided an elevated rationale for the Senate record that Glenn had built by following his instincts In sum Schneiders had come up with the context for which the campaign had been searching Glenn was also charmed by the idea because it fit exactly with his experience in the 1974 Senate race when he won despite the open opposition of labor and the party leaders Thats what I did back home in Ohio when they said they were going to oppose me I went to every union hall he recalls I went in and told the fellows what my views on things were asked them to compare them with my opponents They didnt have to be led around They were smart enough to vote their own consciences and what they thought was important to the future Thats what they did Still many politicians regard the constituency of the whole as a seriously flawed strategy for a primary campaign Their opposition to the idea rests on the arithmetic of the delegateselection process Democratic leaders still smarting over the nomination of political outsider Jimmy Carter in 1976 tailored those rules to make it harder for any candidate to win the nomination simply by building up broad public popularity The new rules shaped mainly by the political allies of Mondale and Ted Kennedy give party leaders and Democratic elected officials a bigger say in naming the 1984 nominee Thirtyone states and territories five more than in 1980 will choose their delegates in party caucuses where highly disciplined cadres such as labor unions and feminist groups have a good record of delivering the vote for their candidates Of the 3931 delegates to the 1984 convention 14 percent will be awarded seats by virtue of holding elective or party office These unpledged delegates plus the 31 percent chosen in the caucuses are presumed to be friendly to a candidate like Mondale who stresses party loyalty This means that Glenn must do extremely well in the 26 primaries that select 55 percent of the delegates to either win the nomination outright or deadlock the convention That is why popular appeal is so essential to Glenns strategy and why anything that enhances that appeal such as the The Right Stuff is an asset It is known that John Glenn in small crowds can attract autograph seekers But to win the nomination he must turn the primaries into what his pollster William Hamilton calls broad participation events in which a surge of voters overwhelms the blocs lined up for Mondale by unions and similar groups To get this kind of turnout Glenn must carry his popular appeal to a new level He must be able to generate the kind of crowd response that John Kennedy did in 1960 and that Ronald Reagan did in 1980 and like those two he must prove to be electrifyingly effective on television Those qualities Glenn has yet to demonstrate As for the overall design of the strategy Hamilton pronounces it risky but possible John Glenn can win the nomination he says Its not going to be easy but it can be done From the outset Hamilton media consultant David Sawyer and field director Joe Grandmaison had doubts about the constituency of the whole strategy Grandmaison insisted on the need for a basic grassroots organization to supplement the media campaign by identifying Glenn voters and getting them to the polls Sawyer warned Schneiders about going too far in demonstrating the campaigns independence For Glenn egged on by Schneiders had seized the concept as a license to taunt the interest groups Glenn had to be reined in and convinced as one adviser carefully put it that it was possible to approach some issues with a bit more political sophistication without giving up an inch of integrity In other words Glenn began speaking to union groups without reminding them that he had voted against the common situs bill that would have broadened their right to picket And there were other concessions to political necessity The United Automobile Workers a power in Glenns home state favored the socalled domestic content bill that would require most foreign cars sold in this country to include some American parts and labor Glenn pronounced himself opposed to the bill in principle but signed on as a sponsor on the grounds that American automakers needed temporary protection Finally under intense pressure from campaign aides worried about Mondales growing lead in gaining the political and financial support of Jewish Democrats Glenn delivered a series of speeches designed to paper over his past criticisms of Israel It was specialinterest politics of a special kind Glenn had no hope of winning over the leadership of labor or the major Jewish organizations But his gestures were intended to block any effort on their part to portray him as a pariah to their members Aside from this damping of Glenns instinct to assert his political independence the constituency of the whole theory has remained the campaigns main strategic dogma Two weeks ago Joe Grandmaison resigned in protest It was a jarring reminder to Glenn and his staff of just how much of a gamble they are taking by staking so much on a macropolitical strategy against Mondale the master of Democratic micropolitics hold this space There is simply no comparison between the Mondale and Glenn organizations In 1982 Mondale strategists decided that no candidate could build a personal organization big enough to handle the frontloaded primary schedule In a period of about three weeks set to begin in late February there will be caucuses and primaries in 23 states So Mondale sought to graft existing organizations such as the AFLCIO and the National Education Association onto his campaign structure The AFLCIOs endorsement of Mondale represents millions of dollars worth of vital volunteer services In the 1982 Congressional election the unions mobilized 145000 volunteers The National Education Association which has also endorsed Mondale has promised to provide campaign workers in every Congressional district in the nation Micropolitics  the taking of a political partys bits and pieces and arranging them into a coasttocoast machine  is a process of addition and Mondale has done it extremely well He has a similar if less commanding advantage when it comes to money He is expected to raise 9 million to Glenns 6 million this year For the first two months of the primaries Mondales aides project a 6 million war chest Glenns staff optimistically projects a 4 million fund for the same period  and Glenn adviser Robert Keefe warns that it may not be enough for a media candidacy Money is terribly controlling in Presidential politics he says People dont lose they run out of money Youre going to have to have 5 to 7 million to spend in the first 60 or 80 days of 1984 to be minimally competitive Mondale believes he has other advantages He has repeatedly stressed his years in the White House a suggestion that Glenn lacks the depth of experience and seasoning needed for the Presidency Also Mondale likes to say that he is the quintessential real Democrat As the campaign has heated up in recent weeks he has forced a major confrontation over Glenns party credentials an area of real vulnerability for Glenn and one in which he has a record of lessthansterling candor At a Washington press conference in 1963 for example Glenn said I have no political affiliations and have always and do now consider myself an independent Once he was quoted as classifying himself as a conservative Democrat or a liberal Republican Before announcing for his first Senate race Glenn met with the Republican national chairman and other GOP officials and said he had given careful consideration to both parties before finally choosing to join the Democrats He also said he sometimes voted Republican in state elections Today Glenn says that he was always a Democrat and consistently voted Democratic Both his parents he says were active Democrats who sometimes held party meetings in their home By flexing its organizational muscle the Mondale campaign hopes to bulldoze its way through the primary season Glenns approach by necessity is more limited Even though he has adopted a broad national strategy he must hit a very small regional target of opportunity in order to stay in the running for the nomination The contest opens with the Iowa caucuses late in February followed by the first primary in New Hampshire Then come the primaries and caucuses set for March 13 including Glenns big opportunities in Alabama Florida and Georgia Says Bill White speaking of the Iowa and New Hampshire contests We can probably come in second in each of those states  if its a good second  and be all right But he adds Going South on March 13 weve got to win something somewhere We cant have Mo Udalls problem and always be second Many analysts believe that Glenn actually needs to sweep the South on Super Tuesday That would underscore his central contention that a traditional Democratic liberal like Mondale cannot take conservative Sun Belt states away from Reagan Conversely a Mondale victory in say Alabama would be a staggering blow to Glenn For after the South comes a series of tests in states such as Illinois where Mondales standing with the Cook County Democratic machine makes him an early favorite If we did not do well in the South on Super Tuesday I wouldnt say the race was over said another Glenn adviser but we would clearly have to rethink our position In the days since Grandmaisons resignation and the elevation of Keefe to a more powerful role both the candidate and his senior advisers have shown a sharpened awarenesss of the need for a minimally competent grassroots organization in the South and elsewhere Regional popularity polls show Glenn either even with Mondale or slightly ahead What would be the impact of a big Glenn victory in the South Greg Schneiders believes that Glenn could use it to issue a populist call to arms to the mass of Democrats to take the party back from the party leaders who have endorsed Mondale His theory If people decide that Glenn would make a better leader for this country then no other political force regardless of being better organized or having the calendar in its favor is going to prevail against them Theoretically that could carry Glenn to the nomination Short of that he could hope to arrive at San Francisco having proved that he is the popular favorite and hoping for a deadlocked convention That would put the nomination in the hands of the 566 appointed and officially uncommitted delegates Mondale is thought to have the larger following among them but they also take their cues from popular sentiment in their home districts It will be a long battle all the way to the convention White predicts unless one candidate collapses completely Mondale and Glenn are not the only actors on the stage The candidacy of the Rev Jesse Jackson may greatly enhance Glenns chances in the South by cutting into Mondales support among blacks Senators Alan Cranston and Gary Hart along with former Senator George McGovern are fragmenting the liberal vote in a way that hampers Mondale On the other hand former Florida Gov Reubin Askew and Senator Ernest F Hollings Jr of South Carolina are a drag on Glenn north and south Some strategists predict Askew could get 10 percent to 15 percent of the vote in New Hampshire luring conservatives who would otherwise probably go to Glenn On balance conventional political analysis points toward a Mondale nomination victory But it is not that simple First the MondaleGlenn matchup is a test of whether traditional Democratic campaigns are still viable in a media age Like a man building the ultimate catapult just as gunpowder is invented Mondale has constructed a wonderful political organization that may in fact be an anachronism Second pollsters on both sides have identified the leadership for the future issue as pivotal Neither candidate has been able to put his stamp on it Glenn strategists believe that Mondale has played into their hands by casting himself as the guardian of outworn Democratic policies However they acknowledge that Glenn is in a critical definition period in which he must transcend the image of the famous former astronaut and present himself as an integrative leadership figure Says David Sawyer As the movie comes out and public attention is focused on him it is terribly important to fill in the gaps Finally the MondaleGlenn contest is one between two public personalities and it is this aspect of the contest that gives Glenns promoters in the Washington political community the greatest hope The tidal flow of the precampaign year they point out has been in Glenns favor He moved from a blip in the polls to a competitive position profiting from the fact that Mondales support seems driven more by duty than by burning commitment Throughout his career one Democratic Party official observes Mondale has suffered from a passion gap To such people Mondale seems to offer the party the solid virtues of an arranged marriage whereas Glenn presents the possibilities  and risks  of a real romance There is one part of John Glenns basic speech for which he never consults his note cards It is the part about war and peace I believe we need a President Glenn says who understands what it takes to defend this country and what we must do to keep our country from stumbling into war At this point Glenns voice often thickens a bit with emotion He speaks of visiting the next of kin and those who know Glenn know that he is probably thinking of Monte Goodman a young pilot from Pennsylvania Goodman was Glenns wingman all the way through flight school and he died in their first combat mission knocked down by Japanese antiaircraft fire off Maloelap Island After the battle Glenn and Tom Miller refueled their fighters and searched for hours over the blue Pacific waters hoping that Goodman had somehow survived All they found was an oil slick After the war Glenn went to Harrisburg Pa to visit Monte Goodmans parents I served 23 years in the Marine Corps Glenn continues I served in World War II and Korea I dont take a back seat to anyone in my support for a strong defense But I know something else out of that background I do not have to watch latenight television watch a movie to find out what combat is like This line has been in Glenns speech for months It is meant to remind audiences that while Glenn and thousands of other young Americans were at war Ronald Reagan was making Army training movies in the safety of Culver City Calif and that in a GlennReagan race Americans would have a choice between an incumbent who made movies and a challenger about whom movies are made As recently as a year ago some political oddsmakers believed that Reagan given a continued economic upturn would be unbeatable in 1984 The economy has continued to improve but Reagan seems suddenly vulnerable in the foreignpolicy realm Just as the Presidents aides launched his reelection campaign two events  the Marine massacre in Beirut and the American invasion of Grenada  created a climate of military crisis that may strengthen Glenns claim that he is the Democrats strongest candidate against Reagan Now with flagdraped coffins being shipped home from foreign battles Glenns argument that a soldier President would know how to be both firm and restrained has a new political sting Glenn has acknowledged that the military action in Grenada was probably justified if American civilians on the island were in danger But he added military force should be used only as a last resort and if the President is right so far on Grenada he has been wrong on Lebanon for a long time Reagan he said had put the Marines in jeopardy in Lebanon without defining either the nations diplomatic goals or a military mission for the troops Despite their differences in background and experience Glenn and Reagan may go into history as playing very similar roles in the histories of their parties So complete is Reagans command of the Republican political structure that it is easy to forget that the party establishment fought doggedly to prevent his nomination attempting as late as March 1980 to lure President Ford out of retirement to block Reagans march to the nomination But Reagan reached over the heads of the party leaders using the medium of television as his main vehicle of communication John Glenn in his way is following the same course Today the stage is set for a showdown of theories and personalities that may have a big impact on the future of American campaigns For some time the political parties have been in the twilight of their power as television challenged their role as main mediator between voters and Presidential candidates Confronted by Glenn and his constituency of the whole candidacy Walter Mondale has rallied the Democratic establishment It is a defining moment A Glenn victory in the primaries followed by a GlennReagan general election contest would strongly suggest that the parties had all but lost their role as the instruments of candidate selection,,
ONCE-HOSTILE VATICAN FORGES CLOSE LINKS WITH SCIENTISTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/14/world/once-hostile-vatican-forges-close-links-with-scientists.html,Catholic womens representatives and bishops met to discuss womens role in the church Page B7 ROME Nov 13  The Roman Catholic Church once a symbol of dogmatic opposition to modern science is moving into its closest collaboration with scientists in at least a century On issues ranging from nuclear war to testtube babies to the evolution of human life the Vatican is soliciting technical advice from hundreds of the worlds leading scientists including Nobel Prize winners experts in esoteric fields and technical leaders from developing nations Most of these experts are not Catholics and many do not even believe in God or in organized religion Pontifical Academy Meets The chief mechanism for this wide ranging effort is the Pontifical Academy of Sciences which is now holding its biennial plenary session and three related scientific meetings at a magnificent Renaissance villa on the grounds of the Vatican This is the group the Pope addressed Saturday when he called on scientists to shun laboratories and factories of death apparently meaning military weapons projects The Popes address a major discourse on science and peace drew heavily from materials supplied by the academy in calling for an end to technological colonialism and wasteful military expenditures But its major theme that scientists should abandon research that can be used for war seems to have been formulated by the Pope himself Some 115 scientists are attending the Pontifical Academys sessions to discuss four major topics chemical events that threaten to disrupt the environment interactions between complex biological molecules like proteins and nucleic acids modern biological techniques for improving agriculture and science in the service of peace How profound the academys influence on church thinking will ultimately be is open to question One observer Paul Abrecht director of the World Council of Churches department of church and society notes that the academy has a very small staff and does little more than hold meetings This looks like a priority but I wonder he says The scientists are all enamored with the idea that somehow they will get a big platform if the Pope comes to speak to them and that suddenly the world is going to move in the right direction I think its an illusion Moreover other outside experts say the church will always be unswayed by scientific arguments that conflict with its moral positions particularly those involving sexuality Nevertheless the sessions here now are no mere ceremonial gatherings The scientists are putting in long days virtually trapped deep inside the Vatican from 9 in the morning until 6 at night The quality of discussion is often as sophisticated as that at conferences sponsored by leading scientific societies according to many participants I came here expecting nothing but a visit to the Vatican Museum and St Peters said James G Anderson a geochemist at Harvard University who was invited to the academys session on chemical threats to the environment But it turned out to be much more than that I was stunned at the quality of the presentations Recalling one paper on the environmental consequences of nuclear war Thomas F Malone a Butler University expert on climate and weather who was invited to the same session called it one of the more impressive papers that Ive heard in the last 43 years The current sessions are part of a systematic and accelerating effort by the church to tap the vast range of knowledge generated by modern science Unlike the theologians of the 17th century who refused even to look through Galileos telescope lest they see something to upset their faith todays church leaders appear determined to keep abreast of the latest advances in science to avoid unnecessary conflicts between religion and science and to help guide science in directions beneficial to humanity The Pontifical Academy is by far the most elaborate mechanism set up by any major church to interact with leading scientists Although Protestant and Jewish organizations often consult with scientists on specific issues no other church has established a permanent scientific senate as the Vatican calls it to provide continuing scientific oversight Academy Founded in 1847 Although the intensity of the scientific effort is new scientific consultation by the Vatican is not The academy was begun with papal sponsorship in 1847 and was given a modern shape and title in 1936 But for most of its life it has been largely ceremonial Only in the last 5 to 10 years participants say has it become vigorous The number of scientific meetings and of the participants has quadrupled over the last eight years The budget has correspondingly risen to about 400000 this year The Vaticans interest in science has really increased said Dr Carlos Chagas a 73yearold Brazilian neurophysiologist who became president of the academy in 1972 Not since the days when many priests were scientists a century ago has the church been so closely involved with scientists Part of the increased interest has to do with Dr Chagass energetic leadership But observers also note that Pope John Paul IIs intellectual interest in science and philosophy is a factor as well In his address to the members of the academy Saturday Pope John Paul declared Today more than ever the Catholic Church is your ally this church which loves true science and right thinking Have courage and the boldness of reason that untiringly seeks the truth and you will find in the church and in this Apostolic See your most convinced ally Some Strong Influence Seen The academy seems to have strongly influenced the hierarchy on some issues Based on academy studies and recommendations Pope John Paul endorsed nuclear power as a useful form of energy approved most forms of genetic engineering except for research on human embryos and voiced greater concern over the dangers of nuclear war At the academys instigation he sent scientists to four world capitals to warn heads of state of the devastating consequences of a nuclear war and he approved the convoking of a conference of the heads of national scientific academies to draft principles for preventing nuclear war The academy brings an unusual array of distinguished scientists into contact with the church Alexander Rich a biologist from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology who has been a member for five years once jotted down a list of the physicists elected to the academy in recent decades It was absolutely overwhelming he says It read like a Whos Who of modern physics people who have transformed the whole subject The current roster has 71 scientists all elected for life of whom 26 are Nobel Prize winners It has a decidedly Western flavor the United States has 16 members Italy 10 and France and Britain 8 each Some two dozen other nations are represented none with more than three members the Soviet Union has none The selection criteria according to Dr Chagas require that members lead exemplary personal lives be outstanding scientists and supply whatever disciplinary and geographical balance is needed in the academy 25 of 71 Practicing Catholics Neither religion nor race is a factor in choosing members Only about 25 of the current 71 members are practicing Catholics according to Dr Chagas whereas more than a dozen including some of the most active members are Jews No inquiries are made about the religious beliefs of the members and the academy includes Anglicans other Protestants Moslems and possibly a Hindu not to mention agnostics and others the church labels nonbelievers The nonCatholics cite a variety of reasons for joining the flattery of being wooed by the church an opportunity to meet with famous colleagues an allexpensepaid trip to Rome every two years spouse included the hope that the academy might prove influential I dont have any strong brief for the Catholic Church in view of its past history says Christian B Anfinsen a Nobel laureate from Johns Hopkins University But I thought it would be interesting Dr Anfinsen was an agnostic all his life but he converted to Judaism five years ago to marry an Orthodox Jew Beyond the members themselves the academy invites hundreds of experts from relevant fields to participate in its weeklong studies on specific topics ranging from energy to cancer to parisitic disease More than 250 such outside experts have come to Rome over the last three years alone PICK UP 1STLAST ADD VATICAN From the perspective of most of the scientists who attend the proceedings are not much different from any other highcaliber scientific meeting They present papers argue about concepts and doze in their chairs after a heavy winesweetened lunch They seldom talk directly with anyone important in the Vatican hierarchy and have no specific idea what if anything the church does with their findings Academy Fills Several Purposes But from the churchs perspective the academy serves several important purposes It promotes progress in science always bearing in mind as Dr Chagas puts it that science has to be geared for human benefit and not for the benefit of the rich people or political classes It allows the church to keep track of scientific advances that might pose ethical moral or theological problems It gives the Pope a forum for exhorting leading scientists to bring a moral dimension to their work And it provides a pool of eminent scientists who can join with the church in pursuing mutual goals such as controlling the nuclear arms race or improving the lot of the impoverished In such cases both the church and the scientists seem pleased with the opportunity to use the prestige and influence of the other Whatever ideological conflicts may once have pitted religion against science seem to have dissipated for the most part Two years ago after an academy study week on astrophysical cosmology put man still further from the center of the universe than anything Galileo had ever proposed Pope John Paul told the academicians how highly the church esteems pure science He said their findings did not conflict with the Bible which does not wish to teach how heaven was made but how to go to heaven Evolution Largely Accepted Last year a meeting of 12 scholars convened by the academy concluded that masses of evidence from paleontology and molecular biology support beyond serious dispute the concept of human evolution a theory that was opposed by Catholic theologians in the last century and that still sparks opposition from fundamentalists today One of the participants J M Lowenstein clinical professor of medicine at the University of California Medical School in San Francisco later called the meeting historic because the highest scientific body of the Catholic Church produced a strong statement supporting evolution just a few weeks after the 100th anniversary of Darwins death The view of the Vatican was much more liberal than I thought it would be says Dr Anfinsen They said evolution is fine and we agree it happened that way but we reserve the right to read a soul into developing animals when man comes along Some members of the academy believe that certain subjects involving conflicts with church doctrine such as the use of contraceptives to curb population growth are taboo We are neither asked nor have we tried to make a pronouncement on that question says the Nobel laureate David Baltimore an academy member from MIT Its an embarrassment to all members of the academy who feel as I do that the lack of birth control is a big problem And Dr Abrecht of the World Council of Churches said one thing embitters the debate between Catholics and those of other faiths on scientific issues This is the question of human reproductive biology which he called forbidden territory that frightens the wits out of Catholic leaders He said Pope John Paul had reaffirmed Catholic opposition to contraception and abortion in such a way as to make it even more difficult than it was before to discuss some of these questions of science and technology Session on Contraception Seen But Dr Chagas says the academy can consider the scientific aspects of virtually any issue including contraception He added that he plans to schedule a meeting on the technical aspects of different forms of contraception in the next year or two The Pope has repeated many times that he is not afraid of what we call scientific truth Dr Chagas says I have had no problem at all with the hierarchy here in any of my activities The academys biggest concern in recent years has been nuclear war and how to prevent it an issue on which the hopes and fears of many scientists and religious leaders coincide In 1981 the academy held a study of the medical consequences of nuclear war after which the Pope sent small groups of academy members to carry the warning to government leaders in Britain France the Soviet Union and the United States The delegations said they had been received cordially and had engaged in substantive discussion by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher of Britain and by Leonid I Brezhnev then the Soviet leader but had been given only a 20minute standup meeting with President Reagan The Pope has used the academys nuclearpolicy statements in major speeches but they seem to have had less political effect than the parallel move by American bishops on halting the nuclear arms race
SENATE APPROVES RIGHTS PANEL BILL,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/15/us/senate-approves-rights-panel-bill.html,The Senate today voted 783 to approve a restructured United States Commission on Civil Rights Supporters said the bill which divides appointment powers between the President and Congress would assure the continued life and independence of the agency Earlier by a vote of 42 to 34 the Senate jettisoned an antiabortion rider that had evoked threats of a filibuster The motion to shelve the rider came from Senator Strom Thurmond Republican of South Carolina chairman of the Judiciary Committee and one of the most conservative senators We have worked too hard on this bill said Mr Thurmond referring to the commission bill We cannot afford to jeopardize it The commission vote ratified a compromise reached Thursday between President Reagan who had sought to install his own appointees and senators advocating independence for the bipartisan advisory agency Judge Bars Reagan Interference A Federal district judge today barred the President from preventing or interfering with the work of two commission members who had sued to block his attempt to dismiss them Judge Norma Holloway Johnson granted a preliminary injunction to the two commission members Mary Frances Berry and Blandina Cardenas Ramirez both Democrats on the ground that there is a substantial likelihood that the President lacked power to dismiss them Judge Johnson said in a 14page opinion that there is adequate evidence in the legislative record to support plaintiffs contention that Congress intended the duties of the commission to be discharged free from any control or coercive influence by the President or Congress Mr Reagan whose civil rights policies have been repeatedly assailed by the sixmember commission nominated three men to replace Miss Berry Mrs Cardenas Ramirez and Rabbi Murray Saltzman in June Mr Reagans choices were Morris Abram a civil rights lawyer John Bunzel of the Hoover Institution and Robert Destro a Catholic University law professor All shared the Presidents opposition to school busing and hiring quotas After Senate confirmation proceedings became mired in controversy Mr Reagan notified the three commissioners on Oct 24 that they were dismissed effective immediately Rabbi Saltzman is not a party to the lawsuit The effect of todays decision will be limited if the bill passed today by the Senate becomes law The current commission whose members are nominated by the President and confirmed by the Senate is due to expire Nov 29 House Approval Expected In the House Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr told reporters that the bill doesnt go far enough in view of the President and his anticivilrights record But Representative Don Edwards chairman of the constitutional subcommittee of the Judiciary Committee said he expected that the House would adopt the measure this week Youd always rather have things your own way but its a workable compromise he said The Senateapproved compromise provided that commissioners could be dismissed only for cause The present sixmember commission would be replaced by an eightmember body The President and Congress would each name two Democrats and two Republicans The President would appoint the staff director chairman and vice chairman with the concurrence of a majority on the commission The measure provided for a sixyear authorization after which Congress again would have to act to preserve the commission Its a tremendous victory for the civil rights community Senator Joseph R Biden of Delaware ranking Democrat on the Judiciary Committee said after the voting It means that neither this President nor any other President can fire a commission member because that member differs with his views It means well have an independent commission from now on Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts said Once again the Congress and the American people have joined to defeat a White House attempt to roll back weaken and undermine Civil Rights protection for women and minorities The Senate majority leader Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee called the voting a major contribution to the welfare of the country Three conservative Republicans cast the only dissenting votes They were Jesse Helms and John East of North Carolina and Steven D Symms of Idaho This bill is superfluous Senator East told the Senate noting the commissions 115 million budget The cost cannot be justified in a period of attempting to cut deficits The antiabortion rider to the commission was offered by Senator Roger W Jepsen Republican of Iowa who said The most fundamental civil right is the right to life without it no other right is secure The rider would have declared a Congressional finding that life began at conception prohibited the use of all Federal funds for abortions and provided a right of direct appeal to the Supreme Court in all cases deriving from a states abortion laws Senator Bob Packwood

U.S. AMMENDMENT ON EQUAL RIGHTS BEATEN IN HOUSE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/16/us/us-ammendment-on-equal-rights-beaten-in-house.html,Rollcall vote page B5 WASHINGTON Nov 15  After a bitter partisan debate the House of Representatives today narrowly defeated a sudden move to revive the proposed equal rights amendment to the Constitution The amendment guaranteeing equal rights for women was scheduled for floor action by the Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr after the Democrats acted Monday to suspend the normal rules and limit debate to 40 minutes and bar modification of the measure The suspension of rules is normally reserved for noncontroversial legislation Using the tactic for the proposed equal rights amendment which has a long and tortuous history infuriated the Republican minority in the House many of whose members support the constitutional change Six Votes Short The vote 278 for passage and 147 against was six votes short of the two thirds majority needed to send proposed constitutional amendments to the states for ratification The Democrats divided 225 to 38 in favor of the measure Republicans opposed it by a margin of 109 to 53 Republicans denounced the tactics of the Democratic majority saying they were acting despotically and cynically using the womens rights measure to churn up an election issue The Democrats said that an equal rights amendment had been debated for 60 years and that the Republicans should vote on principle instead of casting a negative vote because they found the procedures offensive Abuse of Power Do you want to hide behind something Mr ONeill asked in summing up the debate Youre not fooling anybody The House Republican leader Robert H Michel of Illinois said Most of us have spent more time in line to see a movie than we have been given today to debate an amendment to the Constitution of the United States The majority is engaging in an abuse of power that would bring a blush to the cheeks of the most absolute despot of antiquity he said A number of proposed amendments to the equal rights measure did not reach the floor because of the rules suspension The wording changes dealt with such issues as abortion the conscription of women in wartime and the constitutionality and taxexempt status of allmale and all female institutions of learning The resolution before the House was worded as follows Equality of rights under the law shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any state on account of sex The Congress shall have the power to enforce by appropriate legislation the provisions of this article An identically worded article was approved by both houses of Congress in 1972 and then went through laborious debates in the ensuing years in the legislatures of all 50 states That proposal died when its time limit for ratification expired in June 1982 still three states short of the necessary approval of 38 legislatures Classic Lean Language The move to revive the proposal began in January when Mr ONeill said its consideration would be one of the top priorities of the 98th Congress At a briefing before the vote today Mr ONeill said the suspension of the rules had been decided upon at least in part because he doubted very very much whether some of the proposed amendments could have been defeated In the debate the Speaker said the resolution as drafted was in the classic lean language that suits an amendment to the Constitution The Democratic strategy enraged Representative Hamilton Fish Jr Republican of New York whose name is second among sponsors of the resolution after that of the Judiciary chairman Representative Peter W Rodino Jr Democrat of New Jersey Mr Fish said he had long supported the equal rights amendment but we face a cynical and partisan decision that undermines the bipartisan support the measure had had in the past Well Bring It Back Up Mr Fish said of the Democratic move I suggest it is less a commitment to equal rights than it is more of what we have witnessed repeatedly this fall partisan politics in search of a campaign issue A no vote is not a vote against ERA but a vote for respect for the United States Constitution Representative Dick Cheney of Wyoming the No 3 Republican in the House said There was a lot of opinion on our side of To hell with it  vote it down and well bring it back up  later Mr Rodino asked whether the negative Republican votes would be used by Democratic candidates in campaigning smiled and shrugged Christopher Matthews a spokesman for Mr ONeill said the rollcall could be the death knell for Republican Congressmen from suburban wine andcheese districts that go for Reaganomics but are strongly in favor of the amendment affecting womens rights One aide to a top Democrat said that his partys leaders doubted they would win the vote today but that with the roster of Republican nays Democratic campaign strategists were licking their chops

BISHOPS TO DRAFT STATEMENT ON CATHOLIC WOMEN'S ROLE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/18/us/bishops-to-draft-statement-on-catholic-women-s-role.html,Buoyed by its recent success in hammering out a pastoral letter condemning nuclear arms the National Conference of Catholic Bishops voted today to make a statement about the role of women in the church Bishop Joseph L Imesch of Joliet Ill chairman of the committee on women in the church said the statement a pastoral letter that would take at least four years to write would examine the possibility of wider roles for women within the boundaries of Roman Catholic Church law Women may not now be ordained as priests nor may parishes use altar girls Bishop Michael H Kenny of Juneau Alaska told the bishops Some of the injustices toward women are in our own house In their final day of meetings the bishops issued a pastoral letter on ministry to Hispanic people and affirmed Central American church hierarchies opposition to the use of force to resolve the regions conflicts They also endorsed a progress report by Archbishop Rembert Weakland of Milwaukee on a pastoral letter on Catholic thought and the American economic system Like the proposed statement on women the document on the economy is expected to generate much debate when it is issued probably by 1985 Pressure by Vatican In their fourday session the bishops indicated in many ways their desire to continue to address difficult issues They also showed signs of caution in the face of some Vatican pressures to better promote the churchs teachings on sexuality In the past few months most American bishops have made their regular visits to Pope John Paul II In those visits the Pope and top Vatican officials expressed some unhappiness that large numbers of American Catholics were not heeding those teachings Some of this unhappiness has been linked to the aspirations of American Catholic women for a much greater role in the church including ordination As the bishops voted without dissent to issue the pastoral letter on women they insisted they would abide by the Vaticans flat rejection of women as priests Some said privately however that the issue would be difficult to avoid Archbishop John R Roach of Minneapolis the retiring president of the bishops conference said the present strains indicated a period of growing maturation in relations between the American hierarchy and the Vatican and represented a new test of collegiality Many bishops said however that he was only putting the best face on a confusing and distressing situation Officials of the conference agreed that certain tensions had complicated their relationship with the Vatican but denied that the Pope had been critical of them in his recent admonitions Some bishops suggested that the Pope was actually talking more to the American laity than to the bishops in urging greater moral discipline Issue Is Serious Matter Bishop Imesch said the pastoral letter on women would include a look at their history and present status explore ways that the talents of women could be better used in the service of the church and encourage and affirm the roles women are already fulfilling Joseph Cardinal Bernardin who was chairman of the war and peace committee which produced the statement on that topic said the issue of women was one more serious matter we face It is not a passing phenomenon and we cannot respond by ignoring it or treating it superficially Some prelates including Bishop Ernest L Unterkoefler of Charleston SC noted that some women had voiced objections to an allmale group writing about women Bishop Unterkoefler said the issue of male dominance was important and should be addressed in the pastoral letter A conference on women in the church was held for the two days before the bishops meeting More than 100 bishops joined 50 representatives from womens organizations to discuss the theological and historical factors that led to womens current status in the church Reasons for Current Status A growing number of scholars believe women have been barred from the Catholic clergy for primarily secular rather than sacred reasons Feminists see the chief problem as patriarchal structures that were absorbed into the church despite the tendency toward equality found in the earliest decades of the church and in the example of Jesuss treatment of women As feminism has challenged church policy and women have become more opposed to the restrictions against them many have left the church or exist at the fringe Church leaders have become increasingly worried about this trend and the pastoral letter is seen as a way to address it Another matter of concern to women is how much communities of nuns have heeded the Second Vatican Councils call for renewal of religious structures in reference to the modern world Nuns have gone to great lengths often through painful testing to adapt their lives and ministries to presentday needs Many see the Vatican as fighting against their progress Among the American bishops a rising number see the need to reinforce the adaptations nuns have made in the past 15 years Study of Religious Orders The pastoral letter on womens roles coincides with a study of American religious orders recently ordered by the Pope Though Archbishop Pio Laghi the Apostolic Delegate to the United States referred to the study as a pastoral service in remarks to the bishops many nuns have expressed fears that the project may be a Vatican effort to root out dissent and nonconformity By adopting the pastoral letter on Hispanic people the bishops highlighted an area of the church that is burgeoning Hispanic people make up a third of more of all Catholics in some parts of the country including Miami Los Angeles and New York The bishops document recognizes the place of Hispanic culture within the church and pledges resources to aid ministries to Hispanic people including programs to fight injustice Peace Theme Continues The bishops pastoral letter on war and peace completed last spring remained very much on their minds this week Bishop Kenny for example in responding to the view that male clerics should not write about women said the bishops had encountered similar charges that they were out of their field of expertise in preparing the pastoral on nuclear war Cardinal Bernardin who has assumed the chairmanship of the Bishops ProLife Committee in place of the late Terence Cardinal Cooke vowed to tie the antinuclear theme to a renewed campaign against abortion All life issues constitute a seamless garment Cardinal Bernardin said He said his committee would press the connection between the promotion of peace and the promotion of the life of the unborn more vigorously and extensively than had been possible in the war and peace document Several bishops also urged their colleagues to continue to apply the principles of the pastoral letter on nuclear war to current developments in the arms race Asserting that the arms race continued to escalate Bishop Thomas A Gumbleton of Detroit said We as leaders need to be involved in that debate

BREAKUP OF BLACK FAMILY IMPERILS GAINS OF DECADES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/us/breakup-of-black-family-imperils-gains-of-decades.html,At the height of the civil rights movement in 1965 when a quarter of black families with children were headed by women Daniel Patrick Moynihan wrote in a report to President Johnson that this growing matriarchy was an important cause of poverty among black Americans Mr Moynihan then a White House aide created a furor accused by many of blaming the victims for their distress Today 18 years later virtually half of black families are headed by single women and 55 percent of black babies are born to unmarried mothers Gunshy from the Moynihan experience authorities for years were reluctant to speak out about the problem But now politicians and scholars  black and white liberal and conservative  openly agree that the situation has reached such proportions that it threatens to undo the black economic gains of the past three decades Growing Alarm Among Blacks The breakdown of traditional family structure is they say one of the underlying causes of black poverty not only because there is no man to provide family income but also because women on the average earn much less than men Moreover many black spokesmen are saying for the first time that this is one of the most serious problems facing their communities and that it may mean that larger and larger proportions of coming generations of blacks will grow up disadvantaged Eleanor Holmes Norton a law professor at Georgetown University who was chairman of the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission in the Carter Administration termed the family crisis a threat to the future of black people without equal The problem must be resolved the experts say because otherwise society at large will have to pay the price either in compensatory measures to prop up fractured lives or in strife and social conflict as the gap widens between the privileged and the excluded An Unmistakable Correlation It is an open question which is more important that breakdown in family structure causes poverty or that poverty is a cause of the breakdown But the correlation between the two is unmistakable and it is prompting a serious debate over the causes of the problem and a search for solutions A study last summer by the Center for the Study of Social Policy a nonpartisan research group showed that in all races families headed by women were twice as likely as twoparent families to be poor Half of all families headed by black women have incomes below the poverty line the study showed The study noted that in 1981 the average income of black families with two working parents was 84 percent of the average for white families where both parents worked an increase from 73 percent 13 years earlier In contrast a primary reason that the average income for all black families with children was just 56 percent of the average for whites the study concluded was that 47 percent of black families were headed by women as against 14 percent of white ones Losses Exceed Gains Since black femaleheaded households are the most rapidly increasing proportion of all black families the fact that they have not gained economic ground has more than offset the increases made by other types of black families the report said The principal author of the report was the director of the center Tom Joe who was a welfare official in the Nixon Administration In one sense according to some experts single black mothers may represent a vanguard These experts suggest that more and more white women will become single parents as they build a longer tradition of working and financial independence But the farreaching effects on the black community might be mitigated among whites partly because white women tend to get divorced less often than blacks and tend more often to remarry The problems of single mothers black and white are compounded by the fact that working women on the average earn much less than men According to the Census Bureau the median earnings of working black women last year were actually slightly higher than those of working white women 7802 as against 7640 But the average working man earned about twice as much 15373 With the next generation Mrs Norton said we could see proportionately greater numbers of disadvantaged people than in this generation because of the proportion of children who got their start in life as the children of single girls and women Experts Voice Disagreement While the politicians and social scientists agree that the dissolution of the black family structure has been a main cause of poverty among blacks they disagree sharply over why such disintegration has occurred and over the possible remedies One camp which includes many members of the Reagan Administration argues that the nations welfare system has encouraged families to split up and has led to a state of welfare dependency for generation after generation of blacks They would reduce Government social programs require able individuals on welfare to work and place more emphasis on apprehending fathers and forcing them to support their children Another camp comprising many liberals and most but not all black scholars believes that the causes are much more complex but center on the history of discrimination against blacks in this country and the inability of black men to find work to support their families They say the situation would be much worse if not for Government welfare programs and they would expand both those programs and various social services designed to counsel black families discourage teenage pregnancies and help single women with children to make it on their own Here are the arguments advanced by the experts in both camps Welfare For many years the nations primary welfare program Aid to Families with Dependent Children denied benefits to families if an adult male was in the house That bar was stricken in 1968 and states were permitted but not required to cover twoparent families in which the wouldbe breadwinner was unemployed or underemployed Some people believe that the maninthehouse rule has contributed to family breakup by forcing fathers to leave the home Others disagree Mr Joe for example noted that New York New Jersey Connecticut and 18 other states which together account for 70 percent of the nations families on welfare offer aid that covers unemployed fathers in the home Yet only about 300000 such families are covered out of a national welfare caseload of 36 million families War on Poverty Is Blamed The conservative economist George Gilder asserts that conservatives were right in their prediction that the income redistribution programs of President Johnsons war on poverty would result in destroying the incentives and families of the poor In an attack this fall on what he termed the welfare state disaster Mr Gilder wrote Current programs will continue to create a criminal underclass of unlisted male welfare beneficiaries who exploit the welfare trap by living off a series of female recipients  and extend it by violence ever deeper into the heart of our cities and our national consciousness Mr Joe whose organization has been conducting a detailed study of the Reagan Administrations 1981 cuts in welfare programs said a dual system of family law one for the rich the other for the poor was evolving He cited as an example a new welfare regulation requiring he said that if a stepfather enters the home hes liable for not only the support of the mother but also all of the kids He said this meant that a working man who wished to marry a woman on welfare would face the prospect of assuming responsibility for the support of children that were not his Many states New York among them have had difficulty even defining what a stepfather is Mr Joe added Poverty Culture Disputed Socalled culture of poverty theories have long held that dependence on welfare can become so entrenched that it creates its own subculture with values that encourage remaining in poverty and attitudes that discourage selfreliance A pioneering study by the University of Michigans Institute for Social Research one of the few research projects that followed welfare recipients for many years disputes such theories In a report released last month the institute said that at least among blacks longterm welfare dependency as a child does not necessarily lead to longterm welfare dependency as an adult The Michigan study team headed by Dr Martha S Hill also found that while children from poor households are more likely to be poor as young adults nevertheless parental attitudes and values with few exceptions did not make any difference in the economic wellbeing of the children after they left home TeenAge Pregnancy One reason more black children than white children live in singleparent families is the higher degree of teenage pregnancies among blacks Among all unmarried women 15 to 19 years old in 1979 blacks were 50 percent more likely than whites to have had sexual intercourse according to a survey published by the Alan Guttmacher Institute and the National Institutes of Health More than one in four blacks was born to a teenage mother in 1979 according to figures compiled by the Childrens Defense Fund a child advocacy group based in Washington The comparable figure for whites was one in seven The group found that the birth rate declined among single black teenagers in the 1970s but it dropped even faster among older and married black women Studies show these groups are more likely to use contraception or have abortions than unmarried black teenagers Thus the proportion of young single mothers among blacks rose In addition sexual activity among blacks in this age group appeared not to be increasing while such activity among white teenagers was growing rapidly the Guttmacher study found Conservatives Cite Welfare Some authorities think the Government encourages teenage pregnancy by providing a haven for young mothers and by creating a dependency in people who otherwise would have to find some way to survive on their own If you look at the data said Robert B Carleson President Reagans adviser for social policy development as the welfare system has gotten more expansive there is a correlation between the growth of programs and the explosion of families in the teenage group He said the failure to form families in the first place was regarded by the Administration as an even greater problem than family breakup This is probably the toughest welfare problem there is Mr Carleson said Because the welfare system provides money free medical care food stamps and other things to a woman who has a child if shes single the question is does that encourage or induce or in any other way cause the problem of teenage pregnancy Media Pressures Blamed Marian Wright Edelman president of the Childrens Defense Fund blamed the relaxed sexual mores that have evolved in American society in the last 20 or so years particularly the sexually charged messages of contemporary entertainment motion pictures television and popular music The message they convey to children is anything goes  she asserted Some scholars assert that the poor economic prospects of black teenagers may have wrought a fundamental change of mores in the black community Dr Harriett Pipes McAdoo a sociologist at Howard University who has specialized in the study of disadvantaged women and children said The tradition used to be that if a woman got pregnant they were expected to get married if not forced to get married to supply income and a name for the child But if the man has no job theres no impetus for them to get married Her parents would have three people to support instead of just two The boy would become an additional burden on the family Parents feel Why should I force her to marry him Hell be a drain  Whites More Often Marry A study by the National Center for Health Statistics the only available research on the subject found that in 1972 495 percent of white women who conceived out of wedlock married before their babies were born For black women the figure was 117 percent The figures were not broken down by age The Childrens Defense Fund also cites limited research based on reports from eight states in 1979 showing that among all pregnant teenagers 41 percent of whites had abortions while only 26 percent of blacks did But among pregnant older and married women blacks are almost twice as likely to have an abortion as whites the research showed Unemployed Men A number of policy analysts believe that the underlying cause of the increase in black families headed by women is the sharp increase in the joblessness of black men The name of this game is not marriage  the name of this game is income said Mr Joe author of the recent study that addressed black poverty The joblessness is reflected not simply in the unemployment recorded in monthly government figures which is nevertheless higher for blacks than for other major ethnic groups It also includes the growing numbers of discouraged workers who have given up looking for jobs and the many black men in Americas cities and rural areas who lacking jobs and permanent addresses are not counted by census takers Among black teenagers the official unemployment rate hovers around 50 percent but according to Sar A Levitan an employment analyst only onesixth of them have jobs because so many have dropped out of or never joined the labor force Women as Breadwinners From 1960 to 1982 families headed by black women as a percentage of all black households with children rose to 47 percent from 21 percent Over the same span the percentage of employed adult black men plunged to 55 percent from 74 percent Some studies suggest that if the black men who cannot be enumerated by censustakers were added to the total the result would show that fewer than half of adult black men in the country have jobs Even those black men who do work earn significantly less than white men an average of 10510 last year against 15964 for white men Conservative theorists including many in the Reagan Administration argue that the main cause of the high joblessness is not discrimination but rather the absence among many blacks of basic working skills Administration officials say blacks should emulate the experience of those aliens in this country illegally who started in the lowest level jobs and worked their way up through the system But many who have studied the problems of the black family say historic and continuing discrimination against black men robs many of the ability to function as the family breadwinner Scholars Cite Racism The present black family crisis characterized chiefly by the precipitous growth of poor femaleheaded households can be traced almost directly to American racism said a report by 30 black scholars who met in Tarrytown NY earlier this year The group ranked the issue of the black family equally with the economy and education as the critical concerns of the black community Among dozens of black women heading families who were interviewed in several cities by The New York Times there were many who observed like Miriam a Harlem resident who did not want her last name used that while they were able to make a living their men were not He used to say Youre going here there and everywhere and Im going nowhere  Miriam an executive secretary said of her former husband He just didnt have any drive I was moving ahead and he was moving backwards After a while he just couldnt take being bested by a woman He started to hate me but most of all he hated himself Frustration Among Men Some psychiatrists regard such a reaction as the classic response to a sense of futility that grows within many black men and boys when they believe the cards are stacked against them Dr James Comer the Maurice Falk Professor of Child Psychiatry at Yale Universitys Child Study Center in New Haven said many black men came to feel that instead of trying against high odds and failing it was better not to try In a society where the male is supposed to be the breadwinner he said something thats still deep in our psychology its a tremendous psychological burden when you know you dont have a snowballs chance in hell of taking care of your family One of the defenses is not to care to not do not try Dr Comer said the American system to justify itself had to rationalize its abuses of blacks Therefore he said it has to not only deny the black male but it has to destroy him put him down make him look stupid inadequate and weak Moreover he maintained Men who see no opportunities for making it in the job market and of establishing themselves and seeing themselves as inadequate often seek adequacy and adulthood as males by producing a baby Females also often seek to prove that they are someone of worth and value by producing a child he added Mr Carleson President Reagans assistant said the Administration was concerned with avoiding writing off persistently jobless black men as the hardcore unemployed But the fact of the matter is that theyre not going to be able to get any jobs that are there because of these basic skills that they lack he said adding The fact that so many illegal aliens are coming in and on the bottom rung and going up the ladder thats evidence youve got to have those basic skills Women as Vanguard Black women have been in the work force in large numbers for much longer than white women After World War II millions of blacks left Southern farms the women often recruited to work as maids for Northern whites the men to work in factories Mechanization began to eliminate sharecropping the economic system that replaced slavery in the South The consequences were widespread Black families and communities that had functioned as economic and social units for decades on the farm were cut adrift and scattered An extended family structure surviving from African traditions and its attendant values largely succumbed to the impersonal isolation of the cities Getting Out of the Home Even among the middle class which for white women has customarily meant staying home to care for the family black womens income has usually been needed to keep the family at middleincome level As a result black women earlier than other women have made the next step of having and supporting children independently Over the past 20 years white womens participation in the labor force has been catching up and has now passed that of black women In 1960 436 percent of black women were employed as against 346 percent of whites In 1970 it was 449 percent of black women against 403 percent of whites and last year the proportion of black women working leveled off at 448 percent while the figure for white women jumped to 484 percent As white women have entered the labor force the percentage of femaleheaded households among whites while much smaller than among blacks has risen and at a rate almost as rapid Among white families 28 percent were headed by women in 1950 6 percent in 1960 and 139 percent in 1982 compared with 83 percent 207 percent and 471 percent for blacks in those years Declining Stigma for Whites Less of a social stigma has been attached to a woman as a single parent in the black community than in the white one Mrs Edelman of the Childrens Defense Fund said Its more acceptable to have a baby than to have an abortion in part because of strong religious views among many blacks Now there are signs that the stigma is declining in the white community as more middleclass white women choose openly to have babies without husbands Also the white divorce rate has risen in step with womens financial independence with the result that more white women too are single parents as a result of divorce But white women more often remarry than black women do and the percentage of divorced black women is double that of whites A publication released in August by the Rand Corporation the California research company noted that in 1982 fully 21 percent of all families with children were oneparent families Rand cited research showing that demographers estimate that 46 percent of children born in the late 1970s will spend some part of their youth in oneparent families Remedies Controversy is growing about potential remedies to the breakdown in the traditional black family structure Some analysts primarily but not exclusively political conservatives argue that governmental programs have undermined the nuclear family structure They say poor people generally and blacks in particular would be better off without such intervention Mr Gilder the conservative economist maintains for example Illegitimacy means that the sons will be brought up in homes where money is seen as an alwaysinadequate entitlement to women from the state Many of these youths express no comprehension of the requirements of a job most have hardly ever met a working man who supports his children They will find their manhood not by emulating adults but by fierce street rivalries with their peers But he continues any girl is offered an irresistible solution by the US Government It presents her at age 16 a chance for independence in an apartment of her own free housing medicine legal assistance and a combination of payments and food stamps worth several hundred dollars a month There is only one crucial condition She must bear an illegitimate child Others including civil rights groups and most political liberals argue that without the existing income educational and social supports flawed though they are the situation would be much worse and that such assistance must be strengthened rather than abandoned Workfare Plan Debated The Reagan Administration is promoting its community work experience program or workfare as a federally financed program to put the unemployed to work for local public agencies in return for their income payments Mr Carleson the Presidential aide said lowskill jobs in parks departments for example would equip the jobless with the work habits they need to make them employable by private industry Others argue however that black workers have once again been disproportionately displaced by major structural changes in the employment market similar to the demise of the Southern agricultural economy and that it is inequitable to advance as the solution that they start again on the bottom rung John Jacob president of the National Urban League observed that important sources of jobs for blacks were lost in the decline of the automobile steel and rubber industries and said these would require a national industrial policy to replace To develop a work force that wont be outpaced by the high rate of technological development requires a strategy in which we are continually retraining our work force for the new jobs constantly coming on stream he said The Tarrytown group which included Dr Kenneth B Clark the sociologist Dr Bernard Anderson director of social services for the Rockefeller Foundation and Patricia Roberts Harris former Secretary of Housing and Urban Development and of Health and Human Services said governmental assistance programs for poor mothers in particular need to be completely reconceptualized and redesigned Special Programs Endorsed Mrs Norton the former Carter Administration jobs official and other black spokesmen including officials of the Urban League are endorsing a concept of incorporating job training into the welfare system so that women can graduate into selfsupporting work In addition a few private institutions have started experimental programs working with teenage mothers teen age fathers and older women who head families The Ford Foundation for example operates a trial program in Harlem in which young women with babies are assigned older more experienced women to teach them not only practical skills but also maturity and responsibility Mrs Edelman has begun calling on black community organizations starting with churches fraternal groups and womens professional groups to provide support guidance counseling and role models to poor black families Such efforts would be particularly directed at teenagers similar to the Big Brother and Big Sister programs The Need for Opportunity But Mrs Edelman said there would never be a solution to problems like teenage pregnancy until black youngsters male and female are able to see brighter futures in the form of demonstrable economic opportunity for black people Opportunity means hope she said The bottom line is that too few black parents have been able to show children that if you are upright you will do well in this society Franklin Thomas president of the Ford Foundation said For years you would have thought there was a taboo in even discussing the problem But thats clearly gone Its a recognition of how serious the problem is Next Profiles of single mothers

LEGISLATORS DOUBTFUL OF DEALING WITH BUDGET BEFORE '84 ELECTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/us/legislators-doubtful-of-dealing-with-budget-before-84-election.html,As members of Congress scattered for home today for a twomonth vacation they left behind a 200 billion budget deficit and expressed little confidence that they would deal with the problem before the 1984 election Early in the year cooperation between the Republican leadership of the Senate and the Democratic leadership of the House produced some major legislation particularly a plan to rescue the troubled Social Security System The lawmakers also took pride in passing 10 of the 13 appropriation bills needed annually to finance the Government the most to clear Congress in recent years Not a Dollar on Deficit But by fall political calculations so pervaded Capitol Hill that the lawmakers failed to make any significant impact on the budget deficit Congress promised in its budget resolution to trim 85 billion from the deficit over three years but when the adjournment bell rang at 1004 PM Friday not one dollar of reductions had actually been approved At one latenight session this week Senator Pete V Domenici the New Mexico Republican who heads the Budget Committee accused his colleagues of copping out on the deficit problem and added We need the significant support of the President to do anything and if youre asking me whether the President will change his mind I dont think so From Reagan Praise and Blame Even though the economic recovery seems to be holding the lawmakers left town with voices of doom echoing in their ears One was that of Representative Leon E Panetta Democrat of California He told the House Friday The budget process the deficit and the economy are in deep trouble President Reagan who came into office promising to balance the Federal budget has repeatedly blamed Congress for rising deficits and he did so today in his weekly radio broadcast although he also had praise for the years legislative accomplishments Many members of Congress in both parties say one major reason for the deficit is President Reagans adamant insistence on higher military spending and lower taxes They agree with Senator Domenici that Congress will not act to close that gap until Mr Reagan takes the lead and provides political cover for the unpopular decisions that will be required This is President Reagans deficit Senator John C Danforth a Missouri Republican told the Senate this week but from the Administration we have heard nothing but silence The lawmakers did display considerable restraint in adopting appropriation bills All 10 that went to the White House stayed within spending targets set by the budget last spring and so while President Reagan threatened to veto any bills that went too far he never got the chance The War Powers Resolution In foreign affairs Congresss most notable achievement was probably passage of legislation declaring that the War Powers Resolution applies to Lebanon and limiting deployment of the Marines there to 18 months President Reagan expressed doubts about the constitutionality of the act but he signed the bill becoming the first President in the 10year history of the act to effectively acknowledge its validity The year was marked by frequent tension between Congress and the White House on issues ranging from the MX missile to the secret war in Nicaragua to nuclear arms negotiations As James M Cannon chief of staff for Howard H Baker Jr of Tennessee the majority leader put it One of the things we do in this city is constantly define and redefine the relation of the Congress to the President on foreign policy Mr Reagan won most of the battles mainly because there is a lingering presumption in Congress that the President is ultimately responsible for foreign policy But the lawmakers expressed determination to keep a careful eye on the Administrations policies abroad particularly where they might lead to armed conflict Watch Watch Watch This comes from the indelible etch of Vietnam asserted Senator Alan K Simpson a Wyoming Republican Weve got to watch watch watch In the first two years of the Reagan Administration Republicans used the support of conservative Democrats in the House and the political popularity of the President to dominate the agenda on Capitol Hill But as the economy failed to revive last Novembers election swept in a net increase of 26 House Democrats and sent shock waves through Republican ranks The tone for this Congress was set by the 1982 elections said an aide to the Senate Republican leadership We had several members scared for their political life and Speaker ONeill was dealing from a much stronger hand The BakerONeill Cooperation This new power balance started having an impact in the postelection session of the last Congress when Speaker Thomas P ONeill Jr the leading Democrat in Congress and Senator Baker the chief Republican worked together to pass an increase in the gasoline tax and provide funds for new public works projects When the lawmakers returned to Washington last January to begin the 98th Congress concern was still high about the sluggish economy and persistent unemployment Mr Baker and Mr ONeill again cooperated to push through a 46 billion package of job creation programs and emergency aid for victims of the recession The two leaders also recognized that no changes could be made in the politically sensitive Social Security program unless the two parties called a truce on the issue A bipartisan commission appointed by President Reagan proposed a package of changes that would increase payroll taxes and gradually raise the retirement age and the deal breezed through Congress Compromise on Military Spending This spirit of accommodation continued through the drafting of the annual budget when House Democrats and Senate Republicans brushed aside Administration proposals and compromised on a plan that increased military spending by 5 percent half the rise the White House wanted and allotted 215 billion for domestic spending above Mr Reagans request Bipartisan cooperation began to erode however when the economy sputtered to life and Republicans started to regain confidence in the Presidents economic program Moreover as the year went on partisan interests began to diverge sharply By the end of the session Senator Simpson was saying that partisanship had reached an appalling and stifling level in the corridors of the capitol In essence the Democrats repeated their charges that the Reagan program was unfair to average American voters and pushed a string of measures through the House to demonstrate the point including help for homeowners with mortgages and aid for jobless workers who had lost their health benefits The Republicans were generally gambling that the economy would continue to stay healthy through the election and that they could sucessfully brand the Democrats big spenders Accordingly all additional Democratic proposals to aid the unemployed were buried in the Senate In a similar faceoff the House passed legislation to limit the third year of the tax cut that was due to take effect last July But Mr Reagan opposed any change in his taxreduction program and the Senate killed the measure The domestic legislative struggle lapsed into a standoff By the end of the session Republicans were saying that a major accomplishment was preventing the Democrats from adding to social spending programs Maybe one of the better things we did was not to do very much said one Republican staff aide Democrats Claim a Reversal And the Democrats were arguing that they had reversed the trend of the previous two years and blocked the Republicans from making further cuts in domestic programs That was the main thing we did this year Mr ONeill said But Congress was able to agree on a number of significant measures toward the end of the year that transcended partisanship By large margins the lawmakers approved a bill for a Federal holiday in honor of the birthday of the Rev Dr Martin Luther King Jr and a bill that extended the life of the Civil Rights Commission and shielded it from attempts by the Reagan Administration to undercut its independence Congress also voted to extend unemployment benefits for 18 months and loosen the criteria to make workers in more states eligible for maximum help Thanks to some legislative legerdemain by House Democrats Republicans were forced to accept a housing authorization the first in almost three years that created a small program to build rental units for poor tenants IMF Support and Debt Limit Mr Reagan had to use his leverage to swing conservative Republicans into line behind an increase of 84 billion in the American contribution to the International Monetary Fund and an increase in the national debt ceiling to 149 billion This would allow the Treasury to continue borrowing money through April Congress approved two programs to reward farmers for limiting production One distributes Government owned commodities as payment in kind to farmers who curtail surplus crops Another bill cleared Friday night would pay dairy farmers for the first time for reducing their milk production But the list of unpassed bills was probably even longer in this session The Senate passed a comprehensive alteration of the immigration laws but action was blocked in the House by the objections of Hispanic members The House rejected the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution and the Senate buried a proposal to provide tax credits for parents who send their children to private schools Foreign Cars and Phone Use The House passed a bill that would require foreign car makers to use more American parts and labor in vehicles sold here but the Senate took no action and shows little interest in the bill The Democrats also pushed through the House a bill to bar new fees for phone users and that bill should receive prompt Senate attention in January After promises last year to conservative Republicans the Senate debated a proposed amendment to the Constitution that would overturn Supreme Court decisions legalizing abortions but it was defeated Congress did approve a rule that would ban Federal workers from using their health benefits to finance abortions Among proposals that never came to a floor vote were a package of revisions to make various criminal laws tougher on defendants revisions of the Clean Air and Clean Water Acts and deregulation of natural gas which was pulled from the Senate floor on Friday Congressional Highlights National Security WAR POWERS Congress invoked War Powers Resolution for first time since enactment in 1973 authorizing Administration to keep

THE LEGACY OF RHODES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/20/magazine/the-legacy-of-rhodes.html,McQuade a former television correspondent and producer for ABC News and CBS News is director of programs for the Council on Foreign Relations in New York   INNING A RHODES scholarship is one of the few things you can do at 22 they will chisel on your tombstone says Lester Thurow an economist at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology No matter what else you do in life that will be remembered  He is right To be named a Rhodes scholar is to be recognized as one of the intellectual elite Since 1903 more than 2000 Americans have been so honored and educated at Englands ancient and prestigious Oxford University because of the vision and legacy of Cecil John Rhodes At a recent and rare reunion Rhodes scholars returned to Oxford to remember shared experience and to take the measure of the legacy and of one another Reminiscing today about his experience as a Rhodes scholar from 1911 to 1914 91 yearold Philip W Whitcomb a former journalist says he and his classmates were aware they were part of Rhodess great idea that the world should be dominated and protected and guided by the British Empire the United States and Germany When he returned home in 1914 the world was at war and Rhodess vision of benevolent domination was shattered Since then Mr Whitcomb asserts Rhodes scholars have been preoccupied each about his own preeminence rather than with any grand design of the founder Mr Whitcomb may be right that over the years scholarship recipients have rhodes 1st jump   been increasingly less concerned about how they might fulfill Rhodess vision and more concerned with how they might use the scholarship to fulfill their own personal objectives In choosing American candidates like Mr Whitcomb the trustees of the will originally assumed that Rhodes would have wanted men who might eventually become President Sir George Parkin who translated Rhodess will into a working system told a convention of university and college presidents in Chicago that they should select men most likely to become President Chief Justice of the Supreme Court or Ambassador to Britain  In the 80year history of the program no Rhodes scholar has as yet achieved these positions Former President Carter who did achieve political success vividly recalls his disappointment at not being chosen for a Rhodes Many scholars however have served at other levels of government including Byron R White and John Marshall Harlan Associate Justices of the Supreme Court Dean Rusk Secretary of State Walt Whitman Rostow national security adviser and Presidential assistant Stansfield Turner a former Director of the Central Intelligence Agency and J William Fulbright the Senator who modeled the American international scholarship program after the Rhodes The largest number of American scholars have pursued careers in law or academia But the scholars have achieved prominence in all disciplines  the authors Robert Penn Warren and Robert K Massie for example both Pulitizer Prize winners  This scholarship of scholarships is the legacy of one man with an extraordinary idea and the wealth and perseverance to make it a reality Rhodes was a 19thcentury Englishman who changed forever the face of southern Africa He was a sickly man who led a vigorous life a cynical man who was committed to a vision of a more idyllic future  Rhodes a clergymans son who went to South Africa for his health was always singular in his desire to extend the British Empire and the way of life of his beloved England He sought the ultimate recovery of the United States of America as an integral part of the British Empire and the foundation of so great a power as to hereafter render wars impossible and promote the best interests of humanity Before he could make his idea work however he would need vast wealth and power  The source for both was South Africa where Rhodes was a member of Parliament in Cape Colony and its Prime Minister He was a shrewd selfmade businessman who merged the giant mining companies of Kimberley and De Beers an adventurer who trekked throughout southern Africa opening up for development a region that would later be called Rhodesia now Zimbabwe  To secure a place for his ideas in the future Rhodes originally envisioned a secret society not unlike the Jesuits Society of Jesus At 24 he wrote his ideas into his first will He would write a total of seven wills over a period of 22 years ultimately committing his fortune of 33 million to educating the best men for the worlds fight at Oxford University his alma mater  When Rhodes died in 1902 it was left to his trustees to interpret and develop his idea Rhodes described the men he wanted as good students but not bookworms good athletes but not necessarily stars wellversed in the classics but able to mold the future dedicated to public service  and lest they be distracted from their three years of study unmarried  Candidates were to be chosen from the British Dominions Germany and the United States The Americans had the largest single block of scholars with two chosen from each state But the distribution of population made this system unworkable and it was revised in 1929 by an act of Parliament which amended the will to allow regional selection of 32 candidates yearly This is one of a number of examples of how the trustees bent the words of the will to meet practical considerations As Walter B Slocombe a Rhodes scholar and Washington lawyer put it the work of the trustees is the greatest systematic subversion of the designers intent wrapped up in good will  When Parliament passed a law forbidding sexual discrimination in 1975 the trustees asked it to amend Rhodess will again to permit women To date nearly 80 American women have entered the program  While women were clearly excluded from the founders great design from the start the issue of race was less clear The will states that no student shall be qualified or disqualified for election to a scholarship on account of his race or religious opinions but Rhodes was understood to be referring only to the British and Dutch races Although the first black an American went up to Oxford in 1907 participation by blacks in significant numbers has been recent Whatever paths their lives do take the American Rhodes scholars traditionally have started their journey together Until last year when the Queen Elizabeth 2 was pressed into service in the Falklands War the 32 scholars have sailed across the Atlantic using the week long cruise to become acquainted an easier task than getting to know Oxford and the English At Oxford each scholar must apply and be accepted at one of the more than two dozen colleges within the university Hamilton Richardson a New York investment banker and 1958 doubles champion in the United States Championships was in a tennis tournament in Australia when he heard he had won a scholarship He sought out an Englishman in the tournament and asked for guidance in choosing a good college I dont know much about it the fellow replied except I do know Trinity College is supposed to have the best food Mr Richardson went to Trinity He found the colleges more than a place to eat they are places to live play sports study and develop fierce loyalties  The universitys tutorial system contrasts sharply with the American method of large lectures and frequent examinations Lectures are available but not required Instead a student reads a subject meets weekly with a tutor to discuss and defend his essay on a given topic and takes final examinations called schools during a oneweek period at the conclusion of two or three years of study For some American students this freedom and responsibility to decide when and what to study is a maturing and intellectually satisfying experience Others are frustrated by the unfamiliar structure and the absence of grades to let them know regularly how they are doing The physical beauty of Oxford is easy to love Spires soar above some of the finest surviving medieval architecture Bountiful gardens border ancient walls Every college encloses orderly distinctive quadrangles There is a changelessness about the place  a charm as well as a challenging reminder of all the men who have studied there over the centuries and gone on to prominence rhodes 2nd jump  What most Americans have not found so charming are English weather food plumbing and heating When Mr Whitcomb arrived in 1911 there was no running water Pitchers of cold water and basins were provided and water closets were down an alley in the back he says There have been few improvements Hamilton Richardson a Southerner found the damp cold climate particularly hard to adjust to without central heating He told his college bursar that he could not survive without a proper heater He received special permission to get an electrical variety Permission granted Mr Richardson plugged it in and the lights went out all over Trinity College Undaunted he paid a princely sum to rewire his room Twenty years later while showing his family around his old college Mr Richardson went back to his room and discovered the occupants using the outlet he had installed  and his old heater When he told them that he had arranged for the warmth they were now enjoying they looked up in alarm and asked You havent come to take it away have you sir Americans also tend to encounter a lack of warmth in their relationships with the English Friendships seem easier with their counterparts from Australia New Zealand South Africa and Canada Hedley Donovan former editor in chief of Time magazine likes the civility and graceful difference of the English but found it disquieting to talk to someone at a sherry party one evening and have him ignore you the next day Nevertheless he persevered and has made lasting friends While Lawrence McQuade executive vice president of W R Grace and my husband also made enduring friendships he did so after some vivid lessons in English manners and the art of understatement On one such occasion Mr McQuade only the fifth American to play rugby for Oxford University was walking to the showers with a teammate after a game The fellow said You know McQuade the custom here when a player makes an error is to say Bad luck old chap Not Gee what a lousy play  Perhaps the American scholars most alienated from the English during their Oxford experience were those who went up during the Vietnam War Unlike the World Wars essentially shared experiences for Americans and the English Vietnam was a period of deep divisions and violent debate in the United States confusion and distress in England  A lot of us felt a little strange to jump on a boat and go to idyllic Oxford and escape remembers William J Clinton Governor of Arkansas When he arrived in 1968 he found that the emotional conflict because of the war put a cloud over it all It wasnt bad but it was always there As a result we Americans probably clustered in groups more than was usual before or after Mr Clinton is an example of what some people believe Rhodes meant when he wrote that a Rhodes scholar should esteem the performance of public duties as his highest aim On his return to Arkansas Mr Clinton became Attorney General before winning the governorship The American Rhodes scholars who have served in elected public office have mixed views as to how their experience affected their political careers Carl B Albert former Representative from Oklahoma and Speaker of the House recalls his first opponent attacking him for having been educated in England Mr Albert lost that election The next time his supporters successfully used the same fact to prove he was competent to do the job he says John Brademas former Representative from Indiana and Majority Whip took a more philosophical view Mr Brademas now president of New York University says he was much the most politicized in his class at Oxford in 1950 He feels he is probably the kind of person Cecil Rhodes described because of his zeal for political combat  In fact Mr Brademas was so intrigued by political figures that he spent most of his vacs tracking down Spanish anarchists in preparation for his doctoral thesis The scholarship cash stipend now 5400 a year provides for travel He discovered Manuel Salgado an anarchist leader during the Spanish Civil War in a restaurant in Londons West End Mr Salgado referred him to another anarchist a tailor in Bordeaux who in turn referred him to another a barber in Toulouse Mr Brademas continued doing his research seeing Europe and not returning to United States during the entire three years at Oxford But when he did return home and ran for Congress Mr Brademas like Mr Albert found being a Rhodes scholar a minus in northern Indiana  Some people might not think politics is a public service explains Sir Edgar Williams warden of the Rhodes scholars for 28 years However he says a man makes a positive contribution to public service if he improves his surroundings if he does something for the common cause without pay By that definition Sir Edgar believes the scholars have done quite well No one knows precisely what Rhodes intended If the intention was for the Rhodes scholarships to train future Presidents then it has failed If the intention was to make very able men reach higher and contribute more to society than they otherwise would have then it has succeeded These are just ordinary people no geniuses but people who are good citizens says George C McGhee an American diplomat and a Rhodes scholar and you look at where they ended up Few are world figures but most are good substantial people Last spring the Rhodes scholars each received a simple invitation announcing plans for a reunion in June Though it was only the third time in 80 years that the scholars would gather there was no fanfare no engraved card no elaborately detailed program no literature encouraging participation and no solicitation Nonetheless 800 scholars from 14 countries returned  It was a nostalgia binge Most of the returning scholars stayed in rooms at their old colleges Herman H Hamilton an Alabama lawyer headed first for The Trout a favorite country pub along the river where American members of his class who went up in 1950 were gathering for lunch James H Billington director of the Woodrow Wilson International Center for Scholars in Washington showed up with his daughter Susan who is currently a scholar making them the first fatherdaughter combination Dennis C Stanfill was there too although he is no longer the young Annapolis graduate Mr Hamilton remembered but a venture capitalist and former head of 20th CenturyFox Mr Stanfill like singer Kris Kristofferson who did not attend the reunion is one of the few scholars to work in the entertainment industry  This small informal lunch with American friends was followed by tea with the Queen for all the scholars and their spouses in the garden of Rhodes House Unlike a Rose Garden reception at the White House there was no visible security no crush of photographers no sense of urgency Rather there was curiosity civility conviviality Everything was very genteel and very English Not one of the five Rhodes scholars who are currently serving in the United States Senate was present At the moment of the Queens garden party I was sipping instant coffee and presiding over the Senate says Senator Larry L Pressler of South Dakota He and the other Senators  David L Boren of Oklahoma William W Bradley of New Jersey Richard G Lugar of Indiana and Paul S Sarbanes of Maryland  had stayed behind to vote on abortion and the budget Cecil Rhodes would have wanted us to stay here Senator Pressler says Some returning scholars visited college libraries like Oriels where treasures ranging from Cardinal Wolseys hat to the original manuscript of Lewis Carrolls Alice in Wonderland were on display Some went punting on the river remembering perhaps romantic interludes of earlier years Others visited Blackwells to browse and perhaps buy a book from the bookseller of Oxford who may be as appreciated for extending credit to needy students as for his extensive inventory  The highlight of the reunion for many was the remarkable performance of Harold Macmillan a former Prime Minister of Britain and chancellor of Oxford University for 23 years Almost blind he stood with stooped frame and spoke with a voice amazingly strong for his 89 years Mr Macmillan noted he had come up to Oxford himself 71 years ago and had witnessed almost the entire history of the Rhodes scholarships in his lifetime He paid extraordinary tribute to the founder noting that from the monks in the Abbeys of 1112 we have moved from the Age of Faith to the Age of Credulity In that period the most imaginative concept or grand design was that of Cecil Rhodes  The favorable reaction to Mr Macmillans words contrasted with the response of many to the remarks of J Ogilvie Thompson a South African invited to speak on behalf of the scholars An official of De Beers the mining company of which Cecil Rhodes was a director during his life and which supplied the bulk of the wealth for his legacy Mr Thompson gave what many felt might have been the annual report of the company coupled with an apologia for the current political situation in his country For some it was a moment of discomfort that would be exacerbated the following day  The Sheldonian a theater intheround commissioned in the 17th century by Archbishop Sheldon and built by Christopher Wren was the scene of a gathering to discuss The Rhodes Sholarships Past Present and Future After the formal presentations H J Bremer Hofmeyr of South Africa now working with Moral Rearmament took the floor and made a quiet but firm plea We owe to some extent our Rhodes scholarships to the labor of blacks and we owe them a dit  he said I doubt Rhodes had any idea that the situation would be what it is in South Africa today Mr Hofmeyr proposed that the scholars do something enduring which would benefit the less privileged people of the country where Rhodess fortune was amassed  Speaking after Mr Hofmeyr George R Keyes a Washington lawyer recommended that the trust be used to improve educational possibilities for young blacks in South Africa so they might be better able to compete for a scholarship Mr Keyes who is black feels the Rhodes trustees have long dodged the issue A line has to be drawn or a decision made to make an alteration in the will he told the gathering We are the living legacy and we define this legacy Many applauded But Michael Smuts a descendant of former South African Prime Minister Jan Smuts asked that the group be understanding and patience with people who are doing our best  There was support for both points of view Like the seven wills and the legacy itself the solution to the South African question will have to evolve through the trustees who have tried to adhere to the will yet be relevant to the times  One of the remarkable discoveries that emerged from interviews with numerous Rhodes scholars here and at the reunion was the absence of cynicism or disappointment about the program Some scholars expressed some complaints The tutorial system is not as good for the sciences as it is for the humanities there ought to be more scholars from a larger cross section of the South African population the bulk of the Rhodes trust is still based on the fortunes of South Africa But most scholars feel the Oxford experience has proved to be one of the extraordinary opportunities of their lives and often the critical factor in determining a course thereafter The letter and the rhetoric of the Rhodes will have been abridged with time but the idea of making good men better by educating them well and by setting high standards of excellence and public service has survived According to John Brademas the legacy is the best use to which diamonds have ever been put Perhaps Rhodes knew that when he told a Capetown audience almost a century ago I have found out one thing and that is if you have an idea and it is a good idea if you only stick to it you will come out all right

A FAMILY: STORIES OF 7 BLACK WOMEN,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/21/us/a-family-stories-of-7-black-women.html,When Angela Jones was born in the 1950s the vast majority of black children were raised as she was in twoparent families She is 31 years old now and divorced the mother of a 3yearold girl she is rearing in the Bronx under two difficult conditions without a father and in poverty Mrs Jones whose sweet expression hints of a gentler Virginia childhood is part of a profound tide of change that has swept black America since she was a child Last year 47 percent of all black households with children were composed like hers of a woman and her children a rise from 21 percent in 1960 and only 8 percent in 1960 Among blacks the absence of a father at home has virtually become the norm Among whites only 15 percent of families with children were headed by women last year Black leaders and social scientists now agree that the tide threatens to undo the black economic gains of decades Already more than half the black babies born each year have unmarried mothers Statistics show that these children are much more likely than others to spend their lives in poverty Interviews with three dozen black women heading households across the country shed some light on the causes and effects of the breakdown in black families Each womans story was different but clear patterns emerged The most common thread one that ran through the lives of most of the women was the inability of the fathers of their children to hold steady jobs Many also spoke of disregard or ignorance of contraception and aversion to abortion of having been reared themselves by single mothers or by parents who did not get along of family ties weakened by the mass migration of rural blacks to the cities of marital tension aggravated by economic hardship of broken dreams and lingering ambitions and most of all of the desire to provide their children with a life better than their own The stories of these seven women are representative Angela Jones The way men are these days Angela Jones said too many people give their daughters toy stoves and dollbabies Im going to give mine a typewriter and a computer Mrs Jones and her 3yearold daughter Mica live in a cityowned building in the South Bronx They have lived on welfare for the past two years since Mrs Jones and her husband broke up She has brightened Micas bedroom with shelf after shelf of childrens books and a collection of handmedown dollhouses restored to usefulness Its important to take care of a childs personal needs tend to her confidence Mrs Jones said Thats the problem with so many black children Their parents dont motivate them tell them that even if they fail to just get up and try again Hung Up on Discrimination Mrs Jones and her husband spent their childhoods in Newport News Va where her father was a shipyard worker and her mother reared three daughters After her parents were divorced she said her father remained close to them She and her husbandtobe came to New York were married at City Hall and began living with his relatives He did construction work but mostly she said they lived off his unemployment payments Hed say Its just rough out there Mrs Jones said Too many poor black men are hung up on discrimination and prejudice They should take jobs mopping floors whatever and show them that Fathers trying hes working That he may not put the best food on the table but its a balanced meal Surveying the streets of her neighborhood girls with baby strollers young men in a hurry others not going anyplace Mrs Jones maintained Most people on public assistance the boyfriend gets his cut no ifs and ands One thing my father always taught us no man lives with us thats making him weak The thing to do with a man is to strengthen him give him confidence in himself Vera Yarborough A few weeks earlier Vera Yarborough had noticed that her husband was acting strangely He would come home from his job working with computers at a major corporation and he would not eat But he said nothing was wrong She said she was totally unprepared then when one night he simply told her he was leaving her and the children after 13 years of marriage It was 1979 and she was five months pregnant with their third child He quit his job at the company about a month later He was unemployed for a year Mrs Yarborough said worked at three or four little jobs and only began working steadily again this year His new job is with the Postal Service Children Do Not Behave Mrs Yarborough who has worked at the same job as a clerk in a Watts pharmacy for 17 years now makes stops at three schools to drop off her children before she goes to work She said the girls Raquel 14 Nyree 7 and Autumn 3 are faring well emotionally after their fathers departure except that they do not behave very well A father has kind of a dominating image she said I think kids need two parents The four of them now live on her takehome pay of 880 a month half of which goes to cover the mortgage payment on their tidy house in the city of Compton Mrs Yarborough said the worst period was right after Autumn was born when they were forced to live on disability payments which were half her salary Black men if things dont happen right financially and they dont have what they think they should things just fall apart she said There was no way I was going to lose my mind I tell people I did all right because of the kids You kind of hold yourself together because of the kids Zelia Irving Zelia Irvings life was put back on track by the cooks job she was able to get at the daycare center in Watts where her sons now teenagers were once enrolled A Brazilian by birth she was recruited to Philadelphia on contract as a maid she said After her contract was over she migrated to Los Angeles The man she married there worked as a maintenance man at a supermarket a job he had held for years He made very little money Mrs Irving said but he didnt want me to work  he was jealous They had two sons Charles now 15 and Alexander 14 and as the boys grew their father began to drink more and more heavily One night he stayed there at the market Mrs Irving said He was supposed to open the doors in the morning but he was too drunk When they found him they fired him Hes been working there 18 years and they fired him after just one time Lacking any means of support Mrs Irving said she wanted to apply for welfare but she said her husband was too proud She eventually applied for aid without him I didnt want my children to go without she said The social worker came the same day and saw we were really in need The same day she told us to come and pick up a check Unable to get her husband to go with her to a marriage counselor Mrs Irving decided to leave him Her husband moved in with his mother Nobody she said was ever able to talk sense to him When I take my boys to their grandmothers house he never wants to see them Mrs Irving said Im thinking hes ashamed Peggy and Earline Corsby Tashienda at the age of 3 has about her the air of a muchloved child something about the toss of her head and the fastidious way she adjusts the grownups belt she added as her own personal touch to the outfit her mother had so carefully matched Her mother Peggy Crosby has lived virtually all her 25 years in the Jordan Downs housing project in the Watts neighborhood of Los Angeles The project like most public housing in California is a lowrise affair Peggys mother Earline Crosby 51 raised all her six children there without help from any of their fathers Peggy drives a school bus and believes she earns an adequate living for herself and her child But she says she wishes Tashiendas father another young schoolbus driver who entered her life when she spotted him on the projects basketball courts would come around more because I was raised without my father and I didnt want her to be raised without hers When Peggy Crosby thinks of a family she thinks of a mother father two kids picnicking camping traveling Theres a lot of good things I think of No Contraception or Abortion But she said that the notion of marrying Tashiendas father didnt come up at the time  if we had planned to have a child it might have come up later She knew little about birth control she said and she did not seek an abortion because her mother objected to it as being against church teachings Peggy graduated from high school in 1976 four years before Tashienda was born The birth caused little if any disruption in her youthful life The future was something Peggy had a hazy notion of having once played with and then put away ideas of becoming a model or a secretaryI dont think she changed anything because I wasnt really off into doing much of anything anyway she said Earline Crosby has heard her daughter struggle with the future Without prompting she explained My children are just like me We just havent had too much experience in doing anything 20 Years of Welfare She is on welfare and has been off and on for more than 20 years ever since shortly after she moved to Los Angeles from Jackson Miss Earline Crosby speaking gently and patiently said she regretted not being able to teach her children more about life about what to aspire to and how to reach it No one had taught her She recounted how she and a brother were raised hand to mouth 40 and more years ago in Mississippi after their aunt died Her own mother had traveled from state to state looking for work before she became a seamstress in Los Angeles Something was happening in the South she said Something was happening to jobs and people wasnt working in the fields too much I wasnt too much aware of what was going on but I knew something was happening with the jobs there wasnt too much work She was part of the displacement of millions of black people from Southern farms and a traditional rural way of life replaced by the invention of mechanical harvesters From 1940 to 1965 three million people shifted from farm labor into cities and industries most of them without suitable skills or preparation No Chance to Be a Pianist Earline Crosby said she remembered it as a time when large numbers of blacks women not men were leaving the South bound for Northern cities on bus tickets sent by whites seeking domestic workers She said she left Mississippi in 1956 to work as a maid for three months in New York and later for six months in Chicago returning south out of homesickness in between before she finally moved in December 1960 to California Earline Crosby said she bore six children because nobody taught her about birth control She worked two years in hotels as a maid and doing piecework in dry cleaners but she was absent from work so much because of her children that finally her last employer advised her to stop and go on public assistance The absence of parents and a fair education determined for the worse the course of her life she said I feel like I missed out on a lot of things I could have been I remember things Id like to be a nurse or a pianist or an interior decorator And here I end up being nothing I never intended to be just nothing I just didnt make it Marian Johnson Marian Johnson thought she was leaving her biggest troubles behind four years ago when she took her five daughters and ran away from her husband But she said he keeps finding her threatening her and disappearing Do I have a neon sign on my head that blinks trouble or stupid she asked packing up her Milwaukee apartment to move one more time because of problems with her landlord Her share of trouble included a pregnancy and a miscarriage as a high school senior and dropping out of school At 19 she became pregnant with her oldest daughter Two weeks before she was to marry the father he was killed and she found out he had been dealing in drugs Last summer she was raped at knifepoint The police never found the man But the most consistent source of problems has been her marriage MrsJohnson met her husband after her oldest daughter Kameshia was born He was a teacher at a vocational center earnings 700 a month and she was earning 550 a month in an office Over several years they had two children He married her when she was 26 and shortly after that things changed Mrs Johnson said he started abusing her He seemed jealous I was out working and not at home she said They had two more children Later he started abusing the children in a cycle of violent threats and beatings that was to send Mrs Johnson fleeing to a shelter for battered women At one point she said he quit his job so he could watch her and keep her from running away with the children She called it imprisonment She and the children have been surviving on public assistance 745 a month for the six of them With the youngest child now 5 years old Mrs Johnson has been going on interviews again for a secretarial job Women are finding out they dont have to put up with that stuff she said of her marital problems Women are stepping out and taking care of themselves and learning they dont have to depend on a spouse or having a man around the house Denise Washington Denise Washington had everything going for her as a girl growing up in a modest black neighborhood in Los Angeles She was a joiner a doer a Bluebird and Campfire Girl a fraternal lodge princess a queen in a contest promoted by a gospel singing star a debutante in the local cotillion She was studying at a community college working at a parttimed job and had signed a deal for a new car when at 19 she became pregnant I thought I fell in love said Mrs Washington now 23 as her 2yearold daughter Shameka clambered toward her lap I was tired of going to school It probably all hit me at the same time Mrs Washington one of the youngest of 12 brothers and sisters was reared from infancy by her sister and brotherinlaw Leatrice and John Scribner to whom she refers as her mother and father The Scribners come from a Southern tradition of close family involvement When Denises future husband started seeing her frequently they said they invited him for a family interrogation She Married Despite Family We didnt like him Mrs Scribner said She wasnt 18 yet and he wanted her to take care of him Mrs Washington said she was not using contraception when she got pregnant the first time My mother had brought me up that you didnt have sex until you got married so I didnt know much about it she said adding the she declined to use birth control pills because most of people I knew who were taking them were having problems with them Despite the Scribners objections Mrs Washington married after the birth of her first child John now 4 and she and her husband got a place of their own Mrs Washington was working full time for the telephone company things were going fine and they moved into a larger apartment A month later her husband was laid off That she said was the beginning of a string of conflicts over money that led to the end of their marriage Her husband had gotten in trouble with alcohol before they married and had a record of drunkendriving offenses While they were struggling to find a stable financial footing he was in and out of jail for drunken driving Finally fed up she packed up the children and went home to the Scribners He didnt want to do to anything she said summing up the reasons for the split He Sought Work and Schooling They were together for two years Troubled as that period was however Mrs Washington said her husband was not a man who refused to try She said he worked for a while with his father doing maintenance work at a supermarket and was laid off He went to a trade school program in automobile mechanics but it took him two months after it ended to find work He talked of wanting to go to school to be adraftsman but about that time Mrs Washington with a 3yearold and a 9monthold infant went back home Still he completed his high school education she said after their second child was born In contrast Mrs Washington said it has never taken her more than two weeks to land a good job At the phone company where she sees a bright future for herself she now earns almost 400 a week as a report clerk There were a lot of things I wanted but by my husband not being able to be a good provider we couldnt afford it she said That was the biggest conflict I dont think we would have had any serious problems if that had been okay Adrene King As a child growing up in Brooklyn the daughter of an apartment superintendent and his wife in the affluent Midwood section 34yearold Adrene King said the impression she acquired of marriage from her own family and the families around her was that it was an unhappy situation in which to be So when she found out she was pregnant although it was unplanned I had made a conscious decision that I would probably have a child outside of marriage because my parents marriage was so unhappy She said she did not consider abortion Once I was pregnant she said I felt it was something I wanted to experience It was a decision that appears to have worked not only for Miss King but also for her 17yearold son Maurice and 11yearold daughter Ashaki who are doing well at a private high school and a good public intermediated school on Manhattans West Side My moms the best single parent in New York says Maurice proudly Miss King is now a wellpaid account executive at a large communication company She got there after starting out on welfare and effectively using her own hard work and the social programs that were products of the 1960s LowPaying Jobs at First After the birth of her son Miss King said she did not want to raise him in her parents home so she applied for welfare After proving that her parents could not afford to support her and a child she was awarded public assistance and moved into an apartment with another single mother When the baby was a year old she went back to work but the lowpaid clerical jobs she was able to get with a high school education she said raised my career consciousness While she was working a fulltime job making 6000 a year at the New York City Health Department she enrolled in college also on a fulltime basis Through an arrangement made possibly by her union she enrolled in a night sutdy program specially designed for working adults at the College of New Rochelle Under the program she paid only half the usual fees and she financed the rest through education loans She paid for two babysitters a day I worked 9 to 5 went to class 6 to 9 got home at 10 studied until 12 and back up to go to work Miss King said Saturdays Id take the children to the library Sunday it was the cleaning and the laundry In four years she had a bachelors degree in business In that time she had a serious relationship with Ashakis father After three years they decided to end it because his commitment to pursuing a career in show business did not afford the kind of economic stability they felt the children needed Miss King said He has remained an active part of the childrens life Miss King said she did not rule out marrying someday and would like to have one of those highpowered twocareer families But she added There are so many obstacles put out there for black men An assertive black male is very threatening and to survive in the corporate situation you have to be assertive no doubt about that
CONSERVATIVE STUDY GIVES REAGAN A MIXED RATING,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/25/us/conservative-study-gives-reagan-a-mixed-rating.html,As President Reagan approaches the end of his third year in office many conservatives remain divided over his record To some he has sounded an uncertain trumpet missed golden opportunities compromised too often and drifted from his conservative moorings To others he has changed the direction of Government in a way that Democrats will be hardpressed to reverse To still others he has had a mixed bag of successes and failures Such are the findings of the Heritage Foundation a Washington policy group that has been both an occasional critic of and an intellectual resource for the Reagan Administration In an effort to explore the depth of conservative discontent as well as satisfaction with the President it recently asked a number of prominent conservative activists intellectuals politicians and writers to rate how he was doing The foundation which periodically runs such surveys plans to publish its findings shortly But foundation sources have provided a preview of what is to come What they were unable to provide was what effect if any the division in conservative ranks might have on Mr Reagans reelection chances For a number of the doubters provided the dissatisfaction is not too deep Mr Reagan could still be the only acceptable candidate Not Enough Reaganauts There was general agreement among the respondents that Mr Reagan deserved credit for cutting taxes increasing military spending and sticking to his positions on social issues On the other hand some of the respondents criticized the President for not asking for more domestic spending cuts for allowing Democrats to regain control of the political agenda after his first year for ignoring military waste and for not infusing his Administration with more conservative hardliners Richard V Allen the Presidents former national security adviser wrote that on the basis of his White House experience The first year of the Reagan Administration set a new tone in US foreign policy correcting a sense of drift and bringing a clear halt to the notion of American slippage Mr Allens main criticism was that Mr Reagan did not bring enough Reaganauts to power In the first six months of the Administration said Mr Allen the President should have spent an hour each day assessing the qualifications of personnel down to the level of deputy assistant secretary Senator William L Armstrong Republican of Colorado said that if the Administration went down in history as mediocre it will be because the President was not bold enough at the outset Contending that Mr Reagan could have got about anything he wanted from Congress in his first six months in office he complained that the President instead managed to polarize the country over budget cuts He cut the budget enough to make special interest groups and the press mad the Senator wrote but not enough to solve the problem I Expected More John T Dolan chairman of the National Conservative Political Action Committee contended that the tax cut would be the only real historic achievement of Mr Reagans Presidency I expected more to happen said this disappointed conservative activist There has been no major defense buildup beyond what Carter would have done There has been no spending cut There has been no turnover of control to the states There has been no effort to dismantle the Washing bureaucratic elitist establishment M Stanton Evans a newspaper columnist is no less disappointed This has been essentially another Ford Administration he said in his critique It has been business as usual not much different from any other Republican administration of our lifetime It has been an Administration populated by corporate executive types Everyone knows he added that people used to the decorum of the boardroom back off from controversy Representative Newt Gingrich Republican of Georgia saw Mr Reagan as the only coherent revolutionary in an Administration of accommodationist advisers His chief criticism The Administration has had no capacity to launch strategic offenses on behalf of Reagans vision After Mr Reagan won his tax and budget cuts in the spring of 1981 Mr Gingrich added someone in the White House should have been asking What do we do to keep up momentum Instead he said Mr Reagan returned from California in August to a vacuum of activity and a new political agenda that had been set by Democrats Political debate was once again totally enmeshed in the rhetoric and values of the liberal welfare state Mr Gingrich said Waste in Spending Cited Howard Phillips national director of the Conservative Caucus and one of Mr Reagans earliest and sharpest critics asserted Reagan is just the sort of nice fellow Id like to have as a neighbor but he defers too quickly to anyone in a threepiece suit Richard Rahn vice president of the United States Chamber of Commerce differed with those who contend that Mr Reagans agenda has been too modest Reagan may have been too successful too fast said Mr Rahn an economist He was elected before there were enough people ideologically committed to his program who also had the necessary technical skills to run the Government He said there was a widespread belief in the business community that there was tremendous waste in military spending adding that a public war on Pentagon fat would have provided Mr Reagan with the psychological advantage for building support for spending cuts across the board Cal Thomas vice president of communications for Moral Majority credited the President for transforming public thinking on Government spending but faulted him for his leadership on the abortion issue If we balance the budget and we still keep murdering a million and a half babies every year theres no way we can say were better off than we were four years ago said Mr Thomas Paul M Weyrich executive director of the Committee for the Survival of a Free Congress said Mr Reagans eagerness to avoid political confrontations with Congress robbed him of victories that he might have had Sadly Mr Weyrich wrote The radical surgery that was required in Washington was not performed Ronald Reagan made a pledge not to touch entitlement programs and thats one of the few pledges he has kept absolutely
IOWA DEMOCRATS SY ONLY MONDALE'S MARGIN OF VICTORY IN DOUBT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/25/us/iowa-democrats-sy-only-mondale-s-margin-of-victory-in-doubt.html,Leading Iowa Democrats say they are taking it for granted that Walter F Mondale is well ahead in the nations first battle for Presidential nominating delegates The critical question they say is whether Mr Mondales winning margin in the Iowa Democratic caucuses next February will be modest or impressive I think hes got to have 50 percent of the vote said Lieut Gov Robert Anderson who heads the Iowa campaign for Senator John Glenn of Ohio If he comes out with 35 percent hes lost After all this is Mondale territory He grew up next door in Minnesota just a few miles across the state line Hes been coming to Iowa for years Hes got a tremendous edge said John Law Iowa campaign coordinator for Senator Alan Cranston of California You have to give him 20 points for home court advantage Plus hes got endorsements from the organizational people  the state labor federation the Iowa teachers traditional party activists a majority of state legislators Right now hes probably got 60 percent of the Democrats who have made up their minds Fear of Too Great Expectations Privately members of the Mondale camp said they would welcome fashioning a steamroller image in Iowa but they are fearful of being set up by exaggerated expectations In 1972 for example Senator Edmund S Muskie of Maine then the frontrunner came in first in Iowa but narrowly Senator George S McGovern of South Dakota a candidate once again this year scored a psychological victory by finishing a surprisingly close second Theres no question Mondales out front said Ed Campbell the former state party chairman who is cochairman of the Mondale campaign How much is not clear He could take half the vote I hope hell be in the 40 percent range A survey done by The Des Moines Register in early October showed Mr Mondale preferred by 46 percent of Iowa Democrats Senator Glenn by 27 percent Mr McGovern 8 percent Senator Gary Hart of Colorado 4 percent Senator Cranston and the Rev Jesse Jackson 2 percent each former Gov Reuben Askew of Florida 1 percent and Senator Ernest F Hollings of South Carolina less than 1 percent Feeling pressure from Mr Mondale the others have stepped up their campaign efforts here in the past six weeks Senator Glenn sensing the need for at least a strong secondplace showing here has committed more time and energy to Iowa and reinforced a weak campaign organization with more staff and an experienced coordinator Jerry Vento who worked here in 1976 and 1980 for Jimmy Carter Democratic leaders expect from 90000 to 120000 Democrats to turn out for the approximately 2500 precinct caucuses Feb 20 The balloting at the precinct caucuses will select delegates to the partys county conventions The county conventions will then select delegates to the Congressional district and state conventions which in turn will select Iowas 58 delegates to the national party convention in San Francisco Candidates Step Up Efforts On Nov 12 Senator Cranston opened a onemonth 80000 television and radio campaign to increase his visibility Last Sunday his campaign underscored his support of a freeze on nuclear weapons with two dozen group viewings of the television movie The Day After Senator Hart recently revived what was widely seen as a moribund campaign effort with his third set of organizers with an ambitious doortodoor canvassing effort that contacted about 12000 households and with more appearances in the state and more vigorous stumping in rural areas Mr McGovern who stirred excitement with his plainspoken 10point program at the partys JeffersonJackson Day Dinner here on Oct 8 has set up a headquarters recruited Judy Wilson the Democratic chairman of Polk County and begun a push on Iowa campuses Mr Askew has quietly put together a 140member state steering committee gathering what his aides say are several thousand supporters in the business community and among antiabortion Democrats frustrated that other contenders do not oppose abortion Askew may surprise some people said Tom Tully a former Mayor of Dubuque a strongly Catholic city who is a backer of Senator Glenn With his stand on abortion he is attracting Catholic Democrats Hes a greater threat to Glenn than either Cranston or Mondale Glenns Task Is Defined For Senator Glenn the test in Iowa is to persuade the public and politicians across the country that he is in a tight twoman race with Mr Mondale Hes got to be within 10 percentage points of Mondale here in Iowa said Lieutenant Governor Anderson his chairman The immediate task of the Glenn organization his supporters and rivals agree is to convert the large crowds and curiosity the former astronaut generates with his personal appearances into dedicated supporters who will brave the Iowa winter and the intricacies of party politics next Feb 20Hes For Senator Cranston and the others the primary task is to break out of a pack of alsorans to compete with Mr Mondale and Senator Glenn They are all hampered by the hesitancy of pragmatic Democrats who do not see them as strong enough competitors to the two frontrunners The Cranston camp is banking heavily on using the strong organizing capabilities of Mr Law and Karen Kapler former state party officials to turn the peace issue and concern about nuclear war into a rallying point Cranston Lost His Monopoly Senator Cranston initally took the lead among Iowa peace groups but now others like Mr McGovern Mr Hart and Mr Mondale are reported getting support from those groups too Cranston lost his monopoly on that issue at a Peace Forum last August according to Peter B Slone Mr Mondales Iowa manager because several other candidates endorsed a nuclear freeze These shifting currents underscore the potential fluidity of support among Iowans who are in Mr Campbells words still standoffish at this stage Other Democrats in all camps comment that no one not even Mr Mondale has taken fire yet or lit a spark among Iowa Democrats Theres a lot of purposeful organization work but no magic said David Schoenbaum a University of Iowa professor and follower of the caucus process At this stage of the game everybodys support is soft said Jim Riordan a former candidate for agriculture commissioner who is uncommitted in the Presidential race People say now theyre for Mondale but when they go to the caucus they may not go that way Theres not that spark that has solidified support
JACKSON HONES HIS POSITION ON ISSUES,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/26/us/jackson-hones-his-position-on-issues.html,In nearly 16 years as a civil rights leader the Rev Jesse Jackson has amassed a voluminous record of positions on traditional civil rights concerns ranging from busing for school integration to affirmative action He has also touched on issues such as economic development education philosophy and financing of domestic programs and even some foreign policy issues But Mr Jacksons entry into the race for the Democratic nomination for President has required both a refining of his past positions and a broadening of the range of issues with which he must deal Coordinating the Jackson campaigns issues and research effort is Robert Bates an oil company executive who is a former executive assistant to Senator Edward M Kennedy Democrat of Massachusetts When Mr Jackson is in his Washington campaign headquarters Mr Bates with the help of experts in a number of areas has been conducting a series of early morning seminars The immediate goal Mr Bates said is to come up with detailed public position papers or internal briefing papers that will establish in writing the facts and figures behind particular positions Gut Reactions Defined In these seminars Mr Bates said Mr Jacksons gut reactions to many issues are predictable given his background in the civil rights movement and as a Baptist minister As an example he cited the candidates belief that while more Federal financing for public education was necessary to provide greater educational opportunity as well as instruction aimed at available jobs money alone could not instill the sense of responsibility and accountability in students teachers and parents that is also required to improve public education In the past Mr Jackson has coupled his views on education with condemnations of teachers unions and school administrators whose drive for job security and higher wages appeared to him to conflict with their job of educating children Mr Jackson does not have welldefined positions on a number of domestic and foreign policy issues But Mr Bates said that over the next few months detailed positions would be taken on such matters as fiscal policy aimed at eliminating the Federal budget deficit health care the economy and welfare reform capital punishment and criminal justice social policy and job training nuclear disarmament foreign policy and trade broadening business development opportunities through urban revitalization programs agriculture and immigration Missing as well from the list of the candidates public pronouncements are detailed views on such things as the environment and energy issues Focus on Voting Rights Act Perhaps the most developed position of the campaign so far is Mr Jacksons criticism of what he says is the Federal Governments failure to enforce the Voting Rights Act of 1965 and its prohibition against racially discriminatory election laws His position he has said evolved over the months he traveled around the country attempting to spur greater voter registration among blacks He concluded that it was not simply apathy that kept many blacks from registering but the continued existence of barriers to participation in the process Enforcement efforts have failed to focus aggressively on the new forms of denial he has said which take the form of dual registration schemes runoff primaries atlarge voting in municipal elections gerrymandering and annexation schemes These practices he said have cropped up to replace the illegal poll taxes and literacy tests of the past All are results of local legislative actions that he said had the effect of diluting the voting strength of blacks and other minorities Equal Rights Amendment Mr Jackson has said he supported the proposed Federal equal rights amendment and last week he criticized the House for not giving it the necessary twothirds support needed to send it to the states for ratification He has viewed it as essentially an economic rights amendment of particular importance to black and Hispanic women who he said on average earn 47 cents for every dollar earned by men In speeches he frequently says that assuring enforcement of the Voting Rights Act in the South will lead to the enfranchisement of large numbers of black women who are the sole support of their families Because many of these families live in poverty he says they would support measures that insure women equal pay for their work Chides Womens Movement Mr Jackson rarely mentions the proposed amendment and the womens movement without connecting it with enforcement of the Voting Rights Act and emphasizing the economic impact of the amendment As early as 1977 in a newspaper column he wrote that racism and not sexism was the more serious problem in the nation and criticized the womens movement saying it was led by a narrow constituency of upper middle class white females He also chided black women for their involvement in the womens movement which he said talked mainly to the problems of white middleclass women and sought to compete for their loyalty with the civil rights movement Supports Verifiable Freeze On nuclear disarmament Mr Jackson has said he supports a bilateral verifiable arms freeze as well as what he terms an adequate defense He has opposed the deployment of United States missiles in Europe and castigated the Reagan Administration for pursuing this policy while showing he said no real commitment to ongoing arms limitation talks in Geneva The issue of abortion has been a troublesome one for Mr Jackson whose personal opposition to it has often been viewed as support for antiabortion legislation He said recently that while he would not advise a woman to seek an abortion he would oppose any Government attempt to limit the legal right to an abortion or cut off Medicaid funds for abortions for poor women But Mr Jacksons comments always include an emphasis on taking responsibility for and living with the consequences of choosing abortion In a 1977 newspaper article deploring phonograph records movies and television shows that he said encouraged irresponsible attitudes about sex among teenagers Mr Jackson criticized the enlightened proponents of abortion for focusing on the consequences of decadence and not on causes Mr Jackson has supported a strong Government stand in favor of affirmative action programs maintaining that such efforts along with goals and quotas when appropriate were necessary to eradicate 200 years of overwhelming institutionalized discrimination against blacks and other minority groups Urges AntiApartheid Sanctions In the area of foreign policy Mr Jackson has stressed the need to pressure South Africa to end its segregationist apartheid policy He favors the use of trade sanctions such as those employed against Poland because of that Governments suppression of the Solidarity movement He said the United States decision to make South Africa a favored trading partner undermines the nations moral authority as a defender of human rights Mr Jackson has long supported the creation of a Palestinian state in the Middle East while also supporting Israels right to exist with secure borders He has called on the United States to initiate talks between Israel and other Arab countries along the lines of the Carter Administrations Camp David talks He has said he believes that United States marines in the multinational peacekeeping force in Lebanon should be withdrawn and replaced with troops from a nation not perceived as a supporter of Israel and the Maronite Christians who rule the country He has criticized the invasion of Grenada as an overreaction and a misuse of United States military strength in violation of the treaties with Caribbean and Latin American nations

NONFICTION IN BRIEF,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/books/nonfiction-in-brief-071520.html,THE LAW GIVETH Legal Aspects of the Abortion Controversy By Barbara Milbauer in collaboration with Bert N Obrentz 363 pp New York Atheneum 2195 In The Law Giveth Barbara Milbauer has compiled a valuable chronology of the abortion controversy and a catalogue of the ways in which foes of legalized abortion have attempted to hack away at the Supreme Courts decision in Roe v Wade to legalize abortion Unfortunately she not only examines the substance of the abortion debate but incorporates in her book all of its heat venom and oversimplification as well By the authors own count a total of 144 statutes and regulations have been passed to inhibit the right to an abortion during the last 10 years  either by prohibiting it outright or placing restrictions on how it can be performed The most important of these known as the Hyde amendments barred the use of Federal Medicaid funds to pay for nontherapeutic abortions Miss Milbauer argues that the Hyde amendments which the Supreme Court upheld in the 1980 case of Harris v McRae rendered Roe v Wade academic She argues that the alternatives for poor and pregnant women remain what they were prior to 1973  childbirth and further impoverishment or the illegal abortionist But she offers surprisingly little proof that during the past decade the Supreme Court has taken away the right to an abortion Indeed she claims at one point that the overwhelming majority of those deprived of Federal funds nonetheless manage to obtain safe legal abortions Much of this book consists of Miss Milbauers efforts to explain court decisions to the layman  a tricky business and one that she accomplishes quite nicely Regrettably her editorial intrusions do not end here and readers are subjected to some high decibel emotions ranging from sarcasm to exasperation to indignation to condescension
CHILDBIRTH AFTER 35: DISPELLING MYTHS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/style/childbirth-after-35-dispelling-myths.html,A paper on older mothers presented at the national conference of the National Association of Social Workers here last week concludes that some of the stereotypes and misconceptions about being parents after the age of 35 are unfounded The study entitled No Better Time The Choice of Parenting After 35 takes a look at what has been identified by one obstetrician as constituting a second normal curve a comparison with the traditional preponderance of childbirths in the 20s age group Although women have always had children throughout their reproductive years modern birthcontrol techniques and access to abortion have made the decision of when to have children far more a matter of choice For the first time in history the study reports large numbers of women are choosing to have children after the age of 35 In 1981 53 percent of all births to white women in Washington were to women over the age of 30 The study came about as a result of my own experience said Dr Iris Kern who teaches research at the University of the District of Columbia here I had my first child at the age of 27 and in a second marriage had another child at the age of 42 I was fully aware that the experience of parenting 15 years later was a vastly different experience than it had been in my 20s And I wondered whether my experience was true for other people but could find no research that had been done in the area The data for this study was collected starting in September 1981 said Dr Kern and the overwhelming single finding was that for the vast majority the experience was more positive than they had dared to imagine The women interviewed pointed to multiple advantages Those who had children for the first time said they felt they were in far better economic and psychological shape  their careers were established they felt they were more mature more patient And almost all said that although they had less physical energy at age 40 it was compensated for by more psychological energy Dr Kerns study of 83 babies born to 75 older mothers in the Washington metropolitan area who ranged in age from 38 to 49 found that contrary to expectations 80 percent of the mothers were able to deliver vaginally and 58 percent delivered without any kind of medication Only 15 percent experienced forceps delivery in contrast to approximately 60 percent of mothers of all ages We did find a prejudice on the part of some physicans against older mothers said Dr Kern but older mothers are more familiar with their bodies they arent intimidated and wont always listen to a physician who automatically suggests Caesarean section Women are in better shape at 35 today than their mothers they get more exercise they are into aerobic dancing they are eating better observed Dr Cecil Jacobson a Washingtonarea geneticist While risks such as decreased fertility in the mother and increase in Downs syndrome in the child are real the study concludes they do not represent anything like the risk imagined Twothirds of the women in the study believed that access to amniocentesis  a medical procedure by which the presence of serious medical problems in the fetus can be determined  helped them to make their decision Onethird of the women elected not to use amniocentesis Onethird of the women interviewed were firsttime mothers Roughly another third were women who had a history of problems with fertility and who had accepted the fact that they were not going to be parents And the remaining third were in second marriages and raising second families Seventeen percent of those interviewed had PhDs 9 percent had masters degrees and 5 percent were lawyers Sixtyfour of those interviewed were white 13 black and 5 of mixed racial background
"BUSINESS FORUM;
BLOCK MODELS AND SELF-DEFENSE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/27/business/business-forum-block-models-and-selfdefense.html,SUPPOSE youre an official of the Indianapolis chapter of a prominent national conservation group Your organizations activities along with those of 70 other diverse concerns are being studied by a new computer programming technique called block modeling This sophisticated technology studies your cash transactions communications patterns and other recorded financial and social interactions Unexpectedly the computer says that your organizations financial and social profile is like that of the Ku Klux Klan the John Birch Society another environmental group an emergency assistance association and the American Legion Youre all in the same bloc the computer says the study is publicly available and the guiltbyassociation consequences are all too obvious This example is real  part of a study recently reported in a scholarly book whose findings are impeccably qualified It graphically illustrates possible problems created by block modeling  a powerful new information technology for classifying individuals and organizations based on large amounts of seemingly mundane data on transactions and relationships While the craft of block modeling is inaccessible to all but a new information elite its powers have not been lost on highly placed individuals in foreign and domestic corporations as well as nonprofit organizations and government agencies Those who use block models exploit them as an efficient way to sort the good from the bad from the indifferent  whether people programs divisions or rival groups Applications of block modeling and sister technologies already number in the hundreds Block modeling is coming of age and possible applications include management separating fasttrack from slowtrack employees banking studying electronic funds transfers and other cash flow patterns professional sports figuring out the pro draft law enforcement investigating conspiracies among others But despite the versatility and broad appeal genuine problems can arise Computergenerated classifications have a strong mystique And it can be hard indeed to fight a computer classification whose hallmark is naming names through a computer analysis of ordinary activities The classification problems truly come to the fore in the national political arena For example a study of Washington special interest groups has been using a kindred method to probe similiarities among more than 70 organizations on the basis of shared issue interests in healthrelated areas like Medicare and abortion The resulting computer diagram lumps the Environmental Defense Fund with the American College of Cardiology and Merck  Company in a location far removed from major labor organizations like the United Auto Workers and the AFLCIO One need not be a lobbyist or PAC specialist to sense some of the political electricity of this placement or possible action implications BUT what defense does an organization or employee have against the possible misuse of block modeling or sister methods One should not look to Congress to pass a law Waiting for legislation is like waiting for Godot One should also not expect easy recourse through the traditional civil lawsuit In fact the law has yet to define limits to the block modeling enterprise and little legal fault can currently be found with most of the means of gathering the needed information for its use Still protective rules need to be fashioned even if they must sometimes fit in the nooks and crannies of legal categories  a new clause in a union contract for example In most situations an employee should at least be notified if he is the subject of something like a block model analysis by his employer If you are an unsuspecting victim there is no way to defend yourself Then focusing on rules for employee protection a range of unique problems must be dealt with For example the thrust of early computeroriented privacy legislation from the 70s was giving people the right to examine information in their own files The privacy gains were genuine but from a standpoint of block modeling they are largely irrelevant That is because block modeling classifies people on the basis of where they fit in a far larger web of relationships Therefore one has to be concerned with many more files than just ones own  some belonging to people one has no direct connections with One is thus vulnerable to all the problems of these third parties including inaccuracies in their files But if the third parties privacy rights are to be respected much of this relevant information must remain inviolate Thus individuals being classified through a block model or similar method need to be given a carefully calibrated set of rights to information in order to interpret their assigned positions and respond accordingly This information should at least include some basic knowledge about the data base including the scope of the population being modeled as well as what specific types of data have been or will be included Such data gives a crucial basis for understanding ones recourse For example if the block model put you in an unfavorable category and used such data as whom you bowled with or went to parties with this use of nonjob related information could be attacked as gratuitous One might contemplate giving an employee access to the full data base stripped of personal identifying information except his own location in it However the wide availability of precisely such tools as block modeling makes recovery of identities from even such apparently stripped files a real privacy risk  Still one may disclose the structural role of the different blocs without dipping down to a level of individual identities This last type of information combined with a specific right to know your individual bloc location can be enough to give a respectable road map for defense against the worst implications of guilt by association Very importantly effective ways also need to be developed to permit members of the same block to get together to mount a common defense In contrast to abuses like redlining or race sex or age discrimination the new technologies frequently pick out less than obvious groups whose members may easily fail to recognize they are being targeted in common Currently technical progress in block modeling is making it possible to conduct an aggressive defense by showing that in some cases there is an equally good block model leading to very different classifications In other words theres more than one way to structure the given data  so that one block model might for example stress conflicting factions while a second identifies options for negotiation or cooperation Thus responsible users of block modeling methods should also be prepared to disclose major alternative ways of organizing the data In the meantime possibly the most important 1984 New Years resolution is to remember that each time you pick up the telephone or send electronic mail in your office you may be adding to somebodys computer data base  and computers never forget
WOMEN STUDY ART OF POLITICS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/11/28/style/women-study-art-of-politics.html,The Republicans call theirs leadership forums The Democrats call theirs Impact 84 Whatever the name both are conferences for female party activists that are being held in cities throughout the nation These meetings which generally draw about 200 invited women have two major purposes to inform the women of the partys policies and to urge them to run for office in 1984 Betty G Heitman cochairman of the Republican National Committee explained it this way during a recent leadership forum here I feel we have not done as good a job as we could to arm our women leaders with as much information as they need at the grassroots level We hope these meetings will help them gear up for the 1984 campaign Mrs Heitman said this was the first year the Republicans had sponsored such meetings Similar forums have also been held in Indianapolis and San Diego she said with a fourth one planned for early next year in Atlanta Theyre Not a First The Democrats held their Impact 84 meeting in September in Washington and three or four meetings are planned for next year Theyre not a first but theyre the first in a long time said Lynn G Cutler vice chairman of the Democratic National Committee and director of its womens division We had similar conferences during the Johnson years Leaders of both parties agreed that a major reason for the conferences was the socalled gender gap the pattern emerging from polling data showing that women vote for Democrats more than men do What goes on at these meetings The recent Republican Womens Leadership Forum in the Franklin Plaza Hotel here included everything from speeches by top party officials to workshops on how to dress and act in a campaign There was a simulated television talk show in which women pretended they were candidates The weekend meeting drew 200 party activists and elected officials from 10 Northeastern states and the District of Columbia Much of the first day a Saturday was devoted to breakout sessions in which Reagan Administration policies were described to the women These sessions were conducted by officials from the Departments of Defense Labor Justice and Education and the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission People might ask you Why are we spending so much for defense  said Lawrence J Korb Assistant Secretary of Defense for Manpower in a session on arms negotiations I admit 250 billion a year is a lot of money But we need to spend it because defense was underfunded for two decades while the Soviets were spending a lot and because we dont want nuclear war The money helps us to have strong conventional forces as well as to maintain a nuclear balance Dr Lenora Cole Alexander director of the Womens Bureau of the Department of Labor told the women in a session called Fairness Under the Law that there had been a slight decrease in 1982 in the pay gap between men and women Women now earn 62 cents for every dollar earned by men she said So throw away those buttons that say 59 cents she said Theyre outmoded As the officials spoke many women took notes in notebooks that had been given to them along with a thick briefing book that included what were called this Administrations accomplishments and samples of speeches that you may wish to use in part or in whole when delivering speeches around your state Several Republican activists who may be delivering those speeches next year said in interviews that they were having trouble back home answering questions about such womens issues as the equal rights amendment and abortion both of which have failed to win support in party platforms Its damn difficult to be a Republican and a feminist these days said Mary Mather a Republican committee member from Philadelphia By not backing the ERA we lost a lot of viability with a lot of women I think the party has finally become aware that we may have a problem with a lot of people Were all very conscious of the gender gap added Diane Haslett Rudiano of Brooklyn NY vice president of the New York State Federation of Republican Women Thats why were here  to learn how to spread the message that will help change peoples minds Some of their best ammunition came from Elizabeth Hanford Dole the Secretary of Transportation whose keynote speech was devoted almost entirely to what she said President Reagan has done for women Among his accomplishments she said were helping to change Social Security laws to equalize benefits for widows and widowers helping eliminate the estate tax helping increase child care tax credits and reducing the socalled marriage tax Mrs Dole also noted the Presidents appointment of Sandra Day OConnor to the Supreme Court and of three women to Cabinetlevel positions Jeane J Kirkpatrick as chief United States representative at the United Nations Margaret M Heckler as Secretary of Health and Human Services and herself The President and all Republicans have a lot to offer the women of this country she said to loud applause But our message is not getting out Several women at the conference asked how they could deal with members of the press who they said often write negatively about Republican candidates Lyn Nofziger a former assistant to President Reagan told the women they should try to make friends with the press And Mary Jo Jacobi Special Assistant to the President for Public Liaison urged the participants to buy advertisements or print flyers if the press ignores or writes negatively about RepublicansIf we have to spend money to get our message across then we should spend money she said AudienceParticipation Sessions The Republican women seemed to enjoy the second day of the forum most It included audienceparticipation sessions on skills they would need in running for office  fundraising public speaking talkshow appearances and image development The most powerful outfit a woman can wear is a suit Nancy Thompson an image consultant from Washington told the women during a workshop called Candidate Image Development And a suit jacket is just about the most powerful item you can have she added fingering the lapels of her own tweed jacket And ladies leave it on Although most of the Republican women were already wearing suits Miss Thompsons lively presentation seemed to be one of their favorite sessions She recommended that the womens suits be in dark blues and grays and made of fabrics that look real If you walk outside and your suit goes Twinkle twinkle little star then it has too much polyester in it she said A female candidates handshake should be firm she added her eye contact direct and her jewelry small because small looks real And her name tag should always be worn on the same side she shakes hands with she said so the voters will be sure to see it A woman in the audience asked how she could keep male acquaintances from trying to kiss her while she was on the campaign trail Thats easy Miss Thompson replied Thrusting her right arm out in front of her like a football player straightarming an opponent she said Just extend your arm for a shake so he cant kiss you The

WOMEN'S ENDORSEMENT SEEMS A 2-WAY RACE,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/02/us/women-s-endorsement-seems-a-2-way-race.html,Like eager suitors the Democratic Presidential candidates have been courting the National Organization for Women in the hope of gaining the endorsement next week of the countrys largest feminist group The late entry of the Rev Jesse Jackson into the Presidential race has stirred not only uneasiness among his rivals but also turmoil within the womens organization Although NOW officials say privately that former Vice President Walter F Mondale remains the leading contender for the groups first Presidential endorsement Mr Jackson has emerged as a formidable rival for two reasons The first is that Mr Jackson is the only candidate to have pledged to name a woman as his VicePresidential choice a pledge that Judy Goldsmith the president of NOW termed very significant because its important to have the choice It has simply not been a possibility before said Mrs Goldsmith The door has been closed Weve been cheating our country Groups Image Is at Issue By all accounts the second reason is far more delicate Mr Jackson who is black will appeal to minority voters NOW whose 250000 members are mostly white women has sought hard but not too successfully to appeal to minority women The organizations officials said they fear that an endorsement of Mr Mondale or any of the other candidates will perpetuate the view expressed earlier by Mr Jackson that NOW is a white middleclass organization Its a problem its something were trying to correct said one official of the organization But no one is saying that this should be the sole determining factor We do have a history of working for civil rights issues and a lot of feminists began their political activity in the civil rights movement Aides to Mr Mondale had privately expressed concern that the group was planning to delay its endorsement to allow Mr Jackson a full hearing but Mrs Goldsmith said the announcement would be made here on Dec 10 or 11 as scheduled after a closed meeting of the 35member executive board Special Significance Cited The groups endorsement is especially significant because of its size its national network of women and because in the words of one Mondale aide Their support says the candidate is good on the issues The Mondale campaign and to some extent the organizations of such contenders as Senators John Glenn Alan Cranston and Gary Hart have lobbied for the endorsement stressing their support for the proposed Federal equal rights amendment the right of women to seek abortions and issues relating to child care and equitable pay insurance and pension rights At this point I am hopeful but far from confident said Nikki Heiderpriem a Washington lawyer who is director of Mr Mondales womens issues staff Jacksons working hard for it Eric Easter a aide to Mr Jackson said His views on womens issues are very very dear to him Women are another group that has been traditionally ignored in the political process Supporters Extend Effort Mr Mondale and some of his key supporters have spoken with Mrs Goldsmith and other members of the executive board Mr Jackson has met with Mrs Goldsmith twice and lobbying efforts in his behalf have been undertaken by such supporters as Maxine Waters majority whip of the California State Assembly Although Mr Jacksons statements on womens issues have hardly pleased the groups officials  he has criticized the womens movement for being led by a narrow constituency of upper middleclass white females and has indicated he was personally opposed to abortion  the candidate has muted and blurred some of those beliefs that many feminists found objectionable We are taking Jacksons candidacy very seriously Mrs Goldsmith said It addresses very specifically and very powerfully the needs of the minority community But we cannot ignore all the factors upon which we are evaluating all the candidates These criteria include the status of women on the candidates staff  whether theyre making policy or making coffee said one official of the group Other factors are the importance of womens issues in a candidates platform whether or not the candidate is considering a woman as vice president and electability or the candidates potential to defeat President Reagan It is the electability issue that may untimately give Mr Mondale the edge in picking up the endorsement Senator Glenn has quietly sought to gain the endorsement but one of his key feminist supporters Roxanne Conlin a Des Moines lawyer who ran unsuccessfully for Governor of Iowa in 1982 said Im not hopeful Glenn will get the endorsement Im being realistic Like most feminists I want Ronald Reagan out of the White House said Mrs Conlin who is head of the Glenn campaigns national policy council and a member of the NOW legal defense and education board Thats whats important And I think it is John Glenn who can beat Reagan
VATICAN PUBLISHES SET OF GUIDELINES ON SEX EDUCATION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/02/world/vatican-publishes-set-of-guidelines-on-sex-education.html,Excerpts from document page A6 ROME Dec 1  The Vatican issued a set of guidelines for sexual education today The document was viewed in church circles as largely a stern restatement of the Roman Catholic Churchs traditional attitudes The 36page declaration Educational Guidance in Human Love termed extramarital sexual relations a grave disorder and masturbation a grave moral disorder The document emphasized throughout that marriage was designed for procreation but recognized that it also served the purpose of the realization of the couple Homosexuality was described as a disorder and a social maladaptation While priests were urged to treat homosexuals with understanding they were warned not to accord them a moral justification Governments Urged to Act The document said it was the task of governments to safeguard citizens against injustices and moral disorders such as the abuse of minors and every form of sexual violence degrading dress permissiveness and pornography It also strongly urged governmental regulation of outlets of information and entertainment especially with regard to magazines films radio and television programs exhibitions shows and publicity By their intrusiveness and suggestion the statement said communication outlets display to youth and the very young  also and above all in the field of sex education  a continuous and conditioning stream of information and training which is very much more trenchant than that of ones own family The document was viewed by many church officials here as likely to widen the gap between the stern orthodoxy represented by Pope John Paul II and Roman Catholics favoring more liberal interpretations attuned to the worldwide relaxation of sexual mores Demands for Guidance The document was prepared by the Sacred Congregation for Catholic Education whose prefect is an American William Cardinal Baum A member of the congregation said today that the preparation of the document had been inspired by demands for guidance from parents and bishops and was a result of years of consultations with national conferences of bishops He described the document as a consensus fully mindful of the churchs traditional teachings The guidelines said sexual education should prepare future spouses to have knowledge of the natural methods of regulating their fertility Saying that artificial contraception was insistently propagated today the document urged that the Roman Catholic prohibition of such methods be taught at an appropriate age to prepare the young for responsible marriage It also stated the churchs opposition to abortion by stressing that sexual education must include respect for life in the womb Some Concessions Made While maintaining the churchs traditional restrictions against all practices that it deems impermissible the guidelines made some concessions in prescribing attitudes that parents educators and priests should adopt toward offenders For example in discussing masturbation the document attributed the practice to immaturity and advised that instead of punishment its underlying cause be sought From an educative point of view it said it is necessary to consider masturbation and other forms of auto eroticism as symptoms of problems much more profound which provoke sexual tension which the individual seeks to resolve by recourse to such behavior Pedagogic action therefore should be directed more to the causes than to direct repression of the phenomenon Teachers were instructed to help affected adolescents to feel accepted in a communion of charity to undramatize the practice and to not reduce his or her esteem and benevolence for the pupil Suggests Help for Homosexuals Similarly the section on homosexuality while denouncing it morally and speaking of it in terms of a grave disorder counseled a comprehending attitude and refrained from suggesting punishment Instead it told teachers and families to offer help  welcoming with understanding creating a climate of hope encouraging the emancipation of the individual and his or her growth in selfcontrol As possible causes of homosexuality the Sacred Congregation listed lack of affection immaturity obsessive impulses seduction social isolation and other types of frustration depravation in dress license in shows and publications Such a consideration of possible deep psychological causes is considered an advance from the earlier church attitude which categorically condemned homosexuality as mortal sin devoid of extenuating circumstances The statement which has already been distributed to all bishops strongly opposed devaluation of sex by reducing it to genital experience alone It stressed that sexual education is education in love and should never be separated from the morality of the Roman Catholic faith It also emphasized the predominant role of the family in such teaching
SEVERAL REPBUBLICAN WOMEN IN LEGISLATURES URGE PARTY TO SHIFT ON RIGHTS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/04/us/several-repbublican-women-in-legislatures-urge-party-to-shift-on-rights.html,In an angry eruption of frustration a group of Republican women who serve in state legislatures are demanding that their party and President Reagan come out more strongly in favor of womens rights They are in town this week for a bipartisan meeting of more than 350 women who are state legislators A Republican caucus Friday night quickly turned into a forum for the airing of grievances about the Reagan Administrations position on womens issues particularly its opposition to abortion and to the proposed Constitutional amendment on equal rights Theres an unawareness in this Administration of how strongly Republican women feel about womens issues said State Representative Julie Belaga of Westport Conn We are fed up with people saying Where are you on womens issues White House Action Sought The legislators told party leaders here including Betty Heitman cochairman of the Republican National Committee and Olympia J Snowe of Maine a member of the House of Representatives to communicate their sentiments to the White House The complaints appeared to have the support of a clear majority of nearly 100 women at the caucus many of whom wore buttons saying GOP for ERA The turnout for the caucus represented most of the Republicans at the meeting a national conference sponsored by the Center for the American Woman and Politics of Rutgers University It was the second time this year that highranking Republican women publicly criticized the Administration at a major political meeting for what they said is a lack of responsiveness on issues of concern to women The other was at a meeting this summer of the National Womens Political Caucus Convention Action Cited Representative Snowe told the group she was already working with the Administration on some of these key issues citing pay equity as an example But she added Its unfortunate the Republican Party has gotten on the defensive on womens issues We should be on the offensive She cited the Republican Partys traditional support of equal rights a position that was reversed when its endorsement of the equal rights amendment was dropped from the platform at its 1980 national convention Mrs Heitman admitted she was surprised at the depth of the legislators discontent She told them that top party leaders had been lax in listening and commended the legislators for being better at communicating with us Sharing of Experiences More than 600 women including government officials and political activists have been meeting since Thursday in what has been billed as the largest turnout ever of women serving in state legislatures About a third of the total of 993 are here This conference was designed to give the growing number of women who are legislators both Republicans and Democrats an opportunity to share experiences according to the director of the center Ruth Mandel But as it turned out some of Democratic participants seized the opportunity to needle their Republican colleagues because opinion polls consistently show that women are less enthusiastic than men about Mr Reagan And in a clear sign that Mr Reagan is worried about this gender gap Vice President Bush before addressing the group tonight said the President is concerned about it and had consulted pollsters to explain it Their advice was that the major part of the misunderstanding relates to economics Mr Bush said in a session with reporters Therefore the President believes that as the economy rises there will be a diminution of the difference in support At the conference dinner where his speech concerned not womens or states issues but the arms reductions talks Mr Bush unexpectedly agreed to the questionandanswer session he had earlier declined He acknowledged receipt of petitions from the conferees urging him like two Democratic Presidential candidates set to speak Sunday Senators Gary Hart and Alan Cranston to submit to questions I dont think its fair to let Hart and Cranston take all the questions he said prompting an outburst of cheers The Vice President was asked if the Administration supported the equal rights amendment Nope he replied The President took his case to the American people in 1980 To ask the President to change his position in an election year  hes not going to do that Some Defend Reagan Mr Reagan was defended by legislators like State Senator Ann Rydalch of Idaho who called herself part of a silent majority The President has had success as far as the economy she said This socalled gender gap is the only thing they have to try and drag him down Its a Democratic ploy

RELIGIOUS ALLIANCE AGAINST EXECUTIONS GROWS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/us/religious-alliance-against-executions-grows.html,The unsuccessful plea last week by Pope John Paul II to the Governor of Florida to halt the execution of a convicted murderer was the latest demonstration of a religious alliance against capital punishment that promises to grow stronger with the prospect of more executions On this issue the Roman Catholic Church is allied with most mainstream Protestant denominations and most Jewish theologians Fundamentalist Christians and some other Jewish thinkers endorse the death penalty The most definitive statement on capital punishment by the Catholic bishops of the United States came in November 1980 By a vote of 145 to 31 with 14 abstentions they resolved that the penalty should be done away with as a manifestation of our belief in the unique worth and dignity of each person from the moment of conception a creature made in the image and likeness of God In January this year the Pope called for clemency or pardon for those condemned to death The position is a relatively new one for the church hierarchy St Thomas Aquinas foremost of medieval philosophers made a classic defense of the penalty If a man be dangerous and infectious to the community on account of some sin it is praiseworthy and advantageous that he be killed in order to safeguard the common good Todays bishops rest their stand against the penalty partly on pragmatic arguments such as the possibility of error in condemning a person to death But deeper objections are drawn from their faith In the 1980 statement they held that abolition of capital punishment is most consistent with the example of Jesus who both taught and practiced the forgiveness of injustice and who came to give His life as a ransom for many  Bishop Renee Gracida of Corpus Christi Tex who initiated the resolution on capital punishment at the 1980 conference recalled in an interview that he had been troubled by the idea of execution since as a boy in Texas he was taken to see an electric chair The Bishop now 60 years old played a prominent role in the debate that preceded the execution in Florida in May 1979 of John Spenkelink Bishop Gracida then Bishop of Tallahassee wrote a pastoral letter opposing that execution the first to be carried out in Florida after a decadelong moratorium while the United States Supreme Court grappled with the issue Bishop Gracida offered two principles for todays opposition First capital punishment in our time is not morally permissible because the system of justice is flawed it cannot be administered equably justly without discrimination The second principle owes more to contemporary Catholic thought As he formulated it this principle holds Our society is experiencing an attack on human life  euthanasia the idea of death with dignity which is a euphemism for euthanasia abortion the violence and threat to life everywhere in the world Capital punishment is another form of attack on the sanctity of human life Odd Alliances Cited He observed that the bishops belief that the defense of life can be strengthened by eliminating the states power to take it away made for odd alliances saying Some of my friends in the Right to Life movement are very strong for capital punishment and some of my friends who oppose capital punishment are very strong for abortion Both groups are inconsistent We must be consistent The bishops firmest allies on abortion and firmest adversaries on the death penalty outside their own church are to be found among Protestant fundamentalist groups They admit to no inconsistency In an interview Richard Cizik research director of the National Association of Evangelicals defended the position that the sanctity of human life calls for justice He said We are not recommending the death penalty in any specific case but if no crime however atrocious is considered serious enough to warrant capital punishment then the respect for the sacredness of life itself is eroded That would diminish the value of life The view of the evangelicals is not generally subscribed to by the mainstream Protestant denominations such as Episcopalians Methodists and Presbyterians Several of them were ahead of the Catholic bishops in opposing capital punishment declaring their position in the 1950s Concern Over Social Conditions For these groups Scripture alone does not offer sufficient guidance on capital punishment Their opposition is tied to a wider concern over existing social conditions The American Baptist Churches in the USA for example emphasized in a 1977 resolution against capital punishment that almost half of the prisoners on death row come from minority groups That on its face the Baptist group declared is immoral and unjust Such concerns are shared by groups not known for devotion to religion such as the American Civil Liberties Union But there is also a specifically Christian source of opposition that springs from faith in the possibility of redemption As the Christian Church Disciples of Christ declared in 1957 Christian justification of punishment is always found in the hope of rehabiliation of the offender since dead people cannot be rehabiliated we can in no way defend capital punishment on Christian grounds Differences of opinion or of emphasis remain Whereas since 1966 the Lutheran Church in America has urged abolition on the ground that the death penalty falls on the weakest groups in society makes irrevocable any miscarriage of justice and ends the possibility of restoring the convicted person to effective citizenship the more conservative American Lutheran Church in 1972 affirmed our theological heritage which accords to the state the right to impose the death penalty A Lutheran can accept Luthers words that God has delegated his authority for punishing evildoers to civil magistrates yet find that under existing conditions using that power to execute people is wrong Thus believers in identical doctrines continue to reach conflicting conclusions Views of Human Nature The Rev Virginia Mackey a consultant for the National Interreligious Task Force on Criminal Justice which is associated with the National Council of Churches attributes the division among the devout to contrasting views of human nature She said in an interview There are those like myself who believe that the message of religion is restoration People of faith seek conversion to the will of a loving God who wants people to relate to each other The opposing view as she interprets it is that people respond best to force so one must speak to the worst aspects of human nature Christians who oppose the death penalty must confront not only the darker side of human nature but also the tough rules of the Old Testament which mandated death not only for murder but also for such crimes as profaning the Sabbath and committing adultery with a married woman In particular they must deal with the legal retaliation called for in the Book of Exodus Life for life eye for eye tooth for tooth hand for hand foot for foot burning for burning wound for wound stripe for stripe Liberal theologians like Miss Mackey urge that this strong language be read in historical perspective The Torah was setting limits on the blood vengeance that prevailed among tribes and cults as monotheism was being developed he said It expressed an effort by the people of Israel to move away from tribal worship and vengeance The words seem punitive today but they actually set forth in legal language restraints on punishments New Testament Messages However one interprets the Old Testament Christians can find gentler messages in the New Testament which as Miss Mackey sees it moved beyond restraint and mercy to forgiveness thats what Jesuss stories are about Wolfe Kelman a Conservative rabbi and executive vice president of the Rabbinical Assembly emphasized in an interview that the Old Testaments rule that a life must be taken for certain crimes was virtually eliminated by Talmudic scholars 2000 years ago The rabbi drew attention to the fact that in Israel the death penalty is not applied even to terrorists The single exception was made in the case of Adolf Eichmann who was hanged in 1962 for crimes against the Jewish people and humanity Most Jewish groups that have addressed the issue secular as well as religious have come down against capital punishment although Orthodox Jews do not find such opposition written into the guiding rules of their faith Rabbi David Bleich professor of Jewish law and ethics at the Benjamin Cardozo Law School of Yeshiva University pointed out in an interview that the Biblical commandment thou shalt not kill was meant to apply to homicides not for taking the life of a criminal by the state Rabbi Bleich himself is against capital punishment on evidentiary grounds He finds that convictions are usually obtained on circumsantial evidence and that is not satisfactory Nevertheless most spokesmen for religious bodies are in a minority Polls have consistently found that two out of three Americans whether Protestant Catholic or Jewish favor the death penalty
BERNARDIN ASKS CATHOLICS TO FIGHT BOTH NUCLEAR ARMS AND ABORTION,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/us/bernardin-asks-catholics-to-fight-both-nuclear-arms-and-abortion.html,Excerpts from speech page B8 Joseph Cardinal Bernardin the Archbishop of Chicago called on Roman Catholics yesterday to open a broad attack on a cluster of issues related to the sanctity of life among them nuclear arms abortion and capital punishment We intend our opposition to abortion and our opposition to nuclear war to be seen as specific applications of this broader attitude Cardinal Bernardin declared in a speech at the Bronx campus of Fordham University We have also opposed the death penalty because we do not think its use cultivates an attitude of respect for life in society Delivering the annual Gannon Lecture the Cardinal said the various issues made a seamless garment that deserved the utmost attention of the American Catholic church He said Catholics should build a constituency to press all of the churchs prolife moral positions rather than treat them as separate causes Many church leaders have noted tensions and isolation between foes of abortion on the one hand and critics of nuclear arms on the other While stressing the need for moral consistency the Cardinal conceded that sharp divisions existed over these issues among Catholics He also said concern for the unborn fetus must be accompanied by a concern for people living in poverty Cardinal Bernardin has played an exceptionally prominent role in the churchs stance against both nuclear war and abortion He was chairman of the bishops committee that produced a pastoral letter condemning nuclear war and was recently named chairman of the Bishops ProLife Committee to fill the vacancy left by the death of Terence Cardinal Cooke on Oct 7 The Cardinals speech outlined a rationale for a major campaign by the American bishops Though the hierarchy has taken positions on each of these concerns church officials say the issues have remained separated in church programs and in the minds of millions of American Catholics As the nations bishops have become more outspoken on these matters several prelates have spoken of the need for greater coordination among advocates of the various issues and a more vigorous effort to convince Catholics that the issues belong together At their annual meeting last year Archbishop John R Roach of Minneapolis then head of the National Conference of Catholic Bishops applied similar thinking in his presidential address calling for a common fight against nuclear war poverty and abortion Central American Policy Cardinal Bernardin included these concerns in stressing the urgency of developing a consistent ethic of life in our culture and extended this reasoning to voice opposition to the Reagan Administrations policy toward Central America He said Administration policy relies predominantly on the threat and the use of force which is increasingly distancing itself from a concern for human rights in El Salvador and which fails to grasp the opportunity of a diplomatic solution to the Central American conflict The Cardinal said the entire list of concerns fell within the scope of the Prolife Committee which in the past has publicly dealt almost exclusively with abortion Asserting that modern technology posed new and grave threats to life Cardinal Bernardin said society faced a qualitatively new range of moral problems He said the crucial question had become In a time when we can do anything technologically how do we decide morally what we never should do He said the church had a responsibility to make its moral positions known Such a defense of life will draw upon the Catholic moral position and the public place the church presently holds in the American civil debate he said The pastoral letter  The Challenge of Peace  he continued links the questions of abortion and nuclear war The letter does not argue the case for linkage that is one of my purposes today he said It is important to note that the way these two issues are joined in the pastoral places the American bishops in a unique position in the public policy discourse of the nation No other major institution presently holds these two positions in the way the Catholic bishops have joined them There should always be a presumption against taking human life the Cardinal said but in a limited world marked by the effects of sin there are some narrowly defined exceptions where life can be taken He underscored the bishops conditional acceptance of a nuclear deterrent as a step toward disarmament and said that thinking about capital punishment had shifted in recent decades While the church still upholds the belief of St Thomas Aquinas that a state has the right to invoke capital punishment Cardinal Bernardin said the Pope and the bishops have increasingly disapproved of the practice on the basis that more humane methods of defending the society exist and should be used
EXCERPTS FROM CARDINAL BERNARDIN'S APPEAL FOR A 'CONSISTENT EHTIC OF LIFE',https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/07/nyregion/excerpts-from-cardinal-bernardin-s-appeal-for-a-consistent-ehtic-of-life.html,Following are excerpts from the address yesterday by Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago at Fordham University in the Bronx Today I will discuss the pastoral letter in terms of the relationship of our Catholic moral vision and American culture Specifically I wish to use the letter as a starting point for shaping a consistent ethic of life in our culture In keeping with the spirit of a university I have cast the lecture in the style of an inquiry an examination of the need for a consistent ethic of life and a probing of the problems and possibilities which exist within the church and the wider society for developing such an ethic I do not underestimate the intrinsic intellectual difficulties of this exercise nor the delicacy of the question  ecclesially ecumenically and politically But I believe the Catholic moral tradition has something valuable to say in the face of the multiple threats to the sacredness of life today and I am convinced that the church is in a position to make a significant defense of life in a comprehensive and consistent manner The fundamental contribution of The Challenge of Peace I believe is that we have been part of a few central forces which have created the new moment We have helped to shape the debate now we face the question of whether we can help to frame a new consensus concerning nuclear policy The new moment is filled with potential it is also filled with danger The dynamic of the nuclear relationship between the superpowers is not a stable one It is urgent that a consensus be shaped which will move us beyond our present posture Precisely because life is sacred the taking of even one human life is a momentous event Indeed the sense that every human life has transcendent value has led a whole stream of the Christian tradition to argue that life may never be taken That position is held by an increasing number of Catholics and is reflected in the pastoral letter but it has not been the dominant view in Catholic teaching and it is not the principal moral position found in the pastoral letter What is found in the letter is the traditional Catholic teaching that there should always be a presumption against taking human life but in a limited world marked by the effects of sin there are some narrowly defined exceptions where life can be taken This is the moral logic which produced the just war ethic in Catholic theology The dominant cultural fact present in both modern warfare and modern medicine which induces a sharper awareness of the fragility of human life is our technology To live as we do in an age of careening development of technology is to face a qualitatively new range of moral problems The essential question in the technological challenge is this In an age when we can do almost anything how do we decide what we ought to do The even more demanding question is In a time when we can do anything technologically how do we decide morally what we never should do I would however highlight a basic issue the need for an attitude or atmosphere in society which is the pre condition for sustaining a consistent ethic of life The development of such an atmosphere has been the primary concern of the respect life program of the American bishops We intend our opposition to abortion and our opposition to nuclear war to be seen as specific applications of this broader attitude We have also opposed the death penalty because we do not think its use cultivates an attitude of respect for life in society The purpose of proposing a consistent ethic of life is to argue that success on any one of the issues threatening life requires a concern for the broader attitude in society about respect for human life The first is contained in The Challenge of Peace in the connection drawn between Catholic teaching on war and Catholic teaching on abortion Both of course must be seen in light of an attitude of respect for life The more explicit connection is based on the principle which prohibits the directly intended taking of innocent human life The principle is at the heart of Catholic teaching on abortion it is because the fetus is judged to be both human and not an aggressor that Catholic teaching concludes that direct attack on fetal life is always wrong This is also why we insist that legal protection be given to the unborn The same principle yields the most stringent binding and radical conclusion of the pastoral letter that directly intended attacks on civilian centers is always wrong The bishops seek to highlight the power of this conclusion by specifying its implications in two ways first such attacks would be wrong even if our cities had been hit first second anyone asked to execute such attacks should refuse orders The use of this principle exemplifies the meaning of a consistent ethic of life The principle which structures both cases war and abortion needs to be upheld in both places It cannot be successfully sustained on one count and simultaneously eroded in a similar situation Those who defend the right to life of the weakest among us must be equally visible in support of the quality of life of the powerless among us the old and the young the hungry and the homeless the undocumented immigrant and the unemployed worker Consistency means we cannot have it both ways We cannot urge a compassionate society and vigorous public policy to protect the rights of the unborn and then argue that compassion and significant public programs on behalf of the needy undermine the moral fiber of the society or are beyond the proper scope of governmental responsibility

Roosevelt era was recycled well beyond the 1930s so the conservatives will inherit a large permanent part of the Washington turf The Reagan Administration they say is their time for being credentialed in the capital Establishment In my view said Morton C Blackwell another conservative in the West Wing the most important achievement of this Administration is the literally hundreds and hundreds of appointees who share the Presidents philosophy who have been credentialed in Government For conservatives this is the great watershed Both Mr Cribb and Mr Blackwell 44 who is a Presidential assistant for liaison with conservative religious and civic organizations speak with the feeling of two enduring pilgrims They say they were first stirred back in the earliest days of reading Russell Kirks warnings hearing William F Buckley Jrs prescriptions and acting on Barry Goldwaters breakthrough to the national hustings They exemplify the two taproots of Administration conservatives Mr Cribb is from the movements intellectual sphere nurtured by such organizations as the Intercollegiate Studies Institute which he directed in recent years Mr Blackwell who was the youngest Goldwater delegate at the 1964 convention took a more muscular approach organizing student conservatives and eventually becoming director of the College Republican National Committee The working conservatives of the White House are largely unknown to the public but very familiar to the onetime cottage industry of conservative polemicists fund raisers lobbyists and intellectuals now booming in Washington Regeneration is quietly unfolding far beyond such front row conservatives as Edwin Meese 3d the counselor to the President or David A Stockman the theoristbecomeimplementer as budget director They include a busy coterie of a few dozen relatively young officials at or just beyond the White House West Wing plus the hundreds more that they in turn have recruited farther down the hierarchy The first rule is that people are policy said Edwin J Fuelner Jr president of the Heritage Foundation the movements prosperous think tank Theyre all over town he says happily of his colleagues Theres no instant gratification theyre here for long haul Privately members within this group complain about some wheel spinners and goofies among the faithful who have landed Administration jobs But Mr Blackwell is credited for his hardpolitics past with more than zealotry The Perfect is the enemy of the Good is a political maxim attributed to him by another conservative who says Blackwell is into reality BareKnuckled Talent Mr Cribb likewise is credited with a certain bareknuckled talent within what seems the perpetual moderate conservative struggle of the Reagan White House As an adviser to Mr Meese he keeps the conservative agenda alive and kicking at the White House day after day meeting after meeting according to his supporters Some moderates privately groan about him and his relentless concern for parochial school tax credits public school prayer abortion controls and other conservative priorities complaining that they must negotiate compromises and escape hatches for the President up in the more realistic world of Capitol Hill Conservatives counter that whatever the separate squabbles they have already won on the two dominant issues of largescale military budgets and deemphasized Federal social spending Beyond that they claim a rich and widely dispersed contribution in intellectual capital to the Federal bureauracy appointees beyond the stereotype conservative The latter lately is jokingly summarized by some conservatives critical of their brethren in the rallying cry Let Reagan Be Viguerie This is a reference to Richard Viguerie the conservative fund raiser who regularly complains that the Administration gives short shrift to its truest conservative principles They cite upperlevel officials such as Michael J Horowitz the neoconservative who is counsel to Mr Stockman John S Herrington the Reagan loyalist from California whose arrival as White House personnel director soothed conservatives William J Bennett chairman of the National Endowment for the Humanities William F Baxter assistant Attorney General for antitrust and John A Svahn assistant to the President for policy development and a dozen others Mr Cribb who said he once knew each one of the 200 original conservative activists in the country is pleased to say he cannot keep up with the movements growth He waxed nostalgic in describing a recent tableau in which he was escorting his lifelong hero Russell Kirk from the White House and they suddenly saw William F Buckley Jr arriving at the South Gate bearing luggage for a quiet weekend stay with the Reagans What better index is there of the change of times Mr Cribb said he asked Mr Kirk And there the two of them were said Mr Cribb greeting each other as fellow confidantes of the President of the United States
FRAYNAND FARCE GO HAND IN HAND,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/arts/fraynand-farce-go-hand-in-hand.html,LONDON  Sometime in the middle of the 1960s Michael Frayn wrote an article in the British Sunday newspaper The Observer entitled Business Worries The business in question was show business and the worries were those of the audience Or rather they were those of the actors that communicated themselves to the audience The key sentence in the essay is All the time one is waiting aghast for some embarrassing disaster to occur Among the disasters itemized by Mr Frayn are the supposed corpse that can hardly avoid taking visible breaths after perishing in a strenuous sword fight the pause that may turn out to be pregnant with a forgotten line and the vital prop that gets lost Mr Frayn was not a playwright when he wrote that piece but he is now And in Business Worries may be discerned the promise of Noises Off the backstage farce that is currently exhausting its third set of actors in London and that opens tonight on Broadway at the Brooks Atkinson Before being a playwright Mr Frayn was a novelist and before being a novelist he was a journalist Before being a journalist he was very young Born in 1933 he was a student at Cambridge University in the mid 1950s a good time for aspiring writers and theater people His Cambridge days were prefaced by what were then the statutory two years in the army A linguist he found himself assigned to a military Russian course during which he appeared in a production of Gogols The Inspector General He recalls one night on which he attempted to make his prescribed exit I pulled a door which I should have pushed and stood there while stagehands on the other side fought with crowbars to open it It broke my nerve He has never appeared on a stage since But in those moments were sown the earliest seeds of Noises Off which is about a production of a play in which everything goes wrong It concerns a group of actors on tour with a sexfarce called Nothing On In Act One we watch a dress rehearsal even more than usually fraught of the opening scene In Act Two we are backstage while the same scene is performed to a matinee audience we watch the actors rush silently on and off or off and on and we glimpse them in silhouette going through the motions of what we have already seen In Act Three the tour the play and the actors are on their last legs all is chaos The usual theatrical hazards are reinforced by sexual jealousy drunkenness and lost contact lenses among the cast and friction between the director and the stage management Writing it was extremely hard work Mr Frayn said recently I thought my brain would fall out Long before Id finished I thought Id walk off a cliff The director Michael Blakemore one of the shrewdest craftsmen in the English theater said frankly that when rehearsals began he didnt know whether it would work or not it was pretty unprecedented to ask actors to spend a third of their time acting with their backs to the audience  Noises Off  said Mr Frayn is about the necessity for keeping a performance going  which is what we all do though not many people have recognized the play as having a general application Since Noises Off is a play about people at work rather than the neat artificial mechanism that usually constitutes farce there has always been a problem about winding it up Mr Frayn says he has lost count of the number of endings he has written The original London cast finally rebelled and refused to try any more For the preBroadway tryout in Washington and for the new cast in London he wrote what he describes as a quite workable ending Most British critics found the original ending unsatisfying but had laughed so much during the first two acts that they didnt care Americans who have seen the play in London have had varied reactions One lady stormed out after the first act having mistaken a parody of British sex farce for the thing itself On the Washington evidence though Mr Frayn does not feel that British and American reactions have differed much Indeed he said In Washington they laughed more if possible than in London Weve only changed one or two words though we have just discovered that the title which refers to offstage sound effects is meaningless in America They think its a political slogan like Tories out  The atmosphere of the play is so authentic that one would assume Mr Frayn to have been soaked in the theater all his life Actually he came late to it Traumatized by the Russian experience he kept away from plays at Cambridge though he did develop an interest in revues The first thing I did at Cambridge he recalled with a blush was to buy a dinner jacket  dinner jackets being de rigueur for members of the university revue club the Footlights He wrote one of their annual shows singlehandedly but after that he said I turned my back on the theater except for making fun of it He did this to great effect in many of his columns as a professional journalist Journalism had been his main extracurricular pursuit as a student though he had distant hopes of being a novelist As he wrote selfmockingly in another article Is there any other honorable career for an arts graduate In the meantime he thought of himself as a reporter and got a sixmonth trial on The Guardian the national daily newspaper based in the north of England His six months in the north expanded to two years The Guardian then moved him to London as a columnist He had written what he calls funny leading articles comedy now became his profession He pursued it thrice weekly on The Guardian from 1960 to 1962 and then on The Observer every Sunday from 1962 to 1968 The change was made partly in order to buy time to write books The Frayn columns have become classics They were regularly collected into book form in the 60s and a new retrospective selection has just been published with an editorial introduction describing the author as the funniest journalist of our time and one from whom all his British successors have stolen The essays stand in fact in a very recognizable tradition of English and American humor They deal with social and domestic mishaps and embarrassments from trying to help your wife cook from impenetrable recipes to pretending you have caught someones name at a party What Mr Frayn added was a gift for characterization The 1960s were Britains most fashionconscious years and he created the ultimate trendy couple Christopher and Lavinia Crumble childless themselves but always willing to pass on to the author the most advanced ideas on how to raise his own brood The Crumbles we are given to understand live in streamlined comfort while the Frayns make do with companionable squalor And beneath them are their other friends Horace and Doris Morris who live in uncompanionable squalor Times have changed but the types remain recognizable And Mr Frayn fused them into a comic system At Cambridge he passed from studying languages to Moral Sciences a subject known in most other places as philosophy His humor has a wide frame of intellectual reference from the outlandish to the everyday He considers the complications of abortion as exemplified by the unborn 16thcentury genius Ivan Kudovbin He Kudovbin but he wasnt He furnishes a guide to parent care for progressive children Parents are just large human beings They arent as fragile as they look He writes a long poem The Rime of the Wedding Guest My intention is that it should be recited or murmured simultaneously with the recitation of The Rime of the Ancient Mariner as a sort of accompanying ostinato The style is always gentle always lethal  Besides farcical things happen to him He bears a passing physical resemblance to another British playwright Peter Nichols and once sat at a dinner graciously accepting condolences on the closing of a play which Mr Nichols had written What made it worse was that his interlocutor was an official of the National Theater which was staging one of Mr Frayns Chekhov translations at the time I myself remember sitting with him in a noisy restaurant and saying that my favorite among all his novels was Toward the End of the Morning He said that he was interested to hear that but he could not agree his own favorite was Toward the End of the Morning That novel which we both enjoyed so much and on whch we were so signally unable to communicate dealt  very much from Mr Frayns own experiences  with life on a quality newspaper Its characters are a few effortless highflyers and in the majority effortful trudgers impatient with their wives and doomed never to appear on television They are mutatis mutandis the same kind of people who appear in his journalism and his plays He is not one of Britains playwrights of social unhpeaval he belongs with Alan Ayckbourn Tom Stoppard and Mr Nichols the middleclass ironists His theatrical career got started in 1970 Having come to mock I stayed to pray he said The Broadway producer Alexander H Cohen was then operating in London and commissioned a twocharacter sketch from him as part of a program to be called Mixed Doubles The sketch was eventually turned down on grounds of taste it required a babys diaper to be changed on stage Mr Frayn was so riled that I determined to write three more short plays to go with it All were duologues and the four were staged under the title The Two of Us The last was a miniature but fully plotted farce in which two actors play all the roles Mr Frayn noted that the hectic activity looked funnier from behind and this too was stored up for Noises Off The Two of Us got terrible notices but ran nonetheless Since then Mr Frayn has had critical and popular success with Alphabetical Order set on a local newspaper Clouds set in Cuba and Make and Break set at a sales conference None of these plays though are about their settings They are about people colliding competing seeing things differently the stuff of philosophy  or of farce The hero of Make and Break a manic worker is according to his author an extreme version of someone who needs to consume the world around him  someone like myself Not only inert material but human beings get consumed But this is not a despairing vision he insisted Its not bad to be made use of One of the strengths of life is to feel that one could be of use Just as Make and Break is not a denunciation but an exploration so Noises Off is not based as some critics have suggested on hatred of actors but as Mr Frayn puts it on admiration for their courage Many writers lose their comic sense as they grow older Mr Frayn at 50 and in a menacing world is as funny as ever But then he has never sold comedy short Comedy is about the grimness of the world he said Its one way of looking at pain and difficulty  Robert Cushman is theater critic of The Observer
FAMILY LIFE BELIES ITS BEGINNINGS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/nyregion/family-life-belies-its-beginnings.html,The following article is based on reporting by Sandra Gardner Andrea Lichota Fredda Sacharow Carlo M Sardella and Patricia Squires and was written by Mrs Gardner DESPITE the hue and cry that heralded it Family Life  or sex education  has settled into New Jersey classrooms with barely a whisper Although no figures are available state education officials believe that the program has been or is being implemented in every school district despite a lack of materials for younger children despite a lack of training for teachers and despite the reluctance of some teachers and school boards Pockets of opposition remain but they are nothing like the organized efforts that preceded adoption of the program In many classrooms an initial uneasiness soon dissipated as it did for the students of Linda Chermark health and Family Life instructor at Garfield High School in Bergen County The questionandanswer box in her classroom was full of notes for the first few classes she said but after the first few weeks we became very comfortable with each other trusted each other and they were able to ask these questions in class A major reason for the relative smoothness of the programs start was the nature of the educational mandate itself Mandate is a fighting word to New Jerseys home rule advocates But what the Family Life mandate required was the participation of the community it left to each school district the course content the materials to be used and the amount of time to be devoted In addition before any Family Life class was taught parents were to have a copy of the curriculum outline and an excusal form to let them remove their child from those portions of a class they found objectionable One of the nice things about this said Mary Guess Flamer educational program specialist for the states Department of Education is that this is the first time parents have been mandated to be included in curriculum development New Jersey is the third jurisdiction in the country to require sex education the others are Maryland and the District of Columbia All of the states 611 districts were directed starting this year to teach their own programs in four broad areas  Emotional psychological and physical aspects of interpersonal relationships  Human reproduction and sexuality  Development of responsible personal behavior  Establishment of a strong family Before the administrative code was made final in 1980 only 40 percent of New Jerseys school districts had sexeducation programs according to the State Board of Education Some of these consisted of little more than a film on menstruation for fifthgrade girls and a high school anatomy class It was a controversy involving a school that did have a sexeducation program that was one of the factors leading to the statewide mandate Dumont in Bergen County had had such a program for 12thgraders since 1970 In 1977 one family sought to have its daughter excused from the birthcontrol part of the course However the local school board refused and the parents took the case to the state board and the Commissioner of Education then Dr Fred G Burke As a result state education officials began reviewing sexeducation policy which had last been set in 1967 and decided to call for a statewide mandate The Dumont case next went to the Appellate Division of Superior Court which in 1979 dismissed it as moot since the Family Life mandate was by then in the works with provisions for community involvement and parental excusal The Catholic Church which had filed an amicus curiae brief on the side of the parents threw its support heavily behind the mandate because of the provisions for parental participation The bishops in the state issued a pastoral letter in 1981 supporting the mandate and directing parochial schools to implement Family Life education On Dec 1 the Vatican issued a lengthy declaration on sex education that said the schools role should be that of assisting and completing the work of parents furnishing children and adolescents with an evaluation of sexuality    Although the Catholic Church in the state supports the mandate conservative parent and religious groups have opposed it In May 1982 a suit filed by the New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents reached the State Supreme Court which found 7 to 0 for the state school board The following November the United States Supreme Court declined to hear the coalitions appeal Most of the opposition has involved teaching about contraception abortion sexual abuse incest homosexuality and masturbation For example Joseph Remoll a health instuctor who teaches the Family Life course in Passaic Township Morris County said that such topics had no lesson plans or teaching techniques and are difficult to teach without morality Morality and the teaching of ethical values are what most worry parents teachers and school board members In his new book Raising a Child Conservatively in a Sexually Permissive World Dr Sol Gordon director of the Institute for Family Research and Education at Syracuse University says There is in teaching a vast difference between being moral and being moralistic Moral education encourages people to strive toward the accepted ideals of a society and presents facts which facili tate responsible decisionmaking This is an important part of any sexuality education curriculum One of the leaders of the opposition John Tomicki of Ringwood associate director of the New Jersey Coalition of Concerned Parents said that the Family Life mandate tramples on parental rights and that sex education belonged in the home Mary S Calderone an adjunct professor in the human sexuality program in New York Universitys Department of Health Education agrees that sex education can never take the place of what parents are obligated to do but adds that schools have to teach it because parents havent been doing a good job The facts show it she says Kids say I wish I could talk to my mother and father about this but they cant Its important that it be taught skilfully and well And Nicholas Burke director of curriculum for the Trenton schools said that a bad introduction to students is worse than none at all This  the teachers ability  may be one of the problems says Dr Charity E Runden director of the Runden Institute of Marital Counseling and Sex Therapy in Upper Montclair and a consultant to many districts in the implementation of the mandate The teachers want help she said They wish they knew more and had more training Joan Dreyfuss coordinator of Family Life education in Dumont said I dont think our staff  or our parents  are prepared Daniel Watter an instructor in the Department of Health Science at William Paterson College in Wayne thinks that the problem lies not so much with teachers as with the intrusion of the community and its censorship In his course Family Life and Sex Education Methods and Curriculum a graduatelevel class he has instructed about 75 teachers to date Teachers are very much concerned about parental reactions Mr Watter said Theyve said Im afraid if I say something thats objectionable to somebody Im going to lose my job Many teachers say that kids are asking about topics not included in the curriculum because the community didnt think they were appropriate for class discussion The way theyre choosing curriculum is based on the local curriculum committees level of comfort with these topics and is not necessarily a reflection of what those students want and need to know If parents could only realize that kids hunger for information says Madeline Trevor a teacher at Matawan Regional High School which serves students from Matawan and Aberdeen Matawan was one of the districts that had the most opposition to the Family Life program even though since 1979 it had a sexeducation course that included abortion rape incest and sexrole conflicts such as homosexuality transvestites and transsexuals There were no real problems until 1980 when the mandate came out Mrs Trevor said Then those parents that had fears came out of the woodwork and said Youre teaching sex ed  Like those in many other districts Matawan educators held meetings with community groups that went on far into the night The Board of Education faced with a suit by a parents organization twice lifted the curriculum Finally Mrs Trevor recalled the Citizens Committee went over the curriculum  word by word  until agreement was reached They were afraid she said that we were going to say Everyone should have an abortion or that we were going to make their child into a homosexual In Sayreville the Family Life Committee came up with two sets of recommendations a majority and a minority report The majority wanted contraception abortion homosexuality and masturbation included in the curriculum the minority did not The school board opted for the minority view and these topics are excluded from the secondary school curriculum I can certainly understand the boards position said Robert Decker Sayreville Junior High School vice principal and chairman of the Family Life Committee because when those topics came up I had the same reaction However in most school districts  whether or not they had had a sex education program before one was required  there was not much sustained opposition Many teachers and other personnel in local districts have been besieging organizations like the New Jersey Network on Family Life  a Rutgers based resource organization developed by Susan Wilson and Estelle Robinson  and Planned Parenthood for help with materials and speakers Mrs Wilson is a former vice president of the state Board of Education and head of its Family Life Curriculum Committee One particularly scarce resource according to educators is printed material for young children In Newark Planned Parenthood of Essex County staff members say that they cannot keep up with the demands of the high schools for help Newark has had a 10year agreement with Planned Parenthood for assistance in school programs As a result of the mandate we have been overwhelmed with requests from the schools to conduct sessions for teachers and supervisors said Tina Braswell education director of Planned Parenthood of Essex County In addition to speaking with teachers representatives of Planned Parenthood affiliates in the state  as well as chapters of New Jersey Right to Life  are often asked to address students on both sides of the abortion issue Parents too seem eager for information One group that has been teaching parents  the Bridgewater based Parent Connection  recently had to turn parents away from a course in East Windsor on Helping Your Child Adjust to Puberty And the states Congress of Parents and Teachers has been holding parent and teacher seminars teaching them how to talk to youngsters about sex Glenna W Gundell of Piscataway immediate past president of the state PTA said that to date the organization had trained parents and teachers in Middlesex Morris Union Bergen Hudson Atlantic and Cape May Counties and hoped to cover the state within the year Although there are still two bills in the Assembly and one in the State Senate seeking to rescind the mandate it is unlikely that any will reach the floor Alan J Karcher Democrat of Sayreville and Speaker of the Assembly said last June when opposition was still strong that after consulting with dozens of experts and interested parties in education I am satisfied that the Family Life curriculum in our schools is worth continuing I have decided not to post a bill that would thwart the Family Life education program he said So far there has been no monitoring by the state What administrators and teachers say is going on does not always give an accurate picture of whats being taught and how the curriculum is being implemented Dr Runden said For instance someone can say they have a fourthgrade program in Family Life education when all that theyre actually doing is showing a film during a onehour class once a year Thats going on over and over again  definitely  in many school systems Monitoring by the states Department of Education will take place by the end of the school year but only up to a point according to Dr Walter J McCarroll the departments assistant commissioner for county and regional services The monitoring process will establish whether or not a program exists he said We wont be issuing a report card as to whether its good bad or indifferent
WOMEN AND THE CHURCH,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/magazine/l-women-and-the-church-100591.html, I am not surprised to read of indifference among younger women as a result of the churchs inherent sexism This attitude of the church toward its female members is just another obstacle young Catholic women face along with the basic problem of simply reconciling modern life with traditional beliefs To be a 1980s woman  aggressive and selfpromoting  is clearly at odds with the revered Christian qualities of humility and selfdenial Issues now accepted as commonplace  indeed as necessary and desirable  such as birth control abortion divorce  are still grave moral dilemmas for Catholic women and a lot of us have chosen to ignore the teachings of the church in order to pursue our lives as we see fit Yet its hard painful to turn away from a faith that is perhaps as inextricably a part of one as family or ethnic ties It seems to me that the church offers little sympathy or comfort for the spiritual struggles of its younger female members KATHY PETERSEN CECALA Morristown NJ
"NOW, IN FIRST ENDORSEMENT, BACKS MONDALE",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/11/us/now-in-first-endorsement-backs-mondale.html,Former Vice President Walter F Mondale today won the endorsement of the National Organization for Women the nations largest feminist group It was the first Presidential endorsement in the groups 17year history Officials of the 250000member organization said the endorsement followed intense lobbying by supporters of Mr Mondale a Minnesota Democrat as well as those of three other Democrats seeking the Presidential nomination Senator John Glenn of Ohio Senator Alan Cranston of California and the Rev Jesse Jackson of Chicago the civil rights activist In its final endorsement the organizations 37member board voted 32 to 5 to endorse Mr Mondale Meanwhile in Mobile Ala the states largest black Democratic organization voted to endorse Mr Mondale for President and backed Mr Jackson as his running mate Some of Mr Jacksons supporters denounced the action Page 38 The results of the NOW vote were announced by Judy Goldsmith the groups president at a news conference after the board met Officials said Mr Cranston was the runnerup Mrs Goldsmith said This is absolutely not a rejection of Jesse Jacksons campaign or any other campaign We had several good candidates Reverend Jackson is one of those But she added we also felt it essential to make the strongest possible statement for the one candidate we felt could indeed do the best for women and defeat Ronald Reagan Reacting to the endorsement Betty Friedan a founder of NOW and its first president said This is enormously important because NOW is the flagship of the womens movement Mrs Friedan who endorsed Mr Mondale last month said This is a signal that women must mobilize to beat Reagan Donna Brazile a key aide to Mr Jackson said It is not a defeat We have been in the race for about two minutes She said she believed that although Mr Jackson had considerable private support he failed to get board votes because he was not deemed electable They believe that Mondale is electable she said We believe Jesses just as electable as Mondale The groups support added to a string of endorsements picked up in recent months by Mr Mondale He has been backed by the AFLCIO the National Education Assocation and a wide range of prominent Democratic politicians Mrs Goldsmiths announcement followed a closed meeting at the Washington Hilton Hotel of NOWs board most of whose members are elected regionally During the meeting reporters at times overheard arguments in favor of Mr Cranston and Mr Jackson A nonbinding vote earlier today by the board was 23 for Mr Mondale and 11 for Mr Cranston with three abstentions In recent days the tensions within the organization have intensified as supporters of Mr Jackson the only black Presidential candidate argued that an endorsement of Mr Mondale would provoke a major split between black and feminist interests Mr Jackson has promised to select a woman to run for Vice President on his ticket The groups first Presidential endorsement underscores polling data showing that women who are registered to vote are increasingly preferring Democrats over Republicans The pattern has become more pronounced during President Reagans incumbency and has stirred concern among Republicans Beyond this organization officials and aides to Mr Mondale say the organizations endorsement holds symbolic as well as practical value for a candidate seeking to take advantage of the gap between the sexes in political preferences Leaders say that as the largest feminist organization in the nation NOW has gained credibility and leverage among numerous women who are not necessarily members but adhere to its aims of economic and social equality The group has played a central role in spurring legislation and lobbying state legislatures and Congress in behalf of various measures including the proposed Federal equal rights amendment to the Constitution the right of women to seek abortions child care food programs for needy families vocational and educational training for women and measures to strengthen legislation against job and pay discrimination After a 10year fight for ratification the proposed equal rights amendment which Mr Reagan opposes remains stalled in Congress Mrs Goldsmith said before the board meeting that the group had decided to break a tradition that of staying out of partisan politics so it could seek the defeat of Mr Reagan If Ronald Reagan were not in the White House  if it were say Gerald Ford  we would not be endorsing a candidate said Mrs Goldsmith Our priority for 84 is to beat Reagan She said the Reagan Administration had damaged women through erosion of legislation that has protected us against discrimination in jobs and education Mrs Goldsmith also cited the Administrations budget cuts involving vocational training nutritional programs school lunches and other measures She said the organizations endorsement would mean a fullfledged volunteer effort of thousands perhaps tens of thousands of people working to defeat Mr Reagan if he runs for reelection We won our campaign stripes on the ERA battlefield she added In the process we have become very good organizers Nikki Heiderpriem a Washington lawyer who handles womens issues for Mr Mondale said after todays vote We think NOW support will be enormously important in defeating Ronald Reagan In making its choice the executive board took into account not only each candidates views on the proposed amendment abortion and other issues but also the status of women on the candidates staff and the candidates electability The electability argument was pressed hard by Mondale supporters Of Mr Mondales five deputy campaign managers two are women Maxine Isaacs his press secretary and Rebecca McGowan the candidates executive assistant
ROMAN CATHOLIC CONSCIOUSNESS-RAISING AGAINST NUCLEAR ARMS,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/16/nyregion/roman-catholic-consciousness-raising-against-nuclear-arms.html,In the rectory of St Pauls Church in East Harlem yesterday Sister Joan Hart took another step toward bringing the Roman Catholic bishops recent pastoral letter against nuclear arms to the attention of priests working in the field Sister Hart who has carried out similar missions in dozens of parishes in the archdiocese since late fall talked about the letter to nine priests from parishes in the area Then she asked what she could do as the head of the archdiocesan office of justice and peace to help them raise the issue with their parishioners The priests said the task was difficult in East Harlem because the agonies of daily life often made cosmic issues such as war and peace seem irrelevant Living in the Ruins The bomb has already gone off said the Rev Ray Byrne the host pastor Money has been drained away from the poor to build nuclear missiles Were living in the ruins The Rev John Mellitt of Our Lady Queen of Angels said the goal was to use the issue of nuclear war to tie into the needs of the poor Sister Hart like scores of church leaders across the country has joined in in a vigorous effort to educate Catholics on the contents of the 150 page letter which rejects nuclear war calls for a nuclear freeze and allows for nuclear deterrence only as a temporary measure along the road to disarmament Since the letter was approved in May church leaders say it has spurred more interest debate and discussion than any other statement issued by the bishops More than a million copies have been distributed and the churchs publishing house in Washington is turning out the fifth printing of the letter A Spanish translation is expected to be ready this week The bishops have named a follow up committee headed by Bishop George Fulcher of Columbus Ohio But the dioceses have largely been left free to develop their own programs to respond to local needs Officials say some areas have done more than others but all share a determination to keep the issue alive The Rev Brian McCollough who directs a national clearinghouse that monitors those activities for the bishops said the response to the document was even greater than church leaders had expected As an example he said a daylong gathering on the letter last Saturday in Peoria Ill morning drew 600 people An Unprecedented Impact The impact has been unprecedented Father McCollough said The interest is coming from all areas of the church It didnt get caught in one area such as the college community Were at the sixmonth point since the publication of the letter and things are still pretty intense Joseph Cardinal Bernardin of Chicago who was chairman of the bishops committee that wrote the document told a Fordham University audience last week that the efforts were off to a good start because of the initiative taken by individual dioceses He said the process of fully reaching parishes with a hierarchical statement usually took three years In his address at Fordham Cardinal Bernardin indicated how the bishops intended to capitalize on the unusual amount of attention stirred by the pastoral letter The Cardinal proposed a wider campaign that would expand the respect for life theme of the letter to other issues such as capital punishment and abortion As Catholics evaluate the letter church leaders say a variety of opinions have emerged on specific aspects of it The most debated points many church officials say are the call for a nuclear freeze and the skeptical view of deterrence as a morally justifiable strategy Misgivings in St Louis Generally weve had a good response said Sister Kathleen Crowley who is active on the issue in the St Louis Archdiocese where there has been considerable criticism Some of the people who are questioning the letter are willing I think to concede that the church is a place where questions such as this should be asked Enthusiasm for the letter has spawned activities and articles throughout the American church Many dioceses including New York have urged priests to emphasize the letter in homilies and special services during the present season of Advent when the theme of peace permeates the Christian celebration of the birth of Christ Terence Cardinal Cooke took the lead in New York last spring by reviewing the document with his priests Two months ago the justice and peace office held a training session for 200 clergymen and lay people in ways of applying the pastoral letter to their own parishes A Parley in New York By late November the archdiocese had distributed a packet containing assorted material suitable for use during Advent including outlines for homilies and suggestions on how the subject could become the focus of retreats and study groups New York was also the site of a major national conference for 300 Catholic educators on means of integrating the document into school material Some dioceses such as Chicago have been in the vanguard of efforts to provide curriculum guidelines A growing supply of pamphlets books tape recordings and films relating to the topic are being stocked by dioceses and parishes The Washington clearinghouse has compiled a 12page compendium of resources already available Hundreds of leaders are being sought to educate Catholic parishioners and stimulate dialogue over the pastoral letters conclusion In January a month in which many dioceses plan to underscore the issue of peace the church has scheduled a national training conference to supplement similar programs at the local level Other efforts are expected at the annual meeting of the National Catholic Educational Association in March which will spotlight the pastoral letter The current issue of the association magazine Momentum is completely given over to the subject An Active Diocese Some dioceses have long been active on the peace issue In Boston for example the archdiocese has formed Parish Education for Peace teams made up of lay people clergymen professors from the area and nuns A typical twohour visit to a parish by a Pep team would include a summary account of the letter and a discussion of the effects of the arms race on business the economy and the third world As the message of the letter filters down some leaders say it presents a formidable challenge I dont know of anything more difficult to get across to our people said Bishop William E McMannus of the South BendFort Wayne Diocese in Indiana The reason its so hard is that many people are very close to paranoid about the Soviet Union And I cant blame them A Common Problem A common problem church officials say is that some Catholics mistakenly believe that the pastoral letter calls for unilateral disarmament by the United States For that reason some material intended to help priests preach on the subject stresses the need to emphasize that the pastoral letter explicitly rejects that idea and calls for a negotiated disarmament by both the United States and the Soviet Union In Seattle where Archbishop Raymond Hunthausen has been an outspoken opponent of the arms race the topic of war and peace has been studied by the parishes for two years People in Seattle are extremely aware that Christian values bear on the nuclear issue said Don Hopps director of the archdiocesan justice and peace center Alluding to the large military industry in the area he continued The nuclear issue hits people in the pocketbook here The issues have been debated here for some time so the positions of lay people on the pastoral letter tend to be more polarized in Seattle than in many places Many Catholics say the airing of differences is healthy for the church People come down in their conclusions at all different spots said Christine Doby a member of the justice and peace office of the Archdiocese of Detroit a center of much activity on the issue But the Catholic Church is kind of used to that diversity Especially since the Second Vatican Council weve gotten very used to diversity Although sheer numbers create difficulties in some dioceses that has not been a problem for Bishop Michael H Kenny of of Juneau In his sprawling diocese in southeastern Alaska there are 5000 Catholics and 9 parishes The Bishop who personally rejects even limited nuclear deterrence has delivered talks to his priests and informed others through the diocesan newsletter The one complaint he has received he says is that the pastoral letter doesnt go far enough
STATE PANEL'S STUDY OF SHOREHAM ATOM PLANT ENDS IN WIDE DISAGREEMENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/19/nyregion/state-panel-s-study-of-shoreham-atom-plant-ends-in-wide-disagreement.html,Exerpts from report page B8 Members of Governor Cuomos commission on the Shoreham nuclear power plant agree that it was a mistake to build the reactor but after six months of hearings and deliberations there appears to be agreement on very little else The commissions 13 members now disagree even on what their chairman Dr John H Marburger 3d says they agreed to when they drafted their report to Mr Cuomo  such things as whether the Long Island Lighting Company the owner of the reactor is prepared to run it and whether it would pay to open the plant The 300page report formally released last Wednesday provided no recommendations to the Governor It gave no final assessment of the major issue whether the nearly completed reactor should be abandoned or put into service The Shoreham plant is now 1000 percent over budget and 10 years behind schedule and a dispute over whether the area around the plant could be evacuated in the event of a nuclear accident could prevent its opening The plants owner Lilco says such a plan is possible and it is working on its own evacuation plan The government of Suffolk County in which the plant is situated says such a plan is not feasible Dr Marburger said in a cover letter to the Governor that one of the groups findings was that no single policy can be derived unambiguously from the raw facts of the situation The views of individual panel members  in separate clarifications in the report  provided a product that Dr Marburger called rather inhomogeneous a condition he described as characteristic of the public attitute toward nuclear power These additional comments ranged from interpretations of economic trends to an essay on the role of nuclear power in a democracy The report was broken into two parts The first contained answers to nine questions asked by the Governor the second was 10 general conclusions that Dr Marburger and some members of the panel said represented a consensus However in addition to disagreements over whether the general conclusions actually expressed a majority view six members of the commission some favoring the plant and some opposed to it concluded that the answers to the Governors questions in the report were too weakly worded They appended to the report their own answers taking far stronger stands Some members disagreed strongly on what was described as the consensus view I feel betrayed by the way it came out one panel member Alfred E Kahn an economist and former chairman of the New York State Public Service Commission said in an interview Another member Dr Paul Alan Marks president of the Memorial SloanKettering Cancer Center said at a news conference at which the report was released I dont feel my views were given an opportunity I feel very very badly to be placed in this position At the same news conference yet another member Dr William J Ronan the former chairman of the Metropolitan Transportation Authority said I dont think the Governor is well served by something that alleges to be a general conclusion of a majority when it isnt Dr Marburger however said in an interview that a majority of those present at two key meetings at which the general conclusions were negotiated had agreed with all points In addition according to other members some members were present for only a few hours of the fullday meetings The makeup of the majority differed from conclusion to conclusion Dr Marburger said It was gone over word for word for word Marge Harrison a panel member and an antiShoreham activist said in an interview There was no indication that this kind of divisiveness was going to take place How ever she added some panel members who later objected were not present at the key meetings There was not as consistent participation by those who repudiated the report she said It indicates to me that they didnt realize how serious the situation was For example she said at one of the two critical meetings at which general conclusions were negotiated Mr Kahn was absent and Dr Ronan left midway before lunch  he said he had to pick someone up at the airport Mr Kahn has a different view There never was an opportunity to discover whether that really did represent the views of a consensus of the committee he said Mr Kahn who lives upstate said he had made plans to attend all the meetings but was not able to go to the one critical meeting because it had been rescheduled on short notice Most of the meetings were on Long Island We never had an opportunity to discuss these things he said and he attributed that in part to the people who opposed the plant from the outset evidently brought up on a very strong diet of Perry Mason who blanketed the discussion Issues Without Intersection Another member Karen Burstein the former chairman of the State Consumer Protection Board and now head of the State Civil Service Commission argued that achieving any kind of consensus was difficult given the differing viewpoints that members started with These are issues without intersection like abortion or the death penalty she said A group of people finds nuclear power as absolutely unacceptable another group finds it not only acceptable but preferable Those two groups cant talk to each other Following are the other members of the commission Dr David Axelrod State Health Commissioner Leon J Campo executive assistant for finance of the East Meadow LI public schools William J Dircks executive director for nuclear operations of the Federal Nuclear Regulatory Commission Dr Herbert J Kouts chairman of the department of nuclear energy of the Brookhaven National Laboratory David McLoughlin deputy associate director in charge of state and local programs for the Federal Emergency Management Agency David J Willmott publisher of The Suffolk Life weekly

"AT MIDPOINT IN HIS SENATE TERM, D'AMATO TAKES STOCK",https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/20/nyregion/at-midpoint-in-his-senate-term-d-amato-takes-stock.html,Senator Alfonse M DAmato Republican of New York has reached the midpoint of his first term He has gained a reputation for dealing with such local issues as transit housing and Federal grants to communities His chief committee assignments are Appropriations and Banking Housing and Urban Affairs The winner of a strenuous threeway race in 1980 Mr DAmato who ran on the Republican Conservative and Right to Life lines was formerly Presiding Supervisor of Hempstead LI During an interview recently at his office in Manhattan Mr DAmato discussed his first three years in the Senate He spoke of switching his vote to favor the production of nerve gas causing a tie broken this year by Vice President Bush and a measure he sponsored that cut off nonmilitary aid to Syria He also said he opposed the Reagan Administrations intervention in the case of Baby Jane Doe a Long Island infant with serious birth defects whose parents have ruled out corrective surgery Q This state has been hit hard by the Administrations domestic budget cuts How do you think you have succeeded in preventing the worst of those if indeed you have A I think Ive been a moderating influence Im a moderate conservative Im not going to be straitjacketed by some kind of ideological philosophy which puts me in one camp or the other I dont believe thats the role of a senator I have been supportive of the President more so than most Republicans in the Northeast But guaranteed student loans  there is a perfect example I fought against cutting off guaranteed student loans because I think it would be a disaster to working middleclass families But at the same token lets make sure people pay back those loans I think Correct the abuse dont kill the program I think its a matter of fine tuning Q You supported President Reagan in 1981 81 percent of the time on key votes and in 1982 72 percent of the time This is considerably higher support than say Senators Heinz or Specter from Pennsylvania or even Senator Goldwater Will you continue to moderate your support A No no I look at the issues Mass transportation means jobs If people cant get to work then were going to lose the whole region When it comes to a situation like that I will fight for those needs When I can give the President support I will attempt to do that I will give the benefit of the doubt I think that has paid dividends The fact we were able to get the Surface Action Group to come in here  the battleship Iowa and six other ships I believe to a certain extent has something to do with the relationship I have with the White House If I were never to give the benefit of the doubt to the Administration and always too my own perspective I would be a rather ineffective Senator Q You first voted against nerve gas and then changed your vote in favor of production in line with the Administrations position Was this an example of giving benefit of the doubt A The nervegas vote was a deeply painful matter to me because I dont like the idea of having to appropriate huge sums of money for that kind of instrument of death But we are in the real world If we had not had the nerve gas during World War II  had Churchill and FDR not said to Hitler If you use it we will use it  we would not have been able to keep the madman from doing it I think we obviously have to have them as long as the Soviets do The best position would be to call a conference and say Lets destroy them Q There have been instances  on such issues as Lebanon former Secretary Watt and the former administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency Mrs Burford where where you have been early and sharp in criticizing the Adminstration A And Ive almost always been right too Think about it I said they should have let Israel finish the job in Lebanon I criti cized Weinberger for his policies Its all borne me out right I said we should have cut off aid to Syria Im not supposed to know anything about the international scene but maybe sometimes a little downhome practicality is a little bit better than the dreaming of some of the planners in the State Department have engaged in For them to really think because we were going to give the Syrians 242 million in taxpayers money that we were going to get them to back off I couldnt believe it My point is you dont make strategic allies based on these kinds of things You dont bribe people The Syrians must have said Look at this the United States is fearful of us Q You did fairly poorly among Jewish voters in your 1980 election except perhaps on Long Island A No terrible there Q You seem to have made great amends You have spent a great deal of time going to the Jewish community to make clear who you are A No I have not made amends No I have never changed I think its a question of perception They know what I stand for They know I dont pussyfoot about By the way I think some of the things Israel has done have been magnificent Are they supposed to wait for the Iraqis to get the nuclear reactor going I supported them because they did the right thing in knocking it out Can you imagine having those crazy people over there with atomic weapons It is in our interest to understand who are our allies who our friends are and not work up some mythical alliances Q Do you agree with Reagan Administrations actions in the Baby Doe case A No I think Judge Wexler was right  someone who I appointed  the President appointed him but I recommended him The judge was right He looked at the file he was satisified I support Judge Wexlers position Q You were elected wtih the help of the Conservative and Right to Life Parties How comfortable are you voting on abortion and school prayer in the Senate A School prayer  Ive always been an advocate for that and still am Abortion  Im concerned for the right of the unborn I understand there are those freechoice people who have a different feeling I couldnt see myself using taxpayer dollars for elective abortion But Im not a champion for this cause I dont think Im elected just to carry the banner in that area I do think the government has the obligation in assisting youngsters in preventing unwanted pregnancies and giving them educational opportunities to deal with that Q The Republican Senate Campaign Committee took a poll at your request in July It showed that your popularity had risen and your negative ratings had fallen Can you tell us more about what it said A Moving in the right direction The ratio between the approval and disapproval has never been stronger its better than 4 to 1 It indicated that many of the doubts that people had have gone You talk about the Jewish community the business community People have a right to say Look here is a person from a local government background Will they be able to function in Washington Will they be able to meet the challenges whether it be banking or the international or the Middle East I think people including my colleagues in government in the Administration had a different perception prior to my coming there It has taken time rightfully so People have to know whether you are serious and conscientious And you also have to be able to take defeats too Q Your defeats A Some minor setbacks I didnt get my prison bill through yet where we said the Federal Government would reimburse the states for the illegal aliens we now incarcerate The drug epidemic is the major priority that we have failed to address In all the money I have fought to bring in for mass transportation  and Ive done it and done it successfully  then if people are afraid to use those systems in the offpeak hours that system is going to continue to deteriorate Q A recent Gallup poll shows the President is not in great shape in New York State He is in worse shape here than in Ohio You will be chairing his reelection campaign in New York What are the odds of winning New York A I think its going to be 5050 Its going to be the same question that the President put to the people when he ran Are you better off today than you were three years ago If the economy continues to improve the President can carry New York Recognize we have some deep seated unemployment problems that go beyound any President or any Adminsitration Q Have you changed much since you went to Washington A Oh yeah Maybe the feeling of more confidence You come into the banking areas securities areas whole new areas Look at the area of housing There is an area where I took on a different dimension In a testtube case you say youre better off not to have any rent controls But were not in a test tube So I come in to the Congress and say Well have vacancy decontrol and a furor develops So I look into it and the Mayor calls me and he says You ought to look into this thing You learn I made a mistake on that Q You have voted for every defense appropration bill Why A Those are prudent votes One of the things we did was to cut the defense increases on our subcommittee by 50 percent It was Cap Weinberger asking for 10 percent increases We reduced the expenditures to the levels that most of us campaigned on I campaigned for a real growth of 5 percent I have supported a real growth of 5 percent for modernization not only for strategic but for conventional weapons and for communications At the same time I have been absolutely outspoken and worked to correct the abuses in terms of purchasings and awarding of contracts Its money that could be used in other programs or to reduce the deficit which is absolutely critical And secondly it defeats the consensus that came about to say we need a stronger military Q The Senate was a strange place to you when you got there Is it easier to work there than you expected A I will say it was intimidating I chose not to make great big speeches because I didnt feel confident I wanted to try and become more comfortable in my surroundings I like the business of the Congress I dont like the social aspects of Washington as such I think theyre kind of plastic Im more at home with my people and whatnot in New York Q Is there too much decorum in the Senate A I dont think so We can get pretty feisty down there Youve heard me I think Im good for them I think I give them a different perspective  a little more fire when I get rolling

MRS. FERRARO FOR VICE PRESIDENT,https://www.nytimes.com/1983/12/23/us/mrs-ferraro-for-vice-president.html,Representative Geraldine A Ferraro is having the political time of her life Will the Democratic Presidential nominee choose the Queens Democrat as his running mate There is some speculation he might If the Democrats win back the Presidency would Mrs Ferraro end up in the Cabinet Possibly say some party leaders Will she run for the Democratic nomination in New York for the United States Senate in 1986 in an attempt to defeat Senator Alfonse M DAmato a Republican She is receiving some encouragement to try it Will the chairman of the Democratic National Committee select her as chairman of the partys platform committee for the 1984 convention a key position Theres some talk along that line and she has asked for the job Mrs Ferraro a member of Congress since 1978 has achieved considerable prominence on Capitol Hill resolutely working her way into the power structure But lately there has been a good deal of talk about what role she might play in national and Democratic politics beyond the halls of the House Pondering the Possibility Whenever the question of whether the Democrats should or would consider a woman for the Vice Presidential slot has come up recently Mrs Ferraro has been on just about every short list of possible candidates Flying to St Louis recently for a meeting called by Congressional Democrats to figure out what the partys general policies should be for next year Mrs Ferraro pondered the possibility If one of the candidates were to say I definitely need a woman now  she mused I would say How do you know If they were to tell me come July I need a woman to win I would consider it Yes I think theyre serious about a woman Vice President Mrs Ferraro says that a woman on the ticket would bring women to the polls and thus help the Democratic Party achieve victory They could make the difference she said The 48yearold Mrs Ferraro whose Italian heritage and image as an amiable moderate politician are thought to make her an added asset for the Democrats revels in the game of politics The visibility she has attained from the talk of a Vice Presidential candidacy has also added to the speculation that she might take on Senator DAmato I have promises from around the country for money if I run she said A Meeting With the Chairman Or says Ann F Lewis the political director of the Democratic National Committee Mrs Ferraro might instead end up as a Cabinet secretary if there is a Democratic White House after 1984 Geraldine has shown a combination of leadership advocacy and political smarts that make her a likely contender for a major role in a Democratic administration said Mrs Lewis As for a key role at the 1984 Democratic convention Mrs Ferraro met recently with the chairman of the Democratic National Committee Charles T Manatt to present her case that he should select her to head the partys platform committee In preparation she has read the minutes of the 1980 platform proceedings Mrs Ferraro often contrasted with other women in Congress for her pragmatism and ability to seem nonthreatening to her male counterparts arrived in the capital as an unknown political quantity A former prosecutor in the Queens District Attorneys office she won office in the traditionally Democratic but fairly conservative seat long held by James J Delaney The district includes Astoria Long Island City Jackson Heights and the more affluent Forest Hills Gardens where Mrs Ferraro lives with her husband John Zaccaro who is in real estate and their three children It was made famous by the television series All in the Family Archie Bunker lived there and voiced the prejudices of many of its voters Eighty four percent of the district is white many of them elderly first and second generation European immigrants Mrs Ferraro who uses Mrs with her maiden namelearned the politics of Capitol Hill quickly although some of her detractors say she skims issues rather than treating them substantively By 1980 she concluded that her positions on the Post Office and Civil Service Committee and the Public Works and Transportation Committee would not get her far within the hierarchy of the House So she ran for and won the job of Secretary of the Democratic Caucus and also became a member of the Policy and Steering Committee positions that have made her a member of the Democratic leadership Focus on Economic Issues Her access and influence in the House has been bolstered by her friendship with Speaker of the House Thomas P ONeill Jr Tip is a person I confide in a lot she said We have a personal relationship The men in my district are just like him With the Speakers help this year she relinquished the less important Post Office Committee and won a seat on the Budget Committee Legislatively Mrs Ferraro has concentrated most of her energies on economic issues that particularly affect women She is a force behind the Economic Equity Act a bipartisan package designed to address the economic problems of homemakers and women who work outside the home and worked with the Congressional Caucus for Womens Issues to draft two of the 12 bills in the act As a woman and a devout Roman Catholic she says she has found abortion to be the most difficult public issue she has encountered I dont believe in abortion she said but I cant impose my belief On foreign affairs and military policy she concedes that so far her knowledge is sparse Should she move further into national politics this shortcoming could hurt In the meantime she reports the attention she has attracted from the talk of a possible Vice Presidential candidacy has only one drawback the questions One reporter a woman asked me how people would react to having a bleached blonde as Vice President she said I said there would be about as much discussion of it as the fact that Ronald Reagan dyes his hair
